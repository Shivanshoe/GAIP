i'm playing my new favorite legend to play solo i can see why shiv loves bangalore so much because she can do it all when it comes to solo play she's so versatile and i'm pretty sure i only got these two games here because bangalore is so good at running around solo i'm not running around solo solo queueing with random teammates you know what i mean so thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh i was watching a youtube video everyone chill my control is better connected i'm good i've i've got nothing i've got nothing i was late

stuff in here i'm i'm not helping those spiders i'm not helping those spiders was easy to hit when he was like standing up i should have picked up a second second gun shouldn't i really the guy's

someone in here have some energy like one of these guys i think it's probably been ravaged but i don't think he was him i think it was this guy ah i had the energy gun but no energy what about you energy oh 31 humongous any syringes going 40 seconds i've got they're definitely still looting there there were so many people i'm gonna try my best to get you i think they're still there though i'll try this has been a fun game so far i mean two half thousand damage here i can't believe the pathfinder left if they can't just ruin oh they do be gambling one minute ago yeah they all just sat there aren't they oh come on i can't even get there in time now sorry man it's a full team that is rocked up with blue they rocked up with blue like probably not having for anyone i mean i've gotten it i've got 2 800 damage here get third parted yeah look at this guy with my red armor right on with 300 damage huh city it is but it's not the scraptor city that you know and and love and maybe hate at this point that's over there it is this scraps of city the second coming a lot of people jumped here we go big scraps are coming look at this got a shield bat for my white armor come up here mozam that's a permanent spawn that's always there i can't just i guess i'll keep the pk but what still trying to do is do the challenge where if i see you're gonna have to switch to it i'm not but that's just how it's working come on man don't let me put my shield back in this area hello hello pop that there just in case that other team gets involved [Music] i'll probably like this name's this gamer by the way and through here no i'm ceased [Music] i'm coming on come on nice i don't know how you died actually think about it go go grenade round two oh god oh please i'm burning i'm burning someone somehow y'all switchery hello bye let me reload oh so close just left reloading reloading reloading that was a lot of fun nice he's got the respawn back in team i didn't leave my inventory is not a mess which is great considering i haven't looted the entire game any shotgun bolts on anyone anyone got one of those shock okay i'll just take this i guess like that you like that bam bam you rub all this stuff do the soup jump up here because now i'm a movement demon no one knows but i am look at that that was actually so much fun it's refreshing i'll say every time it's refreshing to find somewhere other than uh scrap it or you know that was a great time oh okay i heard you avoiding camino me amigo i'm a pretty slow runner on bangalore though and that's one day from each team i'd assume i don't know can't really tell to be honest with you oh my god i suck oh my god i didn't realize she's gonna be that small why was she so small that was my thought that wasn't my fault love him love the fermis oh red push red push red push they were trying to single me out over this way i think yeah look at that with my teammates smoke is really working against me here oh here you go reloading found another i need heavy ammo hold up healing heavy ammo here like this where was the heavy i lost it i need it thanks uh i have 300 brands tonight i have 300 now if anyone if anyone is headed i have no bats giving my shields of recharge change the light ah okay i am gonna go craft i have zero crafting material which means i can craft nothing however or unknown tactic if you go up to the crafting mats you can actually get some crafting mats here you go look at this secret strategy any spoiler team what is that streamer no it's broken it's a good spot from here to be fair this is bad for us as well he's good enemy spotted i hear ya rings close and we've still got a minute i'm the only one without any movement especially to get high ground are we gonna sit up there we actually are we gonna push up i don't know someone's doing a triple take i hear yeah i was gonna craft another bat but whatever these guys will have bats and i was going to craft a level three because indeed fault like energy mag but i've got level two whatever i'd rather just fight we've been having a good time here let's go straight knock stars oh what come back god i'm bad oh what it's the last team oh my god have i ever played that well apart from that one like that one click that i missed an entire clip on that right on the hill i felt and and a little bit on that lifeline there let's be honest when i was trying to chase with the two times it wasn't moving across my screen fast enough but apart from those two times i felt like i was beaming i felt like i was i feel like i was on fire to be honest with you that was so much fun gg i had 14 kills that was a great time
