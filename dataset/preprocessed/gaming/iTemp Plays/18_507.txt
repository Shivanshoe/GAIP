hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing some of the new a limited time mode called locked and loaded where you spawn in with a level one evo shield a mozambique with a hog and a grey shotgun bolt already attached to it and the floor loot is blue and above apart from the one time scopes i believe so it's actually a lot of fun and it makes me wonder if they're going to make this a permanent change and there's a few reasons why so in warzone you're spawning with a pistol and two shields already on and it works great and i think it could work for apex as well because of the saturated loophole at the moment the disparity between the level 1 items and the level 3 or even the level four items in some cases is huge especially if they plan on introducing more level four items just like they did with the level four magazines this season so let me know what you guys think about this and if you would like to see it as a permanent change for apex because after playing it for around an hour i'm personally in favor of it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it be sure to subscribe if you're new to the channel as we are trying to reach 1 million subs in season 8 and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right the pits it is seems to be some people coming here uh this is mine my friends blue shield a little havoc don't even need the mozambique but i spawn with i'm here you know mass oh my word where on earth did the lifeline die she was literally climbing the car there we go switching shield cells which i definitely do need okay i'm kill leader kill leader with 285 damage that seems like a little bit of a scam i shall be taking the one to two times can you guys hear the scrap close g7 over here g7 is outdated okay i need to i need to show these guys i need to show him the 30 30 is the new message yeah yeah someone definitely was here you know i'm going back for that i don't know if this is worth it i don't know if this was a time saving exercise oh two separate teams facts going on did we get the path is the pathfinder dead or what i don't believe it i'm pretty sure the pathfinder managed to escape but he might just try and go for the banners afterwards he might just be sitting up top or something i'll let him we'll know we'll know if he was here because the old red ship will come in i love the fact that all the loot on the ground is like blue or a bird apart from like maids and uh i think the one times sights as well but everything you find like looting just seemed so worth it i've gone here i've got the shotgun for my mastery level three even one time he's back the right side to won the game all right five kill 6 30. 120 damage per kill a little bit more respectable they're in here anybody need energy i feel like that wasn't the team that we could hear firing [Applause] something else this gun is outrageous i'm not even healing in fact i'm going to commit the ulti for the speed boost does russian friends you better not be reviving there's no way he's reviving oh i fell oh nice job didn't get my kill credit but you know what i felt like i was a little bit i was a little bit high on the old damage per kill ratio oh sorry i was a little bit too low so it's probably it balances out it always bandles his eggs scorpio imagine if you could put a scorpion on the 30 30 repeater that's the stuff of dreams actually i'm not sure it is because i feel like this gun is definitely better on mouse and keyboard and there have been a lot of annoying players that have not left me alone when i'm getting shot by this gun so i take that back here i don't know what i need i have one med kit i saw a medkit somewhere he wasn't this guy love is getting toxic i appreciate it i'm down just to run off somewhere that what well they actually is going that way and your best skin for this though 30 reps that's why i'm missing shots here by the legendary skin i i feel like i'd be like i'll be here in all these shots midair and everything these guys won't stand a chance it's on the best high ground in the game i agree with choice i like my teammates here we are just on a we're a three-man wrecking machine right now that right portal i think he might be the peter patter you good i think he might be the peter patter of the gunshots in the distance yeah it must have been it's that sometimes when you're firing there's other stuff going on it sounds like um it sounds like footsteps think our octane gone he's not moving us nice and good that's the third team this is every team that's left apart from that team that we just fought to run away beforehand here okay oh that's flying octane's coming from behind the logo seems pretty good i've got a chance of surviving this i think i think he must have used his pad to get over here i mean if these guys run away this is only second zone if my lobo just sort of she chills and i can get to it storms better get the last two teams are firing each other she'll haven't on fire [Music] there's one squad left and if they're not waiting for us at the edge of the zone then i don't know what's going on i think we've actually got away with one here this is the like the first time i've picked one of these up since like 1996 and apparently it's gonna work out i mean if they if they didn't realize that we were still in a storm before they will definitely realize that we we're in the storm now you know if they don't rush us now then i don't know what's happening 45 we're not even worth going into the storm i think this is a polluted box now he's going in the storm but this is very conveniently placed jump pad did you revive them that quick stay there with me to his cell phone is it just him or is he i'm sorry but this might just be him oh my word what's a comeback what a comeback what a clutch from the lower two that was sensational she knew just to heal up a little bit she healed me she reminded me just as i was about to die 1700 damage i mean for an 11 minute game where i was down for like a minute straight that's not that bad i will take that what i finish as well the gamemode's fun the games are really quick but the gamemode is fun thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it i'll see you all the next one bye
