hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today the season five trailer dropped earlier on and we've got some huge news in the way of king's canyon being changed once more we had teasers on both maps leading up to this trailer but for some reason it didn't click in my brain that we'd actually see some big changes to king's canyon in season five now these changes are shown here right at the start of the trailer but quite clearly show mirage and pathfinder in school town and bombs are dropping nearby now these look like regular bangalore ultimate bombs many of which i'm sure have already hit scortain and everything's been fine but these bombs explode immediately but we will come back to this at the end of the trailer breakdown because we are shown a little bit of what scorpene is going to look like in season five now the main part of this trailer is definitely around the story of loba versus revenant if you're unaware the story so far is that revenant killed lobe's parents and she was orphaned 25 years later which is now present day she's grown up to be quite the thief and she's desperately seeking revenge on reverend i can definitely see there being some cool voice lines in game if you're bold enough to cue as a revenant and lobo combo now in terms of loper herself and her kit she looks incredibly fun to play my favorite characters on this game are always going to be the ones that have mobility that's why i play pathfinder all the time now loba has a teleport which i assume can't take you quite as far as a well-placed pathfinder grapple but it does look a lot quicker for those moments you're getting murdered in a gunfight she steals the loot from the robots which turn on her when she tries to assassinate revenant which we can assume is another part of her kit seeing as she's a thief of course and it would fit the character entirely she escapes but only to be greeted by all of the current legends including revenant in a destroyed school town possibly one of the most iconic apex legends points of interest has been destroyed now we can see the main skull of scorpane sunken down into the earth and there is a building down there as well i'm not sure if that's going to be accessible and there's going to be a way you can uh climb up or maybe there's some sort of event that would lift you up to the main part or it's just the remnants of school team being swallowed by the earth and it's more decorative now thinking back when i saw the season 4 trailer and seeing how my favorite drop on the game capital city was partially destroyed i was actually very nervous to drop there again i thought it wouldn't be quite as good as it was before but it turned out to be better in my opinion now this may have the same effect on score tone helping to separate the fights and be a little bit more controlled and we get to play this in one week today i'm incredibly excited to play lover i'm incredibly excited to drop at schooltown once more and i'm incredibly excited to play apex legends season five so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with some gameplay my friends all right it's the law to land a mirage voyage if you're on this side of the map it's just too fun at this place not to land it especially as you get blue from okay that's a bad idea anyway it was a good idea right until his teammate shot me yeah okay might need some assistance here friends too early or they would just shoot me but if they get closer teammate are you are you afk see ya oh he's playing get him mess him up my teammate's an apex predator so i've got it i've got every faith here there you go he was looking close the guy might have been able to heal up a little bit in that time uh i don't know if he knows that there's blue shield here i'm going to run and get it i feel like i did enough to uh to pick this up without feeling too bad oh okay little wingman action this is a good idea yeah it's so difficult to know with me whether the wingman is a good idea or not half the time it is half the time it december but i do need practice with the weapon so i might as well figure it out i mean how else am i going to get better with one of the best weapons on the game uh without picking it up there you go i don't feel bad at all about rushing over to the blue shield i could use that in pieces that was the only team that landed here i did see the blue extended limelight don't worry it appears that that was the only team that landed here with us which is strange usually this place is popping off at the start of the game all right if anyone sees another tonight please let me know i'm stacking a bunch of beautiful little attachments here that was an honor tonight that's very sad there'll be another one i'm sure go for the r99 wingman combination which is uh [Music] one of the most trying hard setups you can have but there you go guys i'll start the party get us off some purple armor [Music] standard sniper's top as usual oh this will do actually that's not too bad 175 bucks i mean i could do it a little bit more it's fine team i'll just stick with the problem here you go this is your lucky day yeah look at him turn around real fast on the radar level three i want to trade though and some bullets if you could get better than that no that's a stream online's good power is just as good in my opinion so even though i had a bunch of attachments here for the r99 amazon just change it over i think these are just in the survivings look at this is shameful i asked for something walk straight back typical high temperature on fashion eh oh it's an unloaded train friend get the heck on board oh what is that imagine a lantern on the train with 35 other people i mean obviously no one did this game and having your surprising beer sent now with level one shields a charge rifle what are these guns teammates bopped himself some goldie so man one of you did actually tell me that the back of the train had the best chance of getting the best loot uh and given this sample size of a massive zero i would assume that you guys are not lying maybe i should try and prioritize the back of the train this way i'll do more that's a gibraltar usually i wouldn't accept this but one he's already taken the better armor is run off and two there's a scrap going on i'd very much enjoy getting involved if i could you could say it's in the distance this particular scrap what is with all the snipers i think i've seen one of every single slide for this game over there facing out does that mean you're weak let's find out no you're full health okay enemy down where's your amigo here i go was it burning it's about 34 bursts that's okay it was burning his little robot feet bless him like michael scott on the grill it was just his little feet were melting in the lava which is a shame go by his position as well all right three guys 16 people left how have so many people died when no one landed the hot drops here no one landed at the train no one landed at mirage voyage which is usually popping off when when the uh the old drop ship comes from the west and there's still only 16 people left let's go and get our teammates some gold shields because he did but donate these ones to me or this one even oh i've got to take element pathfinder not interested in that range even without a sight on my prowler not interested that's nice still don't want the digital threat i'd honestly rather have these iron sights on the trailer than the essential threat it feels like the uh the aim system is removed that's what it generally feels like to me for some reason i don't know why i can never land any shots with a good short threat uh wingman all the prayer let's be fair both of these weapons the only good i'm decent with with the digi is the honor tonight and even then i'd rather have the bond times holographic all right fortunately teammate you've got a pathfinder in your team can i can i place this stand hey ralph much obtained i don't know if you can hear him bless him he's he's going wild this is where you need a little bit of discipline i could easily grapple into the vault location here but the issue with that is that one that's my escape route and two that means i'm way ahead of my teammate if something goes wrong i need my i need my ability to get out of here looking like we should be okay with only 10 people left we've done it and we get to experience the uh the teaser for ourselves because i've not done it myself helmet here level four it's like this corner of the ring like opens up or something isn't there like a card on the thanks floor or something level four you're gonna need one of these if you're bleeding out do you know what this is have they removed it i swear is that okay this is good this is a distraction nice right he's running for their lives shields if you've got the smallest hitbox of all time it's actually ridiculous right had a gold bag a gold shields and a gold knock down she must have already visited one of the bolts and she's coming over to this one too she had another vulcan friends i've got a vlog the other two are unlooted though where did you get these loot from if they're just in the storm where are you looting to get yourself gold i mean we are we've nearly completed eight out of eight gold pieces of equipment here we just need to go back for the bangalore i need heavy ammo uh and then we're sorted i will go and look at this octane though i don't think anyone looked at him did they remove the t's by the way because i'm i'm pretty sure i was looking in the right location there i have so many heater boards they've definitely increased the heater ball drop rate recently you can't move for shield batteries anymore which is good news for me a big shield battery fan there we go you see this is where i struggle with the with the wingman that's getting boxed you have to move out of there how is that last one not heating okay apparently every shot with the parallel but none with the wingman oh my word look at that a beautiful beautiful wingman headshot what was that like one out of 13 shots perhaps six or seven percent accuracy it's worth it for that one headshot though it does feel satisfying when you land that one headshot all right until this was left we need to be involved in the scrap if we can to secure a victory here and also if you find a gold bag that's beautiful because then we've got eight out of eight last two teams of fights over there let's get the heck involved how did that grapple land that's not even my fault kind of what's it like lagging mine a little bit now right he's hiding it's levitating we killed the last member good work team only one others fine old music just because i've got a mango there's a team here pushing us people i mean the the power is too good the power is way too good [Music] when you get a good teammate like that when they're in like apex they were they're like a predator season one and season two i believe i've ranked uh i thought i stole a lot of kills there but to be honest i felt like she was letting me get the kills maybe she wasn't shooting them but i felt like i was i was able to lead the team and she gave me some good loots and were able to come out on top of it on top of the game right there 13-minute victory shout out to the boys oh boy i would hold you good game thank you for watching um yeah wingman at close range i'm all right wingman at medium range it's not worth me using honestly i'm gonna stick with my easy mode scout i can't you can't mess with this gate it's impossible thank you for watching i do appreciate and i'll see you all in the next one
