hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some apex legends of course and today we got the first trailer for some new apex legends content in a while it's for a collection event called genesis now with the collection events we can always expect a limited time cosmetics for many different legends and weapons a new heirloom added to the game some cool map changes and also we'll usually get some meta changes as well in the form of some patch notes first things first the heirloom it is indeed for revenant and i have to say it's probably the coolest heirloom in the game it's a scythe it fits his character so well and the animations look incredible i'm looking forward to chopping up the last player in the lobby with this here scythe if you guys have some heirloom shots saved up or maybe you can get lucky with the loot packs during the event a revenant site is looking like a solid choice for your heirloom collection next up we have some map changes the original kings canyon also the original world's edge are back and you forget just how different these maps are since launch the obvious places to return are school time for kings canyon and also scraptol city is no longer cut in half so you have construction building uh for world's edge and i was always landing there but then you remember about all the other map changes between these two maps and all the areas that will be returning what points of interest are you guys looking forward to revisiting the most for me it's a mix-up between school town construction bridges and probably cascades some of my favorite drops in the game along with the heirloom we also get our hands on other cosmetics we can see skins for bangalore gibby crypto watson loba horizon and also revenant of course in this trailer so you pick up some cool exclusive skins along the way as well and also school town is coming in as a arena's map so we'll get to play even after this collection event has concluded this is all coming on tuesday the 29th of june i'm really excited for it be sure to subscribe to the channel here for some genesis content on the day of release i've got some gameplay i think we are free to lose i'm gonna land at this one so survey kemp is a weird one i don't even know how i remember the name of this place i don't know why it sticks with me but i feel like it's not the best place to land but it's a good i mean i'm not taking a 30 30. it's a good place to like come after you've looted once you've got a bit of stuff because there's not actually that many loot drops here because they've got the weapons on the wall you know like you could pick you can pick your guns but chances are you're not going to end up with too much ammo i have 40 light rains like i can have a r301 but not the ammunition to go with it if we looted the big ice piling of doom here first and then went over i think would have been they'll be better off but we're fine you know i've been getting comments recently about my field of view and i do i am sort of zoomed in a little bit where is it 90. maybe you guys were right i think that recess and i didn't even realize it's the capital of the scrap so you would expect people to be over there but apparently there are people behind us goodness knows where these people landed refinery perhaps is this way still less than one minute i popped a mirage ultimate oh no recharging shield uno mass unless these octane has uh it's alphas did he die there's no way he caught this far right oh there we go it's gold as well 200 energy heads up the ring's moving i mean i've got level three bolt but i suck with the peacekeeper uh sorry team i pinged the level three bolt but i've absolutely scammed you there shotgun bolt here yep they've seen those shotgun bombs as well all right perfect half the squads are left this is what happens when you don't land a scrap at all but it's okay you can still rack up a lot of damage from this point onwards circle's fairly fairly open it's not going to force people into its weird spots and there are still people launching grenades at scrap itself it never lets you down oh my word it's all kicking off there might still be two teams here i don't think anyone died or got knocked and they were fine before we got here so it might might pay to be a little bit patient still think there are two teams minimum and we might get furthered as well just because of where we are it's one of my favorite things about playing path on world's edge there's all windows you can sit in i never expect it mighty you don't get any amazes through through here i'm not even gonna cook top now you got that right yeah you got that i missed way too much my apologies he's got a spitfire careful reloading one sec using my phoenix kit contact oh there's a lifeline now i got your teammate nevermind that's running to you exciting today let's make sure they weren't aiming at me because you can die in like three bullets from that thing it's an absolute beamer the biggest beamer on the game a rampant turret behind a rampage only shield seconds left on the clock well scrapped it will close proud you can always rely on a bit of a fight only like five people died and i've come up with basically a thousand damage uh it's my main gun i don't have loads if i find any more i mean this is this is unloaded i actually gonna find some more energy i could switch some for some light there you go just because you find light everywhere all right we need to get involved tonight still needs light and there's none out there pointless at this range come towards me my friend they just got bridge i don't even have to heal here she saw me coming just dodging all my bullets come on back thank you gold helmets i'm not sure what you're saying i'm here to help though we're getting sniped in the back no one has any bats i mean we did kill someone else i've looted the people down low i can't see this guy didn't we kill someone this no i just need some bats contact sorry my cat she likes to bite wise why are you challenging them these guys have way too much faith in the watson generator it's like one shield per second please have some bats for me please you know bats i'll take it okay i mean there are two squads left i'm 400 pink uh i am 30 pink so we even out around 200 each you know if you take the average and 200 ping is playable i think we're fine i'm not sure what he's just said well do you know he's getting scanned that's you target spotted he's ready we could be getting baited all right welcome back to him so i've absolutely joined that i don't think i deserve two of those kills but it's okay one squad left copy that amigo this might be a war of attrition so i don't waste my batteries we go further west here we get like natural not high ground on them but we they can't really hate which is much this could be the ramp from earlier they just ran off best thing to do against the ramp is just get different angles and i think it's one guy i see you that was the guy that locked us down earlier on in the bridge you want to go huh that's a good game my teammates are real good it was a pretty slow start to survey camp but that just shows that you don't really need to to land a full story to get a good amount of action in the game uh that lobby kind of stayed live a good amount of time i mean 2400 damage the teammates popped off as well everyone revived each other at one point during the game it's a fun game i enjoyed that one
