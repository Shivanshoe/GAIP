all right my friends scrap hook scrap book it's skyhook skyhook it is joining me here Fabio join me there's no gun please don't take piece thank you very much purple shields korsak's joined us to Mozambique on fleek yeah you guys need shields Lyman needs weapon look I've got enough I'll throw one triple take time to no damn my load oh it's looking pretty good any scraps going we are a scrapbook she would expect on it's been going on I don't agree shoots that guy and then get us pinched enjoys attention what are you doing and send a bear okay decorative gargoyle person independent variable friend play some Dame or are they even knowing I'll be letting don't worry team I got him I think my effect plays the octane right with the charge - I think it is alright full team game sounds like there's a scrap in the distance but we're all pretty weak here it'd be foolish of me to rush straight over there instead of looting do you know what I'm gonna use these because I don't like Phoenix kits I don't like them to take too long I only like them if I've got like gaunt shields or whatever oh it's coming over anyway there's this blue shield download and I've got myself tool to make Saturn a gimme back the thermite grenades himself - autumn accelerants some reason my least favorite item immune tie game shield that's good let's go to the scrap friends ruled he left look at this he's perfect timing that's how he's ended they say look to the side look one this way and one a little bit further away more to the right thank you and he did end Oh max if possible that's because it's my only spray weapon oh thanks friends great guy and then my spray weapon it's actually pretty good at close range - I looked a little bit suspicious look at this guy you mess him up dry and vizac nice job take these spider nice really sorry a 999 and a g7 scale if I could choose a gun loadout in the current state of the game either tree was a 999 and a g7 scale but I don't know overuse them well I'm playing public matches I don't like to use the g7 too much I could do that because I use it all the time in ranks so I'm gonna try and mix with a little bit I know the are 301 isn't really mixing it up but I've got listen I've got a triple take I could easily switch this VR 99 it's tempting still mmm-hmm you just have to extend the light makes - it's too tempting I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do much I come out the two times and the trouble sake leave your opinions in the comments because I usually don't like sights on the chill tank I love the iron sights on the Sun I mean they're beautiful some of the best iron sights in the game but sometimes the two times magnification is a little bit helpful especially cause it is a sniper at the end of the day alright four kills 23 people if that's not that bad actually recently there's been about 15 people left at this point so we've got a good chance I find enough few more people here especially on the the old skyhook or rotations Bobby also wants to get the gold shield that's gonna be in here it's gonna be a gold shield Mastiff a crabber and a golf knockdown shield for items in here then one either are those don't worry about it well charger I don't mean a few mean if this was like you know season zero one or two and I didn't get a gold back but doesn't matter nowadays I've got one of the best items for Pathfinder which is the gold helmet reduces the cooldown of these both of these abilities this is the old crap owner and the ultimate of all there's the best ability on the game car complain too much that's a that's a lifeline package and this is good first because we can get high ground here and just fire down on that something looks like some is already doing it if you can sneak up to teammate you spooks me breathin even Oh hop top too soon this is messy I messed up oh it's not the way I was facing I knees grapple me on an expressway anyways this man Jason Bourne he's grabbed me out the sky then punching me there I'll tell you better be covering us here because they can get up with my zip line please be covering this good ask a token of Russia's what an absolute graveyard look at that after service died here what are the hands of this man machine as I said I don't like them that much and I need you to get in the academia friend oh that's you who I thought that was coming a weird angle there in an ideal world willed I've only got 7 here already given you my Phoenix kick this might be a separate team I don't know no ideal world we poke these guys and then we rotate early before they get a chance to heal but I don't think that's worked out annoyingly wife no he got chills I've damaged modes 18 rotate honestly that the lifeline and the pathway to have to hear okay they damaged me a little bit I should be okay though it's a rotate early we think we can easily put these guys on and I really want that gold shield call stick is really far away I think you may be hearing up though this is the problem with long-range weapons especially snipers you just keep poking them and nothing really happens [Music] ah that's not I thought that was my caustic ID well I didn't even know anyone was up here to begin we please get up here your vigilance clear mess them up friend I'm pretty much dead I'm pretty much a goner and around octane I thought they were closer I didn't realize he was gonna be three people there and then when I saw the course deke I actually got a respawn here I watching this back is so sad because if one of three different things was slightly different I wind this couldn't fight I'd jump off the ledge regroup with the team and then I could just kill the bracket back up top and try and kill them however three things happened first of all I did 187 damage to the Pathfinder so I needed one shot in the gunfight south when I ducked to join a voice on fire I ended up from some footage into the lifelines knockdown shield real sad what can you do if I picked up that hi 99 instead of petrova take that I was talking about this gunfire probably want to be even been very close at all and if I just used one more shield cell if if I had like a shield battery to have used beforehand I wasn't expecting people to be upon this position I didn't realize that it already rotated around if I was full health I pretty get one last bullet off then jump off the edge and try to regroup with the team but it's okay because my teammates bunched up and they revived me and we carried on that's not good landed air Fabio get out of there Fabio he's running he's got his dweeb machine and I think he's you'll be fine that's a good thing about alkylation I feel like I should play more often that he's an L star on respawn all right we can still easily win this game if I've got an L star maybe we kill one person there's someone the opposite building there's two more people coming out the cave that's probably why he took the longer anything about it placing cast retains with us as well as a gas trap that's mine I think the caustic be okay because they're not gonna push him in he's in his cause - gasps thank you vent to see if they see one in fact it's okay cuz he's down one he's killed one I'll be able to get the body shield off him so I gives it that body shield whatever I'm going in I'm pretty sure he's killed someone up here I'll just take whatever body shot this fan has a bus friendly cross the tracks are they okay no they won't so job I didn't run into them in Donna focus too much on leaves me because it's just one squad I've gone into flip name alright this is different - oh my god look how much health I knew use the Phoenix key on that would have been I would have had some angry comments they I've got I've got to really close cause weapons here so wherever these last squad is I'm gonna need to get up in their face which is interesting because that is completely different to how I had to play earlier on with the r31 and the jaw take sniffing galibi closer Geddy say yeah I'm untouchable well I sounded like he was right behind me look at my health getting that teammate I've been trying to respawn I survived 18 shots in that I can reload it isn't the last type there's one more guy after these dissing finishes are just incredibly satisfying no we shouldn't there's one guy left rushing just getting there oh good grapes I was a little bit scary [Music] if I knew he had a massive shotgun and dinar 99 I'm Maya thought twice about that but fortunately the octane got him pretty weak that was a pin devastating if we lost it there 2400 damage nine kills should have been 10 double digits if I get one more on that right I'm just gonna give that to myself whatever I think someone got revived from the on the big pile on to my teammates got the the old respawn after I think it was just a misunderstanding I thought they were close and they were and I do realize that all three of them were gonna rush up to me I'd even know they got past us I thought that was still hidden up I didn't realize that that I thought I was in a good position there I've gotta rush bow of three of them unfortunate but the respawn came in had a lot of bet patience on that one we came back lstart some people and it's a victory that is a hard-fought victory shout out the team thank you for watching it doesn't always go to plan you know sometimes rate those plays and you're in a great position and you'll snipe them down at people and they can't do anything other times you get bro spoil three of them um and you go down that's that's life but I'll come back up I'm just chained now thanks for watching till the next
