hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some revenant because i realized that revenant is about to have his first birthday at least in the apex games he looks a little bit older than one but uh it got me thinking about his release and how cool they made it with the four storyline unfortunately it was leaked that revenant was going to be the new legend back then i wish that it was kept under wraps and everyone was just shocked but it was leaked and then i thought about how he's changed since his release he's had a series of buffs to every part of his kit and it's never really been meta in public lobbies i know for a while every team in you know the higher ranks and in competitive play was rev pushing but i don't really get involved in that too much he had low profile he only had one stack of his ability and his ultimate used to be less range and also it would teleport you back with one health and now it's 50. so he's had four separate buffs and i still don't see him too often in these public games but it's their job problem with balancing how do you make him more fun to play in pubs without annoying the top players or in pred lobbies and even the algs because i'm honestly not sure not every legend has to be able to dominate a lobby though he definitely has a place and he is a useful addition to any team especially when you pair him with a legend like pathfinder or octane i hope you guys enjoy the revenant gameplay if you're new to the channel be sure to subscribe ready for some season eight content on tuesday and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends wow there's a lot of people if i find one more p20 20 today from my first gun that's the only gun i've got i don't have a gun literally don't even know him i don't
