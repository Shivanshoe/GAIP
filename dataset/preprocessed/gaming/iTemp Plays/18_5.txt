hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and those are some words that i have not said uh for the last like 10 days i spent a week on holiday it was great and it's why there have been fewer videos of the last week it's pretty difficult to get seven days ahead so i just kind of split the videos up over a few days but today we are back and my god i am rusty and apex but i'm trying my best also we are playing lifeline because i came back i realized that lifeline was buffed just before i left so i was excited to play that you know the new lifeline and after a few games i forgot why i was playing lifeline because when i was playing her it didn't feel like a buff at all now just to quickly go over the buff so so they moved the revive cancel option from lifeline to the player that is getting revived that's great but that's not a buff you know that's a quality of life update the doc hill drone has an increased healing pool from 150 to infinite which still lasts 20 seconds and doubled the healing radius i mean that's interesting you know it's kind of cool and the care package has been reduced from five minutes to three and a half minutes the weapon attachment panel now comes with a shield battery instead of two shield cells and it's no blue beam until it's dropped now this might be the single most underwhelming buff of all time because we were crying out for a lifelong buff we needed something special and this is what we got i don't know i'm not i'm not feeling this one that's all i'm gonna say i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and thank you for being patient over the last week with the infrequent uploads but we are back now and i'll see you all in five and a half

replicator uh gold bag for you thank you very nice person look at him go thank you i wonder who okay so who's that really better on you know uh it's yeah it's me at this point it's me uh i don't know 800. i think there's multiple reasons why it would be better on me wait did they did you loot my pack my back or do they rob it what they rub all this stuff level three oh no you got the gold armor oh what i can see what's going on here i've got 32 off red so don't worry about it oh whoa whoa whoa yeah here we go here we go here we go the heck is going on over here oh there's a guy on me there's a lot of people there's all the guys oh okay he's been on you he had a pk i don't know why you can do it with me that's crazy be gay is he on here is he he dropped down i got him one shot recharging my evil shield i'm stuck i actually can't move bomb but i don't know if you can even provide me glitching two palm trees get your i can't i can't a stupid head over here where's the go back oh no some idiot took it flat line i'm having for you fine people there i was going here too oh i almost threw that package i'll go heavy don't worry i got a hundred guy here he got red just multiple yep i'm going to throw this down for cover oh i got no heavy i have a hundred nooks any mike oh my they call me zero dronage yeah i have a flat line with 40 spare and zero heavy mag so if this isn't a heavy mag i'm i'm never playing lifeline again actually never okay i've got a blue one i'll take it um i should be fine i four syringes i've gone back remember one second yeah it hasn't yet no it might just go in the zone a little bit and then i'll cut it out and be like oh see it helped just do that for me okay oh i made it out that's weird that's crazy i don't know what happened let's put you back in there don't worry i have 32 spare heavy yeah i just got my gun i couldn't find any everybody just has light i don't know why um i guess that makes sense yeah but so is the rampage yeah you know a lot of people do like their own page i was replicated dropped it was a campaign i literally set her up again what just now i i don't know huh oh where are the people here is trident uh he's kung fu kicking trying to punch slide i think he's getting in the trident this guy's a maniac just let you know it's him driving so it's probably going to be better than you're used to ah yeah i wouldn't doubt that at all though he has crashed twice already clean he crashed no wait okay please please please yes does that glitchy when he when he does that bam quick i think he's got hummus nice do not hate by playing with a newcastle if he ults you even if he's on your team it sort of knocks you back a little bit like it stunts you johnny yeah it deserves weird apex champions that last fight i was i was leaning back in my chair and i missed an entire r9 mag and i don't regret yeah i think my eyes are closed the whole fight nice oh phenomenal
