hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be running the double flatline setup now usually running setups of the same gun leaves you vulnerable to a certain range but the flatline is probably the most well-rounded gun in the game you could maybe argue that r301 is or maybe even the vault for that title but it's probably between those three weapons and when you have a lobo on your team ammo is absolutely no problem also i uploaded another call of duty video on my other channel if you guys would like to see some more content from me i was roaming the streets of the new warzone map with an ak-74u there's a link in the description if you're interested so thanks for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends it's kind of deep oh i'm gonna i'm gonna grind cold water tonight for like five hours oh okay before the uh before the updates what guns you're going for um i'm doing the rpd right now okay rpd is kind of nice it is good oh that's gonna be dead lean you're right that's gonna be crazy i had i had four bullets in my re and i hit all four bullets on him she just wanted me to waste all my bullets i get it i thought you were in trouble if he's throwing hands man and i guess i was pretty scared another team i've literally killed two teams there's another one i'm uh you're on your own buddy i'm struggling with the loot here i need to get ammo first good luck oh my god don't think for you i think you go away okay i dropped it dropped here i'm here oh that's that's more than one i'm sorry my badge you should be he should be need train train train give me a second best shoot have you seen the gibby and where he is oh he's almost there oh my mates have you seen where they are where is the second phoenix now you want it i i yeah maybe i cannot believe what i'm seeing dude it's just not stopping have you seen where they are like i can't get over it i think they're over by epicenter no yeah on the big hill and i can just see it give your arm shield okay what do you do there's a beautiful job what's going on over there any columns come i didn't think he was going to be looking straight up at me you know so i got bamboozled all right yeah i agree i i want to kill this uh oh we're gonna go again yeah he's right here i see him he's gonna get the ultimate bag it's the full team okay no problem right there oh you do think uh right in front of me therefore he is a pc player with the 84 times sight i really can't contest at this range no worries i'm not really pushing there's another team where where gibby was and they're getting shot on the back okay oh behind us okay i have a rope i just cracked i just crashed i'm just going over there okay i'm doing it um oh like whatever i got one what's happening now oh no oh no it's not gonna this is not good which way they're coming from i don't know i'll mark it by looking at it right there you can see okay i need to back i gotta slow here i gotta flow here they're all coming for us okay now they found each other okay do some shopping i spent two bats it sounds like salvation over here or something hello don't leave my stuff i see disappear i see it disappearing almost broken [Music] oh my god this i tell you what i love capital city kind of crazy i love candice city i have three bats if you need any um i have zero here you got i'll drop you on level one drop two med kits too bye thank you uh normal bats in there level three extended light um struggling on the old extended heavies though mama's got a brand new bag i'm going to do a flat line um i have zero cells i need to find some sales i have four was there none in that i just found some okay oh you probably use it for the stuff right i'm just blind yeah there's 24 in here i'm gonna get an extra eight all right who's next i think i hear shots hold on yeah they're fine this way uh west and they're gonna have to move okay maybe like there over that hill they may not even come this way no they're here they're here yeah i see them one guy so far i see one uh coming down the hill behind him they're chasing this guy i don't know we may need to turn around yeah we might i'm turning around i'm turning around we'll meet my train or something if they gatekeepers we're just dead you've been switching too much right because you suck purple there's no way yeah i've swapped like 10 times people probably lose their mind in my videos but i i genuinely do not care if you don't have a if you don't have a shield bass and the game is like i was just named there's no chance you can keep the same shield yeah i'd much rather just swat like if we're in the middle of a fight and i have red i'd rather just swap to purple than take my time to heal oh yeah yeah everybody's just dead yeah or your team's dead too depending on how the fight's going yep did they just die in the storm or what i'm not gonna sit here i don't know why are these dudes fighting you know sad though actually big value huge value might be one of the best lowers in the game uh i'm not gonna contest that i know you should there was a vault on the way by the way on the bridge i didn't loot it um so i found it oh okay this is a long time ago what are you what are you doing on that i just thought about it and it made me angry that was like an hour ago anger is permanent driving position one minute oh yeah what about all those times you told me there were one shot let me wear it one shot or like that path uh i didn't say he was one shot i said he only did that i did wait which one in training i i can't even remember i said he was one shot and he wasn't that's the story i have two why do i feel like i need to carry like eight chill bats but only two med kits ah i mean because your shield goes first so yeah as long as you manage it not to get health hit that's like half this game you know hey up getting angry mate where is everyone re45 we're already in the ring well relax this is more damaging even needed to me that's actually a uh big lie what is going on here so there's three of the teams right and there's seven of the people yeah no one's making a peep so it could be so long two four teams or it could be two two three literally or we just swear this is what happens when i follow you [Music] i should have seen this coming scrap of the century so sad they're all going to be dead by the time you get here oh please done i really hope i don't die let's see i'm stuck down here for 25 seconds come on man that dude just wasn't aware i'm just not involved mate it's not there is there two teams there um they're pretty much dead i have to pop them out though he's up top we're the teams trying to third point here could just be one guy climbing up wait where'd he go i'm gonna come over to you dude there's no way we just went on the road like i'm gonna die i was just in mid-air i'm i think it's a solo that oh i see him he's oh he's right on my loss please he's loving nades broken okay you see that kill camera alignment it's right by the century oh man what a last kill that was my depression is just um you did you did indeed because somebody wants to go run around i had 10 kills and like 2 000 damage and there was like 15 people left you know it could have been a big game and then gnome was there never is never his memories
