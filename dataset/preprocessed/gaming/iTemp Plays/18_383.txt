hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and a few weeks ago i made a video about the re45 for jackson l who commented many times requesting such a video and i got a few comments on that video of saying that it was a bit of a scam because i used the hemlock for most of the game and i watched it back and i did sort of agree so we are back with the re45 once again i have the eva 8 as its companion in the back pocket and we had a great game with a few one clips in there as well before we get into today's video though a word from our sponsors lenovo and microsoft thanks once more to lenovo and microsoft for sponsoring today's video i hope you guys enjoy it thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends are you landing up top uh i was going european i trusted you what's up sucked me i never get anything yeah it's very bad i've got a p20 i should land up top i have a flawless guy's gotta have it i'm dead wait how do i know he's just in there recharging shields he's like that's why i'm here thank you around he got hit by p20 but 18 damage i'm not surprised he was sprinting off yeah he was terrified he wanted none of that this guy down over here might have loot for you broken going around the corner they faced just in here he's still got purple but he's sprinting into the sunset i'll go back and first in your kill then your teammate oh me now let's see what they left us using a phoenix kid i missed some shots i just tanked everything on the rope for you i was like the right shield guy you know but i didn't have a right shield so i just i was in the face yeah shield yes it's a classic tactic they use in the military i still think i should send out an entire car over here up the rope this is a separate team up the rope oh no on me yeah i'm on another team i'm going to help you up oh nice no he left i was gonna i went to the first damage from the first guy and then i was going to finish for the come on man i just left using the phoenix kid rv45 as slaps has it has moments what was a slapping oh this is a mom third party and a team that's about the third party okay huge reloading broke one of them i almost broke the other yeah yeah all the comments keep you coming uh they are running for me damn he's good-looking i'm going right i'm now stationary someone's hit i'm not firing my weapon i missed a lot of shots okay and then awkward position how's that not a stick in 2021 going around someone else behind me on me wanna he doesn't have an arm section now i already used it one of these guys has gold this other thing that is from the back the healing here i think 150 150 on one of them my phone a different team i don't know i don't think so i'm going with this bangalore back here uh bloodhounds one hp and then there's another one i think oh my god what is happening we just destroyed these guys i don't even understand how many teams are here right now that's unreal i've used about eight different armors yeah i think i've made 18 reds oh yeah let's check it over there twenty-two sky that was a great game noise that was a good one yeah i'll put any charge shots but i don't ever let maybe jump that's right i don't know i don't understand what like what the thought process is the reason i thought process oh oh well you're dead i have nothing [Music] mate i did arbor switch and i did the sprint thing on the box by accident so i started sprinting off the edge he's over here there's one right here he's holds it he was cracked wait was he ready no it's not cracked you lied while he popped a shield i don't know off the edge man i like see ya thank you do you hear something funny ah so i'm doing a time for two let's play right and i looked at janks's old one to see like he's structuring the episodes and i didn't realize how structured it was in time for it's like it's very obvious when you should stop so for the same amount of gameplay i know we're in a scrap but i'm gonna keep going for the same amount of gameplay i um he did his episode in 16 minutes and i did mine at 35 right cracked beyond one shot right should be cracked by the team by the way no i'm fine i'm in the air mate i'm just gonna fly off goodbye thank you oh my god thank you i was like [ __ ] over and off to these beans i'll show you just coming swinging and i looked back at you and i was like i'm coming in swinging thank you oh my god i tried like i i tried punching and he was one hp like when you punched him he's one hp right he's freaked yeah i tried punching him but the bangler was crawling on the floor and i just locked onto her like like a heat-seeking missile just uppercutted her right on the face while she was like does that at least because i was gonna originally looked at um there's some bins there i looked at them and then i looked back and i looked at the bins again i was like oh i needed that thank you that's tragic sometimes like these new settings kick in like really hard and then i just miss everything you miss a few stop panicking panicking skywalker that's how they call you panicking okay i kind of like that one that's actually kind of cool that one's like so bad it's good that one's a retro one i've been using that long for a long time i have a i have a turbocharged devo with 32 bullets and that's it but i really don't want to drop it because i landed on it energy ammo here yes oh you see just complain oh my god that was like like 100 energy really yeah almost like 80. oh i don't have red armor and i don't have a crater valk's really weak if he's cracked if he fell he'd be altered it's not going storyline i'll let you know how it goes i'm here i'm watching i'm a part of it definitely not the main character but i'm here you you were involved you were support yeah i was an extra yes you're in the background you just relax for a minute let me loot me no i'm on the rampage see that all right reloading she's cracked there's on the team this way oh they're tough they're tough okay i'm out with you up there there's no way i know i'm good time so i'm not too concerned i got a turbocharged device i'd really like to use it you want me to just eat some bullets on the way up i can do it no no no we'll definitely you'll definitely uh get get sprayed uh i mean we could go all the way around oh wait blah blah blah blah oh another team cracked a lifeline there whilst we've got four shields yeah we're gonna watch it i'm gonna go i'm gonna do this okay i'm gonna go up the road this way what else is white okay i'll come back and come back because the other guy's gonna jump on you yeah sorry i nah it's not your fault i play i made a dumb play lifeline's trying to thirst oh she's pushing this right here another team yeah the other team shooting him now why are you looking at me for stressful about this at all whole minute left on the rings right there man i'm good this is the team that was up top 45 seconds until the reason oh so i shouldn't be or inside here three seconds i guess thank you did they uh did they clean out my box uh no spitfire in the bin yeah land at the bin spitfire i see uh i see one guy up top i think it's just one guy he's he's born he's going away yeah his teammates they're not pushing me they've just run off you just got back to your box yeah i'm about to are you gonna go over there with me because yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm coming why would they do that i mean i'm glad but yeah i don't know these teams are so bad and duos it's crazy how passive people are ah uh i've got you some bats oh thanks you're good you're good but can we go mate oh man i've learned how to do that i'm just running everywhere else i'm losing about the care package it's nice all right people gonna think i learned it from you but the truth is no no no no no you did 100 you did the truth is i don't actually know how to do it it's just i do some crazy elastic maneuvers and sometimes it just sends me sprinting off into the sunset yeah but see i can teach you how to do it consistently that's what your boy's here for i also gave you a heat shield look at that thank you thank you everything are you good it was either that or face at octane horizon with the team on top of me yeah those are the type of team students hold hands um i'm sorry i gotta find that oh no are you safe yes i the team on me here i might go underneath and just wrap around so we get behind them like it's just over here and there's a pad here the team just took the rope there behind us now oh oh man i'll put it i'll put it right on top of it they're both on me maxwell's name one of my guys's self-raising i think that's tragic oh nice one nice clutch they call me rampage because oh i messed that up oh that's sad yeah no yeah that's and that's going to be in the video so that's unfortunate no that's no no it is because i used a gold diva the whole game so that's going to be in a video
