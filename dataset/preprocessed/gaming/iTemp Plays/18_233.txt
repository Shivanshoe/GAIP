hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and watson got so many buffs in season 11 and i am going to summarize them for you now her fences and ultimate are now far more reliable and responsive when placing them down fences do 20 damage now instead of 15 the stun from crossing defense now lasts for three seconds instead of one and a half seconds the cooldown for fences is now 15 seconds which is down from 30 seconds the placement range of her fences has increased by 50 the delay between fences reactivating when a teammate passes through them is now 0.4 seconds which was one second beforehand and watson now moves at unarmed speed when placing the fences and the last one is that fence nodes can be placed down as soon as the weapon is ready instead of waiting for the animation to finish eight different buffs which is crazy unfortunately the new map isn't the greatest place to showcase watson's abilities once world's edge is back i'm going to play watson land at stream building and put down 45 different fences and see if anyone can beat me i'm going to sit in there all game it's going to be great so thanks for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh baby a triple oh yeah is that your favorite uh your favorite quote uh no i've got many favorite quotes that's one of them oh some big ones oh there are some big strawberries let me out there land me up there don't run over to there but this is literally this is the cap this is the capital city you can see there's a capital city three of the people here there's three people i mean minimum of three no there's actually a gun tomorrow yeah wait what is this where do i line do i just go straight down

only have a triple take that's do you have any heavy but down here to the left one is light on the floor okay why did my fence do that i don't know nice job oh my god can i drop this triple take i don't want it yes you can okay so if if somebody kills a team and then i go up and i scan that box it tells me where that team is it pings their location on the radar yes that's pretty crazy

my god should have tested me should have tested oh no okay well only one of us was ash i know online up top and i have a spare a mesquite i mean bats if you want it uh i mean i'm not gonna do much value with my white armor yeah but you'll get into a fight get blue and then you'll need to pop the bat i say it works they're on the care back don't get back they're on the care back they've run up to this left side oh my gosh back to him to psycho absolutely not to this spot right here is terrifying it's so if you're down here you do oh yeah the naught's now at least yeah i don't know what you're supposed to do down here if anyone passes through here well no actually really valuable we never really think about that oh yeah when we're playing we're playing offline recording i would 100 have left that and just not have not got it and then i would have been stuck with a with a havoc with oh terrible you'd be so confused wait there's a big fence right here i don't i think i can get past it yeah be careful oh you look that's my offense so you're good okay oh okay man i'm getting beaten how's the team here getting i'm getting worked by that brawler that's a waste mod stupid ammo oh they're tearing this dude up over here spawn behind me i'm not the guy shooting i'm protecting you guys [Applause] you got that right ah yes enough it's so hard to punch now yeah i don't know what happened to that it's actually so hard to punch now i can't i can never let anything whoa whoa look at this this is this is cut out so bad right this is op like look at the look at the bins that's actually a lot of business whoa this is crazy this is like if i died and you reach for me i'd be more loot than you yeah after the drop you're coming out with more loot i'm atlanta next game i'm probably dying to get jumped by a bunch of prowess but there's a rank spot oh do they come out of these things yeah yeah yeah if you shoot them in a moment do like a lot of them come out yeah don't please don't wait i i i didn't do anything i didn't do anything but they came out and now i'm being chased by okay goodbye brothers you just have to find out didn't you oh team on me i didn't even try to hop type i know i didn't even i didn't even shoot it playing with fences oh what are they gonna do now i actually don't think they can destroy that recharging shield this is the only way in and out from this side or you can go over the top or you can climb this tree that tree's climbed but there's a ladder inside wait that's crazy i was lying there is no ladder in the back so many trees does my alt even work here i don't know i want to see if my all works here i'm just gonna throw it anyways all right yeah curious how they do go see the trees okay that's what you mean though is the marshall life uh i don't think so this map is really cool though no honestly i'm a big fan we need to turn around oh go to them [Music] you're dead i left my right behind i'm going back to get it man where is it mate please wait uh 500 you want me to do 500 damage are you kidding me i can't do 500 damage i have so many shield cells um i i saw what do you mean why how did i see them flying was there not towers in this map no there's only one tower so it must be probably use the one tower all right i'm on the way we've been in the stupid prowling enclosement for the last hot we spent half our game in a satellite dish and the other half in the prime enclosement being just jumped continuously we're experiencing the map this is how you're supposed to experience that sorry you know i don't think i've ever been here on the beach creating an immersive experience for the viewers good boy that can we like get this over with in position wait that's crazy look at you go oh my god they are actually away wait are they oh no thanks oh you're actually doing this i think anyway like 120 right surely he has a crib i think so ow pop the chimney come on where's the chimney popping chimney did nothing sorry wait they're inside so this doesn't even work right i'm gonna do it anyways okay well it's all up to you they definitely have a craver just by the way they have a craver yeah he's only trying to throw me only trying to fix me why not oh my god i need to kill him right on my body dies so do you remember when you were asking if they had a creeper uh yes did you do the scientific method of testing that by putting your head right yeah yeah i was just i was uh i was just checking we needed the intel you know you took one for the team what were they doing by the way because they've double rushed me onto my arc star i cracked the valkyrie she then runs past me so i 1v1 her teammate what was she doing
