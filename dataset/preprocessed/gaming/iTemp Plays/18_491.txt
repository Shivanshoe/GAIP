hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are going to be playing some ranked and i have two games for you here both of which are solo because i think it's more relatable when i upload some solo gameplay as well uh let's be honest so far could carry a gerbil to masters so having some solo games along the way i hope will be welcome on the channel sometimes they don't go your way that is the nature of a battle royale i hope you guys enjoy today's double whammy and i will see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i genuinely don't know if i've ever come out of market life i don't know if a single market drop for me has ever actually worked out and it's looking like my trend is going to continue i'm sorry friend i don't have a gun yes i do i have no throw on oh my god give me a sec first game of the day i need help oscar mike i could be surviving if he can survive until i get back that hey we got our brothers right here i need your stuff this must be a third team all right i am feeling incredibly rustic i might have to risk this i don't have any shield cells thank you boneless shell battery all right first game of the day it's gonna take me a little bit to warm up are you okay teammate i can't believe you've survived this long you are game chase oh god careful all right i don't think that guy's shield cells i cracked him so easily i'm not gonna chase might as well get the boy back i heard that my marker uh we don't have a caustic and we're going into bunker which is always a risk but it's a calculated risk it doesn't sound like they're inside bunker you know they're definitely outside there's a crypto firing frying pan as they say i knew the frying pan is even hotter because they've got thermite grenades incredibly difficult to push out of here because i really hope my teammates have digital threats that's the only reason i'm smoking this out is because i have one so i've got so many thermite grenades i'll set you all on fire like over and over [Music] are they getting shot in the back because i can hear people find that can't see us i don't know if anyone's dying out there tango down oh i'm not getting there maybe she'll come back for the banner good grief what a series of events huh are you shooting the flyers one minute rings nearby dangerous twice in the same game okay this would never happen on ps4 mainly because people don't rendering that far away but pc lobbies on one word get ready for the charge rifle squad they can still see me i really don't know how the whole area is because they're further up to the left okay yeah yeah i understand i don't know if that's a friendly giveaway or not people are definitely down this way they wouldn't have been able to rotate around the mountain maybe maybe they could if they left early enough we might have to just push these snipers can't stay here all right well i did 700 damage but unfortunately it was on to give you arm shield there is army we're dead there's nothing we can do any chance these teams just run away no okay well oh 2800 damage we just got pinched i think we needed to commit to the sniper team i think we needed to run up the hill or something that's unfortunate fun game there all right bunker it is me amigos at least this time we've got a corsic it's like a prerequisite name for landing at bunker you at least need one corsi on your team i know that means you can't have two hello friends i don't have a gun do you leave any behind hello friends don't mind me i said don't mind me i've got nothing i just wanted to know that i'm i'm not there because i don't have a gun i don't want them to think that i've just left them and i had a weapon i'm sorry teammates might look at the start of the game he's just horrendous oh god and the finish went through teamwork i am so sorry oh my word i could have just shot and the finisher wouldn't have happened that's my fault no that's my old one where's the teammate here he is all right i'm gonna get you back instantly because that's sort of my fault and i gotta go back through bunker fantastic stabilizer it's the old forehead flying technique are those two new teams or is this the same team that just rotated that way i mean i threw my bangalore so maybe they had to run this way and bump into another team i think this is them want to chase our core super so long let's let's get him give me your armor please please give me your armory this other team died as well is that we've got all the lit that we need cancel this we can't even get there the storm's closing in oh okay so they are in the zone [Music] the fighter mate at least i got one of them nice contact i was so bad when i rushed into the zone to kill a team a little bit keep it up here look to kill kill hungry bloodthirsty if you're not going to get safe though i am going to gatekeep you that's just the way it's going to happen if you're going to sit in the zone i will run into the zone to get a gun fight because we haven't had too many this game it's been a bit of a struggle if anyone fancies adventuring into the zone for a golf helmet fell free i reckon that's worth it one minute rings nearby oh my god i wasn't even paying attention let's reposition oh thank you this is our building what 10 minutes come on in stick is incredibly weird all right so he's pushing people off this rooftop so we don't have to challenge but at the same time i sort of do have to [Applause] okay okay they're both down nice guys on my forehead i'm coming teammate never mind you've absolutely destroyed them oh good job gg my friends feels good to get a win i was gonna say i feel a little bit carried by the squad here but i did respawn at the start but it was my thought they died because i didn't have a gun i mean two thousand i mean that's not that's not getting carried i deserve more than six kills that's for sure 20 minute game 2000 damage six kills listen i got my kill participation points that's all that counts in ranked it was a good game it was a gg the whole squad came together thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you on the next one bye
