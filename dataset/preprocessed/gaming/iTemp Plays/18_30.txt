hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and by now everyone must know about the pay to win skins in apex legends the legendary skins that change the weapons iron sights for the better sometimes i pick up someone's wingman and instantly know the reason i won the gunfight against them their skin was horrendous and their rhymes were momentous but for some reason i have completely neglected the pay to win peacekeeping skins for 13 seasons i've barely used this gun since this game came out but now that my mastiff is in the care package again i have to use it just look on screen the difference between these two legendary skins since switching to the superstar skin i've been feeling like a bit of a pk demon it is just so much easier to get on target when there isn't so much visual clutter on your screen it's the exact same as the wingman today we are playing with janks thank you for watching guys i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends ten patrons smacky pack are allowed in the that's exactly what we needed i have already 45 stickers okay i have re-45 or i have spitfire or 99. i'm good thank you drop the car fancy i would prefer the r99 is that weird or not no i i far prefer the i9 to the car so i dropped the car would you like a blue lightning i've got one thank you gotta hop up here shatter caps is no one here all right there wasn't even the ring with the rope dean it's two teams yeah they jumped out ash cracked here right here maneuver look at this [Music] drag i have three phoenixes i have more phoenix kits than light hammer reloading all right if you do not find any light ammo actually here just take some mud running spitfire thank you i'll take one of your phoenix again there's something bugged about about this map i don't know if you noticed or not but it's always the shift that goes over yeah it's horrendous yeah it's every game so people just kind of like land it's really weird it's a glorious idea i almost switched to one that was already taken this guy's self-reviving he's self-reviving right on me okay nice i think teammate tried to take the kill like he shot the guy self revive and then stopped and then the guy stopped self-reviving i think he wanted to get the kill here yeah i aim a little bit i have another idea this guy's really weak teammates to kill him boy jumping just using a phoenix kid i just faced david and then i hit like eight um tap strafes and this guy had no idea where i was i didn't know where i was did you see what i did i heard a car yeah not to like you know compare over here well no totally time here but let's hit it i used my i used my horizon cue put the car in the air boosted the car tell i heard each event separately and i didn't put it together i went above and beyond i like that oh yeah i saw some back there we both have to spare i'm not jumping off here i know you could have taken us to the door this man drove the car and then just like didn't want to drive the car anymore boosting oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah here we go oh yeah 447 [Music] the paws a little bit early the idea was good i seriously liked it it was just a tiny bit early i forgot they nerfed the range that was about eight years ago you know yeah i break the wall so bad there's so much damage vacation they might be careful i'm really confused i don't see anybody i see a shiela and that's it checking in here oh i see them they're on me i jumped off the wrong side i jumped off the wrong side they shot the car thinking that was you 111 on one i did some damage nice it up in the air they stay like a full-on dumped a mag into it thinking you're in there i'm down to hopping the car again oh yeah dude i only say i'll miss out on that play time yeah i can't help but feel i've been a little selfish with the car please oh no no no you're up on the side and here you are oh yeah you're right yeah just here can you queue us onto that oh react to that pretty quick what did this team go that was inside though it was the lifeline i think it's be the teammate of this guy ran away must go faster we do in fact have a runner come on they've got triple charge bro they got triple charged can we just leave these guys and go they gotta die yeah i'm dying it's something about the triple charge rifle that just hit me the wrong way and the full enjoyer just needs to assert i agree i'm nowhere near you oh [Music] like i i [Music] yeah pause your all pogba all right how are you i need to recharge my shields all right the bloodhound is going to be away in a second and we can he his teammate's there he's got shields he's got probably sheila it's these boys oh mate yeah one fell off come on 117 on the ramp relating okay nice shots [Music] i'm still rushing her he's not me obviously different team nearly cracked call stick but there are two of them three of them taking shots yeah that building back there too [Music] it was dark in here but then the firmware like i don't know how to explain it someone say that i'm playing this bubble yeah so she probably got banners and she's probably heading to a respawn might be that one i reckon we should go here this is my detective worth coming in a cracker setting a portal he is up here though i don't see him i think he ran kind of running okay then i'm gonna guess he went yeah he jumps out the window what he's about to say nice thanks big numbers from the boys this is uh not good there's a full team here as well so target landed near me wrong choice oh look it's one yeah i'm just going to keep uh i'm going to keep being a nuisance for people okay i got good luck though so i'm coming okay i'm going to play throwing through my grenade turn my grenade out yeah i love two thermites and they were completely useless nice that's good that's what we needed right there i set them all on fire there's scrappy scrapping here mate let's just speak on you there's a fuse on me there's a team on earth too okay i'll come to you yeah they're fine in here oh there's another one you good i'm good okay nice good job i need to shock them all so bad i need a shotgun bolt okay i will pick one if i see one they dropped the target they're on here as well i see shadows yeah nice bolt yeah yeah thank you i'm using a phoenix kit i just started blasting back us is that yeah we got scanned by nash it's got to be above us yeah it has to be or it could be that way because we killed like two teams there yeah it must be over that way hostile spotted surely i don't see anyone though gotta be this scandal you know what i you might have been i killed the team that took the launch pad i killed him in the air oh okay so they could be on the other side of the launch pad yeah yeah maybe are this many in the same place it has to be here we killed like six people yeah yeah you're right you're right yeah they're on the roof contact with hostile i'm gonna alter them i don't know how the fuse didn't die dude i i do my old adam and your head join and i head shot him yeah he's fused he's probably picked it up that probably held him up oh nice you're gonna regret that yeah got the arcs i don't know how i'm missing my headshots oh no that wasn't that teammate i'll say he's called the naked man i didn't even realize that we're playing with the naked man i don't see him she's running past this you know it's like the it's like the guy from uh the grease ball from family guy you know oh i don't know no you don't no i've never really watched family guy yeah i didn't watch a lot of it either all the time and then he tries to get hot but nobody can catch him 90 on horizon nice no i walked into that recharging yeah oh disregard nice good job oh no he went through the white chunks oh [Laughter] i'm sorry i was kind of trolling now you're good you're good i was getting invited it's fine you are the apex champions no he's kind of stole so many kills but still no i know there was no stealing those little early game once oh to be fair yeah we got like six kills when we third party that team when the ash was like the teams that the ash kept scanning us
