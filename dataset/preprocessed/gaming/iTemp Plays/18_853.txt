straight out of the block okay first of all unique least on your team because he'd he threw in more damage than I did and I think I got two more kills how clearly I was - awesome - you need a sniper scope for those long range gunfights three try to look past I don't know if playing pattern is a good idea these grapples are great but he shoulders a too big you can't see anything I might try play smaller coats next and I wore plain to the game because that one wasn't too impressive we've got a win that's all that counts first game a victory on the new mode two days in a row or at least two different game modes in a row I've got a new skin get me back involved get me back in the action alright I've already got my win so I don't mind lands in a hot drop here and just trying to get me a few I see more gunfights in this we didn't have too many in the previous game I know I just miss that but okay I don't want my a DSC seems a bit fruitless be pointless you know my team that's been spied once more sorry Lawson I was trying to help did the Bangalore there's another person amazed all just up the guide saliva I guess okay I need to aide yes with that I'm terrible if I don't on the Left I have two shots oh come on say that he's so weak come on I think the finishing would be faster no give me a gun stopping me see ya how much someone else's to pay some way you could I've seen I hope which is good nice I'm gonna use this photo steal your loot friend go down I'm coming home useless anyways no see nice going on in this game mode oh it's purple it's purple armor man half man are purple armor right its entry that just means that he's gonna pick up his teammates per kilometer I'll be to show you you've just been YouTube my friend give me a sec I'm just always respawn you I'd rather go down there with some decent stuff I mean that's one in five this way fancy you got something the snow is kicking up nice teammate oh it's okay any grass and stuff no reason under okay I was going to be no reason I want to do that before respawning just sit here it's because I think my team is gonna solve it and it just won't be fair you know are you gonna scrap scratching my face I've got re my cat is on my lap and it's making so I can't really move to my four kills here shooting with octane is a little bit easier then shooting with path minor was and you still got the still are some movement options because all jump at okay I'd say that was pretty successful any question a DSS with that havoc small bucket see make careful careful careful I swear this one this way [Music] why would you do that want to steal you good now whatever you had in fast that maybe there what he finishes kill Tammy my teammate ah oh my god storm how far is he pretty gosh - from far I hear a Pathfinder don't block me do we no no no no no no no no no no new no new get me the syringe on up when I need one more after this we've got to go so far teammate I don't know if he's gonna is he's gonna work on up try though I've no soon just one message okay that's good already drop it do for my teammates teammates oh seven kills I'll tell you what though I'm happy the matter gun fires you've had here he's got a med kit I might drop in a few syringes just a few there we go I think I've got enough medicates to survive Obama I'll do that's one each yeah we're good me too it's told but I don't know if it's actually that good I don't think it's actually that good the spray weapon seems to be far there and my drum pad too soon I don't know if I'd be able to make it all the way up top there I don't think you can got your teammate whoa oh I guess you took the the old rope maybe that was a better idea okay well I didn't take a g7 so I'm struggling on the old long-range frontier a second's it's not a fox well that's put these guys off - there's some blue armor over this way we could try and just get involved here rings closing I like pushing limits as much as the next guy but we gotta really makes me want to get involved how good is them it's the the wingman at long-range tracker oh you have me we definitely heard me I need a sniper scope weapon I wish I had one I'd love this game mode I don't what it is they should be coming from this direction still what they go ah oh god that's not good laughing all right miss mites pretty bad that same it's in the storm where's that teammate are you good I'm not gonna jump you wanna show us off in one medkit finally he little line him up I think someone's seen a behind us yet under shoes that I know all kinds of spook take it's just like a mini first-person I miss every shot anyway you're not saying that's off point I just really I guess they did okay get in get this man come on wingman so I got a she'll back off going down this hill thank you good grace okay the wingman may not be that good I want this on that on that okay give me that yeah yeah but I just have a spatula scope though I'm not saying thank you that was my kill okay I'm gonna back up top I need a sniper scope I might ask them for one I can't I already got one attached already got a sight attached this means you can contest you know that's useful I mean it doesn't reduce the blimp at all oh it's been in the one man already headshot now that's fuming unfortunately seems in here all his teammates okay it's more people this way some say I sound like they doesn't have to think that I needed give me that give me some of these douche your batteries I'll take it I will take it picture brought smoke coming down are they some in this one be careful that there might be yeah no cancel that no eating cancel may as well use it I once again on top of the building with this but I see some Tyrone's man I need this girlfriend oh you have not there was some awesome the right hand Pete the thing is he doesn't have to peek here what was the plan oh okay we're screwed we have to get inside I need another spray weapon I'm going to take the ball that's it in unison oh yeah be careful don't going alone cuz they're clearly just gonna be looking at the doors I just dropped my sniper - it's not like we need him here it's gonna be terrifying we can't go around any other way can we we could sneak around the mountain we only got 14 seconds no we can't okay that would have been the plate that would have been the plate and now look we have to deal with right no don't lobby at us now we have to run Aldi not what we did them am I being too far but it's the right idea are you I did not mean to Superman punch that where did that bangle go Bangalore's in love in lhasa confused Oh you see a missus get him yes I think we won as a bangalore okay the smells what why well you know a new your fame our nice teammate who did it we did it third person mode is so fun what is this [Music] who's that slow fun I've done what it is about it I don't know what it made me feel like the game was so fresh that I wanted to stick my next my teammates because I was a little bit scared I've gone out by myself you know I needed I need a scope but not keep side damage if the person might have never seen anything like it yeah thank you for watching but do you protecting that was so much fun thank you so much for watching and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
