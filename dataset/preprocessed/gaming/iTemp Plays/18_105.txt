hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today i'm using a weapon that i've used maybe 10 times since its release it was ridiculously good on its release but then they nerfed it a few days afterwards and since then i've barely used it it is of course the bow check bow now the thing with the bow check bow is that it's actually pretty good but it's just such a weird gun weapon it's not a gun because if you miss with this thing it really does feel like you're doing absolutely nothing if you miss with a sentinel or a longbow you have that sense of like well if i hit that shot at least i would have done some damage the bow check when you miss it's it's so quiet you feel like you're not even partaking in a gunfight it's hard to explain but it's incredibly fun to third party with this weapon because you can just sit in the shadows and go unnoticed and just farm damage on people it's actually so good hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video thank you so much for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends could be uh let's reposition here we go here and then just uh just
