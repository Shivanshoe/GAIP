hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we're playing some more apex legends of course and today we got into one of the sweatiest games of public matches i've ever been involved in the champion squad was 4k badged out of their minds we got eighth parted at one point and then the final two teams were playing it like it was a predator match and they were there there's about 10 minutes left of the rank season and if they won they got to predator if they lost they got demoted to bronze that's what it felt like one of them was like a crypto watson team who locked down the ultimate high ground and the other team was shooting us in the back with the charge rifles that hit like 90 to 100 damage every time one of the players in the final two squads was either the best player in the entire universe with a charge rifle and flatline or he was cheating i honestly can't tell he wasn't landing every single shot he definitely did miss but the beams coming out of this guy were unbelievable i'm always tentative to accuse people of cheating because sometimes it feels like they are but then if you see their perspective it's obvious that they aren't plus i have no proof i'm about 50 50 on it myself this game is really slow to begin with but stick around for the end me and sopha both did 3 300 damage so it is a banker and let me know what you guys think about the uh the ultra good player at the end i want to know what you guys think it's a bit of a showdown as well so i'm sure you're going to enjoy it so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i don't see anyone come in here all righty there we could quickly get a gun and rotate up to that place that's the hard drop and we could be the biggest thing i'm done i'm landing up top wow all right teammate luke wasn't that great i'm not going to lie to you uh i actually might use i don't even want to use escape should i use escape um i mean i i'm

dude they're all sweaties too we're fighting like really sweaty teams yeah there's actually a lot of good teams that we just killed oh my god dude i played well played mate i'm so sad like i went down because i was healing from this guy and as soon as i turn around and i just finished the med kit he beams in the back of the flat line and one clips me as i'm trying to get to you oh i was walking from like healing there was a couple controller players in there so i was getting beam too well they tried you know yeah even with the eighth party we still ran supreme i choose so many teas that was crazy oh i see them they're going to the high ground in the middle okay it's a full team too it's all three are you going to land in there i should have got my own i'm going to stop with this care package first i'm going to put my hole no problem can we go uh you want a crater just appear right over there uh yeah i see one i can put my ultimate we can literally just rope up if you have your ultimate i'm at a different angle though uh yeah i can go over to you uh i just want to throw one nade at them i have once i hit one i don't know i'm gonna leave my ultimate here okay hp oh yeah let me tell you i killed one of them i killed one of them i can't travel i've been dead charge rifle i'm so sad oh no this other team i'm gonna try and get to you in a second i'm really safe this guy might recognize me wait what that's on i don't even understand uh what just happened that's unreal that's crazy see you guys do you guys don't worry about me good pushing shut it down just run honestly if you can to reset i'm safe if you can get up here i'm saying he's gonna wrap around the shield cell i've never been destroyed by card rifle so bad oh my god i i don't know what happened but i think i got headshot by a wingman and a uh a charged rifle at the same time destroyed oh my god all right we gotta secure this the good news is the team up top has like one person is dead i finished the kill yeah the team up top i don't think is that good no team below a little bit quick tire i mean yeah if we fight we're gonna get third party immediately they're not safe they're not safe yeah their team is below i think yeah they were they were firing down at them this has been the weirdest game of all time yeah i think they're oh my god he's getting his banner trying to get up there with the they're going up there they're going up there on the when they have to come down right so it's not yeah we could just play zone if we if we need to there are two squads next to the residents nearby i say we just placed on i say we're just playing yes pointless going up there again mate this guy whoever is is like the biggest beamer i don't think he can miss the single flat line shot there therefore they are frying i don't know they're not bad they're sweaties little sweaty oh my god one's close one's pushing up once yeah one's on the right side i'm inside holding a door hit the rifle on the right ten seconds we could jump on whoever unless one of us but we could we could literally just hold him in zone there's such a small small portion for them to come in oh dude he's not cheating though there's no no he's not he did miss a little bit he's just good i think he's just insane with the charge i thought oh my god we have to have this crazy scope on so he's like we're standing next to him when's one's pushing left or one dude i don't know i don't know it's it's weird though it's connoisseurs behold this rock we hold this rock dude i don't know about this guy he's he's hitting me for like 90 damage every shot watch five shots are so close i have two left we win if we play close range yes mate what is that dude i don't know dude i don't think he's cheating but it's really sus i need to create every single cop nah dude i don't know that's really sucks we need to dive on this dude do you have your old yeah he made it yeah i'm diving man whoever's got the flatline he's whoever's like the flatlines she's cracked she's cracking scratch i got one i got one that one it's just horizontal she's cheating she's cheating yeah i'm pretty sure she's mate she was up top and i was down low she absolutely like she didn't miss mr shot and that charge drive was unreal dude i think the horizon was cheating she was 90 damage every single shot with the charge rifle that is not normal at all dude oh wait oh dude we're fry let's go even even now let's go dude 20 diamond genie uh okay i do not accuse people of cheating i will say that right now but that dude was cheating all day that's the thing i'm so scared to accuse because you watch people and some people are just really good but dude no way he was he wasn't hitting 90 damage every single shot that's all head shots
