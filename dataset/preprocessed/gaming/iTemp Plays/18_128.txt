hey what's up guys twitch welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing coursey i thought he was dead in season 12. not literally but i thought his kit may not have been useful enough to warrant playing him he had two nerves to his kit you can now destroy his detonated gas barrels and the gas lingers for two seconds after you destroy that gas barrel and even if it isn't destroyed they now last for 11 seconds on the ground instead of the 12 and a half seconds they did beforehand however after playing him for a few hours i still think he's really good one of caustic strengths is controlling engagements and covering for third parties and with the public games how they are at the minute he's coming in clutch almost every single match i have two games here for you today i really hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm gonna get pinged to this yeah yeah i'm inside yes i got it oh i haven't landed in ages i've got a mozam yes and a wingman i am so happy that we're on king's canyon body shot headshot you know the vibes you know the vibrations [Laughter] what a bunch of fancy fellas we're already inside the next ring ah that felt yeah double headshot [Music] back i'll give you yours back they both have purple oh no no no no no no take this oh there we go this this creature is making a lot of noise don't worry i'll shut him up oh my god that might be the first time they've ever died to that he didn't even kill him he lived i should have thrown my bowling ball out i had to shut him up the cooldown on your bowling ball is it's like actually playing bowling it really is you can just you just keep on throwing it down the lane you know did you see the uh the trial he went that way i did there's a guy on the bridge though okay well op bridge careful careful careful independent variable this guy's lucky dude did you see the bug with bangalore yeah where you can stand in the smoke yeah it's kind of ridiculous oh it's like a crack the bank crack daddy i did 100 on life i want that bangalore's put down the subject we ran no no no no i want your wing please just accept that then give me your wingman thank you voice recharging popping i've missed king's canyon i have missed it i mean people die fast on this map but people die fast on every map dude i'm gonna be honest the thing about this map though is like you can move faster yeah you can get away yeah people definitely die faster or just as fast as any other map but the way you can traverse and move the map is like you can at least be there for yeah you can sometimes i mean some games you're inevitably gonna have nothing but plus i just feel good on king's canyon there's value in that i no i'm the same mate i i agree with that statement that sentiment like a throwback playlist or something where we can have like the original kings canyon with the skull town and stuff and then like season three world's edge with the first version of capital city like i do like a throwback oh i'm here i'm hitting with my corset yeah man i agree that'd be great i don't know i don't know you could have like a fancy name for it could be like legacy playlist or something yes i don't know legacy that would be awesome right yeah i mean you got to be fancy about it i appreciate that name i'm a marketing genius you are hey this guy right here i mean were you inspired after the last game i was i was i've done more damage in this game crazy than i did in the last game by far do you need a purple barrel uh no thank you i got wingman 100 um what a guy janks i saw you i saw the finisher start and i was like hold on all the phones no that's a teammate i love these buildings man there was nothing better than when this game first came out when people would hide in there and you would sit on the top and shoot through the little gap i just like oh yeah they had no idea the halls i'm hearing my trap again by the way we should just stay over there this this okay i'm coming it was pretty far it was far i was just throwing that throw on that energy out there you know they're probably shooting my trap they're mad countdown what are you gonna if you just if you just sit there people will come to you 100 yeah something about this hill [Music] there's a replicator coming in two frags on the ground i've already got two gold mine yeah what a fine i got a winner say wingman mastiff yes i got a lot of room for bats frags battle frags beauty load up oh rich i'm looking at him rich i'm just looking at him he's looting the box hold on look at him point five on the bird seems one head shot oh yeah dude he's one reloading pull the phone here throwing frank chuckling delivering track 100 okay [Music] [Music] here variable to consider i still like kills did you kill the do you kill the red uh i don't know if he's a someone's i'll say he has red [Music] oh that's a different guy that wasn't even the right i think yeah yeah that was the one with the red uh if you need more heavy heavy ammo here we should have stayed here this is this is the spot we've come back twice now i'm blown away that two more teams just pulled up there and we know they're here because of my incredible traps i mean i think that's the only adjective you could use in this situation i mean let's be honest here they could have shot it they had all the opportunity to shoot the trap they just simply never did they couldn't make it was hidden in the shadows i know i know all the other spots and it backfired on poor guys i'm gonna have to turn around again in a sec hey if we have to turn around one more time if i could shoot like this in our ranked games maybe we would have gained some rpd today and not lost 300. what are you talking about we only played two games and we won one of them no no when we're playing moose the rewards in that game oh we're playing with moose we never lost rp though i was getting bullied though yeah we never would we never lost our beat it's it's hard to move backwards yeah it is especially because i was in plat you know lost the lamp yeah and waiting you know you're too hard on yourself i think that's awesome i get in my head so much and that definitely affects me and when i'm in those lobbies it's like oh my look because all right so when so when you die first and you spectate i play worse 100 i play worse on stream and i feel like when i mean those lobbies i feel better place and i've i play like that permanently that way yeah they're in uh dude
