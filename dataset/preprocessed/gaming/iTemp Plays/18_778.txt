hey wassup guys eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today I am using the Arthur L 1 and Jax told me that he thought that this gun was feeling a little bit different and when a 50 Legends first came after Arthur 1 if you remember was a complete laser beam I loved to use this weapon it was extremely consistent it reminded me like an ACR from Call of Duty but then they nerfed it and after the first 10 shots the recall goes all kinds of horizontal it's very difficult to stay on target but it does feel a little bit different at the moment let me know if you guys have thought the same thing but thank you for watching I do appreciate it I see one in five and a half seconds my friends [Music] I'm going downstairs in your building
