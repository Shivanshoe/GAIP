hi everyone my name is item plays of rich and i'm here today to give you a full breakdown of c's kit and to see him in action on the new world's edge so let's start off with sia's passive he comes fully equipped with a heartbeat sensor that has a range of 75 meters you will get used to how far away 75 meters east once you've played for a while but you do get a visual representation on screen as you can see here from the bluish circle appearing on the broken building ahead of me heartbeats are highlighted in orange and the circle tells you the direction an enemy heartbeat is detected see it can also see enemy shields and health bars above their heads next up we have sears ability this is a charged of tunnel of drones which interrupts enemies which we'll talk about more in a second and it reveals them for a short period of time this ability can hit multiple targets and it has a range of 75 meters equal to that of his heartbeat sensor says ultimate is a dome area of effect where fast moving enemies are highlighted on screen even through walls and their footsteps are tracked enemies can crouch walk or stand still in this area to avoid detection now i have some sea tips here for you so you can hit the ground running in your first few games first up you can use sears heartbeat passive without a weapon just zoom in to get the effect seat's ultimate can be destroyed make sure you place it strategically in a battle to avoid this happening you can benefit from your heartbeat sensor whilst using your ability just hold your ability and wait for the circle to go orange indicating an enemy within 75 meters when it is orange your ability is on target just remember that the enemies have a short period to react to this and dodge it seasability is an interrupt this stops almost every action in the game including a pathfinder who is mid grapple a valkyrie trying to escape with their ultimate or if they're just flying but also healing actions if you suspect someone is in cover and using a shield battery or a phoenix kit fire your ability at them to reset their healing and get yourself over there to finish the kill so there we have it go out there give cyril go in season 10. i am sure you will love his kit and have fun so that is the video that i made for apexi socials it was a ton of fun playing season 10 early and i might actually have some more details here for you guys soon enough so be on the lookout for those the game that i've got you for today is a fun one a ton of damage a load of crater shots it was a great time thank you guys for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends and stuff so i was like dude i can't play this apparently they fixed it and stuff well it fixed a lot of the issues but it's just like hype's already gone like i don't even care anymore yeah you're not gonna stop playing it maybe if i'm just really bored one day um or if you have internet safe that's true oh these boys pulled up funny we killed this team but there could be more yep i'm going i can't even try to market it again there's sniping from top like four-story uh you're probably raised is he far where he's no he's that in the sideline he

purple mag as well i just love that gun i'm not the biggest fan it's just easy it's just an easy gun i feel like that about the 99 i've been that was fine with the 99 a few games ago in that little damage race we did with kevin there as well you know the one i won oh yeah the one where we averaged about 400 damage each well yeah you dropped the average name cause i got over a thousand but yeah that one okay but make sure to throw in the other two games where i cleared like why would i do that yeah i mean you got to throw those in there you know those are important i won't do that i mean 14 people left where are they i mean i literally drop a 20 bomb but i had 13 kills leaving fragment dg how much damage yeah uh not much at all because a lot of kills were how much time interest uh 1600 so bad 145 it's lived on for you mate i just can't miss right now oh nelly nearly nelly that was nice that was nice oh yeah oh yeah you know they call me uh no what do they call you i was hoping you knew i've got nothing ah i got nothing for you either i'll be honest i was relying on your creativity no energy oh where we came from idiot let's see we need to see another one of those uh the team where we came from that pink there's a team west okay the last few teams then yeah well from one team uh they're around here somewhere no way now he knows not to stand still no way did i miss that i'll see if they'll if i can push him out over here and then maybe let's start off too oh no i'm dead i'm actually dead i didn't realize that they're this close save me i got you back they're not even peeking i have no idea what's going on to recharge bamboozlers are just too much for him and this was for the foos holes you could say uh-huh so the same ran off onto another build onto another rock okay i'm making my way back up it's 240 meters so it's like there gonna need a big down so i can push that let's check out this area this guy's getting closer these guys are these guys are sweaty these guys over here are sweaty 145 on blue the blue we're already in the ring this guy's gonna appear up here oh my god i'm getting attacked by a fly it's not happening okay uh i think these guys just ran oh no wait they're still here all the way all the way 250 meters into the distance these guys are right here what am i doing to these people are you just destroying people because i'm just trying to i'm not like pushing them i'm just kind of shooting for four nine i don't think i'm gonna push him get out there i have two shots i'm dead do you become a mega oh do you need something i dropped it watson i don't know if you might need to get rid of that generator but you can just stand under i guess yeah i'm chilling i need to lift one of their guns because i'm out of crater there's a triple tank over there if you want it how far oh that's he took it i think he's still available i know he's just red armor i think it was on the care package if you want it how fast the cat back oh it's right here all right okay i think it's going right yeah it's still here nice i'm going to go through all the care package snipers i was just this team left and they're terrified of me they didn't
