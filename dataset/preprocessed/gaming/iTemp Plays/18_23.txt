hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and recently i've been looking more into my apex desk to see who i have been playing the most obviously pathfinder is going to be sitting at the top quite comfortably with 5744 kills now i'm a pathfinder mate this was very obvious second place was octane with two thousand two hundred and ninety five kills the two fast boys sitting at the top of the leaderboard makes a lot of sense and then internet horizon with 1 523 kills which surprised me i didn't actually expect it to be this high i think i've just played her consistently since she came out so i think he received seven because she's always been good pathfinder and octane have both had their peaks and their troughs in terms of how good they are in terms of the meta the horizon has been great since she came out now these numbers are a little bit on the lower side by the way because this is only my pc account i think i have another 5 000 kills or so on pathfinder on my playstation account as well just something to keep in mind now if you guys would want a video about my stats and my kill turtles and all the legends in order let me know because i always find those kind of things interesting so thank you for watching guys i've got a great game here for you today i'm sure you will enjoy it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends team our building code red i never land here but i probably should start landing here if there are pks on the ground everywhere oh my god i'm stuck too looking to see here just a team stacked behind rampart shields across the map that's fun give me your purple the rampart here put shields everywhere it's annoying look kill me than elsa amigo my lifeline might seem though oh yeah there you go let's make sure you got something here all right well i guess we'll move this way i need to find an r9 or an alternator oh working with not bad pretty good i have two very close range guns so i need to get involved if this is wall's edge i think r9 pk is absolutely fine but because it's storm point it's kind of difficult to use this as a setup he's anyone waiting for me thankfully it is deserted oh it cost 30. i thought it was 35. did he used to cost 35. attention the corsic trap here and get me a shotgun bolt too if i get some more max it's so weird how i go through phases with weapons i can't believe i'm a pk enjoying it i used to hate this gun but since the various i know i always talk about it but since the start of the game i thought this gun was like i always knew it was good oh there's someone here i always knew it was good but i've always been bad with it i don't know what changed now i thought i'm actually pretty good with this weapon yeah get out of here stop it you're a maniac although they may have dropped no there set up top hello what are we doing i missed i love land like that like horizon another soft landing hello but you're behind the post well there's another team here this guy was solo that was the last one got the best team i have three got the rope jump if you need to have my ulti ready there's only a shield cell that wasn't a shield bats they are weak nice that's going to save you but you didn't need any help what what the heck is going on at the horizon can't have much health just run teammate i got you back there you go i know we have a lifeline but she needs to heal so i don't mind taking the revive duty any light ammunition there was definitely another fight happening that's our location i like it with the digi 2 because that's the weird thing like i know i made that video saying i never had the good skins and i definitely changed my attitude towards the pk but it doesn't explain why i like it with the digital threat now as well because surely that didn't matter when my skin was bad i don't know it's all over the area guys all i wanted was my red armor they're not safe up there if we can get some damage here make them have to fall down into our team that kind of hurts can you stop with the shields please my teammates are waiting for you no i've gone up top i don't know hello there we go he didn't even need to drop it's just scary because if he went down up there like taking the rope he's horrendous you but he did not need that help in the end guys he's too much of a demon oh we got four squads left that's actually not too bad that's a lot better than it usually is on this map we've got a health drone waiting for us why not as well the most op ultimate on the game as we all know well worth a six minute call game i didn't get to crack my shotgun bolt that makes me sad any shotgun bolts i like to keep my distance so they know i'm helping them out oh it was a purple bag that she got not a gold one that's a shame so when your lifeline has a gold bag it's almost an excuse to play two aggro i mean annoyingly we've uh we've managed to avoid the prowler thing but i almost want to go back in here because someone was firing the rings we're not inside them yet finally just a moment i don't need this fat i'll make it for them just in case they do i feel like i hog bats it's like the one thing i look for in death boxes so i very often think my teammates are running around with like one or two bats and i'll have like 18 18 batteries any less than 18 and you're not you're not playing the game properly in my opinion if he's over this way or is it just browse over this way i absolutely despise this place i can't even one clever frail look at me they're getting another shotgun balls i crafted for nothing at least we can use it though have to risk it a lifeline package here i'm scared i can't believe there are there's more than one lifeline in the same lobby never before seen oh yes please sign me up and wanted two times close range yeah i know i still remember let me take this opportunity just to leave one we're not safe and two if you get caught here it's kind of annoying to try and rotate out because it's just open water are you getting sniped through some behind you that sucks trying to do loads of damage here it's just that it's about trying to put them off as they're trying to shoot my team two of them have snipers sorry shut my own lifeline in the face he cracked one of them hopefully he can just get to us now here he is heck my teammate he's using a pk at this range i love it it's all about sending a message as long as they're not shooting the vulnerable teammate in the open and we're absolutely fine this could get interesting okay when we were in checkpoint there were 15 people left and now there are 14 people left a solid six or seven minutes later no one has died apart from this guy never mind i missed oh where my sidelines are terrible and my rhymes are ineffable if we hold them here long enough they're going to get shot on the back [Music] and what's kind of safe here so i actually don't mind as soon as these guys get on the back we move up there's no way they still sat here right i don't mind pushing up because i'm horizon i'm just queueing the air no one can hit me moved back oh you're not interested in those other guys you're just chilling i am more than happy to kill these guys i was about to say one has to pick this angle singularity they're probably just going to drop down but that's fine we just we can just take the high ground instead where did she come from did she climb up i did not hear it mind you i was firing at the time so all right now there's one less team to worry about four to eight on a longer that's i mean you've got to get close to these people you've got to abuse game assist in these situations later strengths you know if you're a medicine keyboard player with a 48 do what they did back up but if you're a controller player like me just hold the left stick forward and you cannot lose it's kind of cheating the team up top have to move is that them my theorists are sniping you might want these i think i've ever used that scope in my entire life good hands picking it up i like it as well oh my an enemy so we've got two teams flying this way and then the team close to us we're not safe here we're gonna have to move down this way they're moving this is great we just take their spot this is perfect these are the last three squads and they're all like ahead of us yes steal their spot shoot them in the back and then steal their loot it's a three-step process it's a three-step plan she's fast he's still weak though that's one he just grappled into the enemies okay my three times accuracies what's happened to my three times accuracy yeah with a good news ease they didn't have a gold bag oh my gosh i get to use a vault this is a christmas miracle my three times accuracy used to be so much better than this i don't know what happened just make sure they don't come to the left that's all we need to do here sort of trap these these guys in they're going to try and rotate left i think as long as we can hold them back maybe work with this ledge here i have angles but [Applause] i used to be so much better than three times r through a one one notice that i mean i haven't used the gun this season but it's not very difficult to use let's be honest it's like the most straightforward gun stop flying at me i'm trying to shoot this fight i miss my ultimate that was the that's the one trick i had uh i'm going to bat to make an afk revive i might get too confident you guys have any i mean i've got a vault i'm more than happy with this my teammate absolutely loves the peacekeeper i thought i was a fan in fact someone shields from there he's an absolute pk machine this vault is completely if i can play to the left here and kill this valkyrie did the valkyrie hear me coming around the side or is she just the luckiest player of all time oh that range oh these guys are screwed i'll bless him it literally is like two fish it's like seeing fish in shallow water look at them they're beached they were like three bleached whales in the shallow water run ashore ex-champion from up top with the vault tremendous game amigos lifeline i'm pretty sure she was doing a peacekeeper only challenge um she did tremendously got some revives in there too 3600 damage i already have my 4k badge on horizon so i don't really mind too much about trying to farm 4k i probably could have farmed a 4k badge there or sorry a 4k game if i picked up more light rains but i forgot where the loop was i and i didn't want to leave my team for too long because they might have got rushed but yeah that was a great game i enjoyed that fun engine as well like a stalemate 3gs
