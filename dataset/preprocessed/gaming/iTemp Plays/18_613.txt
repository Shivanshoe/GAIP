all right here we go my friends we're going in season seven here of apex legends the ascension trailer the first look well that's the rocket ship that thing is keeping us really nice yeah well that was the plan right okay uh new plan follow the racket you shouldn't be standing that close to kid knowledge by way and not hell available can you check the jump signature i can go me right are you ready for this am i ready uh ready for what going to olympus my friends it's the gang it's the pathfinder mirage rampant here we go first look at the little deck what is that maybe it's the welcome committee is it going in the crate looks like the one on king's canyon oh it looks colorful it looks bright olympus is supposed to be like the the rich people's city in the sky so it's going to be very modern it's going to be very green very beautiful not very light on his feet horizon there she is a flat line i i have that skin oh there's the vehicle i was going to say that's the vehicle we can drive i didn't think we'd be able to fly that'd been ludicrous man the map looks unreal actually so excited to play this map i knew there was going to be some sort of anti-gravity lift with horizon that's one of her abilities that's probably her her q her basic ability now she turned bad so what happens when you when you crash the car do they explode can you run people over okay that's her ultimate that has to be her ultimate right so it it's like a black hole so you would everything that goes everything around here gets sucked in like xy from overwatch if you've ever played that and then it just explodes like i assume that you just get sucked in for a little while and it's like you're in that singular point and you can't move for a little bit perhaps but that's incredible it's our first look at olympus can we get back to that shot where we saw it for the first time from above it wasn't then hold on hold on look at these plays this place looks incredible okay i love fighting in cities like capital city because there's a bunch of cover you can outplay people easier i'm not as good in the fields and this place looks like one one big city it's got like the the black hole thing here which is a bit intimidating you've got like a a giant hill here reminds me of the giant icy pine of doom from world's edge a bunch of uh smaller towns and villages around the place but this looks like a water treatment area this place looks unreal i cannot wait to play on this map if this isn't my favorite map i will be very surprised and also can we just appreciate like the color scheme from like like the colors on this map they're looking bright vibrant it's going to be so fun to play on uh world's edge and king's kenny at the moment like that shade of red because there was um they changed the map midway through the uh through the seasons the vehicles are another thing that we're getting there our first look of here as well and they don't look op one thing i will say is that if you are playing on a pc with a controller you will be a disadvantage trying to shoot these vehicles it's always easier to track faster moving targets with the mouse uh compared to a controller in my experience anyway but the cars don't look overpowered they don't look incredibly quick and also if you saw this like they're literally just hanging on to the edge you are vulnerable is is the term i would use you are extremely vulnerable we got a first look at horizons ability as well which i will find for you this is horizon's ability i assume her basic ability where she is like an anti-gravity lift it sends people upwards and then you can shoot them i assume that you'd want to use this on yourself sometimes just to reach higher places um i wonder what her passive is going to be i find passives some of the most interesting abilities because i think they're more difficult to think of like if she's a character based around gravity like the gravity lifts and the black hole the kind of like not obvious that they're interesting mechanics though but the passive is is what changes the character like a rampart with the lmgs for example i always forget the ramp is good with the lmgs well there you go my friends we've got the map we've got the new legend we've got the new vehicles i don't know if there's a new gun in there i couldn't really tell to be honest with you but that is our first look at season seven ascension that was an incredible launch trailer i'm sure we are going to get some more hints and teasers here soon enough for season seven i've got a full gameplay
