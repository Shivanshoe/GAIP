hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today's video is a strange one first of all it was a three-star lobby so the fights were far more intense at one point we befriended a random team and i also got kung fu picked in the back of the head all coming up soon but first a word from our sponsors lenovo intel and microsoft lenovo legion stylish outside savage inside this is how legends are made [Music] thanks once more to lenovo intel and microsoft for today's sponsor so as i said today's game is a bit of a strange one first of all here is the champion squad clearly a very good set of players in a three stack so we're in a three stack lobby if you aren't aware that's pretty much how matchmaking works you can play with a friend on apex and get relatively fine lobbies most of the time but if you're a three stack your opponents are often three sacks as well and i'm glad it works like this because three sack teams have an obvious advantage against a randomly match made squad now three stacker lobbies are just way more intense the lobbies dive faster because everyone's fighting for kills it's brutal honestly and janks our random teammate and i had a massive back and forth with the champion squad with multiple respawns going on towards the end of the game so i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh you know it apparently got me a detective don't mind if i do they are scrapping in here if you're interested oh yes they are i am interested so just flew on us this way another that one got that guy's flesh the second guy don't know where the other guy went he's inside is he oh do you have any heavy 50 oh thank goodness thank
