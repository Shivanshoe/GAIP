hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today i am playing some more apex legends of course and i have somewhat of a bonus game here for you today because i hopped back onto apex earlier on and i had what was probably my best game of season eight so i had to upload it before season 9 came out i'm playing lifeline who i've played maybe 10 times this entire season and i've finished the game on four revives and it would have been five revives but so far decided to self-rest at one point because it was more beneficial for the squad the point is the game is incredibly fun and i'm sure you guys are really going to enjoy it today i wanted to focus on lifeline's changes in season 9 coming out tomorrow and here you can see from my early capture event thanks to ea game changers just how the new lifeline revive system will work because it's basically the same as it was now but without the shield you can see that in the heat of battle though it's still really difficult to counter i don't think it's as bad as it sounds without the shield because my two options when someone is getting revived in front of me is to either first the person getting a revive or to shoot the lifeline who's defending them the problem with thirsting the revive is that the lifeline then gets to shoot you with no repercussions and she'll probably eat you like 120 for free so i end up just dying myself what i will say is that this 1v3 here in arena would have been possible if i didn't think i still had my fault from the previous round as you can see i have a p2020 and a g7 sketch not exactly the greatest close range guns on offer so i don't think the revive nerf is all that bad honestly because lifeline can just defend the player getting revived at close range it's still really powerful it's still really useful and she is getting some major buffs to her in the in the form of her drone he's like 60 quicker her ultimate has got way better looting it i don't think it's going to be incredibly useful i wish they would rework that but at least he's better now and she's no longer going to be a low profile legend as well because low profile is being deleted and that is a huge change believe me so all you lifelong mains out there just wait and see how she plays in season 9 because you may be pleasantly surprised one thing i will say about the the change is that maybe you don't want to revive people at medium range or in the open because that's where he is going to just be almost useless so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends don't trust this guy here we go unless i come out on the roof i can't this guy he's trying to punch me out i don't have a gun i'm dead yeah that's not good there's a guy running in your building right now uh low ground hey oh he's just funny hopping around that guy's purple as well might be same guy might be a different guy okay two purples and a blue crack crack another one blue you have john do you have them yeah come on thank you that constituted lifeline mechanics nice nice nice thank you i will diet oh what he was trying oh my god no no no no no no top down there's a few of them there at least two i'm going out okay oh come on come on [Applause] coco but i'll still revive the views i can't use my drone friend oh he's got purple he's broken there on my head nice [Music] do you know 911 yeah did you know in england it's 99 did you know that i didn't know that honestly no yeah it's good to know yeah in england i'm getting mugged by you very lightly honestly highly likely it's probably the most likely thing specimen a greek god i'm going to open up this secret compartment for some shield cells uh do you have any sight whatsoever for a g7 um both my guns are iron sights unfortunately all good see get a spitfire off drop we survive oh yeah there's still 30 people left what whoa so people left there's a big scrap up here uh uh bangalore alts yeah teammate wants to go loot so i'm gonna let him that's all good he probably doesn't have too much after that yeah i got shot our stealth he's gone oh they just revived someone oh yeah in here he's about a shot he's a plan he was a plan it was a bush didn't tell me that it actually was a person no i didn't realize i wasn't aware it scared me you never expected the plot to start shooting at you you actually don't i dropped it three times so if you're interested on the spitfire car it goes wild ah no thank you i can drop 20s like we don't have that many no problem oh in front of me oh okay trying to help trying to help attract him basically crap through the guy too you just paid the horizon whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa did you know that she was playing local yes or no she thought she was like fused or something after that but that was a ball i'm trying not to die here uh i don't know where the other boxes went i'm just gonna purple switch off this one giving my shields a recharge she did not realize she was playing i forgot i don't know because you can definitely cancel it mind you i had a comment yesterday i don't know if you remember the good fight we were you know those buildings in kings canyon in like artillery and it's like a building that has a build on top like a little you know where i just had that massive scrap where we just worked behind us there's a guy behind us no no no taco engagement yeah and we were like looking up to him and he was a pathfinder and i said and i said i can't get up there and then someone commented you're literally playing lobo he wanted me to bracelet up to this guy that was staring at me so it's entirely possible that guy knew they were playing over because that guy would have just rushed in like a maniac yeah that's my story hopefully you enjoyed it oh yeah that was a good story thank you it was jason seven headshots go back go back oh did you pick that up nobody got anybody going i'm dead now i'm dead now i'm dead oh behind us too yeah that actually hit me i'm just i'm still stunned i'm still stunned can you make it to me oh that's close i'm not with you guys i'm really not with you guys this guy's down you might be able to tap him they're padding over they're panning over they're on top of don't stop they think we're on their team just back up just back up just back up there up top on us what is this actually a guy then he paddles i'm behind him behind him already went around let's watch this mirage go past me go back he's so good oh okay he's just having a good time 50 shields cracked oh

it's always an oxygen i oh my god thank you there's another team i can sell fries don't worry about me okay you should i can tap you sure oh yeah 30 seconds you're good i'm fine i'm right there we can go right side we don't have to like i need heavy oh here we go a lot of heavy in there i don't have any bats left these guys will probably have some though i have uh two cells and that's it uh snails here on the way oh nice more batsy if you need him oh they're rezzing they're gonna res boy that's uh oh wait these isn't it oh that's fine mate we are just reviving each other again and again that was great we were just the best two revivers in the game you by yourself i haven't really got an angle all right it's probably gonna full send me office yeah he is practicing with your it363 it's
