hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends and today thanks to ea and respawn i am bringing you guys some early access season 11 gameplay we're playing pathfinder because ash was taken but we do use the new car smg which is great as well now don't ever ask for this but if you guys could leave a like on this video it would help tremendously and if you're new to the channel please be sure to subscribe because i have even more early gameplay of ash the new care package weapon a load of stuff it's coming soon so don't be saved so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends making contact yeah you know ash you know all right our first hot drop of storm points oh god we're not allowed to use any skins mind you i don't have any that means that my r99 has the circular iron sight which is scientifically proven to be real bad might be something good this way i'm not sure what scientific research is out there on it but i can always guarantee that he's out there 100 okay good start i'm beaming giving my shields a recharge opening fire on the enemy oh my god he's got a triple taker right here mess him up teammates look at that pinch maneuver our team coordination is off the charts i will say supply of syringes evo shield here level three i completely forgot there was a new gun i didn't forget but like i'm trying to i'm trying to focus on like the the map you know look out grenade hostile right here we can kill these guys we're looted look at our armor these guys probably haven't fought anyone yet i can at least one of them's got white i have limited bullets and these guys definitely have loads of bullets and i've got a bangalore ultimate through okay that's not too bad i miss a lot of shots though across the fence as well guys these guys are in they're in shambles mess them up i missed i got no rain because we were fighting beforehand and i think they furthered us uh if i need to i can switch the car to light but i don't have loads of light either so i'm going to use it my heavy first plus i have a gold heavy mag so it makes sense watch out jurassic park over here giving my shields a recharge if i needed to i could grapple over the top of this which is nice i think pathfinder on this map is going to be the prowlers they just find prowlers him that's not a fair trade they revolted what is it season seven giving my shields nice that's not oh good either oh god oh no row this is an unfortunate third party using my phoenix kit here let's bring our friend back okay the good news here is that i don't think there's any chance my teammates leave because it takes a while for the lobbies to fill up in this event and i can definitely reposition oh a battery i can definitely like re-angle reposition get the banners they still losing i would assume so there's one guy there's two guys the teammate already gone no i could be a wraith rings far minute to go using grapple position revealed by ash are you doing here got our friends banner this is great picked up our friends banner we can bring them back i said don't shoot me listen you're so low i'm a solo now that team of three is going to turn around that's half a minute we should have just we should have i mean i shot already didn't i it was my fault giving my shields a recharge oh my god all right there's a respawn beacon here we're good now she's getting naded this is what you get should have moved should have should have got out of there who is this i'm not gonna say i'm saying incognito this is pathfinder supplied in here i love loot ah zones coming in i shouldn't i want a third it's so bad there you go that team's dead anyway i want a third party it would i just got there at a time where i would have been the focus you know teammates don't have any loot so i just got back it's not worth it so seven people left about 1500 damage not bad might be in a position to cut these guys i mean they're still scrapping or they could be fine prowlers i don't know it's not worth it i'll try and stick on my team and try and see this game if we can we're doing great only two other squads remain that's that's solo i reckon that that was the ash that i bumped into r99 here my teammates okay is there loot over there or what's going on are they keeping people or looting or what's the deal you guys good they must be looting surely my ultimate isn't ready yet this is embarrassing replicator dropping might be something good this way now that she's fine the watson might not be this way it looks like she'll be such a okay part of the map i mean the whole map's kind of crazy i can't wait to like properly explore it it took me ages to uh to get used to olympus when it came out like i was playing it and i'd discover a new rotation or a new tunnel like two weeks after playing it for the first time i assume it's gonna be the same thing for this map and i love the design too i love the colors i love the tropical theme i think pathfinder is going to be just so good on this map like actually unbelievably good the rotations remember there are no balloon towers i think there's one balloon tower um and if you don't like tridents which i'm i'm not the biggest fan of uh i think pathfinder might be the oh pathfinder valve corey this is the team of three that killed that solo ash i mean i'm gonna get some ash gameplay so don't worry if you guys want loot we can try and like ambush one of these guys i guess i need to save my grapple because i'm sort of solo at the moment oh that's really impressive oh but it's on connecting yeah i guess i can't move i'm 130 ping that explains the bullets not connecting i forgot i mean i'm with the americans here sorry team i got messed up if you can try and survive taking damage friends oh no i can't help through this window again no aims is through this window it's not even worth me they took the roof i wasn't expecting that i wasn't really with the team when i got caught by the ash queue i took a load of damage i had to run past someone to start healing and then every time i tried to heal those i got interrupted by something i wasn't with the squad if i was with the squad i think we could have killed him maybe i mean they were a good team too but my teammates were pretty good i think yeah my teammates were good oh it was a good game though not bad not bad at all
