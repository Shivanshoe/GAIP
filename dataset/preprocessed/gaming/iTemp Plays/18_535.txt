hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i i've got two new guns that i un-ironically really enjoy using and they are nowhere near the usual meta the spitfire and the charge rifle i use them in combination this game and i get a bunch of kills there's some great little clips in there it's not traditional but it works maybe it's because historically these guns have been associated with lesser skill players maybe that's why i was finding success of them i don't know perhaps this is true but i don't care i am a dweeb with a dweeb machine and i am proud and i hope you enjoy the gameplay thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'll definitely get my issue fixed yeah this one's free looking good nothing that's it you've got your uh time got your sniper hammer though charge rifle charge rifle charge rifle two mastiffs evo shield here that i need help um i've tuned it's crazy how much ammo that you get from those and i say every time but i don't know surprising might be something good go solar on the hunt because that's my reason in late game to not pick up like a gold vault if i don't have energy but it's like 120. yeah it gives you a lot i always forget too do you have any extra um you the most main chance um drop yourself yes please i have a med actually come on oh just no that's swimming just fine oh my gosh nice thank you just blew your mind thank you i was wild wait where are we going all solar right yeah you can tell the road oh there's somebody right here they can just respawn them here we'll come back yep jump hit fire spitfire is great and it's very snazzy sounding too yeah say that say that five times fast hit five speed hit five speeds right here i made it to two oh god i'm flying right on these guys uh oh i'm flying this guy are you running off 74 on one of them thank god i've got a charge rifle i'm doing spitfire charge rifle because this spitfire close range i'm just keep firing it and everybody's going um i am going to do oh i have my my hip fire load up finally nice i'm going to put my purple armor in the thing because i'm not going to use one of my only bats on it wow look at your package coming in no it's worth it though i've only got a one times my charge so if you see a spare decent site three times maybe a two times bruiser i will let you know get rid of watson fence uh playstation uh yes but i'm putting this in first okay and catch up with the rope oh he's beyond one shot uh you're welcome the spitfire is literally the best in the game i don't know if you know this i'm not lying um no it all right yeah is far the best my loadout is uh oh my god my loadout is so what your bag miranda you're worse than me for that and i'm getting the biggest load of sneakers i don't get it you're definitely worse than me eyes are open though um yes you just dropped like 4 000 syringes come on come on i don't have
