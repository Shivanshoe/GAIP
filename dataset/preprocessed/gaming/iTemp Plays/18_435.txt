hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are playing lifeline because lifeline is undergoing some major changes again in season 9. if you aren't aware they are removing the shield on the dock revive they're also increasing the rate of healing on her drone by 60 and they are buffing the loot rewards in her care package a substantial amount but i'm actually kind of sad uh i've said for a while now that i thought lifeline's current revive system is broken and i stand by that but the last time i mentioned this i was flamed by lifeline mains and i can sort of understand why to be honest her kit isn't good outside of the revive it is the only thing she has to offer her team however what i didn't mention last time is that i also wanted birth to the rest of her kit to make her more of a balanced legend at the moment all she is good for is reviving and if she goes down first in a fight she hasn't contributed anything at all to her team she needs to be able to have more options to be useful for her squad and she needs to have low profile removed now if i was in charge of making changes to lifeline in season 9 i'd have added a cooldown on her afk revive per teammate because i do like how good the revive is he definitely should be stronger than gibby's or mirages or even caustic to be honest with you i'd have buffed up the healing drone and made it so you can move it around again behind cover i don't know why they even remove that to be to begin with and i'd have completely reworked her ultimate ability no one needs two shield cells in the third ring by the time you get her ultimate you are almost fully kitted most of the time they play tested what i believe to be a potential lifeline ultimate in the dummies big day out last year which was a huge area of effect full hill which affected both teammates and enemies and i loved this because it took timing and it took skill to use effectively but it had the potential to be an amazing ultimate for lifeline i really like the idea behind it so all you lifeline mains out there i am on your side i want lifeline to be a viable legend again i just think that part of the journey to get her there also includes nothing her front revive system but also to give her way bigger buffs than her nerf in other areas let me know what you guys think about these lifeline changes and i will see you all in five and a half seconds with some lifeline gameplay my friends so you can plan your landing around there and get a gun someone said i'm gonna help can't move these guys just swapped three times dude this dude actually just swapped three armors on me i'm so triggered i'm trying to stop the race the top for you thank you oh my god she had 200 energy how does someone get 250 energy to start the game what a hero um i just have an rd and that's it um do you have a shotgun ball i just found a level one but oh there you go i don't have a helmet i've just realized but apart from that yes i'm good to go see it's riding over here they're driving oh please come back stop for loot or something oh there's a crap here anyway it's a skull piece i don't know which one it is one on the right the one that's going inside him pushing i keep getting suppressed i can't put my drone down another mirage i'm down here oh my god he hit me for 130. so watching this back uh i thought i wasn't silenced anymore so i started the revive a second time turns out i was but then the effects faded and i thought i still must be silent so i thought okay i've got to rush this guy and then he hits me for 129 with a triple take headshot i went back and this is the exact frame i started the second revive 0.1 seconds left on the silence unbelievable how unlucky is that timing anyway i i was raging i got a second game here for you don't go upstairs don't go upstairs okay oh wait i was actually i was trying to i was actually gonna go i was trying to like reverse you know do some reverse psychology hopefully you just ran straight up i would if i if i could have i would have you you could have been to michael scott explaining reverse psychology that big scrap now see here's the see here's how it works i think he's janky's swap right and he's like wow look at the craftsmanship on this and then meredith takes it open gloves it's so good i down someone where are there i can't even find anybody all i have is are you know you take them off one by myself man no i don't want it i don't want it this goes like i it's got like eight armor switches i'm over here what you are with me oh there's no way this dude was unconscious any vaults um i dropped an re oh huge mate thanks it comes we'll rest right through our first race my dunk go east i can't use my tactics oh yeah you invented that listen well i invented that my tactic everyone say flesh thank you good there are no vaults but so much energy uh i have 166 damage and four kills nice 40 damage per kill 1.5 are we on new york service yes i believe so i'm on the 100 ping so hmm all right that explains it i um i have zero shields by the way uh okay hold on hold on here i have four cells one bat so you take all the cells i'll keep that oh i mean oh god i'll keep i'll kicks out okay okay [Music] this one's yours you would use this one right i remember who died thank you you know the team here right huh yeah respect it two bats oh okay well we played that perfectly we are just a pair of tactical geniuses yeah i gotta like throw half the time with loba because you just get she's just terrible um that is the problem when i when i play the other i find that as well i'm mac broken that's my bed i always go the long way around and then you get like double teams it's my bad i'm just i'm apparently going for a record of uh going down when you got lost on that team why would you heal i have seven kills and 900 damage okay um i have three and twelve hundred yeah yeah yeah why didn't this happen in the damage race i'm in the kill race because i played strategic and smart like a strategic genius and then when i play like this i just play like an absolute psycho and then i get i wonder why i die i'm like oh what how like an idiot makes sense yeah that's my life everyone has energy and no one has a vault they won't even have an energy gun they'll just be carrying 60 energy you know they're preparing you to get the ball yeah i know i did the same coming down i don't know oh he's driving towards me don't you thirst don't you thirst for those damage don't you do it don't you do it first thing for strategic reasons also got a lot of damage from that first doesn't count i don't know how many how anybody uses that i can't use the two time about anything yeah i can use it in the author of one with anvils yeah that's just my sense oh oh oh oh god oh god i don't have my i don't have the boost i don't have the beast i don't have a beast okay who else who lost the race only so i crashed the final hurdle i mean i don't know what that changes i still lost but still i'm at your driver only because my driving was bad it wasn't fair you were better driving than i was thank you for clarifying they're going right everyone yeah that's the real one literally i'm the full sending i hate every single bullet every single bullet every single day let's explore this way do you rap all the way around no he's in here james i can't take credit for that that was definitely a storm and almost advanced always so much so much one he's just great he's so weak i was thirsty to everyone mid-fight i didn't have 196 to that rife come on man i just blew in and just one tapped her with eva so you did four times then you thirsted for another hundreds that one kill yeah we got 104 i'm killing and then i thirsted that i thirsted that lobo mid fight yeah thanks mate i've got three revives it revives a thousand damage each i dropped to 5k uh i mean all right i'll give
