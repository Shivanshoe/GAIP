hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and another day another high damage game here i don't know what's happening i'm on a bit of a roll uh but i'm playing a legend who is just so incredible in the late game it is of course course deep i'm gonna delay the inevitable here he's the only one who can completely lock down a whole area by himself and we would not have won this game without caustic in the final circle also let me know if my fused teammate sounded like fuse because i think he did he was a great guy i hope you enjoyed the video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends [Music] this guy's got purple though but if they're getting beaten up again being up i'm farming just trying to level my arm up a little bit let's see let's get here shields are recharging i need to ultimately oh my god where did you come from where did he go i'm coming oh throwing frag i would have popped the uh faintest kid but i didn't know if i had enough time or not it's too much of a commitment stay up i'm just healing you are fortunate we are on the same team where did the path go there he it's always interesting when the pros were involved good grief next i'm gonna bear sniper ammo here oh did i miss that i can use that just run as i'm corsic with a charge rifle if that's not the definition of toxicity then i don't know what is to be honest i really don't i hear a lot of things going on in the distance but i just don't know what they are who's behind blue fuse come on fuse let's go mess them up they're behind this oh my god it's going to say ages we should probably challenge from the right then we get high ground rather than coming in from the water gonna take a little bit longer definitely worth i suggest we just come from the right we challenge from high ground that way it's just like water it's terrible [Applause] this one the charge rifle is just so fun like it's actually really fun oh if i had one last shot i would have missed every single one of them so now we need to be careful the whole gang coming this way or what's going on they're walking damaged we're trying to stand here to keep an eye on them they're coming here there we go it's too many streams away so i just wanted him out of here this is tricky though because it's a team down low it's nicely there you go that's what i like i knew that was gonna be big damage if we could get him to walk through like the mother lode it's like an extra 40 or 50 damage or something it's crazy the damage difference if you have to walk through afterwards this guy's got red well played from the gang there though that's a nice little uh combination oh i shouldn't use my last medkit on that that was stupid it was barely anything as well heavy ammo here is the sniper energy and heavy let's take that vault why is it not picking up his stupid mag turbo charger oh they're firing down here again thanks i mean this is away from the safe zone 40 seconds we should conduct the ring if we come from this way we have high ground on them otherwise we get stuck and they keep us they're firing something but it could have just been spied as i don't know celebratory shots you know because nothing's happened since i'm looking for sniper ammo get this guy out of here reloading oh don't fall oh god we'll have to wait i don't want the valkyries on uh she's not up there anymore she dropped down low there's a horizon knife myself [Music] friends i don't think there is a respawn annoyingly no you had heat shields unfortunately we'll get you back yeah thanks i am and sometimes it'd be like that oh my god i just took an extra 10 damage from that third ring hurts man we could respawn here i think it's our best play it's gonna get the zone first hey teammates coming back got a lot of damage unfortunately couldn't find any sniper rammer that's okay like i should switch these over now flat lines my close range not bad that's not at all let's play from range this is tough it's ending around here we don't really want to fight the people at top to be honest sneaker on the side maybe are they safe is that safe yeah they're safe those care packages likely i've noted your appreciation spotted this is a tough spot firing so let's go three times long by though so honestly could do so much work yeah that's the problem team on the on the right side too we've got nowhere to lock down underneath maybe no i went over the top there's another team shooting us in the side so just tricky they're safe still on the on the side of it but they're gonna keep gibby bubbling i guess they're gonna have to drop eventually we have to hop they're going to have to hop if they keep getting sniped in the side like this they're going to have to hop come on look at the team coming that way too after this way too i have a subject in view team kind of behind us on the hill may this team has to die they're gonna have to drop come on there's a team that way too everyone in the lobby is waiting for this one team to drop oh we're gonna get pinched bad oh this isn't that good shields great the ring is closed less than a minute what the heck's going on man yeah we need to be careful of that team too i'm just going to try and get a lot to say these guys gonna have to drop yeah that is a bit of a problem this team had to drop everyone mess them up i want to push up so bad but i'm going to get in the back guaranteed gas trap deployed let's move to this sector have to push through that i think what is this end game oh they actually threw it that was smart how does this team have blue armor and a scouts um this is such a tough spot man this is a full-on ranked game this team has to push off the hill fairly soon i've got 20 seconds i shouldn't wait oh no i've got a decent ammo oh god i'm tanking this all that bad stay here this is the power spot they have to come off that oh god i gotta try and be careful uh now [Music] oh my god i thought the fuse got down by the lifeline up there that's why i turned around oh my god well played guys well played oh man i like to work for that good great apex champions i enjoy my team though i enjoyed my teammates company that was a really fun game did i get nerdy for oh my god come on come on dude what the that is that is the first almost 4k damn it dude gg though man that was great have you gotten 4k before nah not on uh non-caustic no ah what a great guy he's he kind of sounded like fuse was he australian i didn't even have 3k before that game but i did have 75 revives
