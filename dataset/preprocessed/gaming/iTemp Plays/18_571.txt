hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and what you're watching in the background here is the recovered file of my 4 000 damage game on horizon uh i say 4000 damage it was actually 3983 17 short of the 4k damage badge on the news legend on the game one bullet from my flatline would have done it now i know that the gameplay in the background here is slightly jarring unfortunately when you're recording an mp4 file they need to be manually ended and then your pc ties the data into a pretty little mp4 file if it's interrupted before it ends for example if your pc freezes which is what happens to me here then you're struggling i had to go full hackerman mode to salvage the clip and this is what came out of it if it is too much there will be a timestamp in the description uh which will take you to the start of the regular game for you that i have which is a 3 000 damage game on horizon which was actually the game right before the one that you're watching at the moment i got just under 7 000 damage in these two games that i played on horizon i was having a belter now this would have been my second 4k badge on pc i got one on octane a few weeks ago and the reason that you never saw that game was because i wasn't recording and we didn't even win the game at the end either i was playing so far for that game as well but he was just starting out mouse and keyboard so he played more defensively the game was a bit more stretched out and i think i did about 4020 damage or something so at least i have one fancy badge on pc they're not easy to get nowadays now it's not often i sit down and talk to you guys over gameplay for any decent length of time but i just wanted you guys to see the clips here and show you my pain of how close i've got so let's take this opportunity let's start a discussion in the comments of this video the age-old season 7 question what is better the r99 or the vault for me personally i would have to go for the fault on olympus i would take the r301 over the 99 as it's more versatile but onwards edge into scrapital city itself there are few guns as scary as the 99 now at this point in the game we lost a little bit of time as you can see it didn't really go to plan when we were trying to rotate to the safe zone here because we were getting the gate kept on the edge of the zone not just by this team inside the cave but they were also being fired up by another team that was sat on a rooftop just inside of skyhook there was looking inside the cave so i had to get the banners had to wrap around get the respawns in but after we came back after the team was back in action uh we managed the third part of the final two teams we outputted a lot of damage i ended this game on 17 kills it definitely could have been a 20 bomb as well by the way with the amount of damage that we were outputting and i will show you the final screen here in a second when the final person goes down 3983 damage it was an absolute calamity we got so close to my friends but thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds with today's gameplay my friends landed on a hammock me mate oh there's a fight over this way too i can take it to the top of that building i'm just gonna look for some anonymously shape yeah i'm just gonna get some more real quick all right i'm going up top head down low uh all right okay this guy's literally scaling up [Applause] oh god oh god take time got one guy got this building they are dead nice oh this one disappeared were you going to the shop yeah i'm sorry any turbos no i don't find any turbos anymore it's just so hard to find i really are here's something what's that yep that is an alts i don't know let's do it in here horizon one okay she's literally them oh god mate everyone chill out okay you're the best player ever perfect respawn beacon here all right there's a few things to live here uh obviously there's a guy in here that i killed as well i have two shield cells oh god i will be there shortly i missed everything no how do i miss those bursts recharging another team i'm backing up if i can they're both broken over there i'm running away can i have no i have two shield cells they're all on me like two shield cells i have no shields i have syringes i have some syringes for you that's it oh my gosh to get a teammate i'm gonna pop my old in a second it might be visible i'll get hit i'm dead but he's visible he's visible on the way oh there's no shotgun ball this has been the messiest game i've played in a long time yeah this is just indeed a mess shield's recharging these guys are fun for so long yeah there was a team up here on construction and i i i would assume that they dropped down there's a lower awesome up there i'm going to use my ability they've got fences it's your defense oh thank you i'm going to ultimate keep switching guns just go in the light don't you uh if i run out of ammo i'll come back to look for it i'm out of many talents so i'll use any gun in the game i've no idea what these last two squads were this is like we've been fighting here the entire game we moved like between three buildings that's it i've just been struggling the entire time i hear him oh they're all on the train tracks getting cracked down i'm diving on that oh this way oh here we go again behind him and slightly nice or played here i'm sure this one's cracked good grief what a game mate what a game yeah that was a good game for you yeah i mean we moved that was a one continuous fight from the start and we moved maybe 30 meters only to find the last two teams yeah i spent like 90 of my game just looking for lose which was fun oh i don't think i have a 3k badge on horizon that would have been nice should i should have thirsted some the gibby at the end or something very close very close
