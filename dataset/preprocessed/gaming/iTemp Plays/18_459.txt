hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i don't know if you guys know this or not but loba is completely broken three times in the second game that i have for you today i was let down by the bracelets it just doesn't work half the time she wags her finger at you saying no you may not teleport five feet in front of you and respawn need to do something about it i remember them saying how difficult it was for them to fix on world's edge so maybe they can just rework her ability completely from the ground up she can still be a mobile legend without having the exact bracelet mechanic that she has now and it may be the way to make her a viable legend that actually works now so far had the genius idea of making it similar to a reaper teleport from overwatch where you're still in an animation when you start and end the ability but it's far simpler and you aren't vulnerable whilst your bracelet is flying through the air and i'd love to hear if you guys have any suggestions for this because loba has such amazing potential on apex but she's in such a bad spot at the moment so thank you for watching i do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends putting you in the grinder nice i don't have an armor [Applause] this team's pushing me uh i'm gonna come to 28 grain they found each other yeah i have no i'll all resin there's a there's a shield i'm gonna grab these shields oh my god that's another team oh they they playing through the team flanks as well yeah they're the other teams down the bangalore i have literally only have an ebay my what's there two two one two on this side okay this one's present here too so [Music] you're by yourself honestly times i need a do you have your health drone yeah i'm putting it back here 45 seconds until the ring closes we've got a hike and i'm in palms so let's go oh they just respawn someone can't help huge i have nothing [Music] unless there's another rapper but i'm pretty sure rapper just res this this uh person that i killed setting up over here i'm just trying to lose a little bit all right i've got a kill for something someone somewhere now i'm coming over oh it works oh my god mate what what to start that was that was fun dude that was insane we're getting pushed from both sides the entire time i don't know we were both just like we weren't helping each other farming both sides was great we had to like yeah we had to just cover a side age pretty much i think it was freaking out because he kept getting bored dude he went down like at least five times i feel so bad i don't think he had anything because i was struggling too and no i would res him and then he would peak a corner and he would instantly get someone with a turbo devo get rocked up as well oh man that was fun i killed unreal no how many how much damage you have uh fourteen hundred and sixty nice i have six kills in fourteen hundred oh i start i think this dude he took the car and dipped yeah he just ran off or drove off hey i've got another kill who was that i've no clue nine kills boomer jokes any any of the na1 there's either extremely cringe or they're great like they're gold yes i would prefer those one many good ones that 50 feet is way better it's kind of like how vine was yes and i have a gun please triple think it is gonna triple take some people i haven't used the g7 escape for like three years ever since remember you stopped using it when you finally realized that you were using the worst settings known to man i had to use the g7 to like actually put damage out it was kind of crazy but you're good with it now i mean even now you're still good with it yeah it's not bad it's a good gun to be uh to be solid with it is r99 here i think i see a blue armor right here this entire team has wingman's i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm good team oh my stands i see ya [Music] that's usually how it works yes essentially all right well good work out there aren't you sweet thank you it's your close one i almost died do you appreciate the safe shopping you got you got me good don't worry uh i just picked up my third one you've got good taste crossing jump drive no waste of my time i mean you're right behind me aren't you no i stood up there waiting for my next thing i loved it on the floor just a regular old floor constantly are they up top still yeah they are oh there's like eight teams here what's going on they're both on me like how do i get right here i'll get to you guys nice where's i don't know how they knew where i was i was in that little spot where you first dropped oh yeah in that crevice yeah they just they just knew that was crazy what happens mate look at that for another save by big item patron you know i i've been needing it in the door so you guys can't use my ultimate treasure back here yeah well enjoy your treasure pack mama's extended light mag here level four only the best for my friends using a phoenix hey all right i have five backs let me know if you need some um i have three i'm i'm chilling okay libra is literally only good for ultimate i can't believe the one that just got cancelled it's going to test the legendary without attacking what i can't see that's not true even if it works every time it's still awful yeah it's still not terrible there's a delay when you first throw it and then there's a delay in the air and then there's a delay when you land and you're vulnerable the entire time so you're vulnerable for like five six seconds yeah it's only good okay crack three i just they're they're my other both crack i think everyone i'm so bad dude i am just i'm like the police right now any disturbances i'm rocking up you are taking all of the heat you know and i'm usually i'm blasting recharging my shield i really wish there was fast heels in here oh no i think i need to keep picking them up so when i see them i don't pick them up and then when i need them i don't have them yeah i think that teleport's a good idea no no it's just a care pack yeah i um i think that that would be the way to fix it keep the same um keep the same delay at the beginning when you go into it and then the same delay when you come out of it but then you're not vulnerable when you're in the middle of it yeah which is kind of the issue because you can't like you're just vulnerable the entire time and it provides it provides you no advantage because it's loud everyone sees where it goes there's a massive delay like there's just absolutely no advantage to using our technology it is bad i don't understand they want it to be like you have to think about it and there are yeah you know certain times very specific times it's useful like if you're behind cover getting shot at i can just go behind and oh someone just flew from that way i see someone over there look around the mountain yeah there's there are some scenarios that it works but see it just it just never works no even getting high physically in high ground is tough with this see if this one works no i can't i think i broke the game yep i think he did oh they're fighting as well no no no don't worry i can get there really quick activating jump drive does it work for the work yes dude like 50 uh work great you play lower enough you'll get to know every little square on this on this map and where you kind of can't throw it yeah there's only about four pieces that actually work i've already found one of them yeah you know you just gotta search for the other three yep out of a billion i don't even think they were fighting i think they were just shooting stuff oh yeah i think you're right oh there's a enemy trial i think it landed up top uh i'm gonna go check imagine if i could just lobe up there there we go over here wow i was gonna go that way too i don't know why i did it i would just do a massive circle yeah next to you i mean i was following you guys dude oh there you go oh here we go oh oh they're all standing there rev are they revved no i don't think so there's still someone up top i think okay this is not where i wanted to be like at all i was trying to get on the roof right here right here i see him trusting but i can't see her from this angle just jumping down on you guys let's do the team i'm scared i'm nervous inside the issue all right all right right here left i fried one of them okay i only have a child in the back oh they're right they're right i think this was one oh it was literally right here nice well i did everything at the end i did nothing the whole game until then i was nervous because i was in the storm and i knew the team was behind me so i was taking angles i was too scared to commit to anything i don't know what the team was doing they just hung back the entire time yeah they all had snipers and they were just they're little bobbers
