hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are actually playing horizon who is getting a relatively big buff in season 10. i don't know about you guys but i've barely seen this legend in season 9 not only was her ability nerfed tremendously but they also nerfed the cooldown on her ultimate a few times i quite liked the changes in season nine though because season eight was just horizon central she was so powerful especially in the hands of capable mouse and keyboard players and it was difficult to counter her as a pc controller player however horizon mains can rejoice now because in just a week's time they will be flying through the air once more i spoke about this briefly yesterday but these are the notes written on gamespot about horizon horizon's ability to maneuver while in the air on her gravity lift is adjusting to be close to how it was in season seven prior to her substantial nurse in the following seasons it's not a total reverb though i'm gonna get destroyed by some crazy medicine keyboard horizon mains that's what i'm reading here but it's nice to see a meta mix up once again let me know what you guys think about this change and if you will be testing karav's again when the new season drops thank you for watching today's video i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh god we're playing oh yeah we are you like that video that i tagged you in yesterday the d-tap shaving oh my god uh no that's toxic whoa whoa i'm telling you super toxic i'm telling zeus it's going to be his nose zeus knows he's toxic it's going to beat you up and i'll pay to see that i'll be honest oh yeah yeah i'd like to watch any any fight between the apex movies any members start to play too i should be hilarious that would be great this organized a big boxing event that'd be great i mean you're in your own uh division because you're like six eight and like 140 pounds so yeah we can find anyone that's uh that's a relative to that i have to fight the slender man it's me punching a willow i'm not doing anything but i am tap shaking like a little dude so you come around the corner there ready to scrap it's flying you were ready to scrap me i saw that those people there they're done for should be one guy left oh oh that is beautiful nice i can't even look up i can't even see that really oh here oh okay i'm hoping it's cracked i'm blocking blocking shots blocking shots thanks man i appreciate that it's moving cover moving cover it's going up how did you just push me i'm so far inside yeah good i wasn't paying attention uh on the wall yeah that's convenient i was spamming the um figures i spamming the voice lines if you can tell me i've been i'm skipping so bad [Music] jesus i broke them this could be this could be dangerous yeah that was dangerous that's right oh they were a good team though so i don't mind absolutely one one way this guy it's five out of six headshots he fires six shots from r3 and did 109 damage i had that one no i cursed with the beans mate you know we've got the proper stuff you guys are known for your beans what kind of beans like mate we've got every kind of bean it was american known for i think we're known for just putting cheese on literally every single possible thing yeah and it's not cheese it's not cheese it's plastic your cheese is plastic that's awful don't don't say your cheese i eat organic i eat grass-fed i eat organic grass-fed trees you eat grass-fed trees i don't even eat dairy oh nah no do i well actually yes i do i've actually stopped with dairy like over the past couple months that's good i wish i could i just like cheese yeah i love cheese too but i've yeah try cooking i am not with you because i am a mess okay at all are you you weren't even trying to be with me no i got into another fight don't worry 40 bucks i don't know how they were shooting me when you're right there yeah she's pretty weak oh how do you go that far what i need that loot i nearly just took that guy out magic land on his head and killed him i have is this is such a stupid gun broken hello amigo may actually clap me what the heck do you need some bats i have three i have three okay am i using that because why not i need heavy so desperately uh i have 40. sorry i'm gonna switch my flatline to the vault and i'm not i'm not using it okay oh my god this gun is ridiculous i don't know if you're aware ah yeah it's pretty dumb it's dumb gun shooting in the game broken uh scrap what we came from yeah yeah they're uh in the middle oh yeah huge ultimate from me massive actually like yeah i think it my way yeah on the other side this guy's so lucky hello one's still out he's not too bad when they just get up you know when they throw an ox i need you and then you make that decision to run at them and then then you're in their face and then you regret your decision do you ever do that oh no wait a minute hold up what wait look at look come here come here look at the watch okay i'm i'm in the i'm in the inventory of the box yeah i'm actually in it right now and then look at me look at my body oh you tap straight looted you just tap straight fluted yeah yeah i just started when it like i'm in the box and then i click it and it'll it'll just move it for me how do you do that thing while you walk the same time oh that's just the auto spray one like you just keep your stick i don't know if it works without auto sprint but i just keep my stick push forward and then while i'm holding square and then i just like loot while you're like in the running path until you run out of like the little uh radius of it that's weird because i i do every now and again by accident and i don't use water screen it's weird yeah so then i yeah and people tell me i thought it was like only an auto sprint theme but i've had people tell me that they do it without auto sprint so i think it's just something that you can do you just have to keep i think you just have to keep your stick forward while you're uh like starting the uh like uh pressing square i see a holding square all right well i'm on nine kills sorry i'm an eight kills i can't read wow yeah well okay nice yes i i think it was yesterday's video or maybe it's a game player edited i said i've got 87 damage 96. wow so imagine i don't know why i'm just lying to you like that imagine going to school for a math i'm suing him that's just the end of my statement it's no fallout you ever used anything you've learned in math in your everyday life like and i like like a uni not just like oh no no no no no none of it uni was like just like calculus and matrixes what were you what were you going what did you plan on doing with that um i didn't really have a plan i just knew that going to uni for a stem degree was a good idea like if i was gonna go so you just decided one day like i'm just gonna go to school for math with no actual like i'm gonna like you didn't want to be like a math teacher like no i just wanted to go to school for math well i just knew it was i knew it was difficult but i knew it was like a good job like good job prospects even yeah ah impressive has more people here he is oh come on and that was the last one on me i'm with you i'm down here recharging attacks up in six seconds if necessary yeah three i fell oh my god okay oh no oh my god i'm literally the worst can you escape i done one the other one's probably gonna drop one i'm the worst teammate how do i fall off there i don't know how you fall off there but i mean that doesn't mean you're a bad demon i tried to yeah but then you're getting destroyed by two people i have to take the stairs i like when i'm it's only when i die that i'll blame it on you yeah i mean that's fair enough last two squadrons what uh what kills they got how many cause then uh 10 stuff and stuff i think i took a lot of kills i'm sorry no you definitely didn't i've got good kill to damage ratios yeah i got 2 300 average so that's not are you on 11 yeah oh that's yeah that's perfect i want 2 2000 i have 10. just about 200 damage a kill for each of us pretty much yeah i did try and fire something from that quarterback goldberg i saw you and you emptied uh an entire mag into that yeah i know i should have been healing shouldn't i i just opened this bottle my favorite criber it's always possible it's over here i think he was ads in the crater i mean for 18 i think it might just be him terrified he's free oh my god he's slamming i can't blame him there's two of us one of him yeah oh we're gonna die to the frogs this is a good place yeah i got a three times on so when he straight to the left with his octane sim i'd literally literally couldn't keep up i see him carefully hit me twice so many times oh i needed a decent oh simultaneous finishes let's go let's go nice i didn't realize the last team i said it was last name oh i didn't hear you i was made by my gunshot wound you are the apex champions nice nice that was a good one that was a good game that was like four hours um yeah
