hey was a cottage which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more ATX legends of corpse and today I've got another double whammy for you so once the first game ends stick around because there is a second one so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you warm in five and a half seconds my friends alright swamp Patty's again for the 23rd time today and I am praying that someone lands fear but suppose of you it's not looking likely because no one's landed here today at all which is frustrating because I've been waiting to say a strike relate wait cancel of course fantastic I'm going to say some sort of stupid shrek related get out of my swamp drunk I mean I'm not even attracted biggest fan I don't think that's as good as people think it is okay I'm gonna come out right right why in sight it's it's decent thanks but I wouldn't be watching he's what I'm saying so maybe there's the gamelan quote get out my swamp extends slowpoke level two there we go had a chance to see tremendous beautiful ice off my hemlock tea I would like to say this opportunity to apologize to Trek himself if you are watching I think you're great I'm or live is that humongous crap at the Wraith portal of doom as always this is why I've Londoner Swamp is good it's good and it's bad because by the time you get here there's so if that's what we six in that bad we can get a few people here potentially who's kicking off recharging shields [Music] our Thule Authority Armas which they thanks very much very much appreciated that this is why this one is a good drop because there is such a good look at the race portal I mean this isn't going on for much longer but it's good to know it's good to know that it's working out I'm good I've got a hemlock is single fire assault rifle of of Destiny here the greatest single fire assault rifle for the entire game I would describe eyes on number hour left after being bent that's nonononono hemlock this wants a single fire oh no no it's nine okay someone girl I've got to get one of these I'm happy I just wanted to arm a switch off the lifeline I mean I know there's gold arm here the course kept going on I'm not gonna take I'm not gonna be intrigued I barely hit the caustic I did a lot of damage to the lifeline so I don't talk to that taking this meat wagon he's having one hell of a day I was thinking that Bangalore one hit one hell of a day that meat wagon can't believe it's look got hurt yeah it's a bit of a problem 21 people left I mean 18 others people I mean Kings opinion is a lot smaller and then walls edge however so people do die a lot sooner in these games that's something I've all say something lated but this is somewhere that people would potentially fly awning supposing bodies rotate around ER this way I think is it it comes to in the third drop ship at the moment comes from the east anyway so maybe pushing more towards the east here or give us more people to shoot at that's the drink that's the current dream at least we'll see if it actually materializes into anything I can't believe it signs of life here a diving board right here this guy is a bit separated from his team I think he's gone a bit of an adventure okay that's next week I've won just come off in my tent stay down low doesn't sound like they have though how do you think that was gonna happen and we've all came up top oh yeah yeah he's runnin off he's run off into the sunset friends that should be a pinion that should definitely be pink anyone know where he's gone let's explore it this way anyone got answers on a postcard if you know where this man has gone we've all been bamboozled by the looks of it I mean if he's behind us the storm will drink you'll get mad at my quarterly storm ball pushing towards us but if he's ran this by already I don't think we've really so much of a chance of cash up to because we are way far behind this is when blood Helms would be real good to play my tremendous we lost him fantastic I want three kill and there is 11 people left all right two squads left there was a scrap down this way it isn't in the safe zone and I think they would know that I would assume goodness knows this is the team that we just chased down for half an hour but I guess I guess we'll never know does anyone know where the scrap was I mean you can hear shots of citizens from so far and they seem a of triskin down here somewhere I'm helping that's cavitation for the Bangalore all tea destroys my ankles unfortunately no robe ankles all right that man is fine kocchi squeeze unbelievable fortunately nothing this is overpowered me that's why renders you've got the other one - all right nice daddies daddy's all right imagine trying to run away from a pathfinder not like it said dumb thing today I think they had to but I mean it's just it's just unfortunate it's what I'm trying to say it's not a fun time no no Pat find its begin we all right let's go and find the last team hopefully it's a team of three and then two of them die and then they root spawn them and then I get war five kills because the kills are I'm not a fan well apologies I've done if you can hear when white Cassidy's trying to break into my cupboard she's heard means you stop that's good this is also where I meant to purge the two spectators watching this is all I wanted to do okay so joke's on you if you thought I didn't I'd no idea this place was called interstellar relay named after the world's greatest movie if you're curious interstellar of course to be a man is a nice name oh that's tough so satisfying about a single file I'm telling you two times bruiser well I've opened up to care packages and if these guys aren't pushing I'm very tempted don't get the spoils of this care package as well don't waste time I mean if it's a good and I'm not gonna change out my loadout and I only need 44 more damage to get red shields here so okay go get him I'm gonna be missed I'm scared okay every tickle them have they been tickled Oh one clicked invokes our loot new kill Leah I wasn't the killer this to the end these games on Kings Canyon feel like half a game our bill nice you know I feel like if this was Wars edge I'd have had six kills 1500 damage but then it would have been like you know 15 to 20 people left in the end of the game you can you can get yourself a bunch of kills a bunch of damage but the games end so quick here not route 14 minutes we just can't find him though that's the shape still bit I winter win [Music] airbase cities me amigos and you can think that's where I've been London I have no idea it spawns a nice my beans hemlock a peacekeeper and a perfect sanitary money okay all I need now is a bit of armor and a slice I'm laughing but they wouldn't drop everything in the same place sorry as the armor I don't need to cite that much anymore because he bores got himself for a flat line should I take that I'm so bad with the with the wingmen no don't do that I'm so bad at the moment I was so bad with the Peacekeeper that's what I'm so either of those guns which is weird because those are truth best guns on the game but not in my hands I am actually I think I was voted least likely to eat someone with either of those guns which was insulting but you can't argue with you you can't argue the results I think it was I think it was very accurate you all right no NCR as expected I am gonna keep moving good advice with no insanely no a single solid there is a new kill leader William this six kills I haven't seen a soul not one suited a person I haven't even seen the evidence of okay there we go so it's at least being here the pink any caustics no I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna get pawn ready today here we go scrap though it is in the distance which is good news Thank You extended it have you Mac without your nod of got back your that's a mirage okay we're going to be careful I'm not sure of his that seasoning of time having any flank I thought it should be 1 times on this I stand by the one time listen I even in this situation I don't regret leaving the six times behind I'm so bad with the six times this is a bit of a sticky to play there we go 74 damage shot Lundy friends show language they've booked this single orbit and I haven't really used it since because I'm also alongside the wingman under peacekeeper I'm not good sniper so nice game I think they're about three guns on potentially half these now but they still try my best and I thought you can ask is that the same thing I'll take one you take two lifeline on both on to show Beach the left his teammates I mean I can't blame you they've been a 1v3 situation I need it though so bad okay you didn't let your own kill and this guy's got all the batteries Oh does it up back okay I'm actually way easier come and pick him up now stones coming I've gotta flee the scene oh good work friends I thought we were dead there absolutely no shields between us absolutely struggling don't live too long this storm missin acutely it's pretty far too primitive Elsie's Alton up top do too nice to people and they've respawn their friend but I'm not about to try and five too much in this dorm here at sacrifice a Phoenix get for this hey friends mind yo yeah I reckon we just run look how much loot could you possibly get the guy that respawned I don't know fights in the storm and then get gay capped by raised teammates I don't like the storm nowadays I'd rather just find a safe zone I'm too old for this dawn a moment attendees be sure my fine you good no shots going down that way let's read they go good hands it's someone child through here recently their lifeline is miss fat you have capable events behind that's guys fine at the moment to making corn the crossfire here three that was a train way what that doesn't even count and in fact the guy's dead the guy's already named rug the good news is I've got a bit of magnification now I still do not regret leaving the six times behind I'm telling you six times East is terrible on console-based nice and keyboard I could see it being pretty good I am honestly I should never do this ever again I'm regretting my decision here this is embarrassing please stop and a rough time oh my god tuna Roe I need some same training friends we can all get with ones a street machine man half-man half-dog machine let's gain French that means it's got only one gun that's good at close range instead seven kills that's not too bad somebody have your aunt I do not need those all right they've not gone too bad the sights are just over three times by any chance you do this is my excuse the three times in my favorite sniper scope if I had this from the start I think we would have won by name you know I'll just head over when I can't be using the one time sage 500 1 2 x variable Lord circular scope this that's a bunch of people now she sleeps she's needs that was gonna hit but she did that little slide slide maneuver [Applause] better go in mighty Knights RPG that'll do sometimes you just gotta cut off their escape route you know and that's your contribution to the good fight and that's exactly what what is just happen there thank you I've got a few assists once was late that's secure the victory let's get a win I was trying to get a piece of recon return but I can't see a gosh darn thing with us going up at the same time they've been worth it at least wouldn't be involved in the good fight I mean I don't have to get the kill credits by at least want to see them potentially shoot them maybe getting the ceased the grass shields here but level 3 level 4 and whenever Brady's classified as level 5 can y'all sell nice 19 no very nice you can see on this that beautiful there we go oh here we go people still do this people like boxing still what's wrong situation like are we dropping armor he's supposed to drop your armor right what that's winking me I got no armor even now you've got my red armor hey what what I'm not no but they're nuts there we go now we're even does anyone know does anyone know what just happened the most scuffed boxing match of all time exclaims Mercer do we know Honor I didn't realize people still did that mind you it was a 1 B 3 that was the only chance he stood so fair play 7 kills in two but he would have been 8 you know I saw I could have sprayed you with a flatline if I wanted to it should be eight wins a week thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
