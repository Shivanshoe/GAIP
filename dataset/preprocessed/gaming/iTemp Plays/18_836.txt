every suppose eat which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and in season 4 the battle past the top tier skin was a flat line this time we've had a havoc in the past we've had in our 301 in the past and now we have a flat line back think about it they've all been evolving assault rifles with the interesting thing about this gun is the iron sights on it unfortunately I have no actual satellite game plan for the intro here but you will see in the video today they are a beautiful I mean if you could choose between the iron sights and a one-time sage cog I probably still prefer to one time sage cog however when you first get into a game there are certain guns that I absolutely despise to pick up without his sights on them but spit fire comes to mind the scalp comes to mind and that the flat line is out of that list as well because it's beautiful just a beautiful iron sights I hope you enjoyed today's game if you do be sure to leave a like rating subscribe to the channel if you're newer until I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends okay we're going to the team it's the big icy pilot of doom at ease my friends they'll land him with us it looks like they're a little bit higher than we are after one down low lunge it the supply beans our friend a charged rifle as 112 damage I'm taking the flatline he's watching your friend we're not need some shields I assume it's us the last guy right we killed two of them there was definitely three people that landed here don't mind me I was gonna show up here for the next eight seconds and there was no loot anyway people have already been up here alright I'm on the way friends never mind there isn't shield no kill we'd already if I can find the last person of the squad she'll be able to match the amounts of kills the kill leader has no second I'm only got one kill I didn't even finish one of the kills surely they're gonna be back trying to get the revive off there we go ok I'm trying to get the banner shields so those situations where you don't want them to have good stuff when you're fighting them but as soon as they're like one shot you you start thinking ok it's good but you've got purple shield so now I know that I'm going to grab it for myself squat down purple shields my teammates got blue it's not too bad that's the level 2 for the rapist well then we can move on I mean half the mob is dead but it's okay we've got three kills here that's not two shafts then it's changed so your boxing boobs are there whilst you are I've got happening through the site can take the vibrations could grateful literally subdued but has it always been like this or did they change something with the loot I'm struggling to pick up individual things name but how is that the P 2020 I'm knowing neither P 2020 alright scrap in the distance and I miss ma looter unfortunately I believe the gunfights is over so it may be time for a little bit of decorative gargoyle action here there you go scraps along going it's not the best building when you you get a nice bit of high ground you can see can see scraps or 16s entirety thing just joining the fights are that close Watson show us in Seattle that's unfortunate again respite symmetry hidden either link friend oh good grief there are three people looting this just get the good stuff I can always switch back the mo after so great no I thought of a game grenade you think oh the reason I pick the flower line up at the start look at these iron sights honestly one of the best skins possibly the best iron sights they've ever released this is the tier 110 on the battle pass a lot of people when they saw motor flat line skin which is the t100 sort but I've just managed to grind all the weights at level 100 I don't think that's possible I bought it all the way up to level 100 and then you're not able to buy from 100 to 110 so they said to me that long to get those last 10 levels surprisingly quiet never mind take all them headshot last week they snob about engaging like that is they you don't have any footstep notes what you could hear was the grapple that should be tv1 friends you're good they're good just walked into it that's a stomach wonder if I've ever seen one I was absolutely no I need that Finn or fancies havoc feel free and I know we are the squad leader or sorry to kill me to get get off modern I'm trying to make a video about the iron sights here it's a my nature to pick up the one time sage pocket bone it's the it's the best sigh on the game it's gonna take a lot for me not to pick that one up I'm starts to good our friends it's time to wait for our next scrap you know what that means decorative gargoyle dgt as it's more commonly known in the industry I absolutely nobody see us again a lifeline package these when you need a keen eye something I'm not really known for in this game as soon as I miss all the loot that's the lifeline package being called in but I have no idea where there is a friend he was coming for D G T's well spreading across the nation let me ask you absolutely nothing is happening penis crafts or something about games over the last few days where every single gun fires happening scraps or city but apparently this is not one of those games I was expecting it to be popping off but it is not all right well the Lifeline package was called in in this direction that's all I know Betty natural care package is a natural care package may but may bunk game confused may be used as this how can your face but I'm gonna get my devotion a care package first or Kramer I'll take a Craver so there's a couple flat annoyance teasing cloaks up and put it into single fire for long long range gunfights an awful bag decent for the for the lifeline though since she's already got fast revive and she gets the shield as well so you'd be coming back with a lot of health where's the fight people don't tell me off rock to plate and the fights already over so that's exactly what's happened this is a shame he was that a fine there are two teams over there he's hopped down buddy you're a maniac frenched the faint brief shake me aggression I've never seen anything like it I've got him lunchtime he's like you know what I believe myself here and I tell you why you've got a commended for that self belief nothing is impossible jump down with 12 health doesn't matter it does matter it does he didn't win the gunfight he's dead now he's back to my mommy what's that he probably thought I'm a pathfinder and I was gonna chase him down anyway he be yeah he may as well might as well give it a go so our scout for the the Luke drone think he was there before handling he must have just flown away into the sunset looks like it's time to get back to our building for a bit more decorative gargoyle action there are still four squads left I mean this is the second circle so it's sort of closing a little bit now it's around this stage in the game that if they're only fights you should be able to hear it unless it's at the very outer parts of it oh no the catback is dropping we didn't get a devotion at the first one but hopefully I'll get one out of this one I've only had I've only had one devotion in season four and I've opened 20 care packages easily easily 20 care packages think about it I already get gold armor from them achiever it's usually just like a barrel stabilizer yeah like a care package like this never mind there we go devotion let me keep the extended mag because even though this thing comes with like 200 bullets and that sounds like a lot with the devotion it's not you'll be flying through those they might have to pick up an all-nighter not from someone else what's going on here it's or even in your bed I'll quit at the syringe now may as well finish that I want to check if there's anyone up there I think we'll find I think he's just left it there is that ker a deterrent a deterrent a deterrent which is that is how you Krantz that word I think so what I call my ulti I don't see anyone the train yard Sinope topper train yard is never a bad idea there's a future point okay there we go I see him now turn out the woodwork don't know you can't hit me on nothing yes you can it's a bunch of snipers the good news is like ah positive shots what's the side doing on my gun trying to control the recoil on the devotion whilst going left to right that much is actually more difficult than I thought it's going to be usually not firing at people with that much speed you know that's not gonna breach they'll have caustic traps appear you know samwol off uno dos you have a third one than someone housing oh my god what's happened in bobbin teammates then him again can I reach this reckon oh good grief but they're scrapping my taillight should be safe I'm an idiot I should have just grappled my zip line instead of grappling too dizzy plane I think I'll be there by now my teammates safe and I've got a god bag dog so I said I think this should be fine I finished the cut on the right though I don't like train yard I've come to decide I don't like the fact that you put a silk top in these places it's it's unreal it's unbelievable he's what I use are these people scrapping it's a peacekeeper beam I just just lurking in the shadows ah be coarsely doing nail good teammates gone down for the fight the devotion is both outrageous and contagious none of that one spot left no fired then they were down low nevermind if they had a portal fantastic they're back up in the Train thinking I don't even know what they are floating platforms of doom careful Frank no trying to sneak attack in but that's not looking likely good news is it's not safe as long as my team doesn't take too much damage here we can change together I think it should be update and there's no say that it's because these guys have gotten these guys have got snipers so if they run out of ammo on their first gun they're screwed my interesting you should we have to get the revive on that guy could be dead nice uno mas and white someone self-raising papi you got back [Music] my god we killed that day because they with one SAP top with the would be caustic traps and I'd down that rice at least three times I'll run in there hit fighter with the flatline damned a foul bound graded that down drew again and then it down drew at the end there as well three separate times I had to down that rise to get the kill just shy of double digits but we got 2,300 damage that's not too bad a 17-minute wing with the tier 110 battle path skin there on the flat line it's unbeliev a bubble my friends that is my or my flat line operating there it's an unbelievable out of ten I want to give it which is pretty good if you were curious thank you for watching I do appreciate you and I'll see you all in the next one beautiful animated logo the bond you
