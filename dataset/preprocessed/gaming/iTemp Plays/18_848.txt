hey was the gods to achieve all come back soon of the video today we are playing some more apex legends of course today we got ourselves our last limited time mode it's called dummies big day no one really know what to expect from this and it's an interesting mode it's really strange what are these interesting all it tells us in the description is this game ain't gonna test itself and that sort of hinted towards some of the abilities that we are going to be testing out for the game for a future of release so all the dummies are the same they have the same passive which doesn't do anything the tactical ability which you'll see me use in the gameplays because I use it fairly often gotta gives you some more space pretty spawns randomized loot on a 33 second call that I think is the interesting part here is the ultimate or Ultimates I should say we have three different ones and when you use your ulti it's randomized one of the ultimate is a big area of effect heal everyone within that certain radius of you gets all of their health and shields back enemies and teammates by the way another ultimate is spawning in loads of loot like a big pinata and the third and final ultimate is a dance party which spawns in a load of decoys which copy the actions that you are doing and hopefully ID enough time there to show you each of the Ultimates on screen so theories surrounding this game-mode is that the healing ultimate is going to be lifelines ultimate with the addition of the loot faults and a cargo box by the time you've actually got your lifeline ultimate at the moment it's not actually that useful Gibralter received a fairly big revive both within his shield and lifeline was untouched she's actually fallen down the tier list of legends in the game because of that I think it would be the best ultimate in the game if it only healed your teammates it would be a free gun fight win the fact that it will also Hill enemies means you'll have to be a little bit more tactical with ability now I'm talking as if this is confirmed for lifeline I'd be surprised if it wasn't lifelines no Ultima in the coming weeks or months perhaps it definitely still could be for a different legend that's going to be introduced into the game future date I mean we just don't know I just think he probably lifelines ultimate though but dance party is almost certainly going to be a mirage birth they can't release another legend that has these decoys he'll make too much sense when mirage is so underwhelming lee underpowered at the moment he's been that way for a long time yes you can definitely bamboozle people here and there and it's definitely fun to play when you do confuse people but isn't considered to be a good in fact I personally order item is the worst in the game in most situations the dance party ultimate which is the one that we are testing in this game mode at the moment is really confusing to play against you'll see in one of the game plays the part off you're got to gameplay sweet today which off different Ultimates and the loot pinata ultimate is probably just connected to a future legend have been added into the game it's pretty good but generally I prefer abilities and Ultimates that have an effects in gunfights as they can swing the fight in your favor however sometimes it is despair to have a loop in your enemies and then you can win the good fight that way enough of the cheetah chatter though hopefully you guys enjoy the double gameplay that I've got few day if you did be sure to leave a like rate and subscribe to the channel if you're new around here and I'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends all right sorting factories I am the blue dummy not like that matters or change anything that's all because all the dummies are the exact same I'll be left don't we charge rifle action here I'd say what this mode is extremely quiet though because there are no voice lines look pink blue blue shield but unless someone actually looks at that they're not gonna know I'll shoot good who shot this thing yeah you better run Mini's already the best loop Hey oh he's so wrong shop are going me so much with it with the charged rifle here I'd tickle him I'm chasing stone I'm gaining with the charge rifle I've got an extremely weak I can see him he's running side the man's absolutely shook us beyond belief he kills me oh my god he's got a team here they're in here teammate I'm scared there's two of them hey hey hey we're not doing that sneak at the moment they can definitely hear us they're opening stuff up when I'm hoping I have no he lost oh good idea I'll Phoenix get nice I'll do favor away no no they did not well what can I say nice both of them getting their friends I can't reload what's this what's going on it I tried to arm a switch but them that level one armor on the ground must have nothing left he must have already armies which be quick no I knew I was gonna happen I could hear him I just survived remember this is this is just one guy we can do this getting that see might help him help him team out from nothing it is a Phoenix can something or is it just not that way there we go good god bad thought this is a complete mess here this is getting switched up and tell you how much the facts I need that back there we go see makes is one of these these syringes as well okay I've got all three kills we choose the good news the bad news is that was absolutely horrendous I will say damaged it wasn't it wasn't pretty out here so good look at that cut on one site that started with me missing all my shots on the guy up top and I'll has been at weed machine man half man half tweed machine walking around with the charged rifle if you're unaware about the Tweed machine was not they

that what don't I need oh there's a scuff going on forget it i'm getting over there honestly i don't i don't care how much your buddy i just wanna get involved okay I have my ultimate which could be the hill remember but apparently it might even heal team enemies it's getting there let's go they're in a fight they're pretty weak look obviously getting here teammates where we go in please know I'm assuming that sounds like it's a top I'm getting there I'm getting involved who shot you where's this fight oh my god this is why he's called scrapple city I think I went too far down I think means a hump or way down like that I think he's in this one is this where I was before I got your friends few shots with it with the wee man and it's not worth the risk one side already landed a few shots walking straight with the with the alternates like that was definitely the plate always down though I'm coming I'm coming I'll come in six seconds five seconds I got you know you're at the back okay hopefully my team can just bring your bats oh my God we're so close no that's been used up there oh I think I would've been out to save him man all right where can we go for this capers one left if you fuel leper hi guys absolutely straightedge isn't the one here nice job teammate the other guy shredded my teammates like weak too though he didn't use the med kit oh god that's not good don't if that's the same team or not I smothering me then unwise bothering me so much but it is there so knows I'm around the g7 scale I can't really mess with that yeah oh okay the team I just left what she's friend if you use them met keep there I think we're okay I think I'll leave these guys towards each other did you just tell everyone in the area thank you sir delighting yourself while someone's than surviving oh my god you're so angry it's what the heck is fans where's the other team scrap it salsa TV's my friends please say everyone's landing here how someone's going elsewhere it never works out well when someone else goes elsewhere never ever goes to plan but hopefully this is the one time he does we will have to find out there people are already scrapping on that site oh it did lie nearby okay I thought he went for the the three supply bins that are underneath oh my do that no it's guys as long as you have a gun to defend yourself like you should be fine you're starting run away like I don't remember to use this more often you're sure battery I'll take it for those three triple takes oh my god there you go maybe you should have landed down here I thought we should go and scrap some people name and what Tim's got two level twos this is beautiful I say we go what's he what's going over there I mean I can't really get there that quick and I'm trying my best to get over there I do need that friend wherever that may be he must have taken or something I'm here are they not they're still here definitely that's a crazy challenger what you've just done absolutely unbelievable the other guys might come down nice teammates Oh I was nervous if incoming down but I forgot that was even a thing that little oh it's like a Pirates of walkway story so ever good hey the ball not really okay that's one squad don't care can hear a scrap I'll tell you what nothing has happened for the past sort of two and a half maybe move three minutes so you know I'm getting the heck in freak over there wait no which way that is look I have to go this way anyway that's what green guy going you've got to go this way anyway when he was gonna get pushed when you sat that close to the edge of the storm or the safe zone yeah that's this way I reckon we'd it's gone fight they didn't have to push us all go through the tunnel this may be a complete waste of time but we might get ourselves a few kills here at the same time who knows my green guy he's still looting in the stock do not have enough stuff friend at this point in the game are you still struggling be honest the g7 is too good I mean I don't even have an extended mag committee absolutely rockin people like that is still someone that way teammate I mean I murdered him but I didn't murder him if you know what I mean God she'll slow ok this is such a good ultimate okay there's no way team that could be him I'd say my series vol iPhone I've got the down in that first guy I've got gold shields here some of them do or at least one of them one of them does even shame teammates ah I mean I miss too but I think we chase are you doing their friends I've not furballs for this nice was a gold shield is this guy no I'm gonna get him no he's the guy that brought two 15 minutes late when it's okay though because I've still got good shields so it's not like I'm stroking over this way we knew we had them trapped they could have backed up and gone down the that could have definitely gone down the tunnel but I've read anything they were going to and if they did we could have just chased them this genome used on this good it's a weird one it must be somewhat new oh wait he's he's legendary I think it's a legendary skin I got right four spots left I've still got my ultimate I didn't want to use there because I was too close to them and I didn't want it to be the heel one and then everyone gay gets healed up out of its fing tragic okay son around teen I don't know if we can do this my teammates are closer oh my god I'm just buying time for my teammates they're all I supposed to do here's a dance party I use the dance party so I could do let me get here so they can't see look without dropping down these drop downs drop down nice team both my team i scoff gold shield that's ruled i'm nice it was just one guy well I haven't either one nice job team but that Dan spice off helped a little bit are they're scrapping I'm getting there we need to get involved he's the last two teams I don't care if it's a low keel win I just want the win friends I've been playing this for two hours get me the heck and freak involved this has been a weird game come on the style no messing about green there was a foul shots apparently and maybe inside that's everyone it's this guy I think this is the last guy hands off the controller it better be believable scenes when playing for two hours face why you have to get the hair king trick involved when it's the last two teams alright so what what's meats have we use that game oh I only use the dance party and that night guest it was me however to be honest with you I'm not surprised to guess it was me because my other decoys must have been running back into the storm which would have made no sense 1,600 damage for five kills I'll take that I don't I think that's pretty good 1,600 damage up it was a prolonged fight against those guys in the cave dicks is no game oh thank you for watching that's who appreciate it I'm real happy I finally won now I can go and get some food I am starving good grief see what the next one mm-hm bye
