hey what's up Gossage rich welcome back to another video today we got some more apex legends of course and today's video he's on Kings Canyon I bet you weren't expecting that one I think one of the mistakes I made when they brought Kings Canyon back before when he was the night-time one is that literally landed at school turning these my friends I Pro about 95% of the time so if you enjoyed this is a bit of a mix-up I've seen war in five and half seconds my friends a repulsive tease my friends I am loving landing at the different HUD jobs here on Kings Canyon and we have all landed at the same door something I've got armor and a weapon a decent weapon too so I'll leave you to fun listen to do the fact but there are blue shields over here and enemy team apparently you up in the big door where are you going where are you optic ok alright then getting teammate I'm pretty sure him for 84 damage there you go I have to leave the blue behind I need I need to get these guys lives I've spent everything trying to get this guy to let me mix a light mac tube in fact while some here give me that as well you see man it's not even challenging us Oh trying to choke top that's two people completely shield person I feel a bit hard to buy because I've lost my blue field a friend I'm getting triple took a friend and I'll tell you what I've got absolutely nothing left there's one guy left he's got a triple tape there we go now forgive myself Samar I'm sorry get some more ammo here he had energy he had lights yeah definitely I needed see kind of bad again Heelys well I don't need to go and get my blue back now obviously I don't mind taking that I could have easily had five kills here anything other than the lstart I dumped my nail star early on in the game oh that's perfect but I can't stand it later on in the game it's such an early game weapon in my opinion I don't like feathering the trigger or like I don't know they can't use it on you if you just hold down the fire burn knowingly this overheats immediately and they did nerf it from last season's season as well I can't even claim they nerfed it because there used to be a packaged weapon and now that you can just fight on the floor imagine if you could find a mastiff on the floor kitty it would be ridiculous they'd have to know if it'll all be havoc he's definitely badly seasoned optics here yeah that sites on the game one time say [ __ ] and who knows it why is this building only got one long supply been on the top a saddle only supply bin anyone's got three that is not fair I've got a severe I'll ended a repulsor for a bit of variety and I wasn't expecting it to be this poppy not my favorite things about landing here back in the day was flinging yourself over the wall on looting watchtower safe otherwise known let's go this way as diving board of course I don't my teammates gave this quick you okay you guys come to that part I'll leave the diving board what do you mean that almost sought after attachments on the game I think I bet it is French select-fire okay do you know what I make this that select-fire havoc video and I said I should use this more often my right is being targeted I didn't realize that they actually buffed the select fire in the hammer [Applause] I still over there never judge you fried with an anvil round I'm not sure that have been any easy with a select-fire either you have to wait for it to charge up and a 5 into the sunset here friend never mind she's messing about you keep coming keep coming so that trade it's absolutely shred it there you go I'm taking the purple hope you don't mind of course 5:23 syringes I'm not sure of those of my teammates footsteps or not but it sound like though it's someone close by I would assume that it's the race teammate as well or teammates even because they miss the race than they were shooting me oh that's after my ulti I'm tempted to distress these guys 3v2 that got snipers or at least one of whom does if I could climb this hill there we go follow me up brace this is stupid okay I did most of damage she's got lessen half health there we go just toast going up I don't waste any time on that to use my own also get the top here Fogarty screaming ground how did your crank land of Thomas I've already got purple what am i doing out you friend they both had purple as well the lifeline and the Watson and also the Watson could have easily prevented that if she addressed such offenses it would been far more difficult for us to worship good news we all know the ones south top-level bond shield man yeah that's what I thought never mind you got your teammates is back on walk up one time I spent download I guess what you're joining sorry I'm you good you'll eat you said yeah any reply nice job friends I'm fine just fixing up shields as well there is something so satisfying about the light ammunition guns on this game the r99 and the r3 r1 especially when you just like absolute amana Sherman's life like that and you'll and 95% of your shots there is I don't think there's more as more satisfying good to use to kill someone so you can take that that's fine this is my kill but honestly I don't mind too much because I've been taking a lot of loot this month it's a team game you know it's a team effort havoc anyway we can't use it so when it's all gonna be too close for this but this is a good little angle first I'm helping I got you again I was the first one here I didn't see either of you the people this is what I miss about Kings Canyon though I feel like the buildings have these like the old cubby hole so you can just you know if someone's camping in a building there's holes in the roof okay down as well see ya thanks for playing stop move my kilt Josh or towels Mike you're not obviously shows that's a separate team getting Bolton nice ask that 1430 is that both both teams done for no I guess the answer that question is this is what I mean though if someone's camping in the building can you come in the building plates on the toilet to the point you can just jump in through the roof in different areas it isn't just just a doorway and like maybe a little window with some bars on I mean um but really I'm a big fan of walls edge don't get me wrong I want so much to begin with but I definitely have warmed up to eat but that is definitely something I'm mixed from Kings Canyon and there are even buildings on this map where you can peek right the way through a little hole and they've really can't see that incident a year and often eat after nation sir if any since coming back here I've absolutely demolished teams three as well right well this one squad left I've got nine kills if I had to guess I would assume they're coming this way scrap cave maybe from River Center I feel like we've taken out most of people from like propulsor even like hydro dam I get this way I feel oh we've taken over the eastern site maybe people be coming from the West scanning stuff those are just doors though there we go do they destroy yes they do destroy that's bad we need that EMP for this last one it takes about 35 seconds for a crypto drone to recharge this is bad this is not good that's what that means the good news is we're not forced into this fight if we don't want to be f-friends no son gets cut off if they if they try and rush him on here I don't want to give him foot positions today smart of them whichever team brushes through under the breech their loses because they would you see see up top and we would just see up top careful races are careful there's a good chance they're over there because we haven't seen it for a while are you in pain yes the game over Oh oh okay then that explains it I guess that explains it twenty thousand kills I mean pass bond is my main you could see my ban on the rights I've got what was he three thousand nine hundred kills or something maybe maybe was like three thousand six hundred something like that forgot already I mean two thousand four hundred damage oh that's such a shame we had such good teamwork we got a combined 19 kills I feel like we got all involved in every single kill I'm pretty sure if you looked at it creeped I would have had four kills I'm pretty like six deceased I reckon I had about six assists in there too the Wraith was obviously involved we all got above a thousand damage the teamwork was on fleek and yet it's just like two maybe even three apex predators I don't know just playing together and that's the end I'm afraid such an anti-climax but oh my god bad system looking we did all we could the teamwork was so good up into that point I think the race may be overextended a little bit but I don't think it's her fault like one of us has to be there first oh good game though hopefully you still enjoyed it you can't win them all you can't win them all I think we got played there but you can't positioned thanks for watching that I do appreciate it and I'll see you all in the next one
