no they're not in it but it was a good attempt that was a nice thing down here i don't know if i should jump off or not of course i might be dead i'll kill one more welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and a few weeks ago it was apex's third anniversary of it being created i nearly said born i guess you could say born as well but to celebrate this they've released a new mythic skin for bloodhound it cost me something like 160 to get all of the event skins which unlocked this skin and it was an evolution it was an evolving skin where if you had total damage equaling to 30 000 and then 100 000 the skin would evolve into something new the only problem with this is that within the first week this was booked and my progress got reset and then i completely forgot that i even bought this skin so now i'm trying to unlock the other tiers i was so close to unlocking the second one and it went back down to zero it's actually heartbreaking i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends towers is my new spot i don't think it is it's my spot i don't know if that's true okay these guys are just way faster than me mate i don't know the close one those dudes range oh give me a gun please i have massive economy you can hold on are they running today uh i think there's a full team in my building but there might be i'm trying to him i'm rotating okay if you want some free early kp i mean i got pretty early kp i mean nice i got a three times 30 so i'm just going to sit in the outskirts and just try and shoot him in the back you know like i know i heard it blasting uh oh dude the shadow caps are just naturally on right yeah these guys got around they are very aware yeah they know i'm coming hi purple uh one's right here on this on this place if i eat it a nice job that's got white i don't know why i'm saying 82 here by the way quite clearly 84. it's on this one over there nice i hate the octave a2 as well off white of 84 it's still 84. no no no no it's just it's just two it's one more one a lot oh my god i stalled on his head for like two seconds i'd rather be looting but if they insist taking a moment to recharge my shield i want to put his eye on this but i feel like i'm going to start missing so much better with the iron sights i love the the one time zone taking okay there's we have a replicator coming in got kind of crazy deep at this range of 30 30. yeah it's really hard so slow traveling too recharging and we need to get around to like estates yeah we can go underneath i think we got it we can we can walk in we can walk in marking our surroundings gotta be careful 78 on that bottom nice 57 but he's popping a shield for the team out of stage yeah they're firing we could just get around this bend you know yep he's so annoying top is it three i only see i only see two nice smokes i think it's bangalore bloodhound right oh no there's a fuse as well is not annoying at all i can't stand on this rock it's so annoying reloading there's like ps5 area be careful yeah everybody's kind of in their own fights right now yeah uh maybe we could wrap around and fight this team oh my god i like that it's really good enemy spangles download me oh my god don't sell pizza it could be fernando maybe it's a guy that's named nando that sells pizza no no no no way illegal impossible illegal [Applause] no no he was flying that was a good part by ash yeah it was really good opportunistic you know let's go back to below hmm estates oh there's still seven squads they wait until we shot someone else another fuse oh my god my teammate is literally standing there for half an hour it doesn't get beat incoming welcome they're not looking when we're not turning around and i'm getting beaten from the right this is crazy i don't know where that is this one over here i don't know i think it is oh taking a moment i have noble bats um i can put my i can pull my turn okay i'm gonna put it up top they don't charge for me i am taking fire i hate these guys i got a god spot i mean if other people shooting them it wouldn't be that bad oh there's no way that's crazy how does he choose to shoot us from i don't know oh god i'm sticking i'm just gonna stick it i'll pop a bat after five seconds recharging shields let's create a move i think we'll go right i think we were right yep oxygenates any cracks let's move now they're crafting down there yeah another 100. i think he's i think he's getting bats marking our surroundings he seems to have to walk out i'm not shocked let's look there because they're getting shot one's a low ground on me in this building okay crack out right on this around this door let's try that isn't that crazy how is this happening oh no hold on i need to heal anyone up for some shopping they're all fine the top uh okay these bonds keep the pressure on this way i'm going to shoot so he knows i'm chasing pushing me to you a little bit taking a moment trust in the old father before squads left me down [Applause] spawn where the heck are these people then it's got to just be some solos i need damage i need to get him get him get him reload thank you thank you thank you i don't know where i just wanted to be honest wait did nobody land here at all i don't know if they did i got it i got your hammer why are you straight for it i'm not i'm not accepting any bad trades is happening here i'll trade you this hold up oh idiot was that for me idiot i wasn't expecting that i'll be honest what is happening in this game rich while no i was looking at that for so long there's no way you've done that to me so was i i was looking for like an hour i was trading nades in my adventure for no reason just thinking you hadn't seen it i thought you've underestimated my heal-like ability to see everything i thought you were distracted by the hemlock that i've gifted to you for free even though i wanted to use it wait did you even drop it yeah it was in the triple bins wait do you want to use it no i was joking i was trying to make you feel bad i'm just running in okay oh jump drive taking fire hey don't like me let me tell you dude fair play to this guy because i did not do anything this gun fight i missed every bullet with a hammer because every time i went to shoot someone i was charging up and then i did the worst r9 spray you've ever seen if he wasn't playing with a new player probably would have killed us because i wasn't putting my weight in this good fight it happens people north i don't think you do i heard someone there wait there's another purple here i'm watching it it's too far away it's almost here 50 seconds they're running this way i'm on the hunt they loot those beans they would have taken a while to look those bins already here right in front of me spotted him before you someone over there slash reload she just got i hit her like 130 and she just sat there like she wasn't raised you stop shooting me so then i can get the kills idiot [Laughter] um i was gonna say i'm genuinely surprised that the uh the playerbase doesn't complain about the r301 i was gonna do video about everything else check me and check me out i got our through one they're shooting i'm done fine hold on marking our surroundings him our enemies what's the plan what's the deal oh no someone travelled through here marking this we have to turn around zones closing i am full recline feet up head tilted back oh i like that 30 degree angle you're scavenging right now aren't you i'm scout running right now i'm listening to music trust in the old father i'm not alone for a second i'm here i just saved you from an emp in the face here's the temp contact what a cool guy recharging questions tmp he's part of the game idiot wait was that his clan tag yeah team p i have the streamer thing on i forgot to turn it off why would you do that i mean a weird name like in a game that i was doing good in and i oh i see i don't want to deal with that people people and their dumb names yep yeah yeah always oh my god we're getting rocked up on i can't challenge him from there forget him i'm just gonna go to this gunfight and they can third us if they want i've got a ha i've got a turbo have a car 9. nope we're going to destroy these guys over here they can come over if they want to someone through here every single death nope this guy's gonna evolve some a lovely shook that's awesome that way maybe not i should have saved that really for this shouldn't i yeah we're just now they're inside fine oh where i have no idea oh here are me back to the biggest what is happening to my brain right now he's so weak kill him i can't i don't extend it no there's more but i can't figure out where they're at i'm losing my mind what's going on man i don't know i can't find anybody like my audio's it's crazy right now someone travels through here they're around here somewhere you ran this way that was for the opportunity he ran right next to him horribly i'm not carrying where's the team that we thought was gonna hurt us surely they have wanted to come through monday i think they started fighting um right right when we moved inside uh i'm not going more towards them then that's risky that's a big risk i say that i'm running straight across this uh the bridge of doom what do you know about the bridge of doom mate oh you don't want age got respawned yeah octanes 100 don't try and punch damn oh i missed attention punch big punch pick punch big punch big punch big punch no no no no no no no no hey maybe me yes thank you i mean that's not i don't like doing that to people that are kind of just like you know just having to go why did you start it then i didn't yes you did you were punching jingle no oh someone's up here i tried to super jump if i missed as expected the replicator on high first damage oh no it's so upset through here what's
