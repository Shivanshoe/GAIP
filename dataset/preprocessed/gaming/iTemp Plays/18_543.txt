this video is sponsored by ea the mid-season update is upon us my friends with it comes a new airdrop escalation takeover a new town takeover and a new heirloom all of which are featured in today's gameplays so let's start off with the heirloom this one is for gibby and it's a war club it's sensational it looks tremendous i'm sure you give mains out there are happy with this one i've already uploaded a game today with this or at least i showed me unlocking it if you are interested in that next up we have the airdrop escalation takeover this is a fun one so care packages have been buffed to the max at the start of the game many different clusters of blue care packages spawn in inside them are blue armors and two star guns such as the wingman the spitfire the havoc and the mastiff each of them comes with a level two extended mag the mastiffs is a bolt instead of course and a one times two times variable scope and as the game goes on the rarity of these care packages gets higher and higher dropping three star four star and eventually heirloom weapons and red armor the late game is crazy because there are so many care packages on the small map each with an heirloom gun in them and many of them with red armor as well it's amazing and finally we of course have to talk about pathfinder's town takeover this is a big boxing ring where your only weapons are your fists there are no guns allowed inside the arena and there is a force field of blocking any incoming fire as well it's absolute carnage it's a lot of fun i can't wait to jump back on and play more of this update thank
