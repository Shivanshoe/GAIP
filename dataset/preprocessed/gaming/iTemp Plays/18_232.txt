hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and as we all know the g7 skate was put into the care package for season 11 with increased damage and the return of double tap however respawn thought this wasn't enough for a care package going so yesterday they buffed the headshot multiplier to two and they gave it more reserve ammo as well the g7 was already my favorite gun in the game so i had to test out the newly buffed version also i've posted two call of duty videos on my second channel there's a link in the description to keep up with some of my other content over there if you're interested so thanks for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i tell a game we've been playing recently i don't know if you've ever tried it you probably haven't smite no it's like a moba but it's great because you know like league of legends there's auto attacks you click on somebody attacks them you can't miss but in smite you have to aim everything it's brutal i don't know what i'm going to my smite was like uh it reminds me of it's like what is it it's not overwatch but something else it's a moba so it's like league right right but it's kind of like it's got like heroes and all that yeah yeah yeah different characters [Laughter] nice how you land with the bow check from there i don't know it's awkward this is purple where you see 120 on them el good job what is there's a canadian huh canadian aye candidian hey oh you can take that purple dude grab the purple got the purple i got a bow yeah mine's almost purple already okay yeah you were landing i four bats sure you don't have four bats you need some uh i have two i'm good i'll drop you one i was in my adventure looking at it you know yeah he's not leaving enough you know what i'm going right back up top i'm gonna be completely honest with you i'm gonna have a little cheeky see what was going on

that i know i do that by by accident all the time but turn to another level you know yes dude i encourage that behavior you should totally do that check out this uh care package because you get so many different um weapons there did you did you hear they they actually gave the g7 a bigger buffer yeah they puffed it i think it was the headshot multiplier and something else yeah which is kind of crazy because like it was good yeah it was good anyway they increased the damage it was good on the floor and then they increased the damage by two for the care package and they're like no not enough a little bit more and the ammo which i could see that yeah yeah 100 well guess what i just got yeah you got a g7 nah didn't just kidnap did oh yes sir you're biting switch i was about to curse so far
