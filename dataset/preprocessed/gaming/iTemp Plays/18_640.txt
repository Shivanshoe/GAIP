hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing some loba for the first time since about 1987 i believe it has been a while and it got me thinking today about how i believe they should release new legends into apex here is my take on it i think they shouldn't be as scared about a legend being overpowered when released into the live servers if you look at other games who release characters quite often i don't know if many of you play league of legends but they released a character earlier in the month called samira and she's what is known in the business as a 1v9 champion she was getting dash resets she could use her ultimate ability multiple times in the same fight she was overpowered but they nerfed her really quick with a hotfix um the problem is i suppose is that apex is on different platforms which are more difficult to implement these quick changes like this but even so i think a new legend should enter the game and mix it up i think watson crypto loba and rampat all entered the game and at least in public games they didn't really change the meta i wouldn't mind a week of a new legend mixing things up being a little bit overpowered getting people trying something new we need that in apex you know let me know what you guys think about this also i just posted a 32 kill call of duty warzone video on my older channel i have a lot of big plans for it including streams over there i've got warzone content ready to go the new card is coming out soon a load of different things i would absolutely love it if you guys showed it some love as well there'll be a link in the description and also the pinned comments i mean 32 kills please go and check it out but yeah thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see well in five and a half seconds my friends never saw me coming did you let's try this let's try this rock place what is this place called um this place is called launch site let's try it out let's try it out i don't have a gun yet so i might not be too useful does this guy have a gun um i don't know i'll call you though thank you no problem you might down

gave in top hey jeez bloodhound's so scary is it really how long does it take honestly like it feels like 60 seconds oh i think they reduced it to 90. i think it was nothing i think it was 90. nice choice you've got good taste oh romney nice i think the other one was east oh what the oh my god did you hear him no name is legion there's no audio in on him at all oh maybe there was but i thought it was you guys i can't tell sometimes i mean i didn't hear him at all and i mean it was a pathfinder so it wouldn't surprise me yes oh my my oh god i'm healing oh yeah completely new team here by the way that's getting pumped by that oh my word good job that was all you guys i was literally shooting my teammate i cannot believe that's worked up top as well they're coming they're coming over the hill i left my red behind i think i think got taken by somebody all right dude this guy's more people pop up here you just dip from his teammate oh my gosh that was one that was that's all you guys i'm gonna have to hide for one second and go let my dog in okay give me one second i'm sorry if you guys fight just run out should be good shots open boys and girls let's see if we're a match what oh my god i think i was trying to do a quip oh i'm back i'm back i'm going back god my dog literally she just likes to she wants to eat every mailman and she's not a small dog so she's if if my dog is just barking the mailman will not come up uh understandable they sell our friends cool hardware okay okay we're looking healthy we're looking good oh there's a barcode in the lobby oh yeah that's not nothing barcodes this kind of it takes you to his twitch channel that's the new wave of advertising i think that's his twitch channel it's just a bunch of bars yeah yeah no it's just like a code it's like a qr code you scan it with your phone you imagine that'd be cool i'd be sick i'll be there sooner or later wow the only one that can get up there yes what was it oh the helmet yeah how do you get best on you yeah yeah come on get the scans and you're watching uh uh yeah i guess so unless you're gonna level one if this is level one i'm gonna start screening okay level three yeah you already gave it to me i'm good to go isn't that why i see someone over there oh he says no enemies he said no enemies he said oh yeah no one here never mind i forget that that crypto can do that actually a cool little passive yeah it really is and i just no one ever uses it really oh there's a little octane pad i feel like they probably was somewhere around here every time i come here i'm popping someone so i'm gonna ruin my good night there's always there's oh i hate coming through here because there's always a classic trap behind one of these rocks or one of these bins why don't i play time that's foreign he's and i'm about to hold they're in revel they're in rebel okay trying to get this path i'm with by the way and he's absolutely clapping me somewhere i don't know where he went there oh yeah there he is is he down is that him over there i guess maybe he's teammates the one up top see this guy has to hop off here soon so have fun buddy yes guys pretty much dead i'm not that desperate for that girl i mean he's annoying and i do want him dead right now our crypto was literally he was he was right here on his drone right when he popped his emp he was right here and then i see a revenant pushing with his alt and he runs right by me doesn't even see him it was so perfect reverend i saw it works like a dinosaur like a tyrannosaurus rex as long as you not move you're fine just don't move you just can't see you that's how my my license works that's how we saw the good loops is he's going dead like there's still four squads left i honestly wasn't even looking at the kill feed i reckon he's just sat there still four squads he's the same i think he's just i reckon he might have gotten the batteries he might have just run all the way to the left let's make ourselves something nice oh i think i see him is that him oh i thought i was with you i'm with i'm with crypto if i die i'm gonna start screaming this guy's charge rifling and the only person i allowed to do that is janks i'm actually dead oh my god i got him but just a bit oh my god that's gonna start screaming what gum is he using this guy's crack tastes mind you have a thrill i just sounded like it throughout i think it's a three or one i think it's all three or one fight how many kills do you have um i have nine i have not okay i make sense i have nine ten i'm not killing you oh you have nine two oh no not 90. no you have nine two yeah sorry yeah okay no i'm not i know i know maths i know quick math it's literally what my dad would say every time like the weather was on and he'd be like it's going to be four to five degrees today and he'd be like 45 degrees like every time oh that's funny dude that would literally get me every single time we can is this a care package all right what's gonna happen here is i'm gonna get myself an r99 and i can just drop my mastiff oh yeah it's a crater oh i can't crave a mastiff i'm not that brave that dude you got you have no i'm not that brave you can do it i believe i cannot drive set would you like a real one and you're foolish i've got one thanks i've gotta throw on craig okay okay so i've still picked it up but i'll use this as a as a mastiff anyway on my scope somewhere that guy at the end killed me honestly i'd attempt my playstation he's way too close i was i was i was i got a little worried concerned when you saw i know when you can't do anything you're just so far from your teammate you just watch their shield just go from yeah i go from five audacious maneuver nice nice nice jeez who's the other team who's the spangler where's that coming from up top down low ah i actually don't think i have the bullets i tell the gold bag oh teammate no we went too far as if i'd literally none of the light rays no i told you this craver was going to be the death of me if i can die you can you can loot the light arounds from my body i'm going to try and get them to thirst me oh no i have 600 here you're good you're good i have my ultimate you can only get two stacks though that's what i'm talking about hey [Music] i had no audio on them and then i saw the holes and then they were literally on my head so that guy was sat up top and what they were just like straight beneath him yeah i'm the triple right beneath him what the hell that's the most satisfying damage i've ever seen that's beautiful i'm glad i died
