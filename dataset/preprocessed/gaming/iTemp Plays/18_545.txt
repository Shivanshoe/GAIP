remember that you said you didn't like it so here we are yeah and there's literally no one here so you're kind of throwing our games i have an re45 there's no one even here trying to steal loot from me and i can't get any loot that was struggling okay well where do we even go from here to the loot factory cause i need some loot all right we're gonna go to the way we're gonna go straight to the source the factory no missing a bait that shoot is dead that was okay i didn't actually see anyone they were just running in circles okay he cracked me from there with the charge rifle i really don't like this guy oh he's right on me oh my god oh my god the purple in there oh i think it's broken man i'm deserving yes but the ring's on the move and we're not insider yet i told you it wasn't k9n he wouldn't left i don't know who it is but his name is not and so i just knew who he wasn't you know we process of elimination okay you just know that it's not him no it's not that guy stop stop jump down this way i can help i mean you never know oh she's won there's no audio oh no oh no my order just literally just left i can drop you this gold and you can like heal up i got a phoenix early days all those here numbers i'm recharging my shield it's got to be more right it has to be flight it's just flashing i like killing teams that fast it's fine bloomer you know that wraith had no idea what happened dudes got absolutely destroyed i need energy um i have actually i think i saw a lot right here in this car 125. thank you no problem i will pass this oh my god there's so many boxes here there's four more boxes oh my what old helmet give it to you who's this way yeah oh i died is nice right behind him we're gonna have to get inside mate just come in [Music] here but i'm gonna dive i was somehow dodging it oh my god there's some boxes everything this is like i've never thought so many people that's actually crazy i think i've completed zodia i did it yes wait oh my god i have no ammo girlfriend in here oh i've already got one i'm an idiot i dropped that for you wow yeah sorry it's like it just kicked off yeah i know it look at all these boxes i know dude so many people here like if we would have gotten here two minutes earlier we would have probably had like 20 kills is that a new record where could they be two squads oh yeah the naked ones are the ones that are blind right yes because everyone's been flying over this way so uh bro wow nice thanks jump jets yeah the team got a little they did all catch the one clips i was there to first i was trying to boost my damage it wasn't as embarrassing yeah yeah that's it that's it for 200 damage obviously i know i didn't resent it i don't remember that i think the greatest legend i will literally just go i threw the worst pad of all time so it doesn't even matter oh oh you're trying to actually throw it before i launched so many troubles uh packing chips oh no oh what has white armor oh here we go they've been here the entire game oh my god i have to drop after drop enemy removed why would they come outside no i think it was just them too did you get two kills or one one okay i was just them too did that break that well i'd hit me for like 150 in the air [ __ ] that was terrible jesus you are the eighth champions oh we had a third oh i forgot yeah i remember him insta leaving was there is there anybody coming into this hotdog well i mean we'll get a good loot um direct and i can horizon over this shall we head this way i'll give it a shot never know i didn't know this was a thing i don't think i've ever walked through this little valley before that's way too high that's crazy i didn't even look at it now oh my god there's no way oh my god i need that please bring it yes please do you what are you using sense now because the lobbies have been just too easy today so i thought why not you know it's way too easy right all right let's see this gold g7 treats me you know he's gonna sell my cow greatest g7 player of all time oh my god quick scope for everything that's the last of that squad someone's downloading this i'm sorry [Music] barely getting no mind i shot here i've never uploaded a video of us fighting at the there lakers is what's that roger's what's he trying that for okay okay ah this g7 is kind of nutty i'm yeah it's kind of crazy the g7 is now going to be one of your favorite guns do you know what's crazy on the g7 we're inside a one size um yeah i would i actually i don't mind the two to four time though they're two to four times six foot's nice not too bad i like it variable feels kind of nice i like the little scope on it as long as you can avoid grasping your control like you're trying to kill it when you're in a tense situation which i can't just help just choking your controller out like it owes you money about the cash and checks more opinions please oh that's shoot my g7 if you can refrain from using the g7 so i can slide them that'd be good okay thank you i'm sorry you make it i may i'll make them i'll make them look good thank you get them low and then you just one tape getting it down with the sentinel if it's not like a headshot is really hard already oh zone's literally about to close on there too yeah literally only bought it for pings come on team come on guys later i'm just going to come out to a firing squad won't come out she got ready she's not coming with me tonight she's going to die cracked um octane padding in broken i see i told you i can look at all right i thought i was awesome where's she going this team does not like us don't mean this he's devastating i mean this has been our experience all day so i don't even care anymore pretty much this is a personal fight right here yeah you know there's no person involved we're on the receiving end every time did i get my octane kill um i i i don't know in this arena he's already gone he's off the scene yeah i don't think he did either unless he ends the left can you do that i still get the kill credit um oh if you didn't get killer credit then now you probably didn't i don't know if i did and i don't see anybody no no i'm right on the he's going back he's pretty spoiled what's wrong uh okay me and me and uh watson over here oh there's no way wait the octane's actually live i thought he was down the whole time we're good over here don't worry are you yeah i need to recharge my shields this seems uh kind of scared i'm kind of bad it can be tricky oh made a headshot okay um i have i have seven and i have a gold armor so i will drop you something recharging okay if you're here fighting i'm confused because they're the last team oh yeah well they probably it was when we were fighting so they probably just finished oh so you mean i heard fighting i heard fighting well you're over there just being a little bitter warlord get the comes the right first experience of all time and rich is over here solo queueing you should have seen my like the octane jump paddy through this guy a headshot about this guy he was like a clay pigeon and i was like shooting world champion that's what it was like it was worth it is what you're saying yes it was okay that's all that matters and that's spectacular all the time because they think i am cheating that's the only explanation i mean they were spectating me and then i made a lot of bad decisions so i think they just got tired of it i think they were in sorting um um i feel bad for that team still but they were partying capital the entire time they've won capital we just rock up with a gold g7 now i know they probably killed everybody in capital because they had like red armors and stuff that's why they're spectating me they're just they're really hoping i'll die we just did the absolute minimal i would shut up there but i really want to find this thing you can chill up there i mean i heard them shooting over here they probably rotated our zone though um 335 could you drop just a little bit please oh they go for it big old 36 huge thank you okay i'm charging up i'm charging the bad boy under the middle of the uh and then they're flicking up a little bit yeah i think one of them is up there i'm pushing oh we can go he's buying stuff he's myself yeah they're already [ __ ] i gotta back up 88 up nice oh she's won switched nice hey oh gg yeah nice that's fun i never i've never used the gold g7 before i don't think i've ever actually sat there and used it for an entire game ever you should use the scout champions it's kind of fun i'm not very good with it but it's fun as if you wouldn't be good with this game it's the easiest game okay well i thought we were gonna have more damage than that but all right all right left um yeah we did land in no man's land um and then we rotated to leaf so there's only so many
