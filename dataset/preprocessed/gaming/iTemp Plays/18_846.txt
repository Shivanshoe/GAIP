[Music] alright I'll go this one then hot drop it ease my friends the old hot drop it's gonna try the old role on Drop but I'm not really sure that's gonna work out there's blood on the enemy please give your boy it but thank you very much I only got one on ammo joke weirdly enough hey you can't lend up the hot drop this late gonna take they've been and buff me I'll be honest that was my teammate okay there's two of them there were the late joiners oh there's my kill a bad guy over there apparently I'm not sure I want to what to do with him he could have had the legendary loot for a weiner is he's the hot drop after all I don't know if that guy just quits or that actual teammate would have died level 1 I got one friend thank you though you must know that I have never picked almond before in my entire okay that my friend is some level for shields I'm ready to fight I'm ready to scrap I could do with that it's nice thanks very much Antoine reigns I'm good thanks ok let's go to scraps or sitting already only 36 people we've only been in here for 3 minutes maximum that has turned my team at a range he was coming over with me but he's got no shields unfortunately the new kill leader I've only shot one person so far I've run away from one of them but you've turned out to be my teammate I don't often land at the hot chop and I'll tell you why as well I never get burns at a start so I'm in a building you can grab look - I've really struggled recently with was actually picking up weapons at the start the game I'm gonna actually take Karami because I might find a 99 and if I do I prefer it to the Peacekeeper even though I have the precision choke as well oh my god good grief and how many things can you ping in one game this man's going for a world record all right team you win you win Mimi goes because there is a scrap in scrubs or City but obviously I don't feel like running straight in there and dying with my god fields and just gifting this to someone especially now I've got a level 3 hell me as well open the vaults they've got good shield Shirley now we are ready to scrap I mean there's a new kill leader 25 people left my friends if the heck and freaky involved I've got my ulti we can pray to get there real quick as well easy think to use the kill leader and he's just drop someone else down to the ground I can literally see the scrap but I don't think my teammates are gonna come over wait wait wait wait wait wait that's a turbocharger all right you know how to get me over there okay I got a select fine his havoc ride name it's not too far away got to take this one instead level two I mean we've all got gold we're literally gold shielded out of our minds right now and the storms coming so what better excuse and to leave I have never heard someone being so much in my entire life I'm pretty I mean I know he's trying to be helpful and you can appreciate that it's been someone that doesn't think something I guess grateful helmet level one hemlock earlier ronnie was evite if you fancy that a right talkin no has ever wanted that to be P not one person has ever asked for someone to finger and a right Godavari no crypto sorry protective gargoyle mode activated those remnants of a scrap 21 people left that's a zero of ten grapple can trace it and any higher than that considering I didn't even land it building this is why the scrap was earlier on sucking bony solo voice and I try and say my grapple unless I absolutely need to need to use it now it's has played defensive until it's back because it's my only escape routes confused that's a kill leader I'm pretty sure there were four seals are still sliding back though I've just rocked to play here my turbocharged a gold shield have it I'm pretty sure he was still full health but say it wasn't life I just show him in the back when he was looting but I do feel bad that I've just rocked up these light to this graph in my ammunition if you struggling I mean you guys have been doing this entire time like that I said I would gold watching McCall is well barrel stabilized have reduced the old muzzle flash which I'm very happy about any GMO I'll tell you what I bet I'd get better loot from these people from all these death boxes and then they do actually looting the map if you want good loot the best way to get it is to get involved in a scrap my friend does anyone have a better night ammunition X any maps going on for a long time good grief and another one there we go hope you like snail I'm Meg I've got all the healer balls I need that's a zero a 10 I messed that up I was gonna try and get on the old grapple all right well good better three kills eight other people left and I can really annoy my team here I'll just need to go save through the choke points I don't think these guys have loop that would compare to mine I mean a turbocharger have enough to be fair if the turbocharger did come from a mirage but I just found an online - 940 key to date I feel bad but I can't even hear myself I can't even hear myself talk but from all of the things I mean if your fins for help I'm not gonna be helped I'm not gonna be helpful at all I won't know but I can't hear another extending line my clever one being pinged out I can't write reunited a friend's house life how many bright chocolates to be if we find today I assume quite a lot and we can still get a decent mayor Kells here because there are four squads and eleven people so that's like three full teams and one team of two so all we need to do is try and make sure that we get involved into scrap as soon as we hear it that's the Golden Rule no more playing a little bit scared little bit defensive if I hear one bullet being fired I'm going over there I'd rather die we kill off the wind wheel on you know it's just I feel like I've played long enough now for that to be the case do that from this angle you can definitely do from other angles let me just do a check no one's can interfere I've walked past this place before and been shot by someone come prepared teammates you know that means you have me the heck in freak over there I'm pretty sure I ever heard one of them say they had another look vault key that's open I'm afraid my shield stop that you interested don't tell me you're looting supplies you've got you've got God shield you've had them since four minutes into the game it's a g7 Scout oh my god that's ironic he's been loosing this entire time and he's got a level one bag that's actually kind of sad that's unfortunate he's got no it's put on his good loot that's most German sending name I've ever seen Jacques French fry country 17 please they've got box watts and fences over there hey beneath me as vom might seem Isis or close Bandon oh you thought friend it's gonna get a revive because either one for life lane I think he's already I think he already has Barbara five now down here friends there we go fifty drone really helped Ashley it's still this gold armor there we go I'll tell you what loot another creeper is the way to go hi this is supplied been opening and sweet to be first my teammates they couldn't really drop down there because game back up there without being Pathfinder ease so difficult that is incredibly difficult why three spots left I have six kills now there could be a bunch of people where that wasn't fences they're fighting last two teams it's maybe loud but hopefully it didn't work I need them to get distracted again before I do anything Timmy's going crazy with the really single shot I think it must be a flat line I'm gonna get triple took earth I can't really do anything but we can't throw that in there I'm pretty sure I heard the the Watson thing going down it was an ultimate what he's going on here friends what is this this is like the end of an apex predator game know if that was a care package there's a chance that lifeline goes for that one to kill him we messed up I should have kept an eye on the map Parker to me South Pier already with the fences already when did these guys ultimate now well the waswhen Watson's got their ultimate I wonder if kryptos got his ultimate just just three people just three people sitting in a shipping container nothing to see here I tied didn't want a slide it's cuz I was crate when I fell down oh my god I am the worst at this game the worst ever potentially - screwed now we're the only team that's knocked up my this ultimate he does his everything he's also not I wasn't ready I wasn't ready I can get back the better ASEA thanks for playing guys oh hey books the overseer that was actually such good teamwork with the Krypton Ottoman that works out beautifully where's the last team here fine I'll just as soon as I damage them a decent name I can just drop down on their head running away you heard me you have my plan over there the other third Altima of use to get up top on one of these things [Music] over the Heylin distractin teammate it's damn one I was a timid - I'm surprised we won that one we were the only team that wasn't up top that's directed at you guys have there better Watson they had all the fences up there they the Gibraltar who I'm surprised I didn't use his ultimate skill and we're not when I was grappling up top I would have done it 10 kills how do I still get double digits there I 3 kills with like 11 with 8 people left so I got 7 at the last of the last 8 kills there I still clutched up for the double digits 2,200 damage shout-out to the crypto especially because those crypto Ultimates allow me to get inside of those log containers and mess those teams up that was actually a beautiful game in the end there's actually a beautiful game I'm happy with that one I just had to rush him I to get the hair King freak involved thank you for watching I do appreciate it and I'll see you on the next one [Music]
