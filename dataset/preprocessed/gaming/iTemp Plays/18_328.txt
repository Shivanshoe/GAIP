hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using probably my favorite close range gun in apex the prowler this gun has just came out up to care packages and it's floor loot again and it is still ludicrous it did get enough compared to the care package variant which is good the nerf was the time between bursts has been increased from 0.2 to 0.24 seconds which is a 20 increase but don't be fooled this doesn't just equate to a 20 decrease in fire rate and dps because this is only the time between bursts that is being factored in and doesn't factor in the time it takes to actually fire that burst as well it might overall equate to around a 10 decrease in overall fire rate and dps assuming the time between bursts and the bursts themselves are around equal length which i think they are so ten percent lower dps or they're around to its care package variant is still incredibly good i am happy to floor loot again and i can't wait to three bus people with this weapon thank you for watching today's video guys i really do appreciate it and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'm close close i'm taking the rope they do be up there already stay while i'm just on that guy two of them oh my god that's their party right there oh man bless him and just like that it's over huh yep that's tough i'm dropping my energy gun okay so there's a lot of energy in there i'll take all of it i've still got nothing on my breath oh i guess it's because it's in the crafter as well the purple alexa
