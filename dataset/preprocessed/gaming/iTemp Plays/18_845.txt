all right team the queue has started I am 70 points away from ranking up and I'm currently in dimond 1 which means that we if we have a good game I'm making to making it to apex predator today I I'm praying that I don't lose 48 RP this game and I fall into a spiral and actually end up in so there that's the plan that's not the plan the plan is that I hope that doesn't happen I guess we'll find out I'll be scared friends I'm a little bit scared sourcing Factory is usually pretty popping off but it looks like most the team's actually went I'd like the main doors and we sort of cut them off a lovely here just give me a gun give me something to defend myself what's this is long oh yes it is he's not the greatest close-range weapon especially since a nerf if I right I mean the close-range light please let's all switch these over I didn't mind taken the the close-range side deck because I was going to switch the longbow out anyway for a decent weapon I would find the longbow is good but I'm not good with the longbow I'm good with the devotion with a turbocharger it used to be actually my favorite gun on this game little bean here yes they having dig into target I'll take you said off cheese close there goes I'll take that DoubleTap thanks you guys go in the light munition on the go by any chance I mean it's not hard to come by I do have a load of energy but it's hopefully some more here indeed thank you friend offer you're gonna take effectively one weapon here no that's his friend that no no it's gonna revive her there's not much I can do about that I've downed one absolutely shredded you the one on my team I said okay my team may have to say okay did you shoot down a cargo bus god is scary taking his fights close range of this gun with that of turbo charger is that my thermite that's an absolute tragedy right there what am i thermite not bounced off you know I should he take that was it Emma it was indeed few minutes it's got no long rains and this guy's gonna be scrapped near a second there you go one's down John we can jump over for some reason so me and friends is that too is this one I feel bad but don't let me use this Phoenix kick for the love of God in fact I refuse to use it I'm gonna wait until I get a med kit or hopefully syringes I'm not using a Phoenix kin-san around for 25 seconds for that much healthy it's not happy well these guys team up just desserts in essence yes they have that's exactly what they did I think he's got the loophole but the Luke even default the Volvo key there we go it's I'm stressed so I'm mine - 48 RP that's not looking good so far hopefully is gonna look a little bit better as soon as we get the the vault open there's a human I can't I can't go there it's just straight - when you're down someone in ranked and you don't get a killer or assists on it let us get the revive and they take up the hair can forget it there no not the Phoenix KITT get me on the syringes can't even get up there some lux sometimes you can get turbo charges and these things and if I get one it's an automatic victory for us is that a turbocharger yes it is I was almost convinced there that was going to be an anvil receiver but now we've upgraded our shield so actually full health and we've got a turbocharger and my dreams have become me out tonight hi - 38 RP diamonds want what I want you to do is keep looking top right at the RP and as soon as it says and if it says plus 70 or above but that is when I do not care what happens in this game any longer talk to another cargo but I was gold - I think yeah because we made a pitch predator and honestly it'll be pretty cool if you just said plus 70 harpy but I'm not sure that's possible I'm not gonna see you and do the math so I got people to shoot and places to be I live in our way okay I'm gonna listen to this guy he's ranked number 50th in the world on PlayStation 4 so anything he says goes decide Watson ladies are Watson fence don't think they're here don't mind Barney they are whereabouts we talking to them I'll tickle them friends I don't know recalling that much before what's happened to these use the 85 damage no cell controls it'll be better there I was that my kill that was my help yeah I think this is absolute to get out of here this is this is the worst choke point on the entire game I hate this place because it's not just a regular choke point it has a sniper tower up top and these guys are still scrappy I mean I can try and help but I really don't have much I'll shoot this guy in the foot that's all I can offer please don't represent me he's trying I don't like these friends I read I like this great good this way look in that way even their firing I don't think that's their phone that's good news because that means the games on the back let's no fire you let's get involved and let's get some kills on the go you don't necessarily have to win this game with five kills I suppose I think I'm following that I don't care - Kelcey boy mighty Mike on his way he's not going this way I don't know um to be honest I'm not sure we can we'd have to go all the way around that mountain he's not possible we have to commit to this I can't use I've got one shield that's right that's it I thought my lootcrate was there apparently must've been behind and now I've messed that up too Oh it's just gonna be a struggle I have one Phoenix kit and one shield battery and I'm definitely gonna be in this storm as well I mean it's not too bad I could probably just be escaped once I get out of this but then I'll just have one one shield battery I think I just need to stick on my teammates a little bit hopefully we can get a few points on the board I mean the good news is we're positive now so even if this game ends right now and we die in a storm we would be 62 can't be away from a next racer please don't be on in here afraid it's over my friends my lesson good stuff in there - no it's company we're good I wanna stay in here for too long because this is such a trouble points I think what you're trying to get out of feet we can someone's going to talk let's go up to the left I can use my ulti Louie this way a little bit of high ground advice anything more for me for some reason my teammates are go for a flank I'm this might be stupid I'll do I just don't wanna - I don't them to rush me because now I have to try and regroup my teammates and now their angel little bit they should be shield enough and if you'll free me up to to regroup my teammates I don't know why we didn't get up top there we're in a good a lot of spot well good though I guess we can just flank these guys and try get drunk it's a safety please don't do that I've got no shields I know that's like five times and I'm strapped any book if I get tickled a little bit I'm pretty much useless then I'd have to use my shield battery and then in us in an actual fight I'd be useless watch out behind friends the polls come in separate team and I literally have two syringes to my name I think we get more RP once it's the top five squads we need two squads to die and I think we get more RP and it also increases the multiplier on your kills and assists this one up top as well I hate these sniper towers I mean it's okay for me as Pathfinder because I can get underneath there and grapple up if I have to I think I need to provide some covering fire teammate hopefully you can help me out here we don't have to heat them per se we just need to make them a little bit shook that teammates trying to rotate to us I think he's firing him there's need to scare them in orbit oh my god I have fifty shots left [Applause] and how aggressor can play here with no heavy bullets and no I think we should try and get into sniper's nest though it's to an occupied at the moment and then we can just camp up there I think that's that I think that's the best play it's just about safe and with no shields and you know it's not that many heavy bullets which is my only long-range option this may be the only thing we can do here Oh superseding chokes when I get them so on fancies this year peacekeeper here so for grabs that's not wifey it's not worth it Tim a few drama shells I promise you I'm on I will not peek them I swear I don't think he's gonna scrap over there I think we I think we just have to camp thanks thank you very much listen I'm not gonna pick them okay the man's got a trim or tape I got anything triple took at once it's not gonna I'm not gonna get triple double took her it's not happening I'll be careful peeking that way friend I mean they haven't dropped me shields this whole time apart from just now so I'm not sure they have that many to give up race again aimed at by sniper let's huddle here this is chill no reason to peek their friends don't do it oh my god someone's called that you brought to my team I know this isn't the most exciting game of all time but I've got my three kills this way if I get a good place in this is easily gonna tame its apex predator I mean if I win with this amount of kills it might be like 130 hundred forty points way more than I need that was fun for all but mostly us my five squads left post 27 RP friends I think this is it we have to move soon I'm not really sure what the best course of action we could go around that mountain but I think we're gonna come at the same angle as two other teams I don't know if that's the that's the play more of the safe zone is on this side of the mountain we've got that team there that's all any of us I'm gonna try and sneak it let's need these guys to start clashing and then as soon as as soon as these guys don't find you the ones we can get involved Nick a few kills pops your uncle apex predator little flare I mean it's good I guess it they're gonna take a different angle and moving Rock safe maybe did you learn that in the tree oh my god that's beautiful she set the tree on fire it's nice my style moving know that I think if one more Squad dies we get even more IP I think top three is even more IP there we go 52 I need like one kill the shield US service in Seattle turn it on I got two kills there I got five kills and we weren't that's a hundred cents seven are fixed that means we did it that means that we did it my friends in less than 200 games completely solo from bronze to apex predator we did it five kills i jus did it to the damage new 1800 damage there more than my teammates combines my joy I did have a decent long-range option with it two times on a single fly hemlock and I did magic get into that fight at the end pretty quickly we did play that like little rat boys I will be honest with you that was the rat east-end I've ever played you just wait for him to fight and then you shoot them the back and I feel bad because the people that we killed I'm pretty sure I saw them in the feed I love the game but listen I needed one game I needed one good game to get to apex predator and we did it twenty twenty four thousand apex predators how many of those are - borders last season I'm pretty sure there were 2000 apex predators bit of a difference there bit of a difference but it is what it is and we've made it ourselves thank you for watching I do appreciate it it's a long journey there's a long journey a lot of you guys we're getting impatient not impatient but it looked like I gave up because I didn't post it for like two weeks but there we go I knew I could do thanks for watching I do appreciate it and I see what the next one [Music]
