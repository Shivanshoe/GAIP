hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are going to be using the new spitfire because it is ludicrous now i thought this weapon was underrated for a while for the same reason that the alternator isn't respected it's flat out dps just isn't as high as the flatline but almost anyone can get a kill without reloading when you have nearly 50 bullets in a magazine now in season 8 they buff the damage on this weapon from 18 to 19 which means that against low profile legends which are most the ones that people play it's dealing 20 damage a hit which is significant because then it takes it to a 5 shot kill from no armor and a 10 shot kill from purple how fast i die to this guy i know that they have high ground and i didn't heal my blue armor all the way i just got absolutely exploded it's ludicrous what a gun i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching and thank you for all the support in season eight i do appreciate it if you're new here to the channel please be sure to subscribe as we are aiming to reach one million subs in season eight of apex and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh my god this is quite scary actually and everyone's doing some tactical up and down jump things how are they so much quicker holy how are they that much quicker all right i'm looping off the edge okay one off i hit one off they'll still be alive i think yeah i dropped i'm chasing i jumped off is there anyone else left i think they all jumped off oh you went that way i got two let me be honest yeah i can't use the interactive starter it feels so weird thank you i would assume you'd probably have to do on ps4 though right oh my god right here just went across this rope too there's like five people oh i see everybody i see everybody i can meet you in this guy i'm from behind him i'm in a bad spot i'm right behind him are they up on that hill there how did they hit me cracked really awake like 60 health max i got one oh my god that was stressful know i was running towards you guys it was just like someone just resting in the water in front of me uh i dropped four meters in here recharging shields oh yeah i can't use the two-time as much as i want to just can't it's so tough close range yeah it just doesn't fit it doesn't fit my sense sending you alex over i should be okay all right right now thank you i still want like 20 bullets of heavy yeah yeah thank you um definitely some boxes over here i don't know where they went though oh yeah i see portal getting somewhere at reloading charging up my shield using your ultimate in this cave that is actually kind of okay yeah yeah that's okay that's what they did let's finish finish ultimate nice your teammate's ultimate slows you i didn't know that yeah nice what a replicator mate just doesn't have any right to be this good it's yeah it's not fair it needs a flat line with an extended mac um i don't know i still feel like the flatlines better but i do think the spitfire is just really really scary now i think that's before my bear i think that's mine like a dps still isn't there but i it just like won less damage what's the fire right like it should be kind of similar right um i hear a fight right next to me on the other side of this uh okay this wall whatever i'm flying well soon here he teams here i think they're faster yeah a few of them just about there i'm dead no he did not oh my god oh just here just here i'm gonna get beam in the sky oh right on me he's just trying to finish taking him out with a decoy been coming in that's not good no chicken hi grant hopping a bath up there ally on this building somewhere yeah did you go inside that's gonna pop her back oh she's got red she got red shoes yeah i'm challenging that i might just pull so far right here she's just hanging in there obviously if you have to if it's purple or a bear not powerful annoyingly it's all right i'm going to put i can put shield on frankie's there that's her teammate are they both just camping the storm no no the wreck is down oh i finished there's a box there she's right above me i'm sorry this is the lifeline i've only got one med kit left here one team left nice one i think i can hear stuff was that a missile coming in or something i should have looted for some more heavy i have 44 non-spare yeah i got more heavy i got 160. oh thank you uh i have one bat no med kits three syringes i should be alright though one team there so for that such a heavy here and an extra twenty i stole the 60 bullets made it my voice thank you thank you um probably on the other side of the of this uh mountain yeah yeah i saw um some smoke coming down if it cooled something in this uh this jump pad makes me way too confident like way too confident that i'm not here when i'm going in go in down the bank or two here i don't know do they revive this guy oh she's so low i gotta get her kicking i'm kicking me i'm kicking it get him in a fence i'm stunned nicer yeah how do you raise the fence to play i guess i eat it i have a mozart i am full are we jumping straight there down in here i have four muted is that you what okay yes it was huh well if you see a spitfire please that you're not using that's why rank's nice 45 people left we're just chilling you know i know dude never have that in a pub time this is how uh like old uh the old lobbies used to feel before scope smash i feel like like the players aren't terrible but they're not insane and nobody dies like you know there's not half the lobby dead within two minutes yeah i don't know my kd back then was higher than it is in like these ranked lobbies so whoa i'm getting shot yeah that was a roof just a while hey yeah over here might be two teams here it looks like this one yeah oh my come in almost there keep surviving oh i'm stuck inside there's a door on me i really love it sweet i can't see it nice stuck is that what you said in the middle of it i said i've got a door on me yeah yeah the most potent of enemies sometimes that's all i'm gonna say about that this man doesn't even call out the enemies he calls out the doors i mean it worked i knew you're in trouble that's all i know what you said but i knew you're in trouble from the vibes you know the stress in your voice it sends a message and at one point i got stuck creature underneath this truck as well so someone else wants to help me destroy oh here we go oh no i'm not there i'm okay i think are they oh yeah over gibby i'll be all happy you rich yeah i can back up i can back up babe if we back up they'll probably go um laps i'm diving on this dude that's where i'd go there we go that's what i like we're going to push this speaker we're just going to go crazy mate um i have uh my old i was the one shot he's gonna go down the storm oh did you get him i gotta fight on me i got the blue hound that is just yeah there's a team on me in this little crevice oh no i'm not i jump all the way down oh yeah i'm here right here yeah i see him i see him wait one's on me holy i'm behind him i'm behind him i had to wow you actually impressed me more and more every day guys humongous five-head gaming scan it again it's literally five seconds um going for the uh here oh okay oh god land on their heads oh this poor soul off imagine your game ending in two seconds like that they were fine two seconds ago you played for 13 minutes just to die in three seconds actually heartbreaking that's so sad oh my god i'm the worst caustic i just solo ulted an octane that was on the ground i'm gonna get me uh they got me crabby rich right on you right side okay i'm trying that again another one right behind him this is the one by one one by one it's a race they saw the one by one strand they thought you know what as uh the team before these guys realized i couldn't stand that because in the care package it was a gold bag and it was a lifeline so she really must have wanted it no i did blinded by the gold you hate to see it what even happened in that game that was a slow game climbing through the ranks yeah i think oh your boy silva nice
