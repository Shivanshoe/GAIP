hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the new limited time mode is out it is always the closing evolved it was one of my favorite limited time modes because it pushed everyone into this certain spot and everyone knew where it was so everyone would convene on this particular spot early and you just get a lot of scrappage there's a lot of scraps going on but this may be more interest to you here a new mod has been added into the game called the graffiti mod and it can only go on the spitfire and it increases the magazine capacity and it gives it faster reloads and it paint loads the rounds as well the paint doesn't really do anything although it does it is kind of decorative it's kind of beautiful but it gives the spitfire 63 bullets per magazine that is unbelievable you'll see a few times in this game that i've got for you here today that i just i didn't have to reload i was just spraying from the hip i thought i needed help i didn't i didn't even need to reload but anyway i hope you enjoyed today's video thank you for watching thank you to janks for jumping on and helping me get this game i do appreciate it the challenge will be in the description of course and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends oh god i'm good the interesting thing about it is that uh he who were the mercenaries that attacked her to begin with and then blisters happened to show up like what if he was the reason that they were there there was a bring him to bring her into the games yeah just it was cool it was a cool little little backstory of why she's like turning up yeah like who where did how did she just randomly pop up onto the scene like who are you you know i chose her they wanted that i haven't oh my god janks you are the best you might be the best lightsaber what that's three games in a row yeah i got you i'm gonna go grab that nine and i'm gonna give you the spitfire are you the guy that's close no you're this way oh yeah you are the goddess close i was looking the wrong way thank you very much oh what do i want yellow green or purple or all three oh my god you can leave messages for people on the on the walls you can write sub to items i was literally about to do that yeah hold on i don't have any bullets i can oh don't worry i'll give you some bullets i need to do this in one corner oh my god this guy's this guy's got the good things oh this is an elegant ineligible that's an eye that's this is all too dark over here this is pointless this is in the legend [Laughter] so that's a word and i said it correctly nothing wrong with that this is the way it came out it had me giggling a little bit there's some heavy out here thank you i can give you i'll drop you another stack actually thank you very much i will use this paint thank you on the wall for you thank you that's the best word on the street is that that's going to be like ramparts ability like the graffiti mod ah the whole idea of like passing through that's reloading and stuff yeah oh they're fine on the right by the way we should probably try and get some damage for our shields yeah yeah we got to do it sooner than later before everyone gets burped yeah already what's the jump power looking like jump past i hold on hold on we could get it right into the third floor here right into this oh my word on the best jump powder i i i should be on that level with you oh bottom floor yeah yeah i'm jumping behind him right behind him i need some help never mind now i might nice job oh my god i said i needed help and then i just held down the trigger because i've got a spitfire with a barrel with a graffiti mod look at all the paint in here yes what you said i'm missing huh those are precisely i wanted those shots to go there that's a secret and coded message like time to take i thought we had her on random you lunatic took that into account zame ray jumped on my head oh come on come on come in as fast i can i'm good groot out of here energy groot energy who energy groups you just sent him out he was groot so you just said it yeah you're right actually ah janks get it together sorry sorry holding the trigger name these gun fights i can't hear a single call out hey man i'm just fighting that round i don't know if you notice or not but there's actually uh um bigger magazine size with the mod yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah bigger magazine size and faster reload 63 bullets what's this thing oh that's the final circle you know what i've been looking at the map thinking what what does this mean like what is this come on get it together rich yeah now i'm the one that's oh look at all this where i missed what's going on here it was just warning shots yeah they were indeed which one don't miss i don't really know i'm conflicted because we got the end zone here and i feel like people are gonna be like people turn up right here they have to turn up right yeah think i'm gonna let you be i'm gonna let you be the the deciding factor here uh i am down to sit here just for a little bit see what's happening if it's too boring we'll move guide you but you are right there's good amount of people left and they do have to come this way i want to try this thing i saw i saw an awesome video on twitter the the new pro strat so in like algs and like pro play oh yeah they do they kidnap it's the kidnap strat oh yeah so you just basically i would start my let's say hypothetically we would do it right i would jump off right here and i would start my portal in the air like that yeah and then i would go and i would scoop somebody oh nelly i would scoop them oh yeah and then they would go through the portal and they couldn't oh they can't go back oh my god they can't go back okay good i thought i was getting kidnapped that's like the new strat it's kind of funny to watch so i want to do something that's a good idea yeah that'd be a good video title [Music] somebody's looking at it's funny i feel like you'd get demonetized you probably would oh it's a little bit let's go let's go kill that okay one's got white evo and i just cracked it from 35 meters and they only had 35 shields that was enough to crack them so oh yeah because it's 25 isn't it white here i'm stupid yeah i need to get it together i think i've had heat stroke today i've got my pad i've got my pad they're only they're on this floor they're on this floor they're on this floor okay no they're not oh i've been scammed cracked on white cracks on blue it's gonna i'll let you get a better pressure on oh my god they're really going crazy on us hold up if they it's a rev if they red push take your pe take your pad to the roof yes yeah yeah good idea the whole thing is making this kind of
