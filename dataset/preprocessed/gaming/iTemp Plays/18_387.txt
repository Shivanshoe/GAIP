hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now a few weeks ago i included the clip that's playing in the background at the moment in a video of mine because the guy that killed me had over 100 000 kills just on lifeline and i've never seen that in game before that's that's a crazy number but today we got our revenge which is great i'm gonna leave a link to his stream in the description if you love lifeline or just apex in general you can drop him a follow please don't go there and start badmouthing him we don't do that here and it's just a bad reflection on our community i just thought it was cool because you don't see those numbers very often at all so thank you for watching i hope you enjoy and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends i'll get fried yeah but i know a lot of different languages so yeah you're very cultured i forgot i'm not like four or five so you're very cultured yeah i've been all around the world what uh what are those languages french german i hear a little bit of french spanish are we weak i'm let's do fromage that's not nearly enough do you know what that means i don't tell me i mean four years oh it took like four years of uh uh french too i know loads of french cafe cliches are shooting at me i don't get a these guys are french blasting me man there's a revenant

one in the game yeah i'm sort of over it now though it's been a classic for the last like six months but i don't know it's been a classic for years i know what you're talking about oh this guy actually stuck me what a stick dude i respect it i don't respect that at all i do 100 oh that's a big noob tactic if you ask me sorry mate i thought i was on the ground then i did like a little climb maneuver and i was up there with him oh i know i know exactly what you're talking about actually reloading your character like auto mantles yeah but i guess i was holding jump so it made sense like it
