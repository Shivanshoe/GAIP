hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course now i don't know about you guys but the start of season 12 i was getting emp'd every 34 seconds there was a crypto and every team there were drones flying around everywhere it was crazy but for some reason i very often don't see cryptos for hours on end now i think people have forgotten that they've got some great buffs this season now there are some rumors that crypto is the recipient of the next heirloom so there is a chance that apex might buff crypto even more to try and up the numbers so they can sell more heirlooms but i actually really enjoy playing crypto because he's ultimately so fun i love it i have two games here for you today i hope you enjoy them both thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends lots of people don't understand that oh do i not want that grenade out reloading i've got hands crack there's an octane on me as well are you okay yeah i should be i didn't see where the i just heard the octane inside yeah i put one down [Music] oh he's too quick i'm just healing dude that actually almost killed me it's an impressive nade repairing damages wait how do i have a kill uh i thought you killed all the person completely no you killed the octave down the octave oh hold on shoot you're charging the trigger classical nails shield classic is only for kazakh's dead he died yesterday [Music] oh [Music] their cells all over the place up here okay perfect because i literally have nothing uh in the classics box rejuvenating because that would be uh a safety hazard so hey just because x games that we're just not gonna be safe about it they're not i don't know i don't think we should be i mean i just don't think that always got phone on right where you came the van in peace idiots i mean i don't know if this is gonna reach or not but it would be kind of cool today and one's really weak oh my god [Music] me pickle or dill picks why did they call you that my name is dylan ah i'm charging my shoes it's weird i just i don't know he was janks you know yeah you know right yeah i use janks that's your name that's on your passport for me yeah that's how i expect everybody to call me over the internet it feels weird people i that i admire you going you know going on on a whim and getting everybody to call you rich yeah like i feel weird not calling you red because i don't like the name item yeah it's kind of it doesn't really roll off the tongue especially with the eye and then when they call me temp i feel like ryan from the office so when i uh went chicken lived with me for for a month a few years back and when he stayed here i called him chicken in person i never called him by his real name a single time i just called him chicken who's the big chick monster it was chicken he's like yo chicky boy what's up man what's up chick monster general [ __ ] nice in general chickmeister flex uh yeah for sure for sure if you just want to try to be quick about it it's the nickname abbreviation who is your daddy and what does he do what's that uh from believe that it is from uh what's the what's the movie where they do the dance and they wiggle their head back and forth no no not footloose are you dancing no no not dirty dancing how did you come up with shrek 2 no it's the natural progression it's the trilogy of footloose day dancing trek two no bro guys that they oh they're in front of me they're here i'm sorry mate what is love baby don't hurt me i think it's from that isn't it i don't know big crack bankrupt they got devil as a matter of fact oh she altered actually mad the [ __ ] did all the way to the side nice they were down here somewhere they were pretty deep it's got that double red so they meant business i hear him here did you search the raid no i'm prepared g mile left i don't i don't see your box i don't think i got kill credit what the what's going on here careful oh my god i gotta send it to you oh that's a classic it's such a classic that i'm embarrassed that i didn't remember the name of the movie imagine never having heard it imagine my embarrassment i mean i need to i need to send you a little snippet a clip by my hand man i'm there's no way you're chasing this race down with your drone oh they destroyed it this year there's multiple there's multiple multiple hostiles that was a piss-poor performance by the boy jenks i've only got one bat sir nice social monkey timing adding an exterior dude oh that was your drone right here mate just right here there you go what do you mean do you think what a redemption i'm drunk teabagging teammate wanted dude you're not drone to ebay bridge yeah look at these wait how was it flipping around like that i have to look up things look down and fly down it's kind of beautiful picking up that mask if i saw it but i was like maybe not falsies i think that guys that's what i'll take the overseeing eye thanks my friend oh he's down i was loving nades in the air [ __ ] idiot i'll take your arm on that friend thank you so very much i put one down oh yeah that's one thing though i think a lot of youtubers actually just people in life they focus so much on on one thing but it's important to have balance 100 because you can like full-on grind something for 14 hours a day but it's more it's more efficient to do something like that like say six hours a day and have a balance and be happy you make better content you're more efficient you don't have to take big breaks like sometimes sometimes less is more less is more hundred percent that's why you saw some creatures being like oh i hate apex it's like yeah you have like 20 000 kills in season one right that's why oh it's yeah it's very true do you have this problem where you pick you pick something up but you don't pick it up you know what i mean all the time i mean yeah all the time if i don't have eagle eye vision i'm missing out on all this stuff i have my own by the way okay i just went in this door i'm gonna open it down the roof he fried me really bad he fried me really bad number 100 though richard i didn't hear anyone else in my i

ryzen's just such a quick mover man like she's just she's zooming in the air can't hit her dude the worst part is you destroy the low ball oh look at these boxes and so to be honest i am shoes i'm not
