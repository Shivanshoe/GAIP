hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course we're back here in ranked mode of course because we have been trying to get to uh diamond and then hopefully masters we're making some good progress we've got another long video here for you today i'll use a variety of legends variety of guns it was a good time i hope you enjoy it thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends double car i suck with the car i stick with one car let alone but the two teams aren't fighting each other which is kind of weird cracked on with that hello i pressed triangle i didn't hold it i think he's been spied he has all right nice job team sound detected suck with this gun stuff humongous nice good job team i really suck with the car oh my god this gun is so difficult to do so why is it so tough i've got the attachments to a wing man i could use everything from my lifeline package that's outrageous sure looks like him oh my god throw balls to be honest with you he's burning him that's huge there we go come on there we go i should have started the revive on the second guy too face after i realized he was coming from that angle i didn't know but at least we can instantly revive here it's a respawn i i remembered i was playing lifeline that's huge i never remember i'm playing lifeline i always forget the worst lifeline in the world would you look at that though going to try the three times with the 30 30. the two times is okay with that i prefer the two times i like spray weapons because i don't feel like it's that do i even need this i don't feel like it's that precise like i can never really figure out exactly where it's going to go three times just a dot perfect unfortunately she won't have ultimate name he's coming down i'm coming down with him nice job did he like fall when i was going up i'm pretty sure that's what's happened ultimate surely safe repair like this trying to use this thing a range is so difficult we just need his bannon i finally had a wraith he tries one minute oh is didn't even see it this is huge though i currently decide i'm not there with you anyway yeah i'd love to go down nice please teammate yeah i like to reload too oh i should have just backed up an armor switched go back from spawn 250 nice good job team good job guys nice we've got third party in the back a lifeline is so clutch sometimes i got two revives two respawns look at that i'm here i mean i wish i wasn't i like this place but i am here p20 re-45 okay it's the combo of dreams you know not so fast found it big scan big scan enemy here everyone lands here but it sucks [Music] uh yeah i spent much more time standing still team unfortunately i should have banned them first i'm an idiot can i get on the roof from here okay we don't want to push this through there are more than two teams here [Music] i don't know 400 damage but i got nothing i can't believe those guys probably got away with that revive too these guys are on the roof i just want to arrange i'm just i'm just running i may as well just go back and look for a different kind of gun i mean i've got heavy there's a heavy weapon over here one more minute hello not so fast time to bind you new kill leader surely you can take the title from them thank you i'm pretty sure they got a revive okay these bonds aren't easily broken that's struggling reloading i'm going to craft some ammunition these guys are running off into the sunset i'm in desperate desperate need eyes he's zooming off to an absolutely ginormous scrap it would appear uh you have 79 i mean i crafted these but i can drop a little bit i am going to go up top i need the shield cells oh here we go they synchronized but honestly that's nearly perfect synchronization here all right come on naked vault we got this reloading coming off the side i don't think the mastiff is the greatest choice here let's put you in a bind no we went to the left because a genius i need to be careful these guys still have purple i have multi if i need it i should have just done it on the top so there were two people where did your teammate go there were two of them we started chasing back there good job people are this way zone isn't closing enemies by the team we've chased half an hour ago they've run out of cascades there are 14 people left this isn't a ranked match at that location this is a bit of a risk because i don't have any attachments on my vault i don't have any shield bats oh my god he could not be weaker finding them i assume is maybe got his wait the heck's going on here i don't need to be careful please be careful i'm scared of pushing these when there's clearly another team reloading recharging shields oh my god oh my god i need an extended mag for this vault so bad i've got literally nothing on it almost literally all right well we survived i have a decent amount of light ammo i found a extended energy mag back there i have four kps you know the start was so horrendous i got i'm never landing cascades ever again the start is so bad these are 14 seconds ago let's mess them up one less enemy one minute we have time to strategize nice job nice nice quick win pretty sure i've got my 4kp there because i went in with four i got two kills there's six it wasn't the greatest game of all time especially cascades like sucks a victory with max kp that's what we needed nice good job all right here we go the game that could take us to diamond finally i won't be nervous because i've only got six days left and i'm away over the weekend so i might have to put some overtiming to try and get to uh to masters we'll see what happens either way every rank that i'm getting now will help me in the next rank split this is a good idea we're all inside the ring i think i've ever looted down here and my entire exist up i'm heating up i'm heating up giving my shields a recharge wouldn't mind well this has gone well hey first gun fight of the day i have no clue there's a team over here actually i'm going to use that the other one seems a little bit crazy they're going to go nice job team absolutely destroyed him i love the rampage early game i've got an extra thumb right here i've got my two times around the corner got them eight thousand dollar walls at my disposal what's this punch thing i've seen people talk about it does that make you quicker is that what that is i see the pathfinder doing it look at him go he's zooming bam look at that bam look at the speeds i'm not sure i'll be doing it too much it doesn't it seemed like a the craziest movement tick of all time i'll take that not a problem did i pick up what did i pick up i might as well drop that spotted till i didn't get gold back today no you just got a blue one it's heating up apparently of this better work no he didn't work oh my god scammed he said he was heating up he died reloaded [Music] thanks everyone oh my god oh my god we've got eight parted not your fault eight parties gg that's not fun first game of the day not bad oh my god that game got us to diamond okay gonna keep on climbing this is gonna be tough it's gonna be tough uh playing solo i'll give my best shot
