hey Beast of Carthage which welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and whale plane some blood out now there a character they've cooked continuously since the game came out every time they feel a little bit more rewarded and better to play did you know that originally brewed hand scan wouldn't even track enemies it would leave behind a ghost image of the character through the war and the respawn editing the track of them he was set to one and half seconds originally and then a fifty to three seconds that's three seconds I've known where enemies are through surfaces compared to the split second ghost image that was originally shown now keep in mind that the scanty since exams three times longer than it used to be and the angle is now 125 compared to the original 90 last is the tactical ability they've booked since release the ultimate ability has also had a succession of books as well including faster burn speeds bonus time for downed enemies and reduce animation time to activate and now in season 5 there have been more buffs to brutalize tax-cut ability we've been called amp down to 25 seconds from 35 and a scan duration up to 4 seconds from 3 now when you look at the patch history of blood Hampton just makes you wonder how bad these kapenta must have been all of these especially compared to the race and the Pathfinders back then with a broken hip boxes because no low profile debuff and that was bloodhound just run around scanning people and even if it hits you just see a ghost image of them muscling or fought to play the black thing but now with these continuous buffs that becoming a really fun and ever more important and valuable member to any team in this game and I think in the next patch actually they should make this scan last for 10 seconds and it should be honest we've got a 10 second call they're just permanent both hats think about it we'll probably eventually get there season 17 rotating boulders be a water given current trends it could happen who knows so thank you for watching I really hope you enjoyed today's video if you're new around here or appreciate a subscription we're getting extremely close to 900,000 subs and then after that somehow we are on the homestretch to a million unbelievable scenes new friends CS thanks for watching I do appreciate in RC war five and a half seconds Mimi goes are in lab cities Mimi goes I've been living this job because it's always been popular and now that he's decked out with lint you can let people go down the portal which I just saw they did seen people get up their mind feel free to take that teammate you need weaponry as well found myself of all habit you think this is what you loot up before you get into the fight because if we just went down there we would have a Mozambique and nothing else and it's absolutely kicked off hey I can hear the pete wentz twenties absolutely blazing down in the laps I'm just glad that's not me want a let's go is literally looting in here I think are my bullets went into work the Pathfinders back the Lisa T is fighting with me you can take the back because I would just use it to carry 3535 then once anyway and the same amount of shots else just this one guy there's so much feedback and my screen there I'm happy you dying because I would not have been able to find him in mind in my sights there the ha wants that making orange even purple explain the see I'm not going through that you're on your own there friend I was weak anyway standing oh no you don't you okay fully killed it alright I don't my too much better purple because I was gonna keep my TiVo's anyway so now we are pretty deck fact I would say 69 more damage and I get my purple shields team has got purple your turn scan has been increasing duration and decreasing coal vein let us keep the keeper finished this is character it's unbelievable Hank absolutely I'm moonwalking the old moonwalk bamboozle turn you're on your own afraid I'm getting good if only I had that Menken stolen from Riley friend to me I can try and help so I'm trying to concentrate on those seen before this path my friends over and manages to Hoover a poor buddy chaos well goodbye I'll tell you break flaps ease they drop no recently I've been seen like this is the new school and wherever right Labs is the new school town I know it's always been popping off I don't run big these many people in there wasn't even a hot drop you just love this area and it's kind of fun because you can lend in like the central location and rotor here after you loot up because it's like a it was a back entrance thing there's a lot of sneaky way in think we should go through the portal itself and yes can't be myself to use the on i-29 have except the entire game three kills it's not too bad I'll try and single fine hemlock people I think this this game is in such a good spot there on season 5 to be honest play my favorite since like season 2 and the only reason reason I like season 2 so much is because that was the last season we didn't have too much a skill based matchmaking well that's be fair it's not feeling too bad in this season either they keep they keep they keep updating they keep changing sometimes it feels for Enda sometimes it feels alright and at the moment it's feeling pretty you okay in my opinion no soft 30 people left as well the fights are so spread out in the map of the moment people love right labs but they love everyone apparently and that's good for like the pace never game too oh he's a lunatic he's a lunatic teammate have you got your tea a genius idea oh my word nobody done it you can't hear cuz I've got voice chat disabled but I'm hoping that still went through I mean he did it anyway I got I got a big scam I'll stop stacked it oh no hostile owns the monies for getting straight in there I have one I have one sure battery and in the first season that he's an absolute travesty I've got a triple sent man on the left you drop down this is another but hand okay Shawn the fatty Nick I'm going to cut off some support just go for the loo I think okay nice there's two no rates come in Serbian to do damage I think we just do did we just both - 100 damage each artist be played by a horde used it like the only legendary gun I've used I'll use the hemlock preparing my first 13 seconds here today died it was a it was a sad time our friend like 160 maybe the damages into three separate through separate pencil not entirely sure nice job Timmy got your back that's a terrible idea if you're not fighting with me I know I know you need to heal but if two people are running at me like Connery oh okay that's why the sound Mikoto goes under the team ground upon them that wasn't me blame my team by weight it obviously needed to heal we understand it's a stupid idea for me to go for hostel okay at least one of them is down there there's another blue tank this is like a third boat and in a row Plus although there's no way he's tonight's fine get out of it I don't care what anyone says they have increased the sensitivity on like two times scopes and above on controller which i think is a good thing but I just need to get used to it like closer ranges I'm so used to the two times being like the reason I don't use that so much is because of close range sometimes it feels like you're stuck in cement it doesn't feel like that anymore I'm telling if I change something I tweeted it I don't know think anyone agreed with me make maybe one person D I'm telling you it's true if any respawn devs watch this which I sincerely do please please let me know if that's true or not she needs to get used to it at close range I'm liking the change though I'm far more contour using these scopes now because before it definitely was a bit of a problem as close range ie this graph and the distance that the pace of this season is so good I mean there's 12 people left which is kinda low but meanwhile team have just rolled through so many teams so it sort of explains II if we were to name and stuff you could you'd feel a bit hard to hide Dunbar we too are people left there fighting the distance or scrapping the distance even and I'm not involved this has to be one of the best heirlooms Bowie is top two in my opinion a natural hatchet and thanks wells gonna be careful a little bit when you're rushing it I can find like this from so far because other people could be doing the same thing and unless think okay here we go another boat ain't no Chinese the most popular carrots on the game plans never show me again oh that's so sad crawling to the octane jump pad that's the saddest thing I've ever seen hey you've got these just looking at general direction send him a text message the man the man will fall over that's so quick that guy was toward the squad's Ramin alright good was that the low birth a time I had to be but you miss me cuz she was terrible him towards us and she had no shields I believe this in single fine now because of the old heavy ammo situation that's a lifeline package god I'd love I love diving board just don't buzz my favorite place in the map where people to sit on liking on to anything about it at least we've got a path find if we need to weaken Russia oh look gob action as well that explains why I've been struggling for looting stuff the right amounts of ammo it's because I've had a level to bat the entire game there was a knife line package you can challenge them if they've got a lifeline they can stay healthy and get easy revives off feel for a second you're on land on that on therefore it's their teammate I'm brave might be useful I just want to know if they have to jump off anytime sorry oh it's time so weird yeah I think I think that you're just gonna sit there the rest of time that's not safe in the corner as well that's all safe Ryan that corner you kidding me what an absolute tragedy a modern-day travesty now if hatred go back and get stop it hey we all know you're not about this life okay if you were you jump down and fires if I tried you just go back into cover go on don't even know what I want from this care package peacekeepers not gonna be too useful crane would be nice I guess no it's already been opened friend nice obviously they've got actual take this is why I hate the tool take oh that's nice team then this is the reason I hate that you take everyone would say on top of duck let's see on top of diving board would use one don't do double-teaming my skin is already on a 25 second call then wait that means that my my scan comes back before pathfinders grapple that's great for blue 10 mains by 10 seconds as well on one word and it lasts four seconds as well it used to last two but blue ten came out I says if he was like a they were a character that was adding into the game obviously a baseball I don't I don't want doing there are the good news is they have they have to hop off absolute zero hostiles detected right that goes real far did I move nope they're just up top wait that's time 14 that's up top we need to get involve and we need to get there heck if we go over there it's cooking one guy left [Music] it's got 15 help I mean I've hit this guy for 300 didn't get the kill for that's okay good job team me absolute diving board dweebs I think God's top lane is if the diving board weeps the triple tape Mansell top there would have won that game I don't think I've ever I have ever played again you know with all the things on Kings Canyon that have been destroyed by the Leviathan stepping on them they what they couldn't step on diving board I'm starting a petition okay get the leviathans back on the map get him back on and let him step on diving board both of it I'm sick of it live it a silk that we had to wait like five minutes there just was something to happen nearly 3,000 damaged 12 kills my tours as well share the Pathfinder he loved his load this man he loved his Luke 203 damage per kill him not a clue for me it's a bit more difficult that one but thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all in the next one [Music]
