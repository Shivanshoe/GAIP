hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i would be absolutely furious if i were a lifeline main i think her kit is so outdated now if lifeline came out in season 13 her drone would fire laser beams and nearby enemies and her ultimate would be a giant aoe heal i used my ultimate in one of the games that i have for you today and all i got was a level 2 helmet a level 2 shotgun bolt that gold sniper scope and some heat shield it was horrendous it wasn't even worth waiting for she already has an heirloom as well so you can't just wait until hers comes out so they do prefer surely in season 13 they are going to have to make some lifeline changes i hope you guys enjoyed today's video thank you for watching i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends attention how are there so many people coming here this is the latest drop ever what is my car skin i think it's from the event i don't think it's very good i don't like it okay one gun i got blue armor making contact with the enemy we're all ready in the next ring i can't lock down my rampage here i just dropped teammate you actually helped that massive day this guy's got heavy and a rampage that i need i need some heavy if possible my job i can just craft it i get 125 pounds that wasn't too bad though that was fun this guy was thirsting so i guess i didn't really have anything that might have been a teammate oh i don't know i think team might lose him anyway the fuse really helped there like he's aoe like he's queue he's so helpful sometimes because that god said i mean he just had me locked down didn't they i mean lock down with a rampage and i couldn't really even move the fuse just denies that area with his ability forces them back and allows me to push up it's actually really good really helpful uh there's 18 people left there are 18 people left good grief there we are there's a respawn coming in hearts this will bring some attention not just from us but from other teams you would assume there's a good chance they come down to loot down here this might have been where they fought and where they want to return to to get their loot yeah they are pastel right here i need to be careful still got to take this carefully though ah you just want to run in nice teammate let me leave just giving my shields a recharge recharging my shields gotta let me leave please contact with house style they're gonna try and get the top oh this is either the team that was really poor for me for some reason i thought he was just going to drop down i don't have my goodness even though he said i'm going out i'm confused i don't know clean up players you're just getting a revival one listen up hopefully there's no one in here doesn't look like it look great this way let's take the building there's two teams between us careful i'm gonna get shot on every angle if we just chill out there recharging my shields that's a decoy surely we're gonna get shot in the back nice teammate this is huge need some bats i'll take that i guess careful fuse there's two teams he's going to die he's getting himself pinched pretty much gonna have to try and put some shots in on this team over here i don't know what he's doing how did he get all the way over there is he feeling okay i told him about eight times what was gonna happen two teams honest man okay there are two separate rev teams this is the worst thing that's ever happened okay no it was the worst thing that's ever happened but then that turning to my accuracy was the worst thing that's ever happened just giving my shields a recharge how did i miss every single shot there it's an absolute mystery i need some shield so i'm gonna try and grab some there are enough death boxes we try and reposition we have to go that way but it's gonna be hard with this team here going uh to the left of this mountain so i guess we can just reposition we can still stick around and sort of poke them as long as we protect this like escape route we should be fine because there are these two teams and one of the team so we still want to be near the action this is just going to be a balance one minute until the ring closes and everything here has gone forward so the team's gonna get interested in us it was obvious always going to happen there okay that's what i meant before you know in a in a previous video i mentioned how sometimes like teammates positioning and that's honestly the easiest thing you can change is just learning to position better better just position better so i need to use my t's you need to learn to position better there are two teams fighting there don't put yourself in a spot where they can both shoot you you're gonna die here we go maybe now we can get behind them sneak behind these guys this way shield battery here i don't need four bats with gold armor probably don't need uh three but i'm gonna look to try and arm switch on someone's red or maybe purple i should have picked up a thermite grenade there are definitely a few there it's not really a good spot for it is it hey dan one though care package being delivered amigos nice i think it's 31 actually come on are they that's my question i can't just leave him there or we can send him back with not much help in his own reloading the lifeline's still behind the tree lock we could get flank too i heard someone behind like two other teams fighting that way no they're still trying to come this way nice teammate recharging machines will get flanked i think that's huge let's come back to it though taking fire i knew there'd be someone there watching that angle oh don't leave me don't leave me teammates recharging just giving my shields and recharge these two bins and i'll go and help you you see there's two bins here let's go this way i'm gonna line up those two then go and help you no no no no no no there's a 99 i don't have a gun that's my name don't worry [Music] i didn't realize what was going on be honest okay i'm glitching this guy just came in and robbed all the stuff it's this way warner find a whole different unit oh give me a sec okay well where am i getting shot from i'm getting shot through the window i can't tap actually we'll tap this time this won't hurt no i'll die okay i have no revives i'm i'm traveling you're not even doing your job oh my god oh oh that is coming we're getting padded on no we're not is i don't really have much ammo so i'm just sticking it now she's budget she's won the horizon he's won one i'll go through the brave i've played this he's got the other day and ranked i defeated that's kind of a common name oh maybe it is nice oh there was a guy on the roof that was really weak i need shotgun ammo i don't know where he's now though so yeah somewhere i hear him what are you doing it's the same rotation every game baby i'm 130 ping over here that's why i wasn't reviving you know that's why i was so late i was actually trying to tap but he wasn't he wasn't working i was just lagging makes sense 100 flipping gamer over here i have my lifeline uh thingy what's it called oh oh lifeline lifeline that's it uh i have so much ammo now right um do you know what i just got from my lifeline back level two helmet level two helmet level two shotgun bowl heat shields and uh one of those gold sniper scopes that's because there's no attachments it just gives you attachment it was not worth me waiting for it nice i mean there's like there's no end games in this mode no it's like all the stars yeah yeah that's it the games are so fast it's so anticlimactic all i did at the end was i shot the guy on the roof once and then i tried to first a mirage i definitely possibly ran into my own nade wait that race skin is sick what the heck where is that from which one's that one i didn't see it that well looks sick she's all like pulsating like like oh yeah look at her whoa she's like thor oh seven minute game mate
