hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and i warned you guys that the wingman gameplays were coming and i was not kidding around i've got another two games of wingman gaming here for you today and i i will admit i was a bit hit and miss more miss at the start of this game but i did start to pop off towards the end that is until an infamous glitch in apex happened at the worst possible moment and sent me through an enemy watson fence into enemy territory it was an incredibly sad moment but i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends scared of me good i'm okay rich you can't even grip your controller properly how are my hands small you know i think yours must be bigger i can't i just can't uh i've got one arm and i'm going in yeah yeah yeah i never want to play this game again like never i gonna see started giving my shields a recharge obama i don't want this guy to die on his own i'm gonna just kind of wait for him let me know if you hear anything oh yeah big scrap near me okay i'm going i'm just anything else in there hmm no no no yeah it was a helmet and a down but sorry doing those we're like 15 seconds out recharging shields oh my god see ya nice one of the trucks i'm right in the fight nice oh my god just leave or something no that's i think that's lower but i got kill credit for the first guy oh did you leave or maybe he's down a bunch of times oh possibly from uh low ball i am i've never been so bad you are struggling i've never made worse decisions in my entire life i nearly altered to this when there's a rope right here so oh man now you know what's even worse though is i had to scroll through about like 40 sections of loot in order to pick that heat shield and you were uh you're in the zone just a little knowledge oh wait we're big in zone we're in the zone bigly yeah i'm noticing a pattern don't listen to where i want to take us if i follow you you just end up like a mile and zone that's why it goes mate that's just the way it is wait okay let's try rifle guy proud of your three damage per shot pretty deadly oh that you just got destroyed there should be not somebody else on the bridge so we can probably come up behind them yes i have a level one nightmare and it's kind of depressing i feel that on this side of the rock he's reviving there one right here too once it's underneath here oh that was close only these homies he's going to the rope he is probably gone okay below me maybe wow imagine being as bad as me i don't think it's possible um no i can't imagine that okay i knew that was gonna happen so i'll just wait here i'm a genius it's crazy oh we're definitely gonna get we're gonna dine some ah probably yes yes very disappointed no one's got any light bags man is in the crafter no it's a level one light meg and i'm so so sad there's wisdom that's our teammate from a few games was it really oh that was it was either blue toned yeah the bloodhound that we won that game with they see the guy just killed he was uh he was he's delightful oh god no looks like he carried us um i had the most kills out of all of us so i would say that i carried way more damage i had the many kills i would uh i would like to take the championship you could not keep up with the damage numbers imagine only getting six kills again uh could you drop me like just one syringe place yeah thank you but yeah thank you thanks that's above and beyond mate that's a true teammate she said oh yeah here's somebody yeah there's someone in here too always has to talk recharging shield he was downloading your building he's running now can i squeeze through this oh oh my head just bounced off oh my god i'm the wingman beast oh he's i'm gonna try and climb up i think this guy needs to rise oh this is a sad sad day no it's right okay no no no the game i've died to a glitch mate i've died to a glitch do you know when you can't climb up on this building oh yeah i did like launches the inside i don't know if you guys have had this before but for some reason every now and again when you try and climb this wall in four story it does the animation of you climbing but instead of sending you on top of the building it actually sent you down into the rope shaft this wasn't my fault like i'm not kidding it's an actual glitch and i don't know what causes it or when it happens it's just very unfortunate it's a very very sad day anyway the next game that i have for you guys is actually the same teammate we randomly bumped into him again a few games later we finished second in the first game because i was dead uh and we're gonna go for the win in the second one i've made you do that because there's a purple over here so the time that you were in the back you weren't grappling over this purple i mean that's fine you needed more than me forget that three are you sure have you been playing you've been today oh okay you have not been playing here much better than i have reached okay very red but it happens like this so like do you want to leave me alone or something or what my iron my homie don't you stop following me oh yeah that's what you get what's on my head you just honestly shoot all blue oh my god oh yes very damage two let's go baby we are thriving today i need to recharge my shields grappling into a fight i'm going down confidence is an all-time high sounds good oh he's one hp oh it's costing need to recharge my shields we're coming the squats here here i go oh traps no oh my god save me i think doors anything to do with doors hinges anything like that i was getting patient always kick it and they always cancel and they always shoot me i can't help it though if they're just sitting there here then i have to i can't let them get away from the ring it's close at least i feel that because you gotta fake it you gotta play mind games yeah i really wanna eat my subway rate my subway i've said it before but turkey ladies tomorrow do you come back honey mustard um quite healthy for a subway not terrible i'm not a fan of tomatoes i'm not a fan of honey mustard it's grown up what's that or what is it tomatoes how do you not have big hands yeah troy you win just happens it's just life that's right big troye they're dropping a replica well we found our scrap and it happens a tree we should have known to rotate a tree we should have known can't wait to do two damage no he's moving that's just no oh oh six seven six broken broken broken it's really low watch out i started these guys the reason i thought the one was for that are you up there yes but there's a lifeline on me 71 on this lifeline i had to commit to that i'm taking shots oh valkyrie's residence i was throwing i was throwing ark styles and the game at the same time i don't know why i'm starting off guys i'm not a pc player not messing keyboard the ring is in close proximity less than one minute it's understandable okay is there ever going to be a better bolt ever less than 30 seconds rings nearby four squads left this is a massively different game to our other games it's close at least how much damage you have huh eight hundred not loads why did that turn on me i was just saying the game was slow no no no no oh oh okay oh that makes sense it's delayed it was delayed but i saw it and i would like you to know that i have over a hundred more damage than you even though i'm playing like an unboxing so you should just feel terrible you should feel terrible yeah you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to follow me that one's almost broken i fixed every shot how did he heal oh it's gold ah found me two see you right thanks for playing right uh oh we are in zone once again once again we are throwing we saw the right lead for me body shield here level four these are here he's right here let's explore this way okay this guy's just a demon mirage [Music]
