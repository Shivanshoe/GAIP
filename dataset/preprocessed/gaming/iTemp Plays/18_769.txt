hey mr. Gossett which welcome back to another video before I get into the intro properly here I would like to share with you some exciting news I have resigned with GE or they have let me back on the team once more and my code I temp gets you 30% all of their products until Monday and if you're gonna pick a product of tropical rain I hear is the best flavor but they're all pretty much say thank you for that and I'll just let you get into the video hey what's up guys its rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and the first confirmed details for season 5 which is on the way on the 12th of may have been revealed of course the new character coming with the start of the season is confirmed as Lobo we also got to see her in the story animation which premiered earlier on today on apex legends and YouTube channel it gave a little bit of law on the character she comes across as her stealthy and a deceptive type of legend two shows a little bit of mobility perhaps which is always fun I know ruff yeah bothers I'm saying so here the details the first look of loba outside the animation the first thought 'is she is going to have the coolest heirloom on the game what is that some sort of it's of a cocaine or something he's like a dog head cane and he's described as being resourceful and whenever she wants she takes she's gonna steal your loot essentially he's what they're trying to say she's gonna take your gold armor and leave you with nothing and then kill you I would assume and then of course you get the new battle past coming to season 5 as well called a fortunes favor this over 100 exclusive items in the battle passes well now this is the juicy parts introducing quests hunt for treasure and answers in the new season quest those who complete the journey will be richly rewarded now the question here is whether or not this is an in-game quest or not are they going to put us in quests in the game and the reward is going to be loot or which means what I assume is gonna be here is it going to be a series of challenges to complete over the course of the season much like the weekly challenges that we have at the moment and the reward is going to be skins new law and who knows what else if you guys have any speculation here let me know in the comments section as always and lastly we have the change to ranks or lack thereof we still get two splits with a soft reset in between we still play on two maps however a big change is the introduction of a reconnect which helps a turn with times even in lucky with game crashes or internet loss for example far less frustrating being able to just reconnect to the game that you were playing rather than losing 70 RP yes those are some of the details that we have here the season 5 and it is rumoured or confirmed actually by a dev that we are going to get an incredibly good season 5 trailer coming soon enough is well so thank you for watching I do appreciate it I'll see you all with the gameplay in five and a half seconds my friends make this two teams then here kettle oh I try to grappling I'm uh I'm got to retreat I'm out of here yep I'm out there in a separate direction but I'm also okay cause II I run into a course if I'm coming to you Oh what is the perp wore I still don't have a gun though but put a charge rifle okay the knowledge no equation I still

stuff thank you they're just sitting up there dude do we I can't challenge that to be honest that all just south there I honestly don't think I can change now I'm hitting them I hit him here I'm cooking them the only way if you listen I give a crap across if you grab a cross underneath them it'll give me the opportunity to hit the pad on them yeah yeah he's pointing wait I'm going for it yeah going to man I'll bet shirk my friend oh yeah nice that's what you get I did his weight this is the most horrendous triple take skin like he's one of the legendary ones where he's got the goat horns someone's beneath it so I did think I'll be using one is it there's a possum way as well 400 for a whopping 10 good level one Evo so I just melted his face off rest in peace can I just keep opening closing the door if you wonder what's going on there I have one bat in four cells I have three sounds so maybe just one okay perhaps at least then we can both get well if you take I've got a battery so take to you thank you very much thank you let me just push this team right absolutely then we get him the hack in freak out of here I keep forgetting zeros you know I keep respecting someone else to keep so to rock up my personal experience as a leaves a couple more people to pull up yeah launch night and he did nothing not missed I'm gonna grab a laptop I think you can do here yeah they're up there with you there's a Pathfinder all my papers absolutely readied I think it's right I'll just hit either one with an Arkansas triple circle you could say that um lost fog top they never expect it you just get free damage on them it's yeah it's great all those little windows there's so many of those windows yeah once you learn about it and you just do it you can do on so many different buildings yeah you can wait see old CDs there's an old tear trying to go up was a pathfinder up there I'm down to go up absolutely whoa no shields but I'm screwed hold on I hit him for a lot no he jumped down behind me tap on her on my head oh he grabbed you grab the weight findeth I don't know why they waited this long it's kind of irritating that they didn't rotate look at his own path down low right here finishing me it's got purple you got this let's go wait you got him what else up up self Rose must hope is not costly because he'll be up by now I can hear him he's weak charter there we go nice job grief it's gone ah miss which for you now hey the balls I have once terrain which we can we can I see you right now sir I can give you I can give you a MEK it oh yes please thanks very much thank you ah crap look bad I had one triple take you shot yes I did switched around and then reloading jump down usually when you when you like they play pass up that whole time they were in that building while we were fighting the other team yeah no one of them was childless that from the start sorry I just did not expect him to jump down I was like you didn't push us while we were fighting why would you push now top my head I started doing the finishing move and they tried to PKA did you expect him just stop with the finishing move cuz yeah well lots of people be doing that when you block your shield like when you have your knockdown yeah dildo starts the finisher and then cancel the finisher so your knockdown goes away then they thirsty because he had his PK oh if he's pretty small I can alter up top here a second all right drop it down here if I can't please any time I'm tonight we don't even need it right I mean you feel lady yeah it would be nice to be honest do you need syringes no I just want to try to get out at the head of it yeah I might make it a month oh my god one tick no I risked it we got only had the one make it I was like oh my god I want to get in you mental save it yeah I asked my last syringe it's pretty good that you know that's good we're gonna get some gold arm here what the hope should come maybe the Volks would come with like a right arm sometimes how cool would that be with a fully done up evil yeah yeah there is indeed oh I would like them to get rid of gold shield oh it's full exodia up in here yeah everyone it's all you here take it compete you're complete yourself here complete the collection yeah thanks very much thank you wait did we not get that oh he used it in nails and I say that's what you have any laws like I think you would have already checks good once we're in just one syringe yes back in the game [Music] all right do you need cells I've got five cells as it I have four cells in a battery so yeah take everything we think we'd be like in this game don't look upon mean but we're fine for like armor obviously but everything else dude I went to three buildings at the start to find a gun they shot Papelbon yeah that was good looks but well good is purple if I can't shoot them back there's a joke that's true whoa who's this man okay we both completed in the set of exodia's we are I think would do the art right I'll show batteries oh this guy had shield cells I just love it I need any triple take what they called attachments that's the one - nah nobody uses you've got a P K's yeah they don't
