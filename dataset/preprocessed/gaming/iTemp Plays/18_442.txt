hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and we are playing the second of five game modes as part of the war games event here on apex you guys may have seen that there were a few books with the respawn game mode so apex decided to release the second mode a little bit early which is uh shield regeneration and the shield regens really quickly i was kind of concerned that it was going to be a slow heal and you sort of had to stay out of the fight for ages but you need to wait seven seconds between getting shot at for it to regenerate and it takes probably about eight seconds to fully regen your shield after that and you can shoot people whilst it regenerates as well there are no shield cells but there are batteries in the game which are kind of worth carrying because if your shield gets cracked you do have to wait longer for it to start regenerating and the bat can get you back into the action quicker so hopefully you guys enjoyed the video thank you for watching and i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends nice dude let's go i'm still 120 um yeah i mean i'm on like 90. it's like a nice so i can't
