all of the footage here was recorded early thanks to ea game changers there she is she's going to beat you up oh my word oh no oh gosh oh ari doesn't want to no she's not part of the recording no she's she's gone it's all right team we are here we are previewing the season seven battle pass here we are already honest can i just like this is the the screen um like obviously they're just the lobby look at the colors it's beautiful you've got the beautiful cherry blossom japan esque trees you got the beautiful architect architecture in the background and all the skins sort of fit in with this theme um and it's just beautiful it's a absolutely stunning season and the battle pass is fit for it as well so the first thing you get here is a prairie skin it's a legendary powder skin called the polish perfection it also comes with three base skins for horizon revenant and blue toned in there as well which i'll hover over kind of slower for you so you can just get a bit of a look but they definitely just fit the color scheme and the theme of the season really well i'm not gonna hover over everything and be like this is some xp this is you know a little pack that you can open i will try and focus more on the skins for the guns and also for the legends as well so the next one that comes up is a lot of crepe skin called the strong influence it's a rare one and with every seasonal battle by skin i love to max it out uh as soon as like day one because we've got some tunes on the go i like to max it out day one and then apply every single gun camo and every single legend camo so i'm fully updated with the new season skins here's our longbow one with a nice little geometric white and red design there called the sunspot we have a banner frame for bloodhound with like a geometric arthur there as well who's actually kind of blinged out with some beautiful jewelry that's kind of nice i i appreciate that what's this well that's what she sounds like there's the ray skin that we saw in the trailer it's called high class so it's sort of a strange fray skin i mean i'm gonna use it and i do like it that's a kind of a small cape it's a good race skin it just sort of throws me off a little bit to see with i don't know she just looks so different we've got a g7 scale here as well obviously my favorite gun in the game along with the prowler and we've already got to see those two gun camos i'll be throwing these on day one as i said a little weapon charm there which is one of the balloons it looks like what's it called diamond drop it looks like one of the balloons that keeps horizon oh can you see that in the loading screen one of these look pretty sure that's what it is uh where on earth was i uh i was on this page we've got ourselves a triple take skin called the focused strategy nice little white and pink design there as well level 31 on the battle pass you get so attacked i've seen ghosts around here i didn't mean to hover over that so i apologize i'm mainly trying to focus on like the the banner poses are good as well i guess like the little mirage banner pose here or banner frame even i should say charge rifle here we go we're getting into the meat and gravy of this of the season now this thing if you're on pc you're going to get charged rifled a lot this season and i assume you will be doing a lot of charge rifling yourself dweeb machine as it's known around these parts called sun baked uh no gun cameras on there here we go this is one of the best skins that i've seen it's for octane of course called fast fashion he is looking modern i'm liking this hairstyle i might go into the hairdresser's the barber shop and just show them the skin and see if i can pull it off i very much doubt if i could so never mind i'm actually not going to do that idea it would be horrendous we've got ourselves a hemlock skin on this page as well called lavender looks this skins sorry this this page in general is big value we've got four gun skins and two character skins next up we have a free p2020 skin called the fragmentary we have ourselves a free sentinel skin here called the particle play and we have a free skin for the vault which is called confetti as well and we have to get ourselves a free ray skin the second raid skin in the battle pass this one is called royal guard this one's nice i like that royal purple and gold combination i'm not sure if i prefer that to the other one or not the other one may grow on me what's this oh it's a skydive emo for horizon she's playing with her little i don't know i'm not sure what to call i think yeah i don't really have a clue a banner frame for horizon on this page as well um oh this is beautiful this is when they're trying to escape because the rocket ship has just uh has just went without them and pathed pathfinder rocks up with the uh the drop ship here and mirage can escape from world's edge to olympus so on the next page we have the flatline skin this one is called parallax kind of a nice design i'm liking that we've got an r301 skin here as well called starstruck it's got the little stars on there oh it's nice i'm a fan that's the skydive emote this one's for watson she's playing with the nessie oh that's great it's a shame that i literally never play watson unless by accident maybe i'll have to play it just to use that emote uh here we have the retrograde havoc skin i always like previewing havoc skins because i just love the animation that comes with it like it's ready to charge up and go with this one's called retrograde we have another skydive emote called raven rampage here for pathfinder this one is well worth a watch because we may get to watch this one plenty of times this season oh my word he is going wild he's always getting just the the ravens always come for pathfinder and skydiving mode and i'll tell you what i'm sick of it he's getting bullied by these things it's not it's not fair uh we have a spitfire skin called the borealis the borealis the borax the bora alice the borealis that's what that one's called um i mean i want to make this my desktop screen my my desktop background it's it's beautiful i love it little gun charm here of a little bonsai tree it looks like i'm not sure if that's the correct name but it's beautiful as well in a little plant pot uh a little gun charm that's the one we've already seen it's difficult going between the pages the light pollution devo skin here very bright very vibrant and as soon as you start um charging this gun up as well you're going to have like the the muzzle flash going with that skin didn't mean to hover over you but that's tremendous as well another little gibraltar skydive emote called good vibes he's playing the ukulele he's having a great time look at him go just diving on down to olympus i like these these things because you get to see the map in the background as well which i've already featured i assume uh don't think i missed anything on this page this is horizon when she leaves her son behind to go on that mission uh again to the end of the bow pass here we're getting close this is the l star skin called scorched which is kind of funky i like this kind of psychedelic in its own way uh gun charm here of a vehicle called cruise control that's one of the what's it called one of the tridents all like gold-plated imagine if we get trident skins this season uh coming into the shop that would be tremendous catching the current this is a rampant skydive emote she throws down one of her shields oh that's actually pretty smart i like that and she gets to serve down on the airwaves rather than uh how you would traditionally use a surfboard which is obviously on the sea and here is what we've all been waiting for the end of the battle pass first of all you get uh the energy crisis background which was in the recent season seven trailer you guys saw some more apex coins you get a uh epic guaranteed pack here so you can get some good skins and some good uh gun charms for yourself you get a free r99 skin so even if oh this one's avant-garde it looks like the starstruck one but it's the same it's the same color scheme um but if you do buy the premium battle pass you get yourself the last three levels level 99 level 100 and then all the way up to level 110 what does the badge look like i love these animated battle pass badges it's beautiful i like it a lot what's the longbow called it's called forward thinker here level 99 on the battle pass this is giving me big christmas vibes i'm going to try and do a christmas video with this longbow skin we got the the the green the gold next up we have the r99 skin called cutting edge this thing looks incredible i have seen some footage of this and when you fire you get to see when your body are depleting like right in the middle here right here if you can see and this is a reactive camera as well so it's the r99 not only is it flawless it's kind of pearlescent as well look reminds me of neither speed underground back in the day i've just decoded a coarser or something put some pearlescent paint on there but the t-110 is called the revolutionary it's the same sort of vibe it's the same skin but of course with a different recolor and it is tremendous i cannot wait to fully max out my battle pass throw these skins on throw this badge on as well but there you go there is the season seven preview of the battle pass i mean i missed out on some of the smaller things like along the way or not even you have to admit that was awesome thank you octavio silver you've got uh obviously some backgrounds that i missed in there as well but you will be able to see uh the entire battle pass for yourself on the fourth thank you for watching this little battle pass preview i do appreciate it and i will see you all in the next one bye
