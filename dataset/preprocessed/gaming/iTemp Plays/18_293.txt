hey what's up guys it's rich welcome back to another video today we are playing some more apex legends of course and today we are using the hemlock which is a gun that i've been overlooking this season and i think everyone else has as well a few seasons ago this was the crutch weapon that would melt your face off in two quick bursts but then it got nerfed and people stopped using it but it's a sleeper gun it's still so good and now i've got a soft spot for burst weapons because well i think it stems back to black ops 2. i don't know how many of you guys watching this video watch my black ops 2 videos back in the day but catch me with an m8a1 with stuck on it in league play i was dominating masters or diamond whatever the top part was i can't remember it was like eight years ago the m8a1 like give me your first gun and i'm in my comfort zone now today i've got a solo game and then after that i've got a game with so far as well so hopefully you enjoyed the variety and the video in general thank you for watching i do appreciate it i'll see you all in five and a half seconds my friends the eyes on the prize i have one teammate this guy's got no teammates you get him it's already going for the purple one my teammate he's going to get the purple that's fine i thought he was going to grapple to the purple shield to be honest okay this isn't joe's by the way this is trios i just don't actually make left and i don't know why i have eyes on the enemy this might make them want to push reloading i think we did well as a team there though uh what did i take from that i did take but i needed no i've got enough ammo i took the extended heavy and i took the barrel stabilizer i mean it's not too bad though i was in a bit of a panic a bit of a rush because they were breathing down her neck i should have probably healed up my blue because i assume it was very close to purple but whatever one minute until the ring closes and everything here is gone forever i kicked it to try and distract her and to make some noise drive in position we took out the whole squad we're a good little duo here 74 damage from red just absolutely joining someone's purple is the lifeline these guys were fighting for so long before we arrived i'm tempted to throw my ultimate down i don't think i can get loads of stuff that'll be um but i'm just looking for an extended energy give me one sec that'll do i'm coming home i like the sound of that reloading i don't know it's a good job i remember this was here okay i didn't take two items from this so if there's a phoenix kit it was probably one of those boxes but i don't want to sit in the open when we've just made that much noise with what like 42 health not happening i'm gonna play it safe i've been playing for ages today and i keep dying in the most ludicrous ways had energy as well there's that extending mag that was sad i didn't take someone fired that way but i want to go cap like we just go cap oh okay me and the teammate kind of frying kind of frightened think it's when you're when you're a duo it's way easier to stay next to each other i feel like you're more of a compact team you sort of force into it you know um i think that's an alternator i'm pretty sure that's that's a mini little alternator on the cards here i mean i've been enjoying the vault where is he ready to go here it is it's not using energy i'm going to drop some of those because i will probably have to pick up another gun and if there's a vault around i'm going to take those attachments maybe i'll carry something i mean there's a one of the biggest ropes you've ever seen going up top though oh that team's third party too all right we're going into this i feel like we both understand the assignment and we both we both know the consequences of our actions here there's about 12 teams over this way if we go up this rope when we die then we go up and on this rope and we die you know but we do it together come on fuse around the back enemy no teammates how's he shooting me i guess they were teammates they're big scrapping i mean like there's so much clutch on my screen i literally can't see anything there my gun's firing like a like a star wars blaster you know die oh my god i was trapped though i really wanted to i mean their whole team their whole teams down there gg teammate we knew what we were getting into gg gg i just thought the end of that one because it was a good game i think there's no way yeah i don't really remember the game too much to be honest i've most mp20 but i've got purple i just got purple right in front of me must be nice all right enemies right here hmm come on i've only got a mozam both of them oh my god but this wraith is popping off of that stupid gun kill leader [ __ ] man say thank nice mate i'm telling you i'm probably better with the mozam than i am the either i'm going back to pick them up no cap zero cabbage there's no way you use a gun for like a day and then you think you're just the worst of it i suck with the evac okay well i sucked with the uh the 30 30 forever one more i'm just the greatest right there i'll use the pk let me have it blows what no way what how do we go from eva to pk the game blows oh okay so do you literally just do this to yourself i'm dead literally holding hands down the lake like actually his shoulder shoulder how many likes will that get camera i am slow healing i don't know where they are i did so much damage when they were running straight to i think i've literally just done 500 damage as they're running towards this that's my red that's my red that's my red yes no i need heavy ammo [Music] i think one fell off the edge maybe they did oh is that what that box is there okay i am repairing myself um oh my god [ __ ] on the back can't hit anything with this hollow i'd take it off all right i missed every single shot there so you know on the right crack there one phoenix we just grenade the whole squad exciting i have one heavy bullet uh i have 150 for my hemlock of doom i'm popping off this game like trinity what what gonna using oh yeah hold on yeah it's a tiny bit i find something else i'll switch i have six assists i have eleven kills and two thousand damage baby nice low-key kind of frying i was only a little three-time patching myself up any heavy no one's using heavy oh bit more heavy 16. sometimes it's 30 30 isn't it it's fun gun but sometimes it's just not i'm trying to get like through turbine but i only decided just now ah where do you want to go because you always find people left or right ah you're having a good game i'm fine yeah no following you because you know where to go i really don't though i just go off instincts that's all we need just stop thinking and then just walk forwards close your eyes through it's actually all i do that's literally all i do in my everyday life that's why you're walking so many problems mate probably that's why we gotta listen to the boy yep nine people left i'm going to get every single kill dropping 20. uh no yes why do you want me to be yeah yeah absolutely not me no one doesn't actually save their life sent that guy back it sounds like right beneath me there's a fuse in there gonna there's a quick down here gonna die to a bottom fence away i picked i shocked him for 100. where could they be oh my god you know team left though a little bit late thank goodness we didn't know where oh a weird angle what they say not hitting 400k die mate she's got what i'm running literally god killer i stuck with the bk i tried to let you just get those kills oh my god i suck i can't say that after you drop a big game no that was there's a lifeline with white armor in the final fight of the game i think it probably just got raised probably to be fair oh my god what is wrong with me that's so fun
