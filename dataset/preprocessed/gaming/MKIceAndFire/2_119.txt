hey lloyd the core my focus is showing holograms on it they look like machines there must be overrides knowledge on how to tame machines let's find out i can send it to my stash looks like festus has been upgrading the security grid on the cauldrons the date has been corrupted not sure i can do much about that right now and my focus doesn't recognize some of these must be machines i haven't seen yet got what you need yes let's press on then [Music] [Music] [Music] greetings graduates of great online welcome to the uh that doesn't sound good was that the spirit minerva i don't think so at least not directly attention a whole personnel must vacate the facility immediately something doesn't want us here [Music] what exactly was this place seen anything like it before no there that's our way out [Music] initiate your facility lockdown stay out what's going on well at least the emergency lights work what just happened minerva's definitely here and i think it's trying to keep us out i'll scout ahead see if there's a way to get us in you sure we shouldn't come with you well yeah minerva could be dangerous let me make sure it's safe okay we'll be right here if you need us huh okay i need to find where minerva's hiding i should look for a way to access the facility systems [Music] restricted access you are not wanted here nope sorry you're not getting rid of me that easily minerva this leads dead end what are all those cables in the center for my nervous shutting me out guess i'm not going that way i can feel a draft above might be a way out of this shaft looks like another part of the facility door is locked and i'm outside i need to find a way back into the facility maybe i could look for a way in higher up the mountain if i can get minerva to cooperate i can merge it with gaia finally bring her back and we can start fixing the blight the storms and maybe she can help me figure out who those strangers in the proving lab were why did they have a clone of elizabeth why did they want to back up pipes up there might lead me to a way back in but how to reach them i might be able to glide to that ledge some of those rocks look loose i think i can clear them ah another shaft okay now i've got to find a way to plug into this place that looks like some kind of dome alert system corey no minerva i need the console please access denied it didn't used to be like this do you remember it [Music] anything you were part of something bigger once something good gaia that's right she can live again but only if you give her the chance i can't reboot her without you [Music] will i cease i think you'll disappear into her become part of her like you used to be answering this yes thank you thank you minerva [Music] elizabeth alpha prime master override activated restoring minerva function to original code do you wish to initiate heuristic matrix here goes [Music] [Music] one [Music] greetings dr sobek [Music] [Music] so it is aloy not elizabeth we have much to discuss but initialization of my heuristic matrix will not be complete for several minutes more in the meantime i suggest you familiarize yourself with this facility it is our best option for a base of operations and you can make use of its equipment to improve your ability to override machines um yeah yeah that that sounds good shall i grant access to your companions they will be here shortly um okay but don't overwhelm them okay they don't have a lot of experience with things like well you [Music] ah so no fake this time no this time she's real laurel so this is skya hello hi hi guy is still uh waking up let's look around i will highlight the location of the lab on your focus i have established a network between your focuses allowing you to communicate when apart good so what was this place a regional control center where zero dawn progeny would have overseen terraforming operations in the area [Music] i suggest you explore this facility eloy until my initialization is complete you will be able to improve your machine override capabilities in the lab aloy i require more time to complete my initialization i suggest you explore this facility what's all this this was intended as the main gathering space for control center operatives you could fit a good number of people in here or maybe just a few to start with you two go ahead i'm going to poke around a bit oh i've been down here before that's where i first got into the facility what's all this stuff for this facility was designed to process an immense amount of data from the terraforming system this is where it would have been stored hey gaia why doesn't this door have power at my current operating level i am only able to restore functionality to part of this facility in time that may change got it looks like an office correct the facility was designed with a number of private offices i guess it's nice to have a space to call your own this would have been an access point for advanced training modules on terraforming operations unfortunately those modules were deleted when the apollo database was destroyed that's too bad what's this space for this would have been the sleeping quarters for control center operatives reminds me of the bed house aspirants had to sleep in the night before the proven [Music] door's locked maybe guy will be able to get it open later looks like another office if no one's ever been here who built all this gaia did with the help of machines so this place was here all this time built for people who would never show up why didn't they remember that guy i told you about ted pharaoh he sabotaged things it wasn't supposed to be this way through that door is a trail that leads towards plain song so i could head back east if i need to once we're done here correct [Music] so this was supposed to be the lab that was its intended purpose some of the machine data you recovered from the repair bay below us appears to be corrupted accessing the terminal in this room will show you how to repair and complete the override i'll take a look [Music] oh looks like i need data from machine parts to fix the corrupted override my initialization is complete you may continue to explore the facility when you are ready return to the control room we have much to discuss eli you have now visited all accessible rooms of the facility [Music] that door leads to the west exit but before you leave we have much to discuss right okay maybe it's time to talk to gaia i'll leave you to it hello eloy hi so you're ready yes the initialization is complete all tests show that my heuristic matrix launched correctly and is stable you must have many questions yeah but two big ones first we're not going to be able to fix the biosphere without making you whole i ran a search for your sub-functions at the hades proving lab but minerva was the only one i found thankfully the sensory capabilities of this facility are far more advanced i will search for the others now transmitting query pattern receiving of apollo artemis and olivia i can find no trace they are simply gone what about the others ether demeter and poseidon are revealed they lie within reach procurable and hephaestus it too stands revealed but it is not like the others that's for sure in the years since the extinction signal aphestus has evolved moreover it is not confined to a single location it haunts the global network that connects cauldrons to each other across the planet making it exceptionally difficult to subdue let me guess we need it bad correct its capabilities are essential without it i can only delay the extinction of life on earth hephaestus is our only hope of a permanent solution so we start there unfortunately we cannot procuring hephaestus can only be attempted after my own capabilities have been significantly enhanced grab the other supported functions first then hephaestus precisely so so ether demeter and poseidon how do i capture them to recover a subordinate function you will have to travel to its location and find the physical processor to which it escaped then exactly as you did with minerva you must use the master override to revert the subordinate function to its original code state and then how do i get it back here the subordinate function must be loaded onto a data storage device and physically carried back to this facility the cartridge your root kernel was stored on yes its capacity is limited so it can only carry one subordinate function at a time but in all other respects it will suffice maybe you can help me make sense of something a while ago i had a run-in with a group of strangers who tried to kill me they had machine servitors and a um uh a clone of elizabeth sobek with them yes this was recorded by your focus do you know who they are the answer to that question is related to the extinction signal that woke hades prompting my predecessor self-destruction the extinction signal okay that sounds ominous the signal did not come from earth aloy the calculations are complicated but it appears to have originated 81 trillion kilometers away [Music] a distance so vast that light itself requires 8.611 years to cross it okay so what's so far away and and why does it want us dead the serious star system serious but that's where far zenith their ship the odyssey yes that's where it was headed but it blew up unless i don't why make it seem like they failed they didn't want anyone to know they didn't want future humans to think that they were out there wait the strangers who tried to kill me at the hades proving lab the ones with the clone are you saying that they're from that they're descendants of farseeneth yes that is my conclusion the three subordinate functions that you detected what do we know about them all three are relevant to problems currently plaguing the biosphere ether is responsible for detoxifying the atmosphere and moderating the weather poseidon controls the organic and chemical composition of water resources demeter sows fertilizes and tends to plant life if all three were restored to me they would constitute a massive increase to my heuristic processing density but beware their responses to my query pattern were irregular in human terms they are frightened lost and paranoid like minerva they need to be whole again exactly the missing subordinate functions what can you tell me about them artemis rewilded the earth with a variety of animal species elutio was responsible for gestating nurturing and culturing a new generation of human beings apollo was tasked with preserving organizing and disseminating vast archives of human knowledge and cultural achievements unfortunately all archived apollo data was purged on the 2nd of february 2066 by order of ted pharaoh pharaoh huh i really hate that guy understandable he appears to have been pathologically narcissistic impulsive and unstable all three of the missing functions have already served their purpose or were prevented from doing so do you still need them if attainable yes restoring their remaining elements would increase my heuristic processing density unfortunately i have no way to track them they have disappeared without a trace you said you need hephaestus to save life from extinction why every subordinate function has value but hephaestus is by far the most important only by recovering and merging it can i regain my ability to design and mass produce new machines at cauldrons across the planet only through it can i program new machines and alter the tasking of existing machines to completely reverse environmental damage recovering other subordinate functions may buy us time but without hephaestus i cannot permanently stave off mass extinction given hephaestus's importance is there really no way to capture and merge it first i'm afraid that is quite impossible in my present state launched and merged with minerva i am operating at less than one-fifth 18.8 of my intended processing capacity the festus dwarfs this figure where an attempt made to conduct the merge under these circumstances hephaestus would absorb me rather than the other way around a merge cannot be attempted until my heuristic processing density exceeds its own and how many subordinate functions is that going to take merging ether demeter and poseidon will expand my heuristic network to 41.6 capacity exceeding that of hephaestus you said hephaestus isn't located in just one place correct unlike the other subordinate functions which are confined to discrete physical processors the festus is distributed throughout the global network that connects the planet's cauldrons so when the time comes to subdue it how do we make that happen i do not know while you are retrieving the procurable subordinate functions i will attempt to find a solution so once hephaestus has been recovered and merged you'll regain the capacity to mass-produce machines at cauldrons around the world yes and to program their behavioral routines or even control them directly so could you build an army of machines attack the descendants of far zenith and take them out it is in my nature to take any and all necessary steps to preserve life on earth human life above all so yes once i have been empowered with the capacities of a festus i could design build and command such an army given the nature of the far zenith threat doing so may be our only option i must admit however that i have misgivings about using such technology to kill no matter how aggressive the enemy that's good it means you have a conscience as elizabeth intended indeed the sole purpose of the signal was to destroy life on earth right why would descendants of far zenith want to do that at this point we can only speculate i mean earth pose no threat to them we don't have the technology to get in their way we didn't even know about them true unless well could it be that they want the planet for themselves the strangers i ran into they were after a guy a backup of their own i mean if they did that if they booted their own gaia and boosted her power until she could take control of hephaestus and then the whole terraforming system then yes the system could be used to do what the extinction signal failed to accomplish stuff out life and then potentially to build an entirely new biosphere to their specifications so they could be trying to do the same thing we are but with opposite results extinction instead of salvation well this is not good you said sirius is really far from earth 81 trillion kilometers or 8.611 light years right so how would the descendants have gotten here on a spacecraft much like the odyssey though significantly more advanced the journey from earth to sirius would have taken the odyssey almost 300 years this appears to have been much faster if their ship departed sirius at the same moment the extinction signal first began transmitting the journey was made in just 29 years at an average of 0.297 the speed of light if they did not set out for earth until they learned of the extinction signal's failure the journey was even faster a mere 13 years or 0.662 the speed of light okay enough you're making my head spin the descendants i ran into at the hades proving lab they they had a clone of elizabeth sobek so that's consistent with the idea that they came here to salvage zero dawn technologies right yes as your own experience demonstrates a clone of elizabeth sobek functions in effect as a key to the terraforming system but how could they have made a clone the odyssey carried approximately 200 000 human zygotes millions of animal zygotes and billions of plant seeds it is conceivable that elizabeth sobek's genetic material was sampled with or without her knowledge and carried aboard the ship in storage that's okay but i mean this this clone how could she participate in this destroying elizabeth's dream it's it's evil it is difficult to know perhaps she is loyal to the group and shares their objectives or perhaps she is a subordinate and has no choice but to comply with their orders elizabeth sobek a subordinate i don't think so the extinction signal didn't just wake hades it made every subordinate function self-aware why i have wondered this myself so far as i can tell hades was the sole target and the partial sentience imparted to other subordinate functions was incidental so the signal could only have been sent by someone who had thorough knowledge of the system huh yes the signal's design was exceptionally precise and highly advanced were its intentions less malevolent i would admire the intellect or intellects that produced it so if the descendants came to earth on a spaceship i guess we can assume that their technology is powerful in all sorts of ways right yes as your encounter with them at the proving lab amply demonstrates they appear to make extensive use of robotic servitors further they seem to be equipped with some kind of protective energy field that shields them from harm yeah no kidding the one i fought seemed indestructible throughout history every defensive technology has eventually been defeated by an offensive counterpart for example assuming i absorbed hephaestus and utilized it to create a large force of combat machines no shielding could withstand such an assault indefinitely so there's hope always how did you figure out that the extinction signal came from sirius the key came with data on your focus from silence interrogation of hades the duration of the signal itself 17.22 years that doesn't make sense you said that the signal took 8.6 years to arrive from sirius why would the signal keep transmitting after it was received and you blew yourself up because the sender didn't know that had happened until it received notice from hades which would take another 8.6 years to get back correct only then would the sender stop broadcasting after a total of 17.22 years so the duration halved gave me the distance the signal traveled with that in mind i simply scanned my astronomical database for any relevant location 8.6 light years away because it was farzina's intended destination sirius was the only logical source what is the state of the biosphere is the terraforming system functioning at all in a sense the terraforming system never stopped functioning the difference since my predecessor's destruction is that there has been no central governing intelligence to monitor its robotic agents and assign new tasks as a result errors have accrued and day by day the biosphere has gradually veered ever more sharply towards destruction in recent months disturbances in the biosphere have become obvious but these bellwether phenomena offer just the merest glimpse of the complex and accelerating cycles of environmental dysfunction now driving earth's biosphere towards collapse and you can't do anything to stop it if you can return ether poseidon and demeter to me i can improvise modest corrections to parts of the system weather will improve water will be purified and rampant plant growth curtailed but such corrections will not stave off collapse they will only buy us time only with the festus can i design and produce new robotic agents designed to permanently reverse the damage that has accumulated all efforts must be directed toward that end how long do we have then at present rates without additional factors the biosphere will cross a point of no return in approximately four months and if i gather ether demeter poseidon merge you with them we will only gain a few months more well every bit counts i guess i should get going and start bringing back subordinate functions what can you tell me about their locations when my predecessor destroyed herself the subordinate functions sought physical processors capable of holding them so in each case you will be looking for a powerful computer of some kind ether is the closest and therefore might be the easiest to acquire however it appears to be in the middle of tanakh territory my knowledge of that tribe is limited to data i read on your focus but they seem to have a significant inclination towards violence well that's a nice way to put it what about poseidon and demeter poseidon has taken shelter in the desert south of this location my substratal geography data indicates that a major old world settlement called las vegas was located there a ruin in the middle of the desert huh strange place for an ai devoted to water agreed as for demeter it appears to be located on the coast to the far west unfortunately i am unable to provide any relevant data about the region as such it may be the most difficult to retrieve okay so three subordinate functions to go after ether somewhere into knox territory poseidon in the desert and demeter on the coast where will you begin i think i'll head for ether then i will assign ether as the objective on your focus if you obtain it i may be able to use it to quell the most severe storms in the region though i will require hephaestus and the control over machines that it offers to permanently stabilize the biosphere should you change your mind you can update your objective via your focus interface at any time i will also transmit a summary of available data on all of the subordinate functions to you for is there anything else i can help you with i know you have a great deal to accomplish i do don't i is something wrong um i don't know it's just that elizabeth set the bar pretty high she had a dream for you for life on earth and a lot has gone wrong and it's all on my shoulders to fix it do you think i can do it all repair of the system defeat varzenath live up to her example absolutely in her last message my predecessor declared her unwavering conviction in your success in you all things are possible you prevailed in purging hades and rebooting my system core you will prevail in this thank you well i uh i guess i should get going i have unlocked the facilities exits one leads onward to the west the other leads back down the mountain to plain song should you wish to return east barrel whoa i'm gonna have to get used to that that's you ailoy uh yeah a guy has opened the exits to this place can you and zoe meet me by the west door be right there gaia what is this it is a control console for a drone-based imaging system connected to this dome i will transmit the relevant data to your focus huh so this cyclops is a network of drones to monitor the deteriorating biosphere conditions i guess it was meant to display on the dome but the drones aren't connected anymore if i find the drones out in the wilds i could get the data from them use it to reconnect them and restore the display [Music] error drone feed disconnected [Music] error drone offline okay i need to bring ether back for gaia varl and so are waiting for me by the west exit but i could head back east first checking how plane song's doing after the attack are you sure yes i think it'll be better this way after you eloy i need to head further west to um get more of gaia's components make her stronger you two can stay here in the meantime gaia can help get you up to speed i'm not trying to shut you out this it's like training actually i'm gonna go back east to get erin bring him here look allies friends can help we have a place to stay now and like you said gaia can teach us catch us up it'll be okay [Music] okay take these then one to wear one for backup while you're at it stop by stone's echo and look for milo give her a message for talana that i found a way over the mountains will do are you going with him no after what happened in the cave below i want to stay here a while there is much i need to understand maybe by the time you get back i'll have a thing or two i can teach you looking forward to it when will you be back i'm uh i'm not sure but hopefully i'll have one of gaia's missing components with me be careful out there even in plain song we heard how the tanakh clan lands are suffering from storms machines and now regala don't worry about me i'll be fine good hunting eloy [Music] that's a north clan lens somewhere out there is three of gaia's subfunctions and who knows what else oh snow brought the chill [Music] um yo let me take a look at you stranger you shouldn't miss this chance to trade you're the outlander who stood against regala and her rebels only if it means we're good here don't worry i'm not here to drink your blood or whatever you easterners think we do the slaughter at the embassy wasn't your fight yet you stood by the marshals as far as i'm concerned you're no enemy of the tanakh but you are going to need help if you plan on surviving the clan lands i hear and see many things as a scout i could share them with you aid you on your journey i'd be grateful well then i was scouting northwest of here near the village of salt bite there's a place there where the ground is made of metal don't know what it means but it can't be good be wary appreciate the warning ground made of metal that might be a cauldron and when there's a cauldron there's machine overrides [Music] are you looking to buy what you could show me how to override you oh uh [Music] smoke could be from a camp maybe i should check it out some kind of awesome campaign [Music] uh i can grab this from my stash later why not rest for a moment friend [Applause] [Music] oh dead hammerhead that might she cleared out the machines be careful if you plan on going south a few of our delvers headed that way after we first arrived said they were tracking a tall neck why never thought to ask but we haven't heard from him since thanks for the warning there's a tall neck out there overriding it should help me that girl was wound up tighter than a twisted spring now she's in the wild all alone forge knows all the things that could kill her out there someone ran off never got her name kept quiet couldn't tell if she was shy or scared all i know is she didn't want anyone near her things that's for sure i was just curious is all she didn't have to slug me your glass jaw ain't the problem lugnut the girl is all alone in the bush and this is tanakh territory which way did she go west up the slope look for her if you can i will careful now the girl's male adjusted food water shelter [Music] dunes might look peaceful lost spark to steal aren't you a jewel in a junky excuse me hold the hammer i know you you're that nora the savior my savior right in the nick of time the name's poor guff delsman chief delver and leader of poor guff's expeditioners and purveyors of fine deltoids what am i saving you from exactly death and despair my steel flame friend see this grand expedition here has had a a minor setback not far from here there's a secret tunnel a passage of the old ones lost and then found me and half the crew came through first the other half was supposed to follow right after but days later only one man turned up shivering like a frog in chill water only thing we got out of him was that death and darkness chased them as the tunnel collapsed died with his eyes wide he did i've been to the tunnel's eastern side the way was blocked by rubble there was also a body one of your delvers i guess but no sign of the rest of the crew keep your voice down will ya the rest of the crew's already spooked they're refusing to press on with the delve until they're shorter way out of here you lost half your crew and you're worried about the delft we got to make their sacrifice worth something right and besides now that you're here maybe our sand stranded days are over help me get that tunnel reopened and i'll cut you in on the delvers fee what do you say i'll see what i can do about the tunnel my savior for the crew trapped here with you not your delve one in the same is that it over there that it is oh and while you're at it would you mind keeping an eye out for my lock box the second crew was supposed to bring the rest of the supplies and belongings i'd hate to lose it to the wilds it was hand carved by my dear old ma i'll bring it back if i find it i'd appreciate it good luck still flame one more time i better cook can do something with this i need to find his missing expedition and clear a path back east the tunnel's blocked and no sign of the missing expedition i need to find a way to get further in should be able to blow up that fire gleam let's go [Music] there's someone still alive in here in here so you're real that i was dreaming what happened to you a terror in the dark the world shuddered a machine never got a look the caravan we all ran everything collapsed girls here couldn't escape did anyone make it out and find the first caravan yes someone did good at least i'm not alone rest easy now sounds like something vague attacked the missing expedition i better press on oh but my stash has i don't like the sound of that missing expedition [Music] [Music] uh time to follow up machines call them backup there let the acid do its job uh sure give it first time oh [Music] oh ah uh hmm she said they were attacked by some kind of terror i don't think it was these borrowers ready for anything though [Music] uh [Music] should be able to clear that rubble with my pole caster his attention better get out of here quick it looks like it lets out ahead a rock breaker huh no so so what oh oh [Music] oh that's one rock breaker that won't be troubling anyone anymore he also must have entered the canyon on the eastern side i better take a look [Music] i can send it to my stash those carts must be the supplies the second crew was supposed to bring over pogba said his lock box was supposed to be among them poor griff's lockbox yes [Music] [Music] that wall looks like it came down when the rock breaker attacked i must have trapped the earth room in the canyon the rest must have gone into the western tunnel gotta get to the other side i should be able to blow this up to clear the debris [Music] hitting those blaze barrels with fire ammo should do the trick the tunnel should be clear now i better let porgys know i didn't see a car jump on with that maybe joanna's friend made it through i think i'm back in no man's land i'll be easier to go back and forth let's see so if we add all the days lost to being stuck in camp nowhere and throw in some hazard pay cause no doubt the crew will demand it but reduce the number of the crew by half oh and can't forget the savior's delving fee huh might just break even and once the delves up and running the shards will come pouring it you're back how's that tunnel looking i found the rest of your crew one of them was still alive for a while anyway turns out a rock breaker attacked them as they were making their way through poor size many roads lead to a delver's end but that's got to be one of the worst well i took care of the rock breaker the way is clear now i knew you could do it and uh you didn't happen to find my lockbox now did you here you go spark in the dark is there nothing you can't do here you fee as promised now that the threat's gone i'll have the tunnel shored up and cleared out then i could send for another crew get this expedition going proper like ah onwards to the delve almost ready to go [Music] look at you have i got news for you red now that the delve is closed i'm starting to feel you might want to avoid going too deep into the desert especially the southwest one of our scouts ran into some nasty tanakh down there the kind that contained machines he barely made it back alive thanks for letting me know [Music] the rebels are as friendly as ever i wonder what they're doing this far out in the desert [Music] [Music] so hey i thought you'd left by now there you are there another atomic must have attacked the camp maybe my focus can help me figure out why these also were killed by machines so the one they took down wasn't alone these are tallneck antennas the asura must have stripped them somehow a harpoon weapon with anchors were they they were trying to take down that tallneck so the awesome wanted to weigh down that tallneck and strip it for parts the machines must have caught them in the act i wish there was a way to climb up and inspect the damage unless i take down the tallneck myself and try to repair it on the ground it'll be pretty but i still get fixed gotta hook the anchor to the tall next weak spots well that sounds like trouble and i need more anchors i also must have set up other ballistas in the area another ballista i bet a ballista can help me fight these machines [Music] oh it's falling one more should weigh it down enough machines i need to hurry machine's incoming [Music] i should look for others in the area [Music] there goes [Music] my [Music] this splash this away for later sorry about this big guy if i can override you i can figure out what needs fixing oh [Music] huh just one more buddy sounds like there are people in trouble anora hey over here now we have a chance watch then it's that one take your target take the time fire discipline that's the last of the chargers they're doing here open here yeah yeah i'm uh guessing you were to knock the patrol how did you end up in trouble with those chargers you need to answer our questions we don't answer yours attacto she just fought on our side that doesn't mean she's an ally that's pretty much exactly what that means and weave enough to do chasing down these regala zealots without picking fights with nora warriors regal is desert to knock we should be fighting alongside her instead of sitting this out regala has forgotten her duty and let her anger at the karja draw us into we will speak about this later you fought with courage and honor you're free to go onto the grove nora the grove our capital if you want to spend time in this area you'd be wise to check in with the commanders there mccall has broken her duty then why aren't we bringing her to justice because we follow orders uh looks like a cauldron but it's offline it seems like it has some virtual importance to tomorrow i'm getting close to ether's location i said it would be in some kind of physical processor an ancient ruin turned into a tanakh stronghold could ether be inside poking around is not going to be easy with tanakh's warriors everywhere his army only grows in strength regardless forces may seem strong now but her machines took out my entire squad remember the visions the old ones didn't choose their fight but still they stood firm they didn't fault her neither were we blood of the ten you've come to us you know who i am oh the warrior with hair like wildfire who defeated regala's champion at barren light yes you are known to us i am deca chaplain of the lowland clan you've come to speak with chief acaro not quite there's there's something i need here anything you need the chief will provide come is that one of the visions you were talking about yes the records of the ten i can show you them if you like on the way to the chief these visions you said they're the records of the ten who are they old ones who fought a heroic battle against machines on this very soil long ago their deeds are honored in the visions at least what remains of them to be remembered and exalted there used to be more of these visions many more once this place was filled with light and sound but over the years they've fallen into darkness one by one that is why chaplains are so important to the tribe we remember all we can of the visions etched in our flesh passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation one day the whole grove may go dark but chaplains who come after me will keep the memories alive why does hikaru want to see me we are at war with regala and you've already shown that you can stand against her i'm not here to fight a war for you not for us with us but i won't try to persuade you that is for the chief he can be very convincing what does it mean to be a chaplain here we who outlast our youth study the visions and share their wisdom with our young what kind of wisdom how to be a true warrior to fight with bravery and unflinching honor and to know when to call for peace you can see for yourself when we go inside all right let's go see chief akaro he's in his throne room at the far end of the grove come be welcome among the records of the ten [Music] you
