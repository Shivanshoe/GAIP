hell should i know i'm going to make you talk how much pain you endure before that is in your hands i don't have time for this okay okay he said it for the execution chamber with loeb smart move now you get to take a nap a drone that doesn't belong here wonder who's controlling it i don't have time to waste i should use my grapple gun to get over this gate can't take anymore going crazy look like that's what got into this mess in the first place he's wearing body armor knocking him off balance with my teeth will expose him to my attacks don't hurt me please attention inmates or his subordinates we've got to run is that area of the floor is weak i can use my explosive gel to break through someone ought to check the good police commissioner's pockets because they are lying for my money what have i got to show my own men and the slammer i'm no more no tonight we're making some changes some big changes [Applause] you're a dead man walking low another night that's right so he can

are you talking about i'm not on it after all i've done for you show's over boys i'm too late commissioner loeb is dead black mask has a lot to answer for it's the best we're never getting out of here we got a truck the gas chamber has been activated without following proper protocol and harmful gas may be present has been engaged i told you to grab the memory card you wanted will be your face the memory card is damaged but i should be able to recover most of the data back at the batcave i know i caught yours uh make some money come on uh they'll be scraping you off your boss where's he going what a sass whoever wins is gonna be famous at least we know he won't be ugly not tonight well no such thing as a batman huh are you back for the night huh shall i warm up christmas dinner no it's going to be a long night alfred i just ran into a human-shaped crocodile and told me black mask has hired assassins to kill me assassins sir as in more than one that's right and you heard this from the mouth of a crocodile man his name is killer croc he's already behind bars oh i pity his cellmate i don't let's see what else is on the drone's hard drive each of them gets one of these envelopes i need them delivered tonight they're all hired killers the best in the business black mask isn't messing around slade wilson death stroke former military subject of a failed medical experiment failed you see garfield lens aka firefly burns on 90 of his body his obsession is going to be his end how unlike anyone i know here's a face i don't recognize copperhead strange these reports reference a male not a female 14 escapes huh well you won't forget not what the floyd lawton aka deadshot says here he's an expert sharpshooter yeah suspected of many assassinations dangerous but reckless street tuff named lester bachinski calls himself electrocutioner shocking shiva her skill is unmatched thing here in gotham why would he be taking money as a hired killer is that warden joseph must be how black mass got inside the prison he uses torture for intimidation and entertainment eight assassins after your head what are you going to do i'm going to find out who is operating this drone make them tell me what they know then i'm going to find black mask and put an end to this sir i may be stating the obvious here but you do realize that since you and i are the only people who know the batman's true identity those assassins will all fail their mandate if you'd just spend the evening here they'll put innocence in danger to attract my attention i can't take that risk and you think it's a better idea to just put yourself in their crosshairs there's only one person in gotham who can get his hands on something like this the penguin he's been tracking black mask its next waypoint was a rendezvous with penguins men at jezebel plaza i'll make them talk you're sure this is why sir i know what i'm doing well in case you change your mind and want to train tonight instead i'll keep your training facility active sir to make your travels easier i went ahead and set up some auto nav points at different areas of the city one of my preset destinations should take you right to jezebel plaza i've got i'm tracking it too it appears the control towers you use for your auto nav systems are putting out a jamming signal storm damage you'll have to go down there and find that out for yourself so got it we're close to one hour [Music] um there's no secret plan here fellas we just put that grab the hostages you you saying this what the hell is it i'll pull this trigger i ain't playing smoke pellets will confuse my opponent i need to get up and out of danger he can't shoot attacking head-on is a good way to get myself shot and probably the hostage too but they won't expect an attack from above nobody ever does is that thing out there with you are you crazy we were answering the service call that's it you better not be lying to me the hell was that you think it's the guy that hired us you piss him off or something get yourself to safety and call the police they'll want to see what's going on here okay i will this was just supposed to be history whoever you are come near me and i'll kill this guy i ain't playing i can i can fix the tower whatever you want just please don't hurt me all i want is for you to get yourself to safety ugh [Music] i don't think this tower malfunction is from storm damage i need to set up a crime scene and find out what happened i should start by identifying the victim [Music] the victim's name is david shannon a gotham optics employee sent here to repair a faulty network tower but what killed him scanning the dna impact on the wall should provide an answer impact analysis indicates the victim was killed by some kind of explosion originating at that access panel i should scan it for additional clues it looks like the panel was rigged to detonate when swiped with a key card someone really didn't want this tower repaired and it looks like that same someone left a set of fingerprints behind alfred i'm uploading some prints for analysis let me know what comes back certainly searching now and here we are they belong to one john f baker he's a rather unremarkable criminal small jobs mostly and that's curious what's curious mr baker's dead sir his body was recovered from the diamond district just under an hour ago looks like someone's tying up loose ends i can bypass the booby-trapped access panel with my cryptographic sequencer but i'll need the encryption codes from the victim's access card reviewing the crime scene will show me where it is this card has the codes i need to hack any of the network towers access panels alfred contact the gcpd let them know about the body send the data from my analysis too certainly sir does this mean you found the source of the disturbance i think so well well if it isn't the king thug himself figured it was only a matter of time before you showed up sorry about the mess downstairs who is this think of me as a great big mystery one you're never going to solve enigma then oh you must think you're so clever well how's this for clever i've taken control of towers all over the city as long as they're active your batwing's useless and it looks like it's gonna stay that way i mean this one's practically begging to be taken offline and you still can't hack it pun intended of course hmm black masks not going to like this what are you talking about wouldn't you like to know with the jammer offline i can travel here with the batwing those relays are part of a distributed security system i wonder what they're protecting that must be where enigma set up shop i need to pay him a visit i see you've regained control of the batwing sir i suppose it's off to jezebel plaza then that's the plan but then i've also got a lead on enigma don't overthink it too much sir we both know you'll eventually wind up doing both i'm running out of time i should head for jezebel plaza [Music] stand by for location that looks like the crime in progress the gcpd dispatcher just mentioned i could go investigate perhaps stop the crime but i also need to get to the arms deal at jezebel plaza where are you around i don't believe this oh this is a long bridge i should use my grapnel accelerator i hope you'll try to keep a low profile tonight sir trust me i'll take out those assassins before they even know i'm there if some curious child looks out to see who's patterning across their rooftop they'll expect santa claus not a black clad bat creature i don't pattern [Music] and is i told you it smelled funny looks like i'm the first one here i need to find a spot where i can stake this place out unnoticed [Music] penguin not a dime changes hands in this city he can't tell you about if anyone knows where black mask and his assassins are it's him but penguins hard to find these men are doing a deal here i'll make them talk guys [Music] so little boys what do you want for christmas oh wait i already know now let's see if you've been naughty nice punk and the santa hat must be in charge where's the rest when you deal with is us that's a crazy fight [Music] uh [Music] what the hell get away where's the penguin i don't know where is he damn wake up what happened time to talk where's cobblepot let it go if you insist please stop stop i'll call i'll tell you anything you want to know too late i already have what i need you're crazy you're freaking crazy if i can read this sim card i may be able to locate penguin alfred i'm getting interference on my com systems is that on your side no sir i'm seeing it as well it's from the nearby gcr tower it's the same signal jamming the batwings auto nerve systems i've highlighted the tower on your map i'll need to stop that signal before i can track down the penguin don't you think it's weird we've never seen this guy or heard his voice nothing but text from an unlisted number what do i care like somebody shows up in my bank account that's the crazy part did you ever give him your bank account number i sure as hell didn't so how is he wiring us our money you know what your problem is you got to stop looking a gift horse in the mouth just being smart you think it's a coincidence we get this job the same time black mask puts a bounty on the bat's head i don't want to be mixed up in that no way no how that whole thing's gonna blow over yeah as soon as black mask realizes the bats are men things will go back to normal hope you're right if that means we're out of a job so be it get the bastard gotta be my lucky [Music] well look who just showed up have you really decided to try and take me on tattoo it then i'm looking forward to watching you fail typical i mean why apply cognitive resources to a problem when you can just throw crap at it you know if you would ask nicely i'd have opened it for you congratulations are in order maybe you're not as stupid as i've been led to believe why are you doing this enigma direct i like it so i'll tell you gotham sullied it's filled with brutes who control this city through violence and intimidation you didn't answer my question because you didn't let me finish i want to get rid of them batman to improve gotham's intellectual and moral standing but i'm not a thug like you my approach is a bit more refined what you're doing is no different than stealing there's nothing refined about it your response is as predictable as it is goodbye now i can access the sim card i took from that arms dealer in hack penguins communications the penguins pretty pissed off about the deal going south yeah if i was involved in that i'd be on my way out of the city alfred i'm reading a signal from penguin's men but it's not associated with any known wireless frequency ah yes i see it here looks like penguin runs his own private wireless network using laptop transmitters serving as ad hoc com stations he's feeding his main frequencies via two-way radio there are two of these comm stations near your position good mark them on my map if i can find and hack those walkie-talkies i can triangulate penguin's position [Music] i told you it smelled funny so what am i supposed to do then just starve you could have cooked it first cooking kills the germs oh yeah i should have just gone and used the street barbecues they got on every corner everyone's talking about this freak show dressed like a self-defense what's that all about you know martial arts i'm out of the here ain't no escape [Music] batman you expect me to believe that i need to find the next calm station then i'll be able to triangulate penguin's position then mess with our shipment by saving his own arms is dumber than you are no way that's right there ain't no one dumber than you mr cobblepot i swear it was the bag he dropped ricky off the roof of the clock tower straight into the christmas tree i don't care what you think you saw if you're not back here with my money in the next 10 minutes i'll cut your damn eyeballs out and then you will have to worry about seeing nothing ever again stay clear yes mr cobbleman i'm sorry mr cobblepot this has been acting a real funny lately yeah heard the stories maybe i don't know well then what do you think it is wow all right everyone listen up i know i ought to cancel our annual boiler day fights after what happened tonight at jezebel plaza but just to show you a nice guy the final offer the fights are still on so get yourself down to the ship right now if you want in on this penguin's been hiding out on an old ship no wonder it's been so hard to find wait for like us penguins got snipers out if i want to approach unnoticed i should silently take out these snipers tonight [Music] oh hmm [Music] is there he is waste him gotcha batman looks like someone brought a bat to a knife fight i'm gonna smash that's why [Laughter] you're either cheap or lacking penguin is hosting some kind of fighting tournament because that's where i need to go who wants pancakes that's one fancy freak oh [Music] needs to be pumped out i thought he was like urban myth [Music] so [Music] all right guys [Music] sounds like penguin will be in his office tracy should know where that is i'll make her talk now there's the naughty geezer proper naughty and he deserves the right proper welcome tony lads kill you again [Music] [Applause] i'm looking for black mask where i ain't is to talk i'm here to kick your ass this is your last chance black mass must be out of his mind who wants to show me where the penguin is or are you lousy mugs time to earn your supper how's he doing seriously however much you guys coming away [Music] [Music] okay i give up stop yeah where's cobblepot i ain't telling you jack a little more pressure and i'll crush your larynx what's it going to be all right all right he's in this office only way in is through the theater on the other side of the casino but you'll never get past tracy tracy is not a problem that worked better than the last interrogation so [Music] think about it foreign well maybe a new name this is seriously yeah when was the last time we had an intruder on this ship not here not now oh and now he's on the lamb i should have tied him up and called the cops to get him alfred i had a run-in with one of the assassins lester bachinski the electrocutioner are you all right yes but he managed to escape his gloves put out a strong electromagnetic pulse if you can isolate the signal i'll be able to track him down i'll get to work on that where are you off to now i'm on my way to the final offers casino i'm going to make penguin's assistant show me to her boss [Music] [Music] [Music] an encrypted data drive looks like it's part of a larger set if i can collect enough of these i should be able to read the file so the casino penguin's assistant must be nearby i'll make her tell me where i can find cobblepot's office should i go bring it to him you're serious we gotta move this cash before the bat gets here right right hey thinking what i'm thinking i'm thinking you should shut the hell up and pack the money but there's so much christmas bonus you hear about the last guy who lifted a few bucks penguin told me to work it off at the bottom of the harp hey i was just asking let's ask him you want some of this so you can be on your merry way oh this guy's unbelievable let's see some actions what are you some kind of experience [Music] the entrance is controlled from that security room like that huh yeah like that i feel like she's making enough she can tell me what to do yeah you're right let's kill this son of a thank you issues out here um she's earned herself a dry slap she has that better be lip gloss you're reaching for boy you can't do this i'm claustrophobic i am open her up hello son you know you ain't welcome here and you know what we do to trespass well you're about to find out nature you're about to lose your eggs what are [Music] i'm gonna call him i got some more when i'm done with you so shall inherit the earth one more word so good [Music] [Music] no no i kicked someone's heart make a difference now where were we candy you suggested little alberto over here hey baby tried to convince his father to take early retirement he disagreed and called you a let's see psychotic little bastard no no no no no please now you best listen falcone because this is the last time i'll ask what are you gonna tell your father that we're getting out of the weapons business i promise i'll make him do it i'll see your lips flabbing bernie but i ain't making the sound i want to hear don't hurt me them in the face kickers ours your doctor come on now remind me why i pay you punches i ain't done nothing you're not done ah black mask put a bounty on my head where is he not okay tabs are never gays geezer we're for grudge you're not a popular broke in this town you're running out of time wait wait towers there was a murder it was supposed to be his same house or black hat he's got problems of his own i'm saying someone broke in there [Music] it appears the game is over before it even begins i'm not playing games slade tell me where i can find black mask vigilantism a waste of your talents not that it matters now that was a mistake ugh oh [Music] you'll regret that almost uh yes um it's over slade what are you i seeing you batman feel free to let yourself out i can't let penguin get away there's more i need to ask him i can use deathstroke's device to get up to the balcony you have more luck getting into a nun skippies they're getting into this room go on then beat it a bit harder really make me feel it well as you can see i got the action have a merry christmas and piss off alfred see if you can find any information on a murder at lacey towers oh looks like the police are on the scene now sir though and this is interesting they're saying black mask is the victim black mask dead i'm on my way there now the remote claw i took from deathstroke could be useful here alfred get gcpd to take a look at the final offer more to dixon docs they'll find slade wilson tied up and waiting for them along with some of penguin's illegally obtained weapons another anonymous tip will do sir oppressed citizens of gotham your cries for help have been heard i am anarchy voice of the people here to save you from the plague of corruption that now infest this once proud city those hired and elected to keep us free and safe won't lift a finger and why would they they've been bought and paid for encouraged to turn a blind eye if they won't act i will at dawn's first light the sources of gotham's ruin will be destroyed now back to your regularly scheduled programming of propaganda and consumerist garbage as if there isn't enough going on tonight [Music] don't delay i should hurry to lacey towers before the cops destroy all the evidence from the crime scene were mentioned i was hoping to get a minute of your time see in town the cops investigating this crime should have a relay station set up it'll look like a mobile satellite dish probably on a rooftop tonight [Music] ready rubio what's your 20 on the balcony for a smoke with a menace those men on the balcony that could be my way in case penguin murdered his lady yeah we got penguin now like to see him squirm out of this one fingerprints two dead bodies he's about to do some time yeah except forensics will take all the credit and i'm the one who found the prince that's why they call it first response first pickings on the loot but none of the glory me i take the loot over to glory any day respect the fans i don't need those guys the police believe penguin murdered black mask but why would he send me here if he was the killer it doesn't add up this crime took place days ago the fire and the exposure to the elements make identifying the victims difficult the male victim is wearing a black mask but i can't positively identify him as roman cyanus without a dna analysis something i can't do in the field i can identify the female victim based on her fingerprints tiffany ambrose roman cyanus girlfriend or one of them at least she was no angel long list of priors but nothing to indicate she was the target here the fire spread as a result of a molotov cocktail thrown into the room it may have been intended to destroy evidence the shallow trajectory of the bullet suggests the shooter could be someone of penguin's height but the grooves on the floor suggest that the victim was killed by someone leaning back in a chair this bullet was fired from a revolver ballistics analysis indicates a low angle of trajectory the shooter could have been someone of penguin's height but the pattern in the gunpowder residue suggests the bullet was actually fired by someone lying on the ground these fingerprints are a match for the penguin but they're on top of the soot from the fire the cops were right penguin was in the room but these prints prove he was here after the murders were committed if he didn't kill black mask who did the only thing i know for certain is that tiffany's shooter was lying on the floor but why these white streaks are shoe polish whoever shot tiffany was being dragged along the floor besides the victims there were two other people in the room tiffany's shooter and whoever was dragging the shooter the location from which the male victim was shot may tell me more the dna here doesn't belong to either of the victims whose is it the fight broke out when someone startled the shooter it's not clear who won the fight it could have been either one of them i should review the evidence to see if i can learn anything more about either the intruder or the shooter fabric analysis indicates the intruder was wearing a white suit or sport jacket this fabric swatch could help identify the intruder but i still can't identify the male victim's shooter there's one impact area i haven't checked for clues this dna is from the female victim the level of oxidation suggests it's been here for several days if i review the evidence i may be able to find out what she was doing when she was attacked she was sending text messages to roman cyanus about someone named the joker someone killed black mask but this crime took place several days ago and i saw black mask earlier tonight the only answers i have raised more questions who is the joker was he the killer here or is he one of the assassins i have a body an unknown shooter and an unknown assailant to attack the shooter i need to match the dna samples against the records in the national criminal database to identify who is in the room alfred i need access to the national criminal database well the only way to do that would be to infiltrate the gotham city police department then that's where i'm going sir you'd need to physically hack into their servers if you insist on doing something that foolish you'll need a powerful non-lethal weapon i recommend coming back here to pick up your concussion detonator not a bad idea eight two come in welcome home sir the concussion detonator is on your workbench remember if you use that instead of your fists you'll do less lasting damage to those police officers and civil servants noted me too come in no response from h2 please proceed inside to convert it back but next some monster in a cape drops them from a building and a christmas tree a bit afterwards so me [Music] ah standby so oh uh oh my god foreign yeah probably another water pipe bursting i'd love to go take a look but you know my ship's open low lobe understood the problem is this won't be easy but if i'm going to access the national criminal database and find out what happened at lexi towers i need to find the server room without being discovered we've got a ways to go before sunrise there's eight assassins in town tonight from the info we've been gathering they're among the most dangerous criminals on record period after interrogating whale and jones we've learned that they're all competing for a huge bounty which black mask has offered for the head of the bat where do i sign up i thought he was a ghost right all right with people our goal is to ensure order in this city so our number one priority becomes bringing in the bat before these assassins get to win now the closer it gets to mourning the more desperate the assassins will grow and if he's still out there the more damage they'll cause to the city as they try to find or attract them all right dismissed yeah well they were supposed to be guarding a crime scene not gabin no wonder the bat got the drop on him yeah tell him to keep their eyes open next time must you be so brutal sir these are city employees they're as corrupt as they come and they're in my way i wish you'd think twice about that approach sir you never know when you might need their help at any rate your objective is the gcpd server room i've marked it on your map yes it can't be you're nothing special i won't be able to access doors like this with my cryptographic sequencer i'll need to find another way i won't stand a chance against that many armed men i can use deathstroke's remote claw to pass above their heads undetected all right listen up while you jokers were playing cleanup through a black gate i was making us some money i worked at a deal with a pal black mask if any of us can kill the bat before the assassins get to him we get the bounty all 50 million dollars of it and for those of you who ain't too good with the math that means we all retire early nice that's what i'm talking about let's take him down then yeah what are we waiting for enough we only get one night to get this done whatever they put you on tonight i want you to blow it off finding and killing the bat is your number one priority that clear yes sir all clear clear as day sir you got it sir yes sir questions shout them out how are we gonna keep this from gordon and the rest of the force well for starters you're gonna keep your damn trap shut anyone else sir what about the assassins will they see us as competition yeah i didn't sign up to be on those guys hit list look you all put your lives at risk when you signed up for swat you want to make the big money you're gonna have to accept bigger risk that's how it works anyone wants out can hand me their badge didn't think so we good to go wait brandon how do we know black mask will keep his end of the deal if we do kill the bank he's good for the cash trust me and i know where he's stashing it if you know where he's got the cash why don't we go get it cause the last thing we need is a wall with black mask in his men come on guys let's do this if i'm not careful that guard will alert the others so we can't find dirt and make our own i'm listening what if captain gordon allowed all the perks to hold himself to go free you mean loose little prison right right here in gcpt makes him look like he doesn't have control right right how do we make it happen let me think a minute calm down oh [Music] so what does this disrupter of yours do little bit of this little bit of that mostly though it does a whole lot of none of your damn business oh you want to play it like that all right maybe i'll have the guys over at evidence lock up take a look they can get kind of rough though hope it's not fragile you want to play hardball buddy how's about i tell my cousin at the gazette about the payments you boys been extorting from penguin and the like scum like you's got a cousin at the gazette you expect me to believe that don't see you calling evidence lock up now do i you cops are all the same you ain't getting nothing out of me like i said i got all night you and me both pal not you again talk or you won't be walking anywhere ever no way you got an answer for dropping me off that rooftop putty no you have to answer to me how does this disruptor work ask one of the pigs they got it in evidence lockup how about we take a little walk up to the roof okay okay you win it it jams weapons overrides electronic locks all right now you gotta let me go how'd that work out for you last time he will wipe this city clean of your filth yeah if he's gonna wipe things clean he should start with you good one i got a reputation i'm taking you in [Music] get yourself to a shelter you kidding that's where they round us up now you don't get it anarchy gets it but you hey you don't get it man are you listening to me i don't care what's going on out there don't give this bastard what he wants let's send the tape to the press but that's this patch [Music] priority one alert all personnel be advised he is the worst kind of criminal the kind who thinks their actions are justified who acts completely outside the system the system is broken barbara wait batman's in the building last seen headed towards your location be ready you'd think with the number of skulls we cracked punks to think twice about messing with us in the station no less we gotta patrol our own station house hey whoa that was one of us i don't believe this let's send him a message fan out it shoots a kill dammit get to my position officer incapacitated he's in the room i want every sector searched defend yourself rookie [Music] dressed in black and has wings [Music] i'll leave that for the poison swat why is that ain't you hurt brandon made a deal with black mask they're trying to kill the bat and collect the bat you even know who it's from but i already want to alert all personnel report to your department head need a head count a lot of people unaccounted for they're using a security protocol i'm not familiar with and the windows are reinforced glass the disruptor in the evidence locker might do the trick alfred i can't access the evidence locker i need an alternate route the evidence locker well according to these schematics it adjoins an old elevator shaft which you can access by the infirmary you should be able to break in from there i've added it to your map need security in those areas immediately it's gonna look like an accident oh foreign good you've made it to the infirmary now look for an entrance to an old elevator shaft that will take you to the evidence locker got it now i should be able to bypass the security on the server room door so [Music] emergency protocols engaged priority run riot in the hold itself the disrupter should allow me to get past this gate they're gonna let us down or we'll make our own way out yeah yeah how about that this thing's such a bad christmas after they're all have to let us out now got us some hostages what are you waiting for oh go check it out wicked oh is i got a pulse all right call it in let's get him to gotham general will do as soon as he stabilizes on channel 3. [Music] easy i need access to the national criminal database it's right here you must spend a lot of time here cool phone box you're bypassing the network security but you'll need to physically bridge the internet to the external telecom wires if you want to uplink remotely this kind of knowledge could get a young girl into a lot of trouble they run under the building what does the telecom wires you can access them through the sewers wait why do you do what you do because i made a promise alfred i'm on my way out but before i can access the server remotely i need to hack into the telecom wires under the jcpd you should be able to access them from the sewers which run below the building i'll take the closest entrance on your map penguins man said the disruptor can be used to jam their weapons this creeps fast it's working yeah keep resisting right oh there he is oh i don't want to hurt you but you need to stay out of my way uh never listen i'm on your side my side my side works within the law my side doesn't leave suspects with broken bones and missing teeth we've earned gotham's respect that were true i wouldn't be gordon clear the line of fire hold your fire if he moves take him down you've got nowhere to run move gordon i'm taking him down what's wrong with you badge we can work this out i've highlighted a nearby manhole on your map those sewer tunnels lead directly under the gcpd good work alfred oh and um do try to keep out of the uh mark down there remember who has to clean your suit uh hello hello batman it's barbara sorry for hacking into your comms but i need a favor some evidence crazy has gone missing army grade stuff and no one here is doing anything about it so i'm sending you their gps location information use your weapon disrupter on any crates you find it'll fry their circuits and render the stuff you slick uh strange these are black masks men not the kind of guys i'd expect to find could be worse at least he sent an expert martial artist to protect us protect us he ain't giving up boys show me more stop dog all right uh sorry so all right a lot of these guys i'm under the gcpd why are black masks men planting explosives here the cops have always been on his payroll don't you know who i worked for him [Music] how are you ah please oh hey [Music] what's going on you got no chance against us what is going on here watch me master bruce you are directly beneath the gcpd the telecom wires should be right under your nose alfred confirm we now have access to the national criminal database connection confirmed you can now perform dna analysis i'm also sending over the police file for the lacie towers case this photo is from the day of the murder it's a perfect match the dna tells more of the story but here's something the police overlooked roman cyanus owns the gotham merchant's bank and he installed biometric security only he could access alfred i have enough information to solve the lacie towers case here's what happened by now gotham pd thinks roman cyonus is dead the casualty of a turf war murdered by the penguin [Applause] but i know better someone spooked zionist's girlfriend so he sent her to his safe house which was anything but safe zionists showed up later ready for trouble and found it or so it seemed roman's always been paranoid that's probably why he's lasted this long he'd sent him a decoy giving himself the element of surprise but it wasn't enough there was a fight zionist lost the killer didn't hesitate to shoot the decoy but he wanted roman alive to access the cash door to the gotham merchants bank with zionist under control all that remained was to tie up loose ends but it wasn't the fire that killed zionist's girlfriend [Music] what kind of monster forces a man to kill the ones he loves the joker he's the shadow i've been chasing and now i know where he's going next gotham merchants bank alfred see if you can find any information on someone named the joker searching now sir there doesn't seem to be anything coming up what do you know about him not much but he's taken black mask hostage hostage so scionis isn't dead i don't think so from what i can tell he's worth more to the joker alive the joker wants to use him to break into the gotham merchant's bank i'm on my way there now you were very cordially cordially cordially you are very cautiously invited to a party and it will be a grand affair grand affair grand effect and it will be a grand affair hosted by the hatter we do hope that you can come you could come you can come we do hope that you can come to share it

kill the joker knows i survived the explosion i need to hurry before he kills cyanus or anyone else how many places since you can't find batman [Music] come on stop where's the joker going guys nuts man killed about a quarter of black masked men when they wouldn't take orders from him unless you want to join them talk he said something about the steel mill that's cyanosis mill it's joker's milk now ain't no way you're getting in there i didn't ask for your opinion whole schematics on zionist industries steel mill joker's taking cyanus there he's going to kill him unless i get there first this joker sounds dangerous he's taken over black masks operations and slaughtered the men who wouldn't turn he's the one who hired the assassins and it must be he who ordered the bombing of the gcpd oh dear lord shouldn't you think about letting the police handle this one not a chance he's mine do oh [Music] nice so we gotta collect that bounty that's the plan remember there's a bonus if we bring it alive all right stay short people it won't be the first time the bat got to jump on us keep your eyes open you see even the slightest movement call it out yes sir sir yes sir absolutely and no more yakking i want a dead silent anyone here as much as a pin drop call it be out ugh [Music] me there's nothing here shiva trying to collect the bounty that's just a consolation price in case you failed

[Music] [Applause] this can't be real lost power for weeks [Music] and closed them all up a couple years later let's break that break up you can trust the new guy a guy who calls himself the joker hell no but you can't cross them either ain't that the story of our lives hmm [Music] good bad man oh i have isolated the electromagnetic signal on electrocutions gloves you can track him with your scanner now a bit late alfred i'm about to get my hands on black mask and maybe the joker too right well it's ready to go should you need it i had no idea little firepower should help one side over break i'll need to find the access code to unlock this door how do you know it works trust me it works put it to sleep you're strong at it come on we got em i need to hack that computer so i can find the security code for the door alfred i'm uploading data from one of blackmask servers i need codes to bypass a security door in the loading dock receiving it now sir interesting cyanus had a pacemaker implanted it says here he had prolonged qt syndrome anything that raises his heart rate could trigger cardiac arrest zionist was having the joker followed these photos show him obtaining chemicals used in making explosives if i find cyanus he'll know what the joker's planning sir i found the security codes you're looking for you have access to the building now [Music] that turret is still armed i should disable it with my disruptor mr bruce looking through cyanus's files i found reference to a chemical similar to the compound you need for your glue grenade i'm going to try to synthesize it in our lab if it works i'll have a prototype for you as soon as the resin cures good i'll need it the more i learn about the joker the more i realize there's something very different about him what was that i'll need to find a way inside that room come on why are you messing with the crate we're supposed to be locking this place down knock it off okay okay let me set it down um he ain't giving up just us two killers huh he gets past us and any of you that survive or wish you were deader than that too don't give him an edge me here comes the party blue 62. [Music] that's more like it uh who did this i can use my evidence scanner to examine the body for clues no signs of assault huh his system is shut down acute toxicity he's been poisoned hell no he looks angry ah now hold on they're holding cyanus in here somewhere what do you say joe should we let him out let me think he did give us that raise he promised us oh wait no he never did that's right

copperheads poison female perspiration copperhead came this way all i need is one drop of poison there it's a powerful neurotoxin alfred uploading analysis of a neurotoxin i need you to synthesize an antidote your vitals are off the charts what happened never mind just get up to ground level so i can send in an airdrop and after this you're coming back here so i can have a look at you i won't last long without the antidote i need to get back up to ground level [Music] what would your father say if he could see you now throwing away your family's hard-earned fortune on these frivolous nightly escapades and for what you're not this city's savior you're a wayne and a spoiled wasteful disappointment of a wayne at that have you forgotten what your family name stands for you disappoint me you

[Music] alfred send gcpd an anonymous tip tell them to look inside the shipping containers at the steel mill does that mean you've dealt with copperheads sir yes and i'm about to deal with the joker i don't think that's wise after what you've just been through you should come back here for medical not now alfred electrocutioner's gloves emit a powerful electromagnetic signal which i can follow with my scanner he'll lead me right to the joker but i need to get out of the steel mill first stuff they weren't lying about him like i should destroy the canister before moving on alfred i'm uploading a chemical example i need you to run a scan of the city look for high concentrations of the compound find the source and i can shut it down certainly i'll alert you as soon as i found something hmm i'm not picking up electrocution or signal yet i'll need to get to higher ground the central pillar on pioneer bridge should do [Music] alice i'm not afraid of you there i just need to track the signal to his location looks like the signal is coming from somewhere in the diamond district don't the assassins 50 million on the line who's next bust them up uh there's the signal looks like the electrocutioner is inside the gotham royal hotel the joker's booked out the royal but why are swat providing security i need to find out what's going on here now for the love oh uh [Music] he's in

me we're still getting this yeah we're still live this is vicki vale reporting live from the gotham royal hotel where there has just been a massive explosion and now it appears the batman has been blown from the building by the blast and is somehow hanging from the bottom of our helicopter armed men have gathered on a balcony from now on you hear me after years of on and off unconfirmed sightings with no recorded video we've seen the bat twice tonight and caught him on film could this be the turning of a new leap for the mysterious vigilante is he about to become a public figure one

fine alfred i've dealt with psychopaths before but this i strongly suggest you call in captain gordon he could be a valuable ally for you i don't need any allies i see the joker's men here have been eliminated good work but remember our primary objective is the bat we must remain vigilant he will not get past us and this is the only way to the penthouse we can hope you're right but only time will test your words the bat is coming [Music] present and see what is inside attention shoppers get up off the ground [Music] i can do this i batman just tipped over another one that's it aren't one of us went down well look at that another one of these boys oh he's on his way up to the penthouse oh nice of you to drop in and just in time oh he's my parasol remember you gave your word you have one

just like don't move freak i think he's talking to you take him down let me guess he got away take him to blackgate who else would jump off a building to [Music] i was wondering the same thing myself welcome to blackade we're going to do a quick psychiatric evaluation bad day huh cops in this city always beaten on the sick and defenseless [Music] tell me something dear have you ever had a really bad day and what do you mean by that you all people should know there's nothing so cruel as memory the pointy biting through thunderbolts unwanted party crashers screaming for your syllabuses inescapable unrelenting not at all friendly you can't even escape into madness and then you meet someone who changes your life and you feel that you don't even know who you are anymore isn't it funny how one little encounter can cleave off little pieces of your past deform your memories and persona until you rethink your whole identity and as you realize how foolish it targets your laughter reverberates on the walls of your own emptiness okay i'm gonna need more specifics how about we try some word association that sounds delightful [Music] okay one more and i need you to be serious for this one fate you want to know something funny i used to think of fate as evil predetermined not by some higher power no but by the rules of human nature tonight it's all change what's changed have you ever had the feeling that your entire life has been building towards this one moment is that how you feel well now yes now i realize that all the battles the bad days the brutalities it was all the hand of fate at work so now you see faith differently absolutely now i understand there are no chance encounters it was all meant to be everything leading up to who i've met tonight so you've met someone special yes and you might say it's changed everything everything absolutely i mean do you realize what a vile bird happened how lonely it is to wave through all that wretch and filth on your own it is kind of lonely isn't it of course of course you understand even in a crowd of other screwballs you're so lonely on this path leading nowhere into just emptiness now you feel like you've got someone by your side to share the journey with you and how does that make you feel i feel adrift floating like someone's pulled the stopper on my reality and i'm sucked down the drain into something new it's all very exciting really you wouldn't know what that feels like i'm sure i might can you tell me more about how this person makes you feel it's like meeting someone i can actually relate to which believe me dear i've never felt before you understand you're someone who's not afraid to let go and fall [Music] free falling and i didn't pack a shoot [Music] do you know what i mean yes yes i do i figured you would so may i ask who is this person oh someone very very special but whose real name i don't even know yet uh my name's harleen harleen quinzel what a pretty name do your friends call you harley i don't have a lot of you friends one now now why why why would you do that new spanish the worst kind of criminal wait why do you do what you do master bruce it might be a bit anti-climactic but i hope you might finally be ready to celebrate christmas eve now that the joker's behind bars bane is still out there i've got to locate the signal from the tracker i placed on him even you must eat sir if you hadn't called the police he'd already be in custody you know i made a promise of my own to your parents no sign of any casualties not now alfred the story back to the precepts please see that found bob's under the foundation some kind of hopped up freak must have been 400 pounds of muscle took six cops to gun that bastard down yeah i saw the body in the moor couldn't believe it sounds like this could be bane or one of his men if i hurry to the gcpd morgue i can inspect the body in the autopsy report well before you leave and i've run some tests on the compound you found at the steel mill looks like a match for your globular projectile for non-lethal restraint you mean the glue grenade indeed the resin has finished curing it's at your workbench of course i'd recommend testing it here in the lab before you go but i'm sure you won't listen to me you never do so i take it you won't be testing it then it's called field testing alfred master bruce stop master bruce bruce i will not in good conscience allow you to go you're outmatched by these messages you're not some hardened vigilante you're a young man with a trust fund and too much anger go in over your head tonight i don't want this to be your end alfred who do you see when you look at me the boy whose shoes you use to tie every morning the teenager you drove to his first date while you are here every night i am out there the only thing between the innocent you and me to be no not maybe i am when the mugger or the thief stops to think twice that is fear that is what i am that is why they hired assassins because i am the reason the criminals breathed easier when the sun rises so no alfred i am not in over my head [Music] but it will be theirs i trust you realize you can't just walk into the gcpd after everything that's happened there tonight i know i can't do that i'll have to find a way in that'll avoid detection indeed look i'm sorry about what i said before you left interested we gotta work together morons can't take this all out get his face [Music] oh man please i got kids so and some new guy in town took his gang over and did all that stuff yep and that's the guy who was trying to blow up the station yep and he's in black gate now yep so who's in control of black mass gang you ever shut up no confirmed make yes uh [Music] [Music] [Music] my board is lit up if you don't have an assignment maybe the glue grenade can stop the steam here [Music] it's not bane but one of his men the same one i saw at the riot in the precincts holding cells earlier i should scan his corpse the victim was dosed with a chemical that caused temporary deformation of his physiology i'll need to check the autopsy report to find out more that computer should contain the autopsy report i'm looking for interesting the victim was using a powerful compound with many similarities to the street drug venom at the time of his death it changes the user's muscle and bone structure greatly enhancing strength for a temporary period it appears that whatever this compound is it reduces mental capacity in several ways including severe damage to the brain's memory center prolonged use could seriously compromise the user's memory there's bain's tracker all available we've received reports of shots fired inside the coventry district describe two armed groups fighting over what appear to be chemical weapons requesting any available officers locate and secure the scene chemical weapons i should investigate i should hurry to baine's location before i lose the signal again why don't you come join me uh the tracking signal i saw was coming from somewhere down that tunnel [Music] he's just a move we are an army brain likes us best [Music] i'm gonna look this is fun for me uh looks like i'm stuck unless maybe i can use my blue grenade to create a raft [Music] [Music] ready when you are [Music] wide open we got him now my tracking device is in here somewhere which means bane is likely in here as well some of this research is dedicated to overcoming his own addiction and dependency on venom he can't survive without it time alfred bane knows who i am you're not safe at wayne i'll call the police no i can't risk them discovering my identity as well just secure yourself in the bat cave what are you going to do i'm on my way to you i'll figure something out i need to get back to the bat cave and quickly repeat suspect is airborne in a jet pack armed with a flamethrower multiple hostages on the pioneered bridge firefly he must not know joker's behind bars and he's putting those people in danger to get to me delta 6'5 the dispatch who's the oic of pioneers captain james gordon is the officer in charge a lot of lives could be at risk at the bridge if i can hack firefly's communication channel i can learn more [Applause] and if the cops try anything stupid kill a few hostages sure thing and uh how long before we set the timers on the bombs not until the bat shows we'll wait all night if we have to there's 50 million dollars riding on this alfred firefly has hostages on the pioneers bridge i need to deal with him before coming back oh can't you just let the police handle mr linds especially in light of what we've just learned i can't abandon those hostages they're in jeopardy because of me because of the bounty joker placed on my head you'll be safe in the bat cave i need to draw a firefly away from the bridge so i can approach safely [Music] lift it it's just up of those stinking pigs that's fun on this bridge set the timing we'll blow them all to hell gordon would never order a bridge if he knew about firefly's bombs i've got to stop him before he sends his men into a trap dispatch this is marine where's the tactical command folks he's supposed to report the chord tcp is inside the center pillar [Music] freak show uh he's a cop harvey he'll do his job don't send in your men firefly has the bridge rigged with explosives show yourself you have a go no call them back if firefly blows the bridge there's no telling how many will die you're the reason those people are in danger he's doing this for the bounty on your head give yourself up i'm going to bring in firefly myself don't send anyone else in until i tell you it's safe you'll stay the hell out of this you hear me report [Music] no one else goes in without my order emergency alert please follow the quickest route but how do you know any of the other guys i need to make one of these guards tell me how many bombs firefly has and where they are so what are you gonna do with your  what ship you know knows [Music] um [Music] it's [Music] huh how many bombs are on this bridge four four one here one directly above us in the bridge sub-level and one board each end of the bridge those are the big ones that's all of them i promise then i promise you a good night's sleep four bombs on the bridge for the largest bombs at each end i'll need to disarm this law before going after the others one bomb down now to find the other three so engaging the fire door in that section to protect the hostages i am he's [Music] there we go i hate you so much just gonna stand there untie me you've been after the bounty on my head all night it was never scientists the joker put up the bounty and now he's behind bars i heard but i still got a score to settle with you i'm giving
