oh is our sciencey types are learning all kinds of neat stuff about it over at annex ridge we wield the biggest nastiest gun in the universe and soon we might just learn humans [Music] someone tell me uh [Music] humans would never fight grunts like us to this gun needs to be powered on too look for a power source nearby [Music] uh [Music] thank you [Music] what you do [Music] second aa gun is open for business and by open i mean let's go [Music] i'm on it the lockdown's probably going to trigger again but don't worry we'll be out of here in how many spartans remain do you even know there would have been 50 at laconia station maybe more such a loss do you feel it in your heart does it leave a hole atriox was my finest recruit he understood sacrifice and when one is necessary i honor his memory each day when our enemy rises we meet their challenge it is why i created the hand of atriax i found the best the cruelest the most efficient killers in the universe and taught them how to be better my spartan killers are coming for you it is your time to rise spartan killers really everyone is trying to kill you i'm done here now it's your turn chief we're being contacted on unsc channels tom's signature belongs to a spartan theodore sorel the one we found dead put it through i know you can hear me will you die with honor i doubt it you are human weak pathetic i will crack your armor peel you from your shell it will not be my first spartan blood but it will be the sweetest you're sending a spartan killer chief this is crazy this is crazy we got to get out of here we've got to move not yet hold position when this goes bad it's on you chief remember that so yourself [Music] over and over um [Music] [Music] searching good for now but i got this hunch that won't last forever every hour what nothing more you're a sneaky one he's tracking our locations [Music] last one and cue the lock down huh no asheram i'm almost disappointed [Music] almost all set let's get back to the pelican we did it there's a repeated message across all banished frequencies the first part is hand of atriox and then what i can't stay i've lost his signal if the spartan killers find him that won't happen how can you be sure because they'll need to go through me first come on chief we've got well a lot see that chopper i guess that's one of the spartan killers and there's the other one up there in the wreckage you need to stop them [Music] if we're gonna make any noise on this ring we need a base of operations it's beat to hell but shelter defensible location no sign of banished activity yeah this could work any spartans range spartan griffin is in range but his signal is diminishing rapidly i think we found our rendezvous point [Music] [Music] for this facebook oh [Music] i smell beers [Music] you cannot stop what is [Music] that wasn't easy was it what if escherim sends more let him echo 216. nothing but i think i can yes comms are still offline but i was able to activate his tracking beacon remotely he's he's out in the open the unsc ship graveyard i hope he's okay uh animals chief my eyes didn't deceive me back there we need to go three unsc condors seeing one is rare finding three is a miracle i should have known better torn apart completely got it slip space drives obliterated we don't have the time over there's another shattered and cratered over a kilometer in there the last one all of it crushed broken prison useless enough when when is it enough chief and we're in there because that's where i belong in there with them worthless junk not this i'm not you i'm not a pilot i'm not even a soldier a marine oh fraud i stole that pelican i stole it you know why of course you don't have you ever been scared so scared that you [Music] i'm worthless you should leave me here with the rest of the garbage we all fail we all make mistakes it's what makes us human i'm sorry chief but how have you ever failed i should have protected cortana stopped everything from going wrong i failed her i will not fail you chief we we're going to make it we have to this is all i've got it's all we need our only way home is straight through the heart of the banished we need you [Music] we can fix this [Music] together of course we can [Music] together so what's the plan let me guess it's dangerous and it's probably going to get us killed i have my answer let's do this [Music] you are losing control nothing is lost deploy your army descend upon him no odds will not break him the spartan is not alone there's something here helping him connected to this installation what is it it's remarkably vulnerable but highly intelligent is it a weakness something to exploit we will see the reformation is controlled from this spire it must be protected done atriox believed you to be valuable prove incorrect when the endless are found and when you have your ring then you will never question my worth and i will never question your judgment the scent grows stronger save your strength i need something of you old friend anything bring me the master chief alive ready when you are chief we left them in a nice big crater the banished is more than just a collection of unstoppable heroes we got allies important powerful allies and if you thought these last six months were bad [ __ ] what comes next it's gonna blow your mind out of your stupid head [Music] all right let's move how long has it been since i met you six hours maybe seven it's been eventful six months on my own surviving barely seems like a dream now this on the other hand mostly feels like a nightmare mostly chief are you okay what you said back there about cortana you let her down i don't understand your mission was to destroy her but you didn't what happened halsey initialized you i was supposed to deploy you and you did right yes so what happened atriox came for you you attacked the infinity we fought he won he won adriance beat me surgically precisely brutally next thing i remember i was being woken up in this pelican do you want to know who killed her you need to know she was important to you very important she's [Music] this ring it's not like the others there's something else here and that's why i'm still here second spire coming up where do i drop you off close close it is call me in when you're done chief wow look at the spire it's so new evolved different not like the last one and you're sure this is the one it's acting as the command spire coordinating the repair operation can you shut it down hopefully we just need to look for a door [Music] you
