our enemies are weak they lack conviction lack purpose they spread nothing but lies about us that's all they can offer a pile of [ __ ] they have no vision for the future they are hopeless swamp all they want is to see us burn and why is that they envy our successes they know we are and it drives that charlatan are there is mad with envy they don't understand loyalty or sacrifice we do because we are guided by these principles have the worst Horrors imaginable time and time again we all know what kind of animals they are we all know that they stand for nothing they are empty depraved Psychopaths every last one of them they must be dealt with swiftly and without mercy before they can poison everything we have worked so hard to achieve the tower will always stand that's the tourist doesn't look so tough [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this map is all the proof we need clear to me that justice was served Gary and a deals denials don't outweigh Steve coughing at all including the map and frankly I don't give a [ __ ] who was the mastermind I stand behind anything on Gary but they all earn the walk human hunting twisted [ __ ] let all this tick stuff go we took care of big-picture focus from now on Georgia [Music] [Music] Northwest corridor 3 1 3 investigate via Corolla I don't give a damn it was on that map then prove a thing Georgia has such a stranglehold on the tower she said the sky was Green and made of jello than everybody behind the wall would not smile and get out their spoons not me and not my daughter I'm going to prove to Umbra that we can rise above it all that we can remain in truth which brings me to a confession tourists I didn't tell the full story of how I got the reserve key Umbra called me out for omitting a critical detail I am raising the kid right I guess to get the key I had to hurt someone bad a dear friend I almost killed her in the moment it felt like the right thing to do no question but I regained my senses for my daughter's sake I could see her eyes pleading with me from across the room stop mommy this isn't right I was ashamed I had succumb to what the tower had become under Georgia's influence a breeding ground for betrayal forcing people to turn against each other supervise sad thing he's not proud of it but it's true there is a violent end it's cross it does not matter who you are I will do whatever it takes to defend what I knew is right and protect my daughter so now you know exactly who you're dealing with tourists nobody like before the drawing will point into cash beyond the location the next cache is in Sydney through what might be in there I've heard is that it's quite a haul me ah our enemies are weak they lack conviction lack purpose they spread nothing but lies about us that's all they can offer a pile of [ __ ] they have no vision for the future they are hopeless Swan all they want is to see us burn and why is that they envied our success that's why they know we are strong they know we refuse to be swayed they know we are united and it drives that half-wit charlatan are there is mad with envy they don't understand loyalty or sacrifice we do because we are guided by prison and these principles have seen us through the worst Horrors imaginable time and time again we all know what kind of animals they are we all know that they stand for nothing they are empty depraved Psychopaths every last one of them and without mercy before they can poison everything we have worked so hard to achieve George yeah [Music] [Music] didn't think I'd ever see another human being again is your name Kenneth yeah how do you know my name Casey asked me to look for you he's alive in the bunker he wanted to know what happened to you and the rest of the squad Casey's alive huh that's good to hear letting give him much chance honestly thought he'd have

of the church I believed him he begged me not to tell the others he didn't trust them but he trusted me we were friends listen my brain is it's getting foggy laughs I'm seeing [ __ ] I don't know how
