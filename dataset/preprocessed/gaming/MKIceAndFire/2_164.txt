mary jane watson associate editor begin research notes my sources are saying the magia is mounting a comeback the old crime families were all but wiped out until fisk went away and they started filling the void the old dawns were working harmoniously for years but now that there's a power vacuum there's bound to be a power struggle it's only a matter of time before one of the families makes a move on the others better follow up with my sources in the force hopefully we can stop this crime come back before it even starts hey pete i'm working on a story you might be interested in the escort expose new one it's about the majia crime families the mob i thought they went out with swing dancing both times they were in decline but with fisk and the demons gone macosa is making a comeback i love it when you talk dirty easy tiger so you know the feds raided the magia last month sure well one of the dawns had this lost masterpiece painting called the maria and now they're displaying it over at manhattan mocha and and i have a source who says one of the families is planning to steal it back tonight sounds like there's more to it than just art appreciation he'll swing by the museum [Music] [Music] mj looks like your source was right there's a small army of goons trying to break in stay on the line while i take a closer look just be careful if those guys are majia they play for keeps hurry up come on boss wants that painting we should have been in and out by now you want to try be my guest sheesh some people do anything to avoid paying full price admission these guys have to learn to appreciate art during business hours somebody [Music] time for a little demonstration of the fine art of subduing criminals [Music] ah i know some of these guys that's frederico frazelli and sal petrillo those guys are part of hammerhead's crime family right why would he want the maria it doesn't seem like his thing i'm gonna look around make sure no one got in a different way i'll let you know if i find anything hey what is that mj someone cut a hole in a skylight i'm gonna check it out so while hammerheads guys were trying to break in the front someone else slipped in through the roof looks that way no sign of anyone at all shouldn't there be guards here at night yeah maybe check the security booth near the entrance there should be cameras there too they would have seen whoever broke in the security booth's secure i need a palm print to get in any clue about what happened to the guards will be inside is there a way to override the lock not without a guard's hand actually their handprint if you can't find the guards maybe you can lift prints from the things they touched oh yeah good idea always happy to lend a hand got a handprint well a part of one looks like i'll need more weird it's like the guards just vanished another one cool trained guards wouldn't leave their stuff around like this unless they didn't leave voluntarily a flashlight i can get a partial okay i should have enough partials to reconstruct a handprint i should be able to reconfigure the scanner so it takes my data if i bypass the optic sensor i can upload my own data got it transmitting hand print now we're in nice what do you see they're alive looks like they were tranquilized no signs of a struggle definitely not hammerhead style so if not hammerhead who is there a camera feed let me check someone switched off camera five well that's suspicious let me turn it back on and see what they didn't want anyone looking at it's pointing at one of the paintings in the exhibit that has to be the maria and no one's stolen it yet i need to see this up close figure out what's so special about it the maria is a brilliant example of modern pastoral impressionism the saga of its repeated theft and recovery are almost as intriguing as the artwork itself looks like a pretty normal painting to me it is there's way more valuable stuff in that museum so why is the magia so worked up about this painting hang on mj someone's coming so keep an eye out spider-man could still be here ah damn it gotta lock behind security glass hey tell frank we're gonna need to break out the big guns mj hammerhead's guys called in reinforcements they haven't spotted me yet good try to keep it that way but we got the signal that means he was here [Music] cops will be here any minute the hell with this grab what you can and run great now they're looting the other art gotta stop them before they make it out next time try the gift shop you better run how about as a consolation prize i send you a poster of that piece for your prison cell you're going yep maybe they'll have art classes in prison [Music] ah [Music] looks like you'll have to get your mom another mother's day gift may i suggest a bath bomb stay down peter you there you okay yeah i think i got them all a lot of heart to put back though what about the maria this could have all been a distraction my thoughts exactly i'll head back there hopefully the glass was thick enough security wall's intact and bulletproof nobody's getting near the maria anytime soon mission accomplished then i hope so yeah i am gonna have to call you right back why what's going on you look good been working out no i mean you know a little so you swinging solo now you're back with your ex that's a lot of questions i'm just curious yeah i hear that's bad for cats how about you tell me why you're really here i was just waiting for the right moment look behind you [Music] rockets who brings rockets to a museum you ready league punk [Music] more coming your way handsome mess you up [Music] [Music] watch it [Music] [Music] i like your new tricks and i'm tired of your old ones weren't you gonna stop stealing art who said i'm here for the art what are you doing i think you have lives to save not again [Music] what where'd she go peter is everything okay sorry mj i just uh ran into an old friend who trouble [Music] so black cat was the one who went in through the roof she was working with hammerheads guys yeah she was probably watching me the whole time i was in there just tell me you didn't let her get away with the maria she didn't good she smashed it and stole a data drive hidden in the frame what sorry so what do you think was on that drive good question i'll start asking around and i guess i'll start following cat prints all units we have reports all units we have reports of an explosion in the vicinity of times square and bryant explosion better check it out looks like another car bomb which family set it up this time hammerhead again probably might be more nearby better calling the bomb squad bombs under things time to go small [Music] spider bots active should be tracking the other bombs okay still a few more out there [Music] disarmed need to find the others got it just one left just in time hammerhead's on a mission better keep a lookout for more of these around the city [Music] hello spiderman this is detective mackie i got your number from a friend in the force i bet i know which friend what can i do you poor detective probably better if we spoke in person do you stop by the greenwich precinct when you get a chance i hear you like meeting on rooftops sure thing see in a few this will keep me busy while i wait to hear from mj that museum heist was crazy it's not black cat's style to work with guys like hammerhead hope mj can find out the story behind that data drive [Music] harassing a civilian nearby officers please proceed to the west village spider-man over here [Music] detective mackie i presume thanks for coming i want to talk to you about the black cat i played the fifth not the new cat the old one 20 years ago i worked the case black cat is a copycat huh what happened to the original he died in prison but we never found all the paintings he stole i've got a new lead but the department doesn't want to waste resources on an old case wasting resources is kind of my specialty great head to this location i'll fill you in on the way i appreciate your help i'm retiring soon and this case is my biggest loose end so i went through the files one last shot the old cat preferred to steal art but right before he got busted he hit a smoke detector factory smoke detectors that's random not really he stole the americium 241 inside him we thought he had a buyer for the radio isotopes but i was watching a movie the other night and saw something that gave me an idea what if he tagged the paintings he stole with those isotopes in order to help him find them once he got out what movie were you watching wait don't tell me spoilers so i was thinking if we tracked the isotope we could find the stolen paintings i have a simulation counter in my suit that should do it i'll call you if i find anything thanks spiderman if i can close the books on this one i can retire in peace i think i'm close to one of those stolen paintings the signal's coming from this power box but i'm not detecting any electricity huh an art storage tube detective i found a stolen painting it was hidden in a fake power box yes i knew it leave it there i'll have someone pick it up in the meantime i'll send you some other locations we know hardy frequented sounds good wait did you say hardy yeah the original cat's name was walter hardy i'll pull his files and have more details next time we talk walter hardy the original black cat felicia hardy the black cat that i know this appears to be a family business peter the police scanner just reported an active shootout around hudson and north moore isn't that area controlled by the magia yeah whatever black cat stole it might have just triggered a gang war well i'm on my way to check it out any other updates on the museum heist so here's what i got nobody knows what was on that drive in the maria painting but word is hammerhead now has the drive and the magia families are freaked out about it must have been pretty valuable if it made a notorious art thief ignore art i wonder why she's working for hammerhead she usually flies solo who knows i stopped trying to figure out felicia a long time ago felicia huh you guys on a first name basis now well i mean yeah i guess maybe well let's just keep each other in the loop okay [Music] you're not being subtle time to shut this down before someone gets killed [Music] got them all oh boy there you go here did i get everyone all right all right all right i give up do i get time off if i talk you won't if you don't oh this is the way here chick she told us to come down to your mixing noise sucker bait and i'm the sucker where'd you meet her bodega i'm waverly [Music] mj the whole shootout was a distraction black cats set it up to draw police away from waverly street one of the other magia families has a front on waverly the cicero's i think maybe i can still catch her felicia takes her time she's nothing if not methodical is she now uh i'll keep you posted there's the bodega all right felicia where are you there's your stakeout gear what were you looking at felicia gotcha [Music] oh hey spider felicia the magi are no joke you shouldn't be playing with them oh but i like to play spiderman he's working with the cat got him i'm not working for hammerhead or any other crime family i'm just wrong place wrong time [Music] [Music] [Music] well that was fun now where's felicia i like watching you reminds me of old times what's on that drive not entirely sure to be honest then why are you stealing it if i don't they'll kill my son [Music] your son damn it felicia has a son can't be i mean it could be and i could be no no no i'm not gonna think about that right now mj i found the cat but she got away really how methodical of her she stole another data drive so each family has a drive i wonder what's on him did you learn anything else uh well not much okay sounds like she's helping hammerhead make a power play on the other crime families which could end badly for everyone the last thing the city needs is a gang war i'll let you know if i turn up any info on those drives what's up sm it's your number one fan wait a minute screwball uh don't tell me you're out of jail i sure am and i brought some of my fans with me aren't they just the cutest they're helping me set up for my new show in fact i'd love for you to swing by ttyl something tells me those guys weren't released for good behavior better get over there and check it out [Music] time to put screwball's fans back behind bars where they belong hey guys i promise to go easy on you if you promise to stop idolizing internet celebrities [Music] one thing hasn't changed screwball's getting others to do our dirty work what were they setting up anyway spiderman wasn't that exciting perfect way to kick off my brand [Music] sorry my dance card's full pretty sure you'll make time for this cause if you don't my fans will get angry and people will die i just love reality shows don't you some people do anything for clicks sam know what an emp emitter is well here's an eli five if you don't disable them they'll knock out power across the city oh and if you don't disable them in the right order zap better hurry but she's using a binary signal repeater i can piggyback on it to visualize the right path i think my webs will disable them don't forget about the photobomb targets [Music] that one's disabled gotta find the next one [Music] don't forget to subscribe to my channel whoa look at him go we got so many viewers the stream's getting chubby i love it [Music] thumbs up [Music] so close to perfection some upvotes some downvotes but thanks to all of you who tuned in hey peter i might have found black cat's next target really how because according to police dispatch there was just a burglary matching her mo i'm sending you the location hey if you find her don't let her play you again yeah i'll be on guard she's i don't know she just seems to bring bad luck wherever she goes black cat brings bad luck that's a little on the nose pete felicia what have you done this time cops have blocked off the whole street if i can pick up the cat's trail maybe i can catch up to her looks like the security guard was hurt maybe the emt can tell me what happened what happened here spider-man uh i heard someone stole a rare book or something is the guard gonna be okay pretty bad case of photocarotidis basically a flash burn of his corneas but he'll recover i need to check the alley if felicia did this i've got to find her magnesium flare probably would burn that guard's eyes if i analyze the residue i can track her [Music] so so got it there's the trail let's see where it leads having a hard time focusing i can't be a dad i mean technically i can be but looks like a member of the machio crime family spiderman take him out and here comes some of his brothers you're done everything like i told the cicero guys i do not work for hammerhead better get back on the trail those look like hammerheads guys mj sending you a pic of a plate i need you to run got it i'll let you know what i find you get it the hell [Music] where's the drive she said she wanted to deliver it to hammerhead personally didn't i tell you to get the drive yeah but she gave the other ones to him so i just figured so i tell you to do something and you don't do it now you know what happens next wait wait wait wait wait wait wait [Music] hey don't act so surprised you said you knew what happened next [Music]  this one [Music] [Music] great [Music] here fellas it's probably overdue mj the cat got another day to drive just one more and hammerhead has the drives from all the other magia families we gotta figure out what's on those drives and there's something else there's this thing uh probably not a big thing but it could be a thing a little maybe a big thing please say a sentence that doesn't include the word thing okay the reason felicia's working for hammerhead is because he took her son i didn't know she had a son well certainly sounds like something hammerhead would do there's this other thing you know that she and i dated for a while yeah so oh oh are you serious i mean i don't know for sure but it's possible ew i need to hang up now okay then she'll call back when she's cooled off right i think i'll go on patrol for a while try to clear my head hey mj first things first head to this address it's the last known address of the costa family safehouse if my source is right they have the final day to drive mj listen no you listen [Music] i i kind of overreacted the last time we talked not at all you reacted exactly how i would we weren't together at the time and it's not like i didn't date other people right wait you dated people like plural the point is we're adults and there's a kid in danger so let's get to saving him i don't deserve you i know okay so i think i know what's on those drives years ago the families agreed to a joint accounting database in order to keep the peace put all their assets in one place and require all five data drives to access it so hammerhead steals black cat's son and then forces her to steal the drive so he can steal the assets from the other families hammerhead's trying to get rich quick and bankrupt the other families in the process [Music] all units advised reports of a missing vip witness in a magia investigation please proceed to cathedral [Music] felicia we need to talk oh i do miss our little chats but i've got to [Music] she run out my web shooters with an emp guess i'm doing this the old-fashioned way what's going on come on i want to help then back off if hammerhead's got your son you can't do this alone why not i've done everything else alone i'm saying you don't have to why won't you trust me we worked together before answered your own question didn't you felicia why didn't you come to me with this because it's not your problem it's mine and i'll handle it maybe i don't think it's a problem wait unless you mean the gang war cause that's definitely a problem i can take care of myself finally web shooters are back online i can help you stop hammerhead how no killing no breaking the law your way won't get it done felicia about your son i just need to know is he he's mine and i'll take care of him [Music] stubborn little spider i just want to talk [Music] still with me i could go all night if that's what it takes now you're getting my attention ah i guess i gotta play harder to get i need to get closer last time don't look for me hey stop running stop chasing me would you like to do something because i'm trying to slow you down got her finally now i can get in close um [Music] now can we talk like human beings this feels pretty human to me i know what's on those drives you're stealing look at you brawn and brains you can't give hammerhead the last drive once he has what he wants your son will just be a loose end let me help you what are you thinking stall him give us some time to find your son i missed you glad we're back together again not like that shame okay i can probably give us a couple days max so about your son is there a chance i'm later for now let's find him when he's safe we can talk about that keep in touch spider [Music] oh mj's gonna kill me hey you get her this time yeah she's gonna stall hammerhead while we all try to find her son did she tell you if you're she didn't say of course she didn't are you sure she's not just playing you i know her she wouldn't be working for someone like hammerhead
