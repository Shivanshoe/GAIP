abilities how curious i was tracking arm quest in hopes of discovering his secret base but instead he came here to a civilian facility known as the white house to meet with his leader the president i knew it armquist couldn't lead an army of ants cut to the part where i crashed the party find out what sort of place it is what defenses it has and then destroy all the humans gotcha no no stealth is our watchword just disguise yourself and make your way to the white house to serve and protect to serve and protect to serve and protect to swerve and defect to curve and perfect damn it i lost it

steam which is why the president has asked me to make some changes changes don't worry general you'll still be in command of our military forces that much i've decided you've decided it's only logical my organization has the skills the specialists but up to now we've been a federal agency operating on a limited scale this new threat however demands a radical new concept of national defense the hell are you talking about i'm talking about a project for a new american century the time has come to unite our five defense branches under a single chain of command five branches army navy air force marines and majestic of course you've got to be kidding me it's the start of a whole new era general and the president would like you to deliver the good news are you out of your mind you really think the joy chiefs will let majestic swallow them whole without a fight i think you better convince them to and general don't ever talk to me that way again yes sir so huh majestic in the army getting it on hmm i should have known those slide hogs bit cavalier about this aren't you why the hell not i don't think it makes any difference i didn't clone you to think and it may make a very big difference

heading to a meeting with the other human war mongers his orders ought to unite them against us no biggie i'll just take him out yes but that would still leave the others alive martyring armquest will only stiffen their resolve oh well i guess i'll have to do them too follow armquist to that meeting it seems majestic is using primitive listening devices they've discreetly placed to spy on armquest [Music] just don't let this stunt hold you up my analysis shows that bending an antenna has the desired effect of interrupting transmission one would think you'd done this before i'm shutting you down got it yes yes as they can no longer spy on armquist's little meeting majestic can get bent [Music] that rock hudson what a dreamboat did i just think that um lumberjacks football uh ah that that's
