[Music] Jean why [Music] throughout history the human race has adapted evolved to become the top of the food chain but recently evolution has accelerated creating unpredictable changes in the fundamental nature of man some welcomed these changes as a blessing while others seek to stop them at all costs William Stryker was one who tried to destroy all mutants in the end Stryker's plans failed but at a tremendous cost now magneto is on the run his brotherhood decimated and a date taunt has settled in the conflict between homo sapien and homo superior mutants are finding unparalleled acceptance in our culture becoming famous taking prominent positions in government but there is still a threat some mutants still use their powers for criminal gain others for vigilante justice and as long as magneto is free he threatens the stability of our entire world thank you the strain of gene dine took its toll on all of us professor your power will come back it's not me storm it's cerebro I

me see one of Strykers projects from years ago even before Weapon X went online we never thought he got it past the design stage but he did yes an underground group called Hydra helped him design and build the prototype a master mold a factory that can produce robots he called sentinels designed to hunt mutants and where is it we don't know it has shielding that is resisting even our most advanced tracking systems god help us home [Music] that's enough John where's rogue girlfriend not here to fight your battles for you I can't let you do this no you can't stop me devour you I'd get out of here

X program Stryker even used some of our designs for your improvements another one of strikers cronies you know nothing about what Stryker was really doing enlighten me Hydra went into business with striker to build the Sentinels it wasn't in our interest to turn them against mutants but he had other plans so you went to alkali lake to activate them fool I am mutant the activation of the master
