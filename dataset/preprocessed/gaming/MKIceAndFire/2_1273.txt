in that isolation tank me innopolis was built on the ancestral hunting grounds of monsters from another world as far as they're concerned were just game just pray but my father left me this city and this technology and here on planet earth man is the ultimate predator that's what bruno Borgia taught me it's Taif and blunt that's a law of the jungle behind all your fancy hotels and your diamond parlous turf and blood and brian that's why they all want a piece of bruno Borja in its jungle I'm the ultimate [ __ ] predator the king of the beasts I couldn't have put it better fire and brimstone

ugly son of a [ __ ] [Music] [Music] think that makes you the boss now something about this creature was different unlike the hunting parties of young males we'd captured before this one was older stronger a veteran of battles we cannot imagine unknown battlefields were only the strongest and most savage of killers can survive I'm a little concerned I may have underestimated the anesthetic dose and then as soon as I sunlight after all those years decades how could I ever forget how could it ever forget what I've done to it [Music] [Music] so hunter Borgia had succeeded where his father Bruno had failed conquering the new a devil one hundred years of progress had changed the odds in his little game and delivered the captive devil here to the birthplace of that progress it had already seen if humans were willing to do to their own kind in their pursuit of power twisting the living and cannibalizing the dead to produce the cybernetic enforcers of there's a new world order now it will discover what we had done to its own kind and its savage code of honor would demand a bloody revenge [Music] yes anyway what could I do I mean sure she's Brad's wife but I never liked that jerk-off
