oh but something came to me gotta give yourself time to grieve judy experience all its stages feel them let them play out shock anger depression i'd tiger claws killed one girl too many so people took matters into their own hands belongs to us now clouds could stand to get the same makeover i'm familiar with the story things did not go that smoothly i didn't say they did didn't say they would but every thought clouds would be safe you saw how far that got her how she ended i can't stand by and let things go on like this sure you've thought this through judy carefully haven't thought it through at all all i know is the mocks didn't turn things around by sitting on their hands and toned will you help fine got me on board yes okay so what's the plan first what she do officially she's a doll so she's a nobody you sure michael's going to want to join forces if i was sure i'd be on the hollow to her and we wouldn't be having this conversation let me rephrase there any chance you'll slap us around and shove us out of mega tower window of course sure yes i can work with that how well do you know i'll be by the entrance stretch that the balcony above class we'll sneak in no one needs to know we're there on the balcony got it cool today hello i'm julian jordan welcome to the world report on n54 news the western corporate states recently announced a new visa program persons intending to relocate there must first find a sponsor from among wcm's affiliated companies following a 20-year employment period within the wcs visa holders can earn the right to permanent residence a marriage license and a single child sweden has responded so hey v thanks for showing talking with michael is like a game of 3d chess don't let her derail you some deets about her could be useful when i talk to her don't you think no leave the talking to me so in brief i'm just here with your hustle right never said that i just know the woman better how do you aim to get her over to our side by telling the truth about evelyn what happened and why i think that'll cut it no have to improvise from there you seem a bundle of nerves i have a mind to kill the bastards with my bare hands so yeah you could say i'm a teensy bit nervous i'm ready let's go hold on i'll open it looks like you've come this way before more than once i have on occasion easiest pay yeah follow me judy alvarez i'd say it's great to see you but i've never been one to lie also i never like surprise parties but you know yup but i even know why thought you'd hit rock bottom when you joined the mox guess you've managed to stoop even lower now you somehow never failed to lower my expectations first you settle for the mocks now murderers i shudder to think what's next yes v i mean you sounds like i left a mark on this place good if by mark you mean buckets of blood and yeah congrats don't mind me just here to blend into the decor that's no reason why come at all to make sure judy gets what she came for jude would have had a better chance without you judy has a proposal about clouds wanna come back done always valued your skills you know that just don't get why you had to drag this loose end in here stop treating dolls like meat and i'll consider it but first things first clouds needs to be taken from the tiger claws okay look it's clear what happened to ev was traumatic huh i was convinced you didn't know that girl was asking for an unhappy ending i was just surprised it took so long we gotta do something or everyone lend up like evie woodman raped her while she was unconscious then sold her like she was so much scrapped yeesh you've always been unstable okay since you seem more reasonable care to explain what this is about judy's idea think about it it could work well well jude see you've found a true and loyal fan call me a murderer you're right i killed woodman i do it again in a heartbeat and if i'd known what he did to evelyn when she needed help i wouldn't have gone so easy on him tiger club bosses rule this place know how much i mean to them about as much as you two and your problems mean to me read negligible doesn't make you wonder why you even work here gonna pretend as if you two weren't ever here for old time's sake judy literally moments from now security's gonna figure out you're here got two options go out the way you came in or get thrown out and that's not a threat or figure of speech just a friendly heads up had enough i'm leaving smart move you picked the wrong side michael i'll be the judge of that that went smoothly she totally blew us off probably needs time to think couple of days tops and you might be right i'll call her tomorrow you two have a history way back yeah i think i just felt lonely like everyone in night city she was different then so was i can't trust people that see everything as a numbers game line between pat and you on the back is their friend and playing the knight kantra line between pat and you on the back is their friend and playing a knife in you as their enemy is down to a decimal i know right there with you i've well used to have a big crush on her it took me a long time to realize who she really was but still honest or crooked we need her just think could have gone diving this morning a little unwind and do you good do me good too actually i wouldn't have been unwinding not exactly got an idea buzzing in my head working it but can't say if it'll amount to anything yeah you a deck chair and a mai tai with a cocktail umbrella somehow i don't see it no me and the deck chairs me mulling over cutter's [ __ ] of wood is something i avoid right now so hold on you take the blow up doll really don't understand what tits have to do with selling that garbage can't say no to tits rez can go [ __ ] itself hey if it works blame your corpse all you want but at the end of the day it says more about us than them biz is biz and tits are biz it's like junk food people don't buy it because they're gonk they're just poor i'm sorry sir you have a moment of your time gotta get back to michael with something big appealing to her sense of justice wasn't big enough michael only works with specifics a minute there i thought you're about to call it quits v i go for days tuning virtues in a basement know what the chances are of somebody blowing my head off down there minuscule same as michael's empathy unlike you i don't put myself out there but this ain't over not yet you know i'm also partial to specifics so that's what matters how many you'll drop how much ammo you'll use how many eddies it'll get you art and
