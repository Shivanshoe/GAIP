men are still fighting they barricaded themselves inside the tunnel i can't help you what about our agreement relax listen there's another way through an old tunnel under the hills near the tango motel it was used by smugglers peacekeepers didn't even know about it it's been closed for years but if you manage to start the generators you might be able to get to the center and you're telling me this just now sorry adam i want to help you but most of all i have to help the bazaar good luck pilgrims [Music] [Music] locked how to find another way [Music] you there yeah kind of bit busy just letting you know we've detected movement among the pk's they're looking for you take care and good luck [Music] so [Music] that's a gre tunnel this could be the place hetcon talked about but no sign of waltz [Music] [Music] damn it maybe there's some kind of generator around here [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] just what i needed ah [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] well look what's behind door number one hey you don't call you know right and it was such a promising friendship waltz ordered lucas's death detective adam won't rest until he solves the case you expect me to believe you why would i because waltz is here i don't boys search the tunnel why would wolves have lucas killed it's weaken the pks to put a wedge between you spread chaos i don't know his plans i [ __ ] hate politics and you picked the wrong side what else is there to discuss peter peter they're attacking the headquarters they took the metro station what the [ __ ] come on grab that door this gun did it quiet i warned you adam the electricity's off we need to find the fuse box what's going on here who turned it off who do you think you're gonna be a smart arse now i'm just saying let's get him well you can't escape anyway okay search for the fuse box there should be a utility room nearby hepa check the other entrance you two search that tunnel it's a maze but if waltz is hiding here he had to leave a trail like any slug we're waiting aidan peppa do you have anything there are some wires but it's all flooded this doesn't look good lieutenant the equipment's been shut down for 15 years keep looking hopefully that's not the reason for the short circuit someone was here they yanked out the court [Music] hmm icon been through here i barely made it this far damn someone must have locked that door [Music] uh [Music] hey somebody's in here it's him get him [Applause] easy now surround him still on jack matt's leash save it for your trial just before they cut your head off do you really think that's how this is going to play out lieutenant lucas's death was just the beginning you admit you hadn't killed take him why does his death bother you you're not enjoying your new role new status new challenges new possibilities don't i deserve a thank you for making this possible nicely put now enough of your crap cuff him peppa i'm glad you finally joined us now give back what you stole from me give back the key boy or you will all die [ __ ] peppa what are you waiting you're gonna pay for what you've done [Music] a little boy wants to pretend he's a grown-up but he's no grown-up just a precious little boy [Music] boss is in the factory let him know there's something weird about him [Music] man [Music] oh what the hell i had it i found it what's happening to me what happened here i'm in the car factory over the key well there's the dre key this is it waltz i'm coming for you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are we going up here [Music] [Music]

you you'll get a chance to witness something spectacular [Music] everything comes full circle we return to the beginning and now you will witness history in the making the history five years old you taught your kids we were kids you were part of something greater you owe it to me that you are still alive that you are stronger than others special that you are stronger than i could have imagined yet not as strong as me any last words [Music] you're alive [Music] [Applause] okay he's transforming [Music] [Music] run get the [ __ ] out of there [Music] come on [Music] [Music] ah [Music] here [Music] [Music] no time um [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] that was close all right now talk who the [ __ ] are you i'm aiden and you why are you helping me show me your arm come on i won't bite well not hard we have something in common i was one of that crazy fucker's subjects too mia did you know a girl named mia mia no who's me she's my sister we were in a gre place together i have to find her well if she's alive she must be pouring herself with water somewhere in the city what not that i'd blame her what what are you saying [ __ ] you oh god sign of the times world we live in just saying i have to find her well first let's [ __ ] out of here not sure we managed to ditch that psycho [Music] hey wait hell she's fast [Music] the entrance to the central loop is not far away we'll be safe there [Music] um [Music] the military they're here bring them in uh earth to aiden man you were just a million miles away do you have nightmares about what he did to us all the time that's why i want to kill the [ __ ] waltz is number three on my list what about the rest of the kids who are in the hospital oh man someday someone will write a book about it and it ain't gonna be a bedtime story most of them are gone i ran across one guy though he'll sleep with a knife in his hand for the rest of his life in the refrigerator he converted into a shelter for himself that he'll never leave we didn't organize a therapy group if that's what you're asking so while it's experimented on you when how long when it's blurry the time i spent there but i was a lucky one managed to run after a few weeks i don't remember you i'll take that as a compliment those who do don't usually have fond memories most prefer to forget me if they survive maybe you ran sort of wait you got a hit list seriously do i look like i'm kidding the city's got a lot of trash and i'm the maid who's gonna make it the capital of cleanliness uh who else is on it besides waltz butcher hack on and you know what it's a very long list there's a few small fries that deserve a bolt between the eyes as well and by whose authority are you doing this you kidding me the highest court of justice in the land my own noble authority your honor and you what were you doing with that bastard hack on you'll have a hard time believing this but he saved my life when i came to town i was infected yeah no biomarker people at the bazaar wanted to hang me sure i'd do it myself but he got me out of there got me a biomarker can't believe he duped me he dupes everyone like everyone i trusted him once too oh really tell me about it maybe someday but my story's similar to yours he tricked me and people died better forget about him or do like me when you see him next make sure you have a crossbow and a bunch of bolts handy okay enough chatting let's go bossy i like that we gotta go hayden you there yeah i'm coming wow i thought you were gone apparently waltz was doing these experiments on the sly [ __ ] psycho but and no one in the gre noticed [Music] at some point they did i heard that's why they kicked him out too bad it was too late and hack on why's he on the list because he killed lucas no i like those blue puppets the pks but no i don't give a [ __ ] about lucas's death why then thought my dear is a long story for another day let's just say everyone on that list deserves a headshot and hackon deserves something worse [ __ ] this was always open we're locked out [ __ ] great this is a gre facility isn't it oh man it worked where did you get that you know dylan how do you know dylan no is an overstatement he contacted me because he wanted to escape the city and waltz he was frightened something must have happened or he found something what could he have found i don't know he knew i was in touch with frank but then dylan just disappeared stopped making contact [Music] dylan gave me this before he died waltz killed him [ __ ] so he got him after all also dylan told me to find someone named lawan you know who that is maybe we were meant to meet each other the universe brought us together for some [ __ ] up reason what i am the one dylan wanted to contact frank he said the pk commander lucas found something something walt's been looking for for a long time he wanted to escape the city so that waltz wouldn't get it the gre key i have it now probably lucas died because of this gizmo dylan two watch out or you'll be next it's valuable for waltz and valuable i suppose so you'd better not lose it oh what's going on impossible waltz must have switched on the generators waltz but why don't have a clue who knows what's in that fucker's head come on hurry up if the train is delayed the metro service is sorry for any inconvenience please mind the gap thank you for your attention you're [ __ ] welcome hurry aiden it seems we have a clear path to the central loop inhibitor container is aidan over here [Music] are we going or what i was sightseeing funny [ __ ] oh [ __ ] look light's here too look it's always [ __ ] unbelievable um come up to the roof we'll check it from above [Music] come on quick hey where are you so damn it i was wrong can't see [ __ ] i really thought it'd work you're [ __ ] duped oh well um at least it's peaceful yep that's why i come here when i'm pissed off so a lot believe me look aiden they're back on they're [ __ ] coming back on you see that again you see that it's beautiful oh i can't believe it no i just can't believe it you're seeing this oh i see it daniel i'm at a lookout point and it's quite the show how's this happen dark as hell for 15 years and suddenly this i don't know don't know but we need to find out then drop by the campaign and let's talk been missing you like last year's snowmobile while shotgunning beers and screwing bartenders you know me it's a gift i'll meet you there dumbass something's wrong no oh no no no no no [ __ ] what the hell's going on so that's the fish eye okay how do we get there the fish eyes gotta wait gotta wait but why we need to check the substations ones over there level with the pk tower what about the fish eye listen i want to help you and i will help we'll do this together but you have to understand it's the first it's been the same situation for over 10 years ten years of this [ __ ] darkness we gotta check this out how do we get to the substation it's an old power glider it'll help you get to places you normally can't reach just follow me wait [ __ ] [Music] [Music] not bad for a rookie it's easier than it looks i still can't believe this is happening i think walt's turned the power on somehow but why would he do that he's never helped anyone why would he give people power back are you sure it was him he used the gre key in the car factory i think that's when everything lit up that makes sense years ago the military took over the plan to secure the energy cells in the hills but i had no idea they could still be made to work and power half the city keep an eye on that key aiden hal knows what else can be done with it we better hurry to the substation [Music] nice but you better keep practicing if you hope to beat me i didn't know it was a race it's always [Applause] [Music] get going way better aiden but you have to control the wind otherwise it controls you [Music] [Applause] okay from here it's not far at all to the substation go there and activate it on my own you're a big boy you'll figure it out there's another one near the metro i'll check that one if we get one or both of these working means we can activate all of them hey but how do i activate it it's not rocket science aiden those are old systems i guess we need to make sure fuses and cables are working uh this paraglider can it be made to fly faster possibly but that's something you should ask master about you seriously ugh [Music] uh power gliders it used to be a night runner's favorite toy you're a night runner me night runner i wish they were really something hayden real heroes the only thing i had in common with them was substance abuse but maybe someday uh hey you seen any signs of renegades around here no see private now calm down and let aglot think what's there to think about why not head back to base who the heck are you anyway i'm someone offering to help i'll check what happened to the power you know anything else about it that's top secret military information we're trying to figure out how to get up there just go ahead and tell him everything why don't you every last detail what's the big secret huh we need to get this piece of [ __ ] working that's what my colleague's vastly oversimplifying things but his just is correct there are obvious signs of the electricity having returned and this here appears to be a substation it and others like it are capable of transmitting electricity throughout the city we have orders to get this building functioning once more meaning turn it back on unfortunately without climbing equipment access to it is severely limited you want the electricity for the peacekeepers what would you do with it plug [ __ ] in what do you think the gentleman here must be asking how it would affect other people if the control of power is in the hands of peacekeepers the answer however is relatively simple as well whoever controls the power controls the city i got it in any case i don't need equipment to get up there i can climb up there without the equipment you'd be willing to do that you'd be doing a great favor for the peacekeeper what was that he said i think it was something about his mother and a goat pk morons we'll be taking that electricity thank you very much kill him i'm gonna move for a fight yes [Music] my god [ __ ] in the barracks what about you bud who taught you how to fight like that name's aiden hey you guys know this one what do the bullets say to the man that got shot bang no just passing through [Laughter] you severed his limbs with a machete knit taff technically speaking that's a melee weapon while bullets are reserved i'm glad you're fine too still want to climb up there aidan not for free of course we reward specialists fittingly no time like now if you need any help up there give us a holler over the radio aglot's good electronics however from here i can estimate the level of damage done to the apparatus aglots got a knack for electronics man i've been on my feet too long um somebody was in a big hurry when they took it offline i would surmise the main circuit suffered a break find a cable and connect the source of power to the transmitter that should restore the circuit [Music] trying to connect power to the transmitter i wasn't a piece of cake in here after all sure you're gonna make it i met a bunch of pks who couldn't get to the substation themselves so that's why you haven't called me yet you should see them can't decide which one i like more you know that'll cost you right the peacekeepers they're all right but they're not the sort to help out of the kindness of their hearts i wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't for them besides they're down there and i'm the one up here tough choice huh i wouldn't give it to them i mean [ __ ] them they have their own men and what about the free folk someone should be on their side who else if not people like us hmm i'll think about it just don't take too long wait what i'm already done here and you're [ __ ] around over there always with the competition huh [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] container nearby oh [Music] so [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] all right plugged it in what now activate the control unit it's in the control room on my way your help is an important contribution to make this city safer i just wanted to say that so you feel appreciated until you understand how important this is okay thank you i guess [Music] [Music] [Music] just yank in your chain meet me back at the canteen this could be the start of something beautiful [Music] gee someone turned the power on whole neighborhood [Music] they seem to have some kind of [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] i didn't think it was so believe the night runners you fixed the station by yourself inhibitor container detected there are a lot more substations if we could get them all going that would be something power for the entire city imagine that maybe i'll hit up some of the others is i got something for you [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] dale the [ __ ] prepared here he's here [Music] wait what the hell is that [ __ ] i got something for you [Music] what's happening [Music] hmm [ __ ] [Music] your breath stank man anybody else [Music] you [ __ ] me ain't that are you kidding me [Music] am i thinking [Music] so god [Music] [Music] you're mine now yes uh so [Music] [Music] three [Music] [Music] inhibitor container nearby um [Applause] ugh bloody dukes they were worse than disease [Music] hmm uh inhibitor container detected inhibitor container nearby hmm um uh um uh [Music] inhibitor container look at nearby [Music] so container [Music] we who the [ __ ] they cares that the commander [Music] the one in the blazes turned those lights on we're looking into it sir be patient patient what good are you guys i'm sorry have you seen lawn can't you see we're having a conversation so you're a peacekeeper huh yes but as i say no one knows who turned on the lights and when it'll come back in other neighborhoods please be patient we're doing all we can to figure this out i'm just looking for a friend lawan you sure you know what to do if you catch that tiger by the tail anyhow she's probably out in the field somewhere but you can ask at the bar now that we've got the lights yeah but where did it come from all of a sudden everywhere in town that somebody had to turn it on right until we've eliminated the renegade have you seen the one of course i see her all the time oh wait you mean like today sorry got mixed up in all the excitement hey looking for lawn you know i can find her she was just here boo still didn't break your neck good this him the gajo you were talking about daniel i've heard a lot about you [Music] huh i haven't heard a thing about you at all do we have to see frank tucandano rocky wrestler obscene way chibi jackass what are you talking about that levant friends are my friends danier says that to get the power flowing we have to reactivate the other substations [Music] the power plants on but the cables couldn't take it 15 years took a toll atrophy muscularity means chewity untrained muscles wither come on frank's room is over there let's figure out why walt's turned it on in the first place good thought goggle better watch your back you have somewhere to be [Music] are we going one thing about frank do you see these people anywhere else they'd be savages at each other's throats but not here here they stay calm cool and collected because of frank they respect him because he was a night runner everyone here owes him something including me if it wasn't for frank i wouldn't be here and where would you be in a dark zone as a biter or in some den high and about to get higher frank will help us you can rely on him too trust me ready let's go break they slaughtered us one by one like [ __ ] rabbits frank frank it's me wake up you what the [ __ ] you doing here you know rubbing my conversation with robin's been dead for years frank pull yourself together you gotta visit her who's that queen of [ __ ] england i gotta act old danny now this is aidan he has a gre access key waltz used it to turn on the electricity in town working gre key you're full of [ __ ] show it him you get it from one of walt's men so you want a watson's men too hey easy frank aiden is on our side we think this contains data proving what they did to us in the hospital so you still believe you'll find out why walt's [ __ ] up your childhood okay i'll tell you ready yeah because he's a [ __ ] psycho he's [ __ ] in the head that's your holy grail and arc of the covenant all in one load happy hayden right you and luang can get the [ __ ] out of my face now i got more important things in my mind it would have worked if that [ __ ] had showed up at the tv station you were right ravik [ __ ] traitor without him we were like kids with slingshots going up against tanks we're not finished here frank this contains info on someone i'm looking for too i need to know how to read it it's a [ __ ] key not a diary you can use it to open doors start the electricity but it's useless on its own you need some place to stick it and before i tell you where you can stick it get out you'll give him your [ __ ] headache ravik you [ __ ] bastard why did you come back for this mission everything went wrong so many people so many wonderful people lawn says only you can help us luann tends to run at the mouth and you know what it's mostly [ __ ] she's a junkie i picked up from the street understand you don't believe me ask her she'll tell you everything herself so what the [ __ ] if we got to that floor we were in a pile of [ __ ] not even close maybe this tower is not being won and will not be one you understand we're all gonna [ __ ] die and then it'll be cool you'll shut up too i didn't come this far to let you blow me off like this frank you came all this way to talk to little old me well lottie [ __ ] dog congratulations you're a bigger loser than i am now get the [ __ ] out of here already see this revic he can't piss me off almost as much as you shut up that doesn't mean you can talk [ __ ] revic stop making excuses for this traitor denying what's happened frank damn it come back [ __ ] off kid while you're [ __ ] off take lawn with you i'm done the one it seems we're done here come on let's go walt's turned the power on with this key for the first time in years and i doubt he did that out of the kindness of his heart and you don't give a [ __ ] frank get your [ __ ] together you were a legend [ __ ] commander of the night runners do you even remember that that frankie's dead luanne he died with the others at the tv station why the [ __ ] would waltz turn on the power don't ask me i want a clue but if you're looking for the gre database you need to find a terminal to access it the thing is i have no idea where one could be and those whom you are probably long dead but the good news is we'll probably do that ourselves soon enough cheers now get the [ __ ] out of my quarters [ __ ] drunkard you hear that [ __ ] something's happening who you chuck i'm right behind you my god it's not possible we need help we're the peacekeepers for christchurch to all units renegades are in the central loop i repeat renegades are in the center they're surrounding the fisheye can anyone hear me over [Applause] oh [Music] you
