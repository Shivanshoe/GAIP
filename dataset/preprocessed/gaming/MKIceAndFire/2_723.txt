oh she's sleeping at least i think she is her eyes are closed and she's not shaking anymore i would have already killed her by now if i didn't feel so bad for her i need to talk to her listen i know you've got some serious questions that she's got the answers to i mean if i were you i'd want to know too but it's just not gonna happen she's completely out of it you've gotta be [ __ ] kidding me how's she feeling use your imagination that place sucked every last drop of humanity from her it's not enough she already gave up everything she had i just kept taking more and more she's in some kind of trance like she's folded into herself no reaction to her surroundings whatsoever i really really didn't want to poke around in her head i did it for you i just want you to know that you're mad at her why when you asked me to scour her behavioral chip i was just about done dealing with your [ __ ] judy i didn't have it i know it's okay so i don't get why you'll find out in a sec i'll show you the virtue i found how many bds did you manage to rip two only one of them's intact understandable though the rest well they're in the same shape as evelyn right now guessing you saw them already yeah i had to wrestle to make sense of the whole thing but i don't want to say anything and taint your perspective you should go in with fresh eyes okay show me give me a sec while i set the parameters guess we'll find out if our doll really did lose her tune come on v i'll be the first to admit this does not look good hey how you feeling you need anything i'm not here to nag just talk i know it's a bad time but i gotta ask you got any idea how to remove the biochip or know anyone else who might listen evelyn i really need your help it's important if i don't do anything and do it soon i'll die you're right this is a complete waste of time well now look at you [Music] have a seat all right roll it data was in pretty rough shape not all that editable glad you managed to salvage them in the first place needs a second to load quality is lousy but i did what i could what am i looking out for every single piece of tech i see security we need a layout of the whole room we will get everything else we need from the virtue what about his messages only if you can do it and be puffy it's most important that he suspect nothing try to be your usual relaxed self and if he starts talking about the bio chip himself should i bioship where you hear this that is not of interest to you you spin the virtue you come back here we give you the eddies that is your one job the rest is none of your concern understand take a look around if you want what am i looking out for can't see your face under normal circumstances that kind of encryption's easy to crack but not this time whoever she is she's got serious net running skills that or someone's working it for her [Music] i think i recognize these what you familiar with them not enough to know what they actually mean heard of who might use them though could be the voodoo boys but that's just a hunch can't [Music] relax self and might not be important maybe all of them are from pacifica now's down our search at least what now looks like i'm going on the field talking about the biochip himself should i all right i think we got everything [Music] the woman who hired evelyn any idea who we're up against your guess is as good as mine sorry v now we know what happened to clouds they're the ones who tried to flatline her launched a new could hurt ship so it was punishment for getting played by her she knew more than they thought she knew couldn't let that go so that's who she was running from looks like evelyn never told us the whole truth you're telling me if i'd known what she'd gotten herself into i'm so mad at her her only job was to record a virtue it's pretty damn amazing she managed to organize a full-blown heist and swipe the biochip from under her boss's noses so that's where you came in she hired you and brought this all on herself on youtube there's one more recording wanna see it sure why not nothing can surprise me at this point [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] i don't know haitian creole it is the voodoo boys didn't i wait let me see if i've got an auto translator meantime you try to tune in to the phone's frequency see what the other side's saying got it give it a second herder mentioned you're nobody probably why evelyn buried this recording deep cut another name as something like silver hat we have to know what they're saying it could be important fine just found the auto translate package should get along fine with your system i'll install it now [Music] okay judy we're good all right disconnecting i'd like me you got any idea a biochip we stole it's uh it's got silverhands engram burned onto it engram digitized psyche personality construct [Music] can you give me a minute i need to go over some stuff in my head um of course know who they are who the woman is any idea how we find them [ __ ] fee i've been dead the last half century sorry if i'm unable to hand you all the answers on a chrome [ __ ] platter when you snap your fingers these people what could they want from alt how the hell should i know got no notion whatsoever one way or another everything leads back to that net runner finding hers our biggest priority if she knows as much as i think she knows about the chip she can help us out thought you said nothing could help us nah just find us that juju wirehead okay so wait you got any idea how to get in touch with the voodoo boys why were they like if evelyn up to him no i didn't trust you at first but well if you wanted to get back at evelyn you would have done it already so why the worried look i just i want it all to work out for you you got a plan i'll ask around make a few calls let me put it this way the voodoo boys wouldn't trust a cat if it walked onto their turf but someone's gotta know way in well good luck i hope you won't need it see you around judy right um thanks be ah huh so hey what's shaking need to make contact with the voodoo boys chief if you can swing it all right all right straight to heavy business hmm now that'd be memo brigitte be tough getting a word into her huh i was led to believe you could arrange anything ah now that sounded like my third wife every time she wanted a new purse mama brigitte and that sounds like a spooky cult alias have not had the pleasure of asking her personally but it is what everybody calls her doubt the title has any real religious weight though voodoo boys play pretty fast and loose with their haitian heritage you really don't do any biz with them not with the chefs chefins priests and whatnot all got dirigible-sized egos won't talk to lowly me but if you insist i can ask around try to set something up i'll just need some details first sorry it's personal well that's [ __ ] helpful uh got something they want truly want to sell something to the vdbs trust me they don't want it they don't need it they're isolated insulated they got their own contracts tech networks but have it your way okay i'll see what i can do and get back to you i don't even know you got a problem hey good to hear you finally been a long time since we talked since when jackie pass away how are you doing how you think my son is dead but i am hanging in there calling to offer my condolences offer your condolences you lived under a roof have the decency not to treat me like some stranger you just met i was going to call you i prepared an offrenda for jaquito we can't let him go without a proper goodbye the ceremony will be at the coyote many of his friends will be there say no more mama i'll be there i did not doubt it for a second i eat them slow down the pool table we got to get rid of it really he's pretty massive so maybe we scooch it put it up against the wall the nice to see you okay sit sit you want a beer wouldn't mind one salud a lot of time has passed how you been been better to tell you the truth what is happening at night when jackie fell i should say things haven't exactly been easy since i am in the middle of preparing an offering there is still so much to take care of and a friend what's that exactly friends and family we gather to celebrate the departed our memories of them and we bring things they loved in life and might need in the after sure some beard be at the top of jackie's list and there will be beer i could help you with that but i will manage it's enough you come to say goodbye want to take part in the ceremony but i want to do it the right way in line with tradition but something i'd lay by his casket that'd do justice to his memory i don't got anything but your heart is in the right place don't worry he's symbolic look for something in his garage his past is all there jackie had a garage he used it for his motorcycle mostly but not so long ago he moved in you'll find something there i'm sure you won't mind me digging through his stuff no mijo he's gone and funerals are for the leaving not the dead thomas take the key thanks mama wells ah don't mention it we you have respect i admire that the garage is on republic so ivy you here alone this is not exactly the safest neighborhood in town misty i used to sit on the stairs when i was 10. 26 now if anything was gonna happen it wouldn't have taken this long what are you doing here sitting and waiting and yeah waiting for him though i know he's never coming back lately i've just been coming here to sit an hour sometimes too i know it's gonk it's just i miss him a lot wanna sit catch ketchup hardly gonk at all just well human i guess you know each other long half our lives grew up in the same streets saw each other a lot but just never got together till a year back yeah best darn year of my life jack talked about you a lot always saying how much you meant to him did he really say that i better use different words maybe but that's what he meant i really believe that you actually got to know him the real jackie everybody else thought he was a goofball with a rough hewn face and an edge but they're wrong did you see in him let me tell you what he told me once told me he'd take a bullet for me in an instant even if it'd kill him spoken like a true hayward boy a man with dreams ambitions only thing they cost him was his life there's a huge chunk of his past in there i'll come here outside i don't have the key jackie never gave you a set you two didn't get that far he offered but i wanted him to have his own space just his own mama wells is having a send-off for jackie i need to find something he really cared about you might give me a hand i'm not sure i should go in there v still too soon no it's not that mama wells and i aren't exactly on the best terms she wouldn't want me touching any of his things disturbing the memory that i know jackie would want you here that's more important come on jackie loved to pump iron didn't he he called it his form of meditation he used to say barbells are the best listeners they understand all your problems and never give you gunk advice gotta be hanging here since 2020 it's a fine piece of metal and mechanics he was so psyched loved to poke around engines he was 15 when he first got on a bike knowing him it's a miracle he never wiped out for whom the bell tolls ernest hemingway jack read it a dozen times always right before a big job he said the guy who wrote it was tougher than morgan blackhand have you read it is it any good i i never got the chance it'd be a good tribute for the offender though i guess no man cave is complete without some of those huh he said they're collectibles they don't print them anymore that's definitely why they're up there yeah still full his favorite strategic reserve no touching how come porque no puerto una reserva esta basketball signed by dante gonzalez he was from haywood too everyone here shot hoops dante ran circles around him i think he might have been the first kid to ditch the valentinos like jackie they both wanted more out of life dante's captain of the nc blackouts now oh jackie it's a long story hey you all right i'm so much better than all right i once told jackie he should sweep all the dark energy out of this place a sand mandala do the trick for example he told me that out of sand he'd build a castle a home the wells family hideout stronghold something i guess you made a bigger impression than you thought i guess i did it's beautiful it's hideous but it's also the most beautiful thing i've ever seen an aquarium they used to be tacos and taco was miss fish a dwarf shark like minnie sounds like a mighty expensive fish oh i don't think he bought it jackie's favorite tequila still sealed it's his lucky charm one of the first bottles ever made by jesus de abajo what the founder of censon tequila only a hundred of them left in the world all owned by the one percent how'd jackie get this one some shriveled abuela in mexico sold it to him told him de avajo had stolen her recipe nice still it's got to be jackie's dad old school ganger valentinos of course do you meet him no i only ever heard about him but he didn't exactly inspire many fond memories leather belt sort of a memento his dad's used to beat both jackie and his mom with it until one day jackie fought back kicked his butt told him he'd kill him next time old man was hospitalized and then he left why'd he hold on to it in case his dad ever comes back so so taking this yeah perfect for jackie well you got something for your refrenda but we could look around a little more better get going actually via i think i'll stay awhile say bye to him here mama wells wouldn't want me there anyway what happened between you two what's the beef let's just say she didn't see me as daughter-in-law material what'd she have against you that my name wasn't camila and i wasn't jackie's ex-output camilla was mama well's favorite right you gotta come misty you got a right to be there i'd rather not get in mama wells way it's for family you were family to him i guess you're right thanks v so shall we go whoever thought you might leave night city sure once upon a time i even tried seriously meaning packed my bags and hopped on a plane and nepal thought i'd stay there after a week i realized i couldn't live without the traffic

to start sit down please i thank you all for coming today i'm not going to tell you what kind of man my son was or lament about how much i miss him instead i'll tell you a story when he was about 19 years old jackie was in the valentinos they were at war with miles from back then i get a call from the hospital they tell me he got shot three times just by the heart he was conscious when i get there so many tubes coming out of him he looked like a like a pulp like an octopus or something he tell me he said [Music] look i'm bulletproof nothing bad will ever happen to me and when i go he take off his valentino's ring he swear he won't need it anymore but he was not scared he just didn't want me to worry these guns and pass me among the membership of the night city devil's boxing club we had this saying make your best friends among the fighters who knock you out cold and it's true jackie's arm was a cannon no one's ever hit me as hard i can still almost feel it well frowns buddy anyone else i uh i often think back to the first time me and jack met it all started when he put a heater to my head [Music] then some badges showed up beat the [ __ ] out of us both it's half my fault half his and we hightailed it out together half an hour later while we're eating dinner mama wells turned out to have more in common than we thought principles jackie wells [Music] best friend you could ask for loyal to a fault once he set his mind to something he was ready to die to achieve it he once told me brodar the one thing we can't do is be afraid of others he kept haywood in his heart always made him who he was but most importantly jackie loved life and had no fear hard on his sleeve he didn't overthink things he just went for it i thought he was bulletproof and that he became legend at the afterlife and ultimately he did what he set out to do [ __ ] in the shoes of some powerful people and if he's watching i bet just about now he's flipping him all the bird he always wanted more than he got out of life rest easy too i would like to say a toast or thank you for your kind words we i'm glad you're here it was a beautiful friend that we gave him board you
