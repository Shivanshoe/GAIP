have done more we should have rallied the whole of asgard when the mushrooms invaded smarter fame and you should never have let our son come here he sought to prevent this war was that not a worthy goal as for asgard the builder's treachery was still fresh we needed to rebuild honor our debt there was little appetite for further conflict i recall you said the same when sutured invaded alfine now the elves are no more now you dredge up ancient history you should have intervened lord of asgard then and now instead suta has grown too bold and our sun may be the cost of it do not say so freak we'll find him yet what have they done the city lies in ruins this is worse than i thought i've put this land to flame and sword boulder he is nearby javi i feel it you feel it the bond of mother and

death lingers in my nostrils that was no mere dream i must seek valka's wisdom [Music] mistletoe nothing more until i see you next [Music] [Music] the air hangs heavy around you ever you are troubled i had another dream a vision like the last there's one full of fire tell me i saw the god balder broken and beaten held captive by his suitor i i tried to save him but i was defeated and left to die in a pit of corpses when i awoke i found this in the fold of my clothing balder also dropped off his own death this tale i know afterwards his mother freak visited everything living or dead and had them swear not to harm him but he overlooked the mistletoe boos and so fate had its way not all visions are premonitions abor but all hide wisdom if we have the wit to see it drink this if you would know more then go to the sacred circle behind my hut there is more mistletoe there lay the mistletoe around the circle light it and stand within we shall see what your dream has to teach you the mistletoe is in place ready for burning oh what is the meaning of this is this some part of your ritual the flames throw ever closer ah you'll find me alive if you would reach your dreams avon you must not run from the fire you must be coming [Music] [Music] [Music] are you well javi's not well a passing weakness is nothing we should continue are you sure we could rest a while they kidnapped my son murdered his mother i will not rest till i repay these wrongs forgive me you lifted me from that fly-blown hell set me on my feet again you do not deserve my rage and you do not belong among the dead not yet now come on your gift awaits still have not told me the nature of this gift nor why you offer it it's nature you will know soon enough as to why well you have seen the suffering the musicals brought to svartage fire and ruin and slaughter they may waste lands of our green meadows and enslave those they didn't kill they keep your people as slaves i sort zortor works them for some dark purpose of his own what that is we don't yet know we can't fight them harvey our people are broken forced into hiding but now the tides of fate have washed the lord of asgard to our shores i'm not your savior i mean only to find my son then return him greet us have soothed and you might save us nonetheless that's why we offer you look upon the splendor of our [ __ ] hubby a sight to stir a cow on heart and all the nine worlds the crafters of svatel fame have no equal ah a oh hammer and tongs they're here they're looking for the gift this dog dares to steal a gift intended for me javi you have to stop them with pleasure keep back i will deal with this well done javi we should search around here hopefully with better luck than that it must be around here somewhere what are we looking for i see nothing but stone there should be a hidden catch it's somewhere right about here take it lord of asgard put it on from the dwarves of sparta pain to you this is the mighty gift indeed told you they'd like it with this bracer you can draw out the essence of fallen foes steal their powers and make them your own try it now on that moose spell you killed i feel it fire charges my blood i but you'll need more of it before you can take on their powers let's keep moving you best keep moving it's the essier sound the alarm here [Music] spawn of asgard flame and ash a powerful incentive to kill the enemies of the dwarfs aye it's almost as if we've planned it or something where this one was filled there'll be others let them come i have death in the fall the brazer grows weak i must find a way to revitalize it i must remember to draw new strength from the world around me i drew about the muscle's power and the lava did not harm me what other gifts might this bracelet grant be the other side was the bird are you there open the door they're taking too long oh one of the most smells got them with dude drop your fretting i knew you can do it hi sure never doubt it for an instant javi your braces magic will run dry if you do not replenish it look around see if there's something here that will help you to do so we must hurry if the enemy found these hidden halls they can find the shelter shelter a sanctuary a secret hideaway only the dwarves know when the invasion began our people took refuge in such places but the threat of discovery means we're always on the moon holstein and i left our own shelter in search of resources and we returned everyone was gone leaving nothing but a secret sign to show us how to follow that shelter is somewhere nearby we'd better find our companions before the moose fell obstacle where's the door these flowers are useful those flowers like the shrine they call out to the bracelet so oh it's gone that block of stone is closer we could make the jump the musical's in the fire sludge it's everywhere i will move that block nearer and make it across thanks hobby i knew you wouldn't let us down i never will you saved my life not so long ago then i shall use this new trick to my advantage i will and then give them a big nasty surprise let's be on our way i thought i heard the mewing of an assyr kitten my husband should have stamped on you when he had the chance but mercy is no flaw of mine i will see red vengeance on all of you for what you have done and i will enjoy watching you fail you should have stayed in asgard ah ugh right you fight well better than your woman at least come at me then let's finish this oh i'll be back i will hunt you to the far corners of the nine worlds treasure every moment javi for death is at your heels and you know not the hour it will find you damn you to hell you beat cinema i never dreamed i'd see it fate has truly sent us a hero fate bends to my will now show me to the shelter of yours the fine they left us spoke of a hidden power look around in the woods that will set us on our way [Music] that symbol a dwarf mark he points the way to the shelter let's examine the map for any clues see here javi this is a map of svartalfam you can see the shelter should be nearby there are other shelters too we only have a rough idea of their locations but when you get close you'll see the signs [Music] i can't wait to see their faces when we arrive vimbar bro old garage and his dirty beard bimba still owes me 20 silver from losing at cards bet he thought he'd got away with it too remind me never to play you at cards huh the day you part with a coin is the day the sky falls down another we must be getting close there's a hard part to walk well hidden has to be or else the muscles would find it but day by day they're learning to read the signs and once that happens no dwarf will ever be safe again where is the next sign it should be here hidden perhaps let's look around good work let's be on our way then we are getting closer are you sure about that yes we should go left after the next sign no no and certain it's to the right you are mistaken as usual follow my lead [Music] hmm might be i took a wrong turn i told you didn't i let's haste more care let's retrace our steps [Music] yes yes this is the right path the sons of ivaldi have steered us true i see it now have a little faith house thing i know what i'm doing hal stain oh shut your face who are these sons of evil that you mentioned evil dee is a name well known to me but he never spoke of children yes he was your slave once wasn't he hosting oh sorry perhaps slave wasn't the right word uh your freedom deficient associate the sons of ivaldi are those who follow eve aldi's teachings we're not all male either though you can be sure whoever came up with the name was eve aldi learned much from the essie during his time in ascar not least the value of being prepared for unexpected attack after his return we set up a network of shelters bolt holes in case of disaster it's thanks to us there are any dwarves left free at all if freedom's what you can call it speaking of which first order of business is to find the chief and warn him about those spells else there'll be no one left for us to protect [Music] and call me an elf you found us and with all those spells on our doorstep you know about the moose spells wouldn't be much of a chief if i didn't hope you didn't wear yourself out coming out to warn us actually we kind of did and who's this you've got with you i'm harvey called wolfsbane ravenguard the high one of asgard that right they call me brood our scratcher snot snorter he of the crusty toe javi is here because we have an enemy in common sutra has taken his son captive he fought sinmura to a standstill i saw it surtrey any enemy of that oversized stack of heart sweepings is a friend of mine come inside you two get some rest wait javi before you go i have another gift we would not have made it here without you no i without you my friends i'd say we're even take this all the same it's silica bring it to a blacksmith and they will put it to good use on your behalf thank you secret and you helstain may our paths cross again soon you must have done something right that stuff's rarer than hen's teeth these days the muscles they seized the mines and now they guard him carefully bunch of overly flammable bastards still if you ever need more you're welcome to slaughter your way to one of their stockpiles my sign is in sutras clutches i have no time for diversions might be you change your mind once you see it put to use let me show you our blacksmith salutations chief who's your friend here they've got too many names to remember all you need to know is they've got silica and the bracer of such craftsmanship as makes my hammer arm weak with empty that's a fine thing indeed but maybe not so fine that it can't be enhanced somewhat any half piece of blacksmith should be able to help you improve it assuming you have the right materials of course others here will be glad of a stranger silver look around the while if you like you know my purpose i have no time to tarry here he asks for death who goes to battle unprepared i'll see you at the entrance when you're ready back again so soon it seems but a moment since i saw you last it is said by your kind that time passes swiftly to the bead of hammer on anvil i and those who say it have never lifted a hammer in their lives how can i serve how came you to this place did you flee here when the invasion began i know i was here already study where the refugees started coming in what is there to study here calico porphyry serpentine banded nice precious obsidian silica gold oh friend there is beauty in the earth here in this secret place we gathered all we knew of the thousand facets of emir from whose body sprang all creation i dreamed of learning fantastical techniques of crafting armor with materials never before attempted but that dream has died i suppose along with so many others sachi's fate [Music] any other way i can help is oh what in the nine worlds is that terrible stench oh that it's me have you considered taking a bath you smell like someone vomited on a week old carcass and then shat on it afterwards no bath will cleanse the stench of shame are you here to trade or to add to my misery tell me of your shame i was a warrior once head of the militia charged with keeping law in our village then the muslims came my people looked to me to lead the defense to give time for the others to escape but when i saw them you ran i hid in the village cesspit how long i lingered in that unspeakable filth i'll never know but when i emerged it was all over none survived that day none but me so i put away my axe forever and tried to make myself useful down here but though i strap my skin raw the smell of that split never leaves me the mark of my cowardice my curse forgive me i cannot stay here any longer you know you ain't the first stranger to come around here a while back our scouts saw a u-turn creeping about name of hurricane hurricane no doubt she flees the wrath of sutunga and gun luther hers was not a name i expected to hear in this place her presence here may be an ill omen or it might mean nothing at all you as guardians like to be vague don't you walk with me now let's have some straight talk one thing puzzles you cower in these holes like rabbits why not fight back we fought at first fought hard but they hid our leaders scattered us once they divided us we were done then join together race your axes and throw them off not simply look we don't even know where the others are the shelters were planned so that if one of us was caught we couldn't give them all away but you could find them i'd wager my business is the suitor and rescuing my son you might have noticed that suitor can't be killed could be a problem i'll find a way or else i will seize what he values most and trade it for bothers freedom either way you'll need our aid you don't know an inch of this land listen harvey i understand this isn't your war you just want your son back but those more spells on our doorstep they ain't no joke if they find us we're dead meat think about moose spells though is they love to fight amongst themselves all that's stopping them is fear of slutter take out their leader they'll tear themselves apart flee back to muspelhane most likely the swat el fame will once again belong to the dwarves dwarves who will be very very grateful to the one who delivered them there's more gifts where that racer came from i make you no promise i will seek out your shelters perhaps there i will find the means to save baldur good enough for now [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to smart alpha from here [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] gods here are legit uh died [Music] huh uh uh [Music] uh uh [Music] this gemstone might be important ah so uh oh let's end this [Music] ugh do that [Music] uh here you die now foreign what dark spirits torment this land [Music] [Music] uh uh uh [Music] [Music] [Music] malevolence this land bears deep affliction [Music] huh damn troll magic will then the curses holding here uh this shelter must be nearby what are they looking at there must be something wait a minute warming markings if i follow they will lead me to a shelter i wonder what this nonsense means a bone or a riddle this points the way to a dwarn shelter the dwarves hide their paths in plain sight this points the way to a dwarf shelter there's a shelter not far from here ah dead end these dwarves are cunning indeed a dwarven moon a dead end ever since uh [Music] must be on the right track um there's a shelter not far from here good woven rune he has a child's innocence my boy i pray as it's still after all of this these dwarves i need them for chase me to admit it gracious harvey humble and patient the dwarves hide their paths in plain this way will take me to the dwarves blisters please ah her outsider tell me stranger have you seen any heaps of dwarven bodies piled high moose spells reeving the land ruined villages well there have been as a thought the invasion is nothing but a fiction dreamed up by our rich masters so they can add to their wealth well two can play at that game many rare gems lie unguarded while we hide underground bring them to me and i will see you well-rewarded you do not believe there has been an invasion control your it's all about control if you aren't a shepherd you're a sheep but you could simply go outside and see for yourself i don't need to it's already plain as day well tell me you've fallen for it too the moose smells i've slain were no lie and i've seen more dead dwarfs than i can count oh no yeah you're one of them aren't you spare me your falsehood serpent tongue the truth cannot be denied i'll see what i can find for you [Music] you are always [Music] songs of my deeds follow me my enemies do not well if you're sure not many know this place not even the other dwarves that's how we'd like to keep it you price your secrecy here even more than other dwarves i've met well of course they'd only just discovered this place when the invasion began those of us nearby were herded in quick best thing we can do now is to keep our heads down don't need strangers going in and out bringing who knows what to our door i am no friend to muscle iotan glad to hear it see that it stays that way anything else speak up enough of this no don't worry i'll be careful this time yes no need to remind me now it was only a little blood who are you talking to us i'm speaking to no one good sir take a seat let me get my needles and blades you spoke of voices when none are to be heard are you moon touched voices the very idea that crystals can talk and that they would be speaking to me it is you who is mad for even suggesting it i made no mention of crystals that's because they don't talk to you you're not special i think you've been down here a very long time what have you got for me today i might just try elsewhere if only king raymar was still alive they wouldn't be stuck down here who goes there i am javi lord of asgard you you're a long way from home or the ass you're now invading us as well jailer avivaldi evaldi owes me his freedom where is he i would speak with him be my guest i assume you know the way to hellheim he's he's dead oh how else or do you need both eyes to see the moose spells everywhere that was uncalled for leader of this shelter or what remains of it now ivaldi is gone he was trying to make contact with the other shelters there was an ambush glods soldiers and something else something worse a creature of fire and it fury evan hall no doubt bret inserter's dungeons perhaps loki's aid before i could make him my captive you and your captives regardless uldar fell soon after eval did our minds and miners any survivors now serve clot is that name meant to mean anything to me global suitor's bastard son hath must spell half utah a nightmarish being capable of tearing a dwarf in two your people will have vengeance no the people of uldar are finished and yet god has not simply slaughtered you people he needs your miners to what end the invaders hunger for secrets buried deep in the ground ancient relics the moose spells place great importance in them and how do you know this enough javi we have suffered enough now i must endure all these questions aid me with your knowledge and i shall strike a blow against glad and all muscles in uldor we had someone gathering information for us the miner frithiover he's been silent for days now we're just unlike him probably dead for all i know anything sought by the moose belt must be mine where was fritzio the last scene perhaps i can find him there is a house in uldar its owners killed by muspells long ago there we would exchange messages with him this house how do i find it it's the tallest house in the jewelers district by the city southgate just look for the gold in the streets you'll see faith yoga may be the key to obtaining these relics sutra seeks i must find him do as you must lord of asgard i have too many burdens of my own to worry about yours as well is it lunchtime no probably not so event is dead a pity but ulda may yet reveal something of value that i can trade for boulder or use against sutar and i we brought balder here once too although when he was just a boy now both are captives loki deservingly by my hand and boulder by suitors will be saved and his mother avenged i should be cautious uh oh [Music] uh here oh [Music] always have been too busy squabbling over their minds i'd wager they put up no real fight against the invaders have you seen it is he still inside oh leave us alone i remember this was a lively city once a place of great happiness you will be incinerated don't bite they're going to feed the world oh so so be my eyes gold in the streets the house i seek should be close this is where a gunmark told me to look i once saw bluff crush an ogre's skull like it was a raw egg [Music] oh down ah [Music] you die now [Music] ah ugh oh so much gold strewn about so what happened here someone was beaten tortured perhaps then dragged along the ground here generally for every occasion this building surely played host to important moments in the lives of many look at it now [Music] completely over rights of holding cells within ulda therefore wolves who disobey may yet live like this tira he mentions [Music] the artisans who once worked here their life's work how trippy all these trinkets must seem now given all that has happened huh what do we have here the sons of ivaldi tried to warn frisia of increased muscle activity in ulda i wonder did he get to see this message this place was used to exchange messages but fridhiova was careless the spells found out ambushed him and took him from here to the holding cells then i need to get into the smelting foundry show me these relics suit our sikhs i'll cease them for myself and use them to party for baldur's life or to end suitors [Music] everybody feels cold [Music] you pleaded dog hill spread out [Music] yeah i can feel this melting foundry's heat see why the spells keep prisoners here roast the whole part of them poor bastards this is their future and for them cannot come soon enough i however forge my own destiny shut your mouth wretch what do you want to bake in the cells [Music] i'm looking for freedom they they took him below we are safe thank you do you have water no now which of you is with you no i am and i do not care you are you physio i don't know any frizzy over here is

[Music] over three mindy ahem breathe you there that isn't very well the sons of vivaldi were active here but no longer i suppose no they were not of much use to you or freely you [Music] no they will not have much use to you i'll feel you or evaldi for that matter let's go truly i regret letting smart fame fall to sutra and i've been more vigilant perhaps balder would have never fallen into his clutches my son as kind as he is which way is it [ __ ] cathode mother tyra queen trio sign weird and cupboard that's what i get for trusting a dwarf there must be a clue here the road heads west and has fresh tracks from a cart clearly in regular use this main road continues north away from uther a road like this surely leads to another city oh gosh i tonight there must be another way to be sure look around tyra what is this lettering intentionally damaged and written in a script i cannot read tyra can you make sense of that yeah yeah freddie over i find you impressive tyra unless a dwarf would only be interested in saving their own skin yet here you are on this journey determined when we get to our destination be sure to stay out of harm's way yes wolves why did it have to be wolves

i'll meet you at vergel minion and we shall forge the sunstone into a new form i watch you forge i will bring you the sunstone my sight i think it's returning i i can't believe i told you to kill my father everything he did was all for you you ungrateful cur that doesn't change the fact that he did those things though does it enough lip i'll take your sight for good i have practice in tearing out eyeballs it's supposed to be the place don't list this water but a simpler life one that has been denied to me thanks to loki not to mention my own occasional foolishness so only one thing watches over this tiny village that's that you nothing but whatever stone was here has been carefully removed no scratches no scorches so it was not taken by muscle hands let's see you old friend when i was a child my brothers and i would rob the fairies innocent times i remember how the fairies sometimes got wind of our approach and try to hide their treasures fairies dwarves they all think alike i must search the knocks and crannies of this village leave no stone unturned uh this shows promise nope there you are now let's see what they now can do with you happy i was starting to worry you may have met with resistance those who assist me are not long for this world indeed and we are not short of foes in this area so i'd be glad for your company come my workshop is close here ayna your sunstone this is where you worked before the moose spells invaded one sight of many indeed when the moose pillars took uldar captured freaky offer and my niece tyra yes i returned to the city worked with the sons of evilde but to no avail so i allowed myself to be captured offered my services to glott to rescue your son there's more to you than meets the eye mastaina as you can see it's been some time since i was last here now if i may ask what does the high one of asgard seek in svartalfeim my motive is not so different to your own a son to rescue to do so i believe i need the relic though to what end remains a mystery i see so you're not here to save dwarf cat if butchering spells in my path ate your course then i will not deny you my gifts you are most generous it has been certain yes damn it alter helheim what what is it javi forgive me what do you fail me aina the sunstone must endure incredible heat for me to render it into a new form my instruments are no longer capable i'm sorry give it to me i have the means to endure any heat of course when the process is complete the sun stone will shine brightly bring it to me then and i shall finish what you have begun big words from one so small it will be done now to subject myself to the kind of heat that would kill all but i must spell words thank you with me [Music] this is an elaborate deception ana's death will be considerably more simple i must continue they now know what to do next how did you uh i know better than to ask do you have what you need now yes i believe so let me see ah still hot will this work ana sorry uh sorry i just i've only ever read about this in the ancient scriptures i've never seen it with my own eyes can you get me into the vault or not i believe so but blood is no fool he'll surely have made preparations let me worry about glad as you wish now if all has gone to plan fritz your friend will be in position by the time you arrive within uldar's old city the great cavern at its heart and you

old and slow we must begin without him do you know what must be done my father is the expert in these ancient relics but how hard can it be now place the sun stone here surely it cannot be so simple no this mechanism what was it i think yes we need more light to converge here on this spot leave it to me stay outside see what the light reveals yet the sunstone hungers more light is needed it is working enough was right the sunstone must be satisfied now the relic will be mine the vault of the ancients what is wrong why isn't it opening is there something wrong with the mechanism yeah about that i'd feel a lot more confident if my father would help get to work i'll stretch my fighting arm let's stretch the money kill the door come feed the flames leave no breathing space okay we are for sure um before oh ah [Applause] [Music] it is done took you long enough by emails armpits what are you doing here you one night [ __ ] seeking a relic it's somehow grown more wrinkly and ill-tempered

disarray not while surtour is in power tell me more of the relics and what you did with them what happened in the vault what do you think glorda tortured me commanded me to revive the relics then extract their magic so that sort of might use it in some way and you could not how [ __ ] dare you of course i could but not for [ __ ] like him of course gload was too dim to see that i was dispelling the magic rather than storing it and as soon as i knew you were coming i gutted the relics rendered them useless so no mighty weapon for that prick suitor it is unwise to underestimate such an enemy but you were short-sighted if aldi i could have made good use of that magic well if it's items of power you seek during my imprisonment i heard rumors surter is building something something small yet very very potent and highly valuable to him so valuable that if it were to fall into your hands you might do some real damage here i think music to my ears i will seek out wisdom on the subject more ancient and advanced than even my own but first i must equip myself with some decent tools starting with a hammer and maybe a chisel or two [Music] there is a dumb in the north of van

tragedy no doubt but life's about searching for that glimmer of gold i'm happier here than i ever was before i would welcome a glad tale i've been few enough of late i'm a blacksmith good as any man you try telling that to them up there if you don't have hairy forearms and a beard they'll go somewhere else business was bad no one gave me a chance thought a woman's hammer toil was inferior those clod-brained dunces then the invasion we fled to this shelter and i'm the only smith down here are they paying attention now you bet they are the finest armor the sharpest swords they sing the praises of elga the smith now just sad so many had to die for them to see it and want good to [Music] [Music] trademark [Music] is [Music] sail out um this looks like a bird's list must be on the right track a shelter must yes the dwarves hide their paths in plain sight fix up your boat or don't makes no odds to me have you got any new designs for me i would like to see what you have in stock anything else your enthusiasm is quite inspiring oh is it that's nice are you buying something i'll come back later [Music] looking for work bretta is always happy to oblige have fun be welcome friend let me make art of your skin a sculpture of your hair the plight of your people has not dampened your spirits it seems the surest cure for sadnesses to make many and we have made maddie indeed what have you got anything else does it not prick at your conscience to feast in this place of plenty while you can starve throughout the realm should i be miserable because they are to each their fate mine was to find sanctuary here beneath the bountiful tree i will enjoy what time i have till better days come or not another time look around there's got to be a tank that we can tongue a few drops out of don't let me interrupt you lord am i pissed or does the all father stand before me uh both [Laughter] this this is good and the wise one will surely help solve our problem let us help one another what exactly is the source of your grief here rhymes rhythm oh we could use your poet's heart my what your words your gusto we the greatest of the sons of evild i need a fitting end to the song well rn i'm here to understand how you might help me strike back at sutra strike back nonsense besides it is not only he we must contend with but his kin his daughter asa stars above snatches up our people forks them to death an unwinnable war all that's left to do is eat drink shag and seal our legacies exactly but as is clear as day we have drunk ourselves to hell and no crying sticks the way it should so it must be you who completes the song of our saga mine and loms that is not why i've come of course it is faith has brought you here we are to be remembered and revered by all yes with javi among us we must adjust the final verse listen closely till the depths of spartalheim great javi came met with dwarves he knew not my name in search of warriors without remiss instead found cowards who reek of piss and not quite what i was thinking let's try you call yourself the sons of evil d why to [ __ ] on his name brahmer i don't think he means to lend his words to our song go away mom your words carve deep wound but they are true enough each day we see our numbers dwindle trends go out do not return choice to forget is alluring sutra has stolen my son and i do not have the luxury of forgetting you said suture has a daughter yes clever cunning commands an elite swath of warriors she oversees sorter's operations here whereby i find her there is a smell tree of the road the dwarfs there may not i'll go there see what your people know luck i can trap acer trade her life for my sons thank you bermia i'll tend to your people as a true son of evaluation i need you i will good to see you somewhere safer hi one good to see you again here something to show my appreciation for saving my life this is unnecessary but thank you more of these youtube leaders live i should do something about that you shouldn't be here can it be host father mighty poet chooser of the slain the raven god whom they call oski i know my names friends and they are many but what is yours i am ori son of nori son of gory also son of gauri they have the same name you see a baguette of fimber who was sired by foamer third child of bomber and then there was kubrak voldy corey again ori you said well that's right son of nori something else your pride in your family does you credit i only have them here with you oh no dead a lot of them father he was crushed when a cow wandered off a cliff and landed on him grandma the birds had her face she fell off her pony and ran herself over with her own cart grandpa lost his razors so he tried shipping with his axe instead you can imagine how that went that is quite a streak of misfortune exactly bad luck runs in the family prone to misadventure you might say still i made it down here when the invasion began feasting and idling all day long so maybe my luck has turned at last [Music] looks as though we have a guest of honor come to join us in our final moment of respite taiwan is that the sorry side i see before me i'll piss off with that high and mighty aura you will not dump a noun this is quite a feast for so desperate a time bountiful food bountiful ale bountiful women would you be anywhere else you make a strong argument excuse me you're looking he's out went on an expedition he said you're looking for the plattsmouth he's out he went on an expedition he said oh greeting stranger you've got the look of one who knows how to throw a line i would have thought you had little need of help in this place of plenty it's true the fish came easy from that lake too easy we ate our fill and more and we thought they'd last forever we were wrong bring me fish from outside stranger from the places we dare not go i'll reward you well i have something that may interest you need something more i'll return another time just death may have to carry us into the next realm [Music] dirty [ __ ] [Laughter] surely his beloved daughter's life is worth baldur's freedom the dwarves of the smelting cow maybe they can help me hunt down that princess hmm that stink smells worse than evaldi's forge back in asgard let's see what these storms can tell me about acer please be on your way [Music] you toil as if tomorrow will never come is this the pace acer demands it keeps our pesky rodents off my back keeps me fed well barely at this rate i could eat the troll i imagine the hunger pangs hit quite frequently here may i offer you something to eat it would surely help keep this toiler going i have something that will say to your belly and hopefully rouse your spirits how can i repay such a kindness acer is a common enemy of ours and i'm looking for her common enemy is right if i had it my way i would bash her pretty face into sculpting goo sadly she has not returned for me to try my hand and i do not know where she has gone is there anything you can tell me hmm i get the growing sense you mean to confront her forcefully then do have caution asa can use magma to treat her wounds quite quickly i might add she always has a silky fresh layer on her skin i'll have to remember that if you see asa you will give her my friendly regards won't you can you spare a moment piss off one eye friendly you should not be here i'll only take a moment please go i do not want trouble with the guards they allow me to speak only when reporting to them and them alone [Music] i should disguise myself as a misspell why are you here do not react as i yeah but what that is quite the disguise if loki is giving lessons tell him we could use his expertise i have him locked away in a dungeon cell for roughly the next thousand years then what brings you you have not come to land your hand in the muck i'm looking for asa can you help me then suitor's daughter haven't seen her for some time now she's got her minions keeping a watchful eye on us though what i can say is that wherever she goes she makes it a point to forge large magma pools seen her do it here walks around in there i hear she can even move through them something to look forward to crafty she is if you see any liquid fire pits it may be proof she is nearby i will keep an eye out ah uh [Music] we have the advantage thank you [Applause] we don't want more trouble what are you doing here are you all right move away i need to fix this or i'll lose the whole patch along with my head you and i should talk hi one is that really you what are you doing here i've come looking for sutra's daughter one they call asa here she frequents this place she makes her rounds comes to see that we are working as best we can what is all this work for who knows she brings us the oars we extract the metals they go to sutra for whatever it is he so desires what is she like this acer get on her bad side and she'll bark her threats but so long as you keep on the straight and narrow she is tolerable ensures you are well fed and healed of your wounds sets the bar high for a more spell where might i find her now i do not know but you can try your luck around the kiln asa appears soft of heart for muscle this is very very bad you shouldn't be here leave us alone go my eyes any longer [Music] remain steadfast oh what are you doing getting you out of here now keep quiet quiet my arse is on fire wait you can walk over magma we are in the clear i think put me down are you okay i owe you my life those muscles were prepared to let me bake to death you are no death to me although as it turns out i have need of your help what can i help you with putting a stop to this invasion i am listening i know asa oversees your work i need to find her what do you know of her whereabouts nothing more than which way i saw her leave it was east though interestingly she took a bunch of my people with her diggers she is scouring another site that is helpful farewell and keep safe at last oh relief go east that is where i last saw acer headed it works it works go away please as good as new you have done me a great service i could kiss you i'd prefer you use your lips to tell me where i may find asa asa what business doesn't asir have with a muspell princess i have a quarrel with suture his daughter will help me rectify it and how do you plan on that asa may come off as a young cub but she does have a dark side ass do i can you tell me where to find her or not not exactly the resources we receive come from a milner but i haven't got a clue which our blacksmith dramnik asa took some of his workers with her he may know more but have caution last i heard the guards are making an example out of him some other task has stolen aces attention as of late if she's distracted that will make capturing her awesome uh [Music] ah uh [Music] what is this are you lost that depends i'm looking for someone i was told i might find her here maybe you know her muscle around your age goes by asa father's uh how shall i put this a vain glorious fool who thinks himself a god never heard of her then you will not mind if i stay a while dip my toes in one of these soothing fire baths i have a better idea oh turn around go back from where you came and please do mind your step that is no way to welcome a curious outsider care to put that away why afraid i know how to use it i'm sure you can use it possibly well but then i would have to kill you don't worry you won't yeah these fires there is an easy way out of this now where is the fun let's go uh the same gift [Music] will give her life georgia fire uh [Music] focus oh let's keep the baubles out of it shall we oh no the godly gloating smite me i cannot bear it if i were you i would save the tongue wit for a more appropriate time i saw no such trinket on suture yet he too has a problem with dying so that was you and either what squabble had you trading blows with my father he has taken my son and now i will give your father a taste of what he has wrought move so that i may trade his child for mine you clearly do not know my father your son balder i assume he has something my father needs and if that is so papa would sooner see me dead than given to your demands if you want your son back you will need something far more precious than me to barter with me his own daughter i simply will not do then there's no longer any need for you to draw breath asa we found it we oh found what what have you found uh asa would not want me to say acer is no longer here i am javi of asgard lord of frenzy you are in full control of my temper mural asa believes it may help her gain entry to an ancient vault it is in a cavern that way my son will be his prisoner how does one kill that which cannot be killed if death is not his weakness then i must find something that is should be somewhere in this cavern she believes there's something interesting here it is huh a few of which may allude to peaks or mountains you can you read this to me me uh i i can try elven runes are not something i can decipher with ease you will fail better than i and that will have to do any mention of an ancient bolt a door secret entrance maybe no uh but i can make out this see two great mountains to the north the sun and moon above that's it regrets asia we are simple diggers not experts of things writ long ago not to worry you've been a great help i should search there [Music] what's wrong with you ah this must be the place so the spells were here i can still smell that stench in here now where shall i point this one now we're getting somewhere they have to match one of the doors the sun strange place and reeks of death wonder what secrets i will uncover here whoever was here made it a point to occupy this space secret and whoever did this will see that there is a price to pay the wounds and their chests identical and cauterized i've seen nothing like it it's unnatural [Music] [Music] more elven symbols whatever was in this wall sat undisturbed for many ages until now [Music] only most spells leave ash in footprints like these than the ones drag marks and blood were but only a shed amount where the victim's still alive aces sought to enter this world and unlock its secrets but before she could do so someone beat her to it center of this chamber where it appears that some sort of ritual was prepared the orchestrator came to the ancient elven object built into the wall possibly even used it in the ritual is that what led to the dwarves death the muspels then left taking the object with them but the purpose of this ritual of theirs remains a mystery to me that sigil i think i glimpsed it before an a3 while i searched for balder perhaps we'll find some answers there [Music] what spells they must have [Applause] [Music] [Music] i've seen the situation around here before find it and i may find the culprit amid all this excitement i have had little time to dwell on ragnarok when will the storm break tomorrow or find the future i think the latter more likely i have loki imprisoned for whatever role he has played in baldur's predicament his son tomb is bound by my chains what of sutra but for now he is merely the abductor of my child not the bringer of the twilight still once balder is safe i will return to ascot and raise an army spell he must be conquered without mercy can't need to get on the other side storm growing there all locked there are three inserts uh here oh so thank you [Music] the area soon third key looks as though it may be complete well whoever held the ritual at the bald was once here writings on the ritual they are performed at night there's emphasis on something called a salacar my alvin is rusty vessel of souls i think is this the object from the vault the culprit was deciphering elven runes something about the binding of only the most powerful hookers [Music] the culprits are just for a yelten and a must-spell subject to complete their work or spells killing muscles [Music] so as much secrecy about the culprit's affairs only she and sutra i wear [Music] [Music] the vault is marked here along with a second location another ritual site perhaps your light on your feed a sir following me now you've become quite useful esier my gratitude for opening the vault now tell me what happened there i'm following the stink as it rises as are you care to tell me why that is days ago sin mata ordered my best warriors to the vault without bothering to inform me i've not heard from them since well you're casting your suspicions that the right people whose quarters are these his name is calder an adept in magic or cedar as you as guardians sometimes call it this place is where he practices it whatever he's doing it is not sader at least not as i know it he is using something called a salacar it's part of a deadly ritual and from what this room tells me the debt will continue to pile up wolves i don't know what you're talking about you wouldn't your stepmother the spices then distrust you your father only the latter of those for now but in time thanks to her venomous whispers he may come to hate you as much as she does this is a lie all of it your twisted attempt to pit me against them through the mesh yourself no other truth lies within where are you going after the salah whatever it is your father needs it maybe the only leverage i have to get my son back call the mark the place on the map surrounded by waters just northeast if he's planning another ritual there i may be able to understand what value this seller car holds best not to draw well there may be nearby this roof should give me a clear view oh no out lord calder with your permission we will now return to asa soon i have need for you still asus warriors where do they fit into all this you are one of our captains yes a duty i share with two others here i thought i saw something in you stout resolute step over here seeker and holstein were two of the most revered sons of evild if such prestige is a requirement for these rituals then calder is surely luring that muscle to his death i wonder if there's a way i can observe the ritual up close i need to approach calder without him taking notice perhaps the best ways was deception chosen ones together we will enact suitors will against us not sure i'd buy it but keep your eyes open ah let me kill him made it far come on uh work with me talent hmm what i find in this pursuit so what do you see these fools dead stand in her path several wombs this one put up a fight briefly i suspect so [Music] no other bodies in this war path he was the last to die how hard was he knocked into this rock most likely dead upon impact these are caught up to calder his warriors moved in while he pushed on laser tore through them like a whirlwind the trail of the dead reveals a direction for those two and most importantly the southern cars they are headed west i need to find calder before i ease of those in her bloodlust the salakar is not safe looks like these two brought all the fires of useful time with them and freya wonders why i have always refused to take her on a tour of that scorched dumbbell either calder fought here blood was spilt two sets of footprints one is stretched like someone fled the other closer together uneven and lined with blood they were hobbling perhaps asan calder fought here he gained the advantage foolish girl acer young ranks makes you vulnerable she's hurt but not enough to stop her looks like she followed calder up that hill so foreign i must be careful now no side effects are colder only these curious yeltsin buffoons who stand in my way they should run but they won't limbo for you testing these are similar we used to restrain someone there was a card here and drag marks leading to it the dead stack up for these misspells ragnarok came early asus spear abandoned did calder and his minions finally best her [Music] asa chased calder into this camp leaking her lifeblood blinded by rage and utterly reckless looks to have caused her to she came crashing in smalling whatever halfway stood between her and calder those halfwits fought back in numbers injured and disarmed she was overpowered and restrained calder then head and tossed onto a cart like a sack of turnips looks like they fled up that path what is it calder plans to do with the little princess now that she is his prisoner she only not these tracks lead west i must find calder and the seller car for ball is safe is this about aces or is she still proving too much to handle perhaps baldur would not approve of my methods of the cruelty i must perform on his behalf he and acer they're young pure of heart but lacking in logic one day they will grow up and see life as i see it in the meantime they must rely on me to ensure they live long enough perhaps balder would not approve of my methods of the crawls here must perform on his behalf he and acer i hope i'm not too late they made a turn here toward the river pray line lisa is that you again mad one come to tempt fates i see i do not die this day can you say the same ah yes you've proven once already how you like to strut around unencumbered by fear perhaps the salah did not give you an adequate taste of it enough of this blithering hand over what is now mine or shall i just take it to no fear we must be subjected to it when i am through with you i will take asus willful huger soon after the salakar will be complete then believe me you will know fear and pain just like your son asgardian air [Music] seeing what was under me full and true why is certain collecting hookahs what does he mean to do with the celica tell me why do you aim to finish my work ask yourself how much you care to suffer in these final moments do your worst you are wasting your breath he will not tell you and he won't have to his secrets are known to me now you want them move aside move aside or i will destroy it traitor traitor it is you who are slaughtering your own kind what i do i do for suitor such devotion requires a strong hooger all these moosebull sacrifices you need it only look inward was he right about you wanting to complete the salah sutra will not trade my son for something he cannot use so you will see it through to what end how many lives would you take for baldur i would drain all nine realms even asgard the words of a dreadful king and a selfless father it is the one thing that separates you from my own you wish to reunite with your son i wish to see my father's plans lie in ruin no matter the price can you see both through i can but i will need your help the seller car still requires the hooker of a suitable yotan calte never found one i must get hunting do as you will in the meantime i'll join my stepmother wherever she may be i will try to learn how the salakar fits into my father's plants under the guise of a contrite step daughter of course keep it i will need a way to find you when it is time to confront my father you and this marvel share a bond i set out to use you to my advantage that ends with me in your debts if it were not for you i would have never known what my father was capable of he used our people turned them on each other for his gain i cannot forgive him and to that end i am your ally an asgard an ally is a friend let us not get carried away so will reveal itself i should return to the shelter perhaps the dwarfs there can hate me now that i see there is an asser among us you'll free us from the clutches of that red witch won't you who do you mean she has taken our people please our father you must help us enlist all of us kartif need be please what else can you tell me about this acer only that so long as she is out there we will remain down here help us speak to brahman if he is still able to string a sentence together that drunkard [Music] of our fury she will regret having ever followed her father [Music] well we at least go out with our bellies as full as our spirits what can i do for [Music] something else we'll speak again you're looking for the blacksmith he's out on expedition thank you my pleasure [Music] came to humiliate us some more help me and i'll compose your soccer so exalted it will endure ragnarok itself but first i need a name and a place for what for whom the mightiest yotan in all of spartalfame we know the one right hand of sutenger uh malviga here because of us she is worthwhile gave your son vida quite the beating once didn't she one day veta will make me proud allow me to introduce the ones who killed suit and ghost father i heard something about him trying to out drink a couple of dwarfs and after befuddled tripping and breaking his neck tsutenger wasn't happy held us responsible but luckily we required some me some special need and well tsutenger is partial to a bit of need we bothered it in exchange for our lives except afterwards some thieving [ __ ] waiting slowly loki most likely it's always loki whoever it was suit hunger didn't catch them so he decided to take it out on us instead sent malviga to hunt us down been incognito ever since can't trust this lot not to sell us out still she hasn't found us yet she will alvigus dangerous prey even for you we can help balance the scales our old house north of here sunk in a lake inside upstairs on a table you'll find a cup of great potency cup you know the cup oh yes the club has the power to do wonderful stuff for instance so i bring you the cup and then we show you how to use it against mouthfigure it's a deal no one wants to hear us now well i'm getting tired of her fury she will regret having ever followed her father into swat alpine i know looks like i'll be getting my toes wet [Music] so this wondrous cup of this should be on the table over there nothing perhaps someone has already been here and stolen it assuming there was a cup in the first place leave one of your enemies alive so they can tell of your greatness everyone knows of my greatness perhaps there are one or two who have not yet heard just tell me where mal vigor is what what's in it for me i do not know but i will tell you this the longer you make me wait the worse it will be more bigger is at the dam to the rest and now will you spare me until next we meet there will be no next you can be sure of that foreign we'll find more liquor at the damn west of here she is the worthy foe loki told me we'll find mole vigor at the dam west of here she is a worthy foe loki told me how she and anger brother once came to blows it did not go well for anger bother the salaka reject smell vigor then it has a false tool and zuter pins his hopes on a worthless toy so ah [Music] [Music] [Music] these rocket views that remind me of when i once roved the land with freak the cool knights spent together beneath the stars she enjoyed the solitude as much as i the trouble and danger even what trickery is this there is the dam this tempest is so the traitors have been betrayed they had hoped that by serving you up i would show them mercy clearly a misapprehension yet here i am served up if i were here for you i won i would have brought an army now sutenger will have his vengeance but not here i know why you have come i have a bone to pick with you after what you did to my son neither i must be there put up an honorable fight that is not what i heard do not believe the stories on his return too weak to stand he squirmed like a worm caught in the sun [Laughter] you should have seen me my acolytes had to carry me home on their backs no your boy fought well is that why you spared his life it is but you aren't here to avenge vedar's honor you have come to steal my hookah and i intend to stop you how do you know this you and loki are both mad and hiro kim he's just as bad and thor is so stupid he might as well be mad you spread chaos wherever you go yet you are all known quantities to us not he rarely emerges from muspelheim and when he does he shares little with us thus while here i have sent my spies to learn what he plans beyond wiping out the dwarves like he did the elves of alvain what do you know of his plans i know that he found a powerful elven relic and that his minion calder was tasked with finding the hookers necessary to sustain it that calder is now trapped within said relic and that you would have me join him i must trade the salah for my son you the one who almost killed sutanga for his meat will hand over a legendary relic take your son and leave just like that [Laughter] put your mania aside heavy work with me together we will foil sertra's ambitions i cannot take the risk with each breath balder is a step closer to death i was a parent once but we must look beyond ourselves for the good of all we have spoken long enough or die trying uh nicely done impressive uh [Music] this is uh you are the greater warrior but this is not the right result do what you came here to do get on with it blind one end my misery my body comes to you sent by the same imposter who claimed your own as for my hooger do not weep for me i do not deserve this no you do not i'm all of the cameras right i must find out more about this perhaps hitler kin i've seen nothing of her since my arrival in swattlefield that leaves even where was it the old workshop ruins yes that is the place [Music] ah [Music] this is the old workshop found anything worthy of your talents this will have to do soon you can put them to good use i never knew they actually existed i know all the circus of your people yet i've never heard i never said my people you mean the light elves there aren't many who remember the children of light or their stories i do when sutra invaded their lands they begged me for eight the war with the vani had only just ended and i was very long after i learned how sutra devoured the elves in mortal light by hugo maybe it's the same light that now allows him to renew himself after death during the conquest he must have uncovered knowledge of the salakars but to what end what cougars does it hold those of two warlords one who spell the other a yoton nothing more nothing more at least not of value he speaks the truth you deal with a fire nymph a fire nymph i am the finest fire nymph in all of spartalheim allow me to introduce acer treasonous daughter of sutra and my friend you grow dewy eyed in your dotage what have you unearthed only rumors my father is rebuilding something large and powerful though its exact nature i cannot fathom and the salah is intended to be part of this there's something most likely either way its value to my father is so great he may indeed trade your son for its return return to your stepmother arrange a trade and one more thing i would feel better knowing you're protected sin mara travels far and wide but i will rejoin her as you wish whatever the salakar is i must steal it back once baldur is safe why ragnarok comes i've made plans but they are not ideal perhaps the salakar offers another way one that will allow me to truly save those i care about even you hmm to unlock its secrets i will need help there are rumors of a shelter nearby its dwellers may be able to assist me try looking near the largest cars south of here tell them i sent you no dwarf would give up the chance to work with ivaldi mangrin was once home to your rivals cindy and broker your name may not carry much weight here don't make me laugh no one cares about those two i'll follow you once i've finished taking what i need this is the old workshop that evil he spoke of i should check if he's already here perhaps i should take another peek at the salah ah damn it better not i will need help if i am to study the salah oh brought me gems have you here more gemstones for your collection see how can there be an invasion with so many gems lying around i'll see what i can find for you was still alive we wouldn't be stuck down here wow the shelter must be nearby markings if i follow them so this is where they are this must be the shelter even they spoke of i should head inside be gone from here [Music] uh please there i want to obtain some of my uh attractive uh where's everything is half the price of yesterday half the price that seems generous well i doubled the prices yesterday to make a profit but nobody bought anything so half the price today you haven't been doing this very long have you it's my second day isn't there someone more experienced to show you the ropes nope i saw a gap in the market and i went for it why aren't they doing a good job no no it's it's not that you think i'm awful you do don't you [Music] is this a ploy to persuade me to buy something is it working go on goodbye for now i do not take kindly to being interrupted charming no we are their dearest allies they [Music] greetings dwarf i am harvey of the asia do not want to waste words friend i wish there were more like you that's killing me the toil never ends did anyone follow you what do you want [Music] you are always welcome how can so many starving dwarves produce so much [ __ ] what do i care go talk to the ganker gengar yeah the chief name's oakland just spoke to that fellow you know how it works fix a problem get a reward if only everyone was as motivated as you i just spoke to that fellow look around you all the treasure a heart could want but on a scrap of food for the belly what good is a thing if it makes no one happy all that counts are people in the end huh you've recruited another soldier what was this place before it became your sanctuary a treasury when the invasion began they sent warriors to guard it our leaders would rather protect their wealth than our lives and we followed seeking protection and so we are here all the wealth we could wish for yet hungry and miserable still i would like to reorganize the crew keep well strange a word my friend evil d requests your aid ain't my concern go talk to ogler he's the master of this workshop master now a boy's chief when the masters aren't here [Music] what do you want evil descends me he requires the help of a skilled artisan a meeting of mines well it ain't up to me you'd best talk to brockgirl cindy they still breathe where are they no idea cindy went off adventuring he does that mind you it's been a while since he left how much of a while couple of weeks and his absence doesn't worry you not my business where he goes and brooke went to look for cindy bit of a worry guts that one ever since he mucked up the forging of mjolnir anyway look leave your name and i'll pass it to brocker when he shows up tell him harvey of asgard was here harvey of by emir really it is you i'll return tonight in the meantime fetch evilly he's at the old workshop ruins the high one will save us from the giants but who will save us from the highway how can so many starving dwarves produce so oh [ __ ] [Music] who you followed [Music] why are you here [Music] three times it stung me three on the hand then the neck oh lit on the eyeball a true master would ignore such trifles tribals that gadfly was the size of a squirrel a big one an ogre could hear me limb from limb and still my severed hands would finish the job that is focus that is passion that is horseshit master broker i'm glad you have made it home and your brother did you find him yeah you never did say where he was i believe cinderelly went adventuring adventuring no no that's not it he went to find the special meme i had a hankering you said special meat yeah the special me so tunga's special meat what's that frosty ass gotta do with it we ain't in yachting home in case you hadn't noticed well there's this mead they made down at the brewery so sweet it can [Music] well it's bloody sweet all right anyway century had an itch for him just a haul or two he said so off he goes that was half a moon ago i told him not to do it too many giants out there but he wouldn't listen uh him and his cravings where can i find this brewery ale thought southeast of here other side of the marsh can't miss it you're going to rescue him i will find him yes and afterwards you and he will repay me by helping evil deal with the job and he'd done now hold on we didn't uh good good we have a deal that gadfly it was loki thor himself could not have withstood this thing remind me and in all that time consider what i have learned and what you haven't saved [Music] lose something ugh uh go [Music] god uh [Music] uh [Music] this place is heavily guarded [Music] the smell of meat grows strong this must be where everything is stored guided him here guide me i don't believe in locked doors [Music] what feed ah [Music] have a look soon where are they holding him i wonder i'm out of me bring me another barrel thank you much obliged [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh chain was placed here from the scarring something heavy was suspended from it i've carried enough dwarves recently to know they are not as light as they look is this cindy's special need given the puddles on the floor he must have taken a bath in it this hammer grass the mark of century and here a bag of roasted acorns [Music] this guy is many days old untruly send the other out do we have here the moose spells have a prison not far from here yarn they call it some days ago syndry was captured while sneaking outside he was dragged in here for interrogation his belongings were ceased even his roasted acorns one of the many dwarven delicacies i will never fathom he tried to loosen his tongue using the same sweet mead he himself sawed almost drowned him in it but the shelter has not been raided so cinderelly must have remained strong and refused to give them its location instead he was dragged away bloodied drunk as a fish but alive most likely to face further tortures at a makeshift prison named yarns whose that is where i should go next ugh hmm [Applause] so this place reeks of misery more than i would even wish upon loki no matter his crimes it's likely century was brought here many days ago i'm not too late yes [Music] give up speeding foreign foreign the giants have no mercy when i face them i know this mark whoever he was he had his hoover cruelly stolen i oh well it's done i must return the body to broken [Music] [Music] be on your way please still it can't be coincidence that calder stated the salah car with the hookers of so many races who knows what else hail to you friend if it's bird or beast you seek you come to the right place everything you see is for sale except for nara of course and who is nara your prize steed that knackered old nag she's nobody's prize but i owe her and that's why she'll always hold a place in my heart you're in debt to a horse i am but she saved my life the addled old thing broke out of a pen and wandered far from the village and i set out to find her took me a day and a night to bring her home when i did i found my village in flame and ruin no one got out alive none but you i and i have nara to thank for that together we made for the nearest shelter and well here we are please let this not be our missing master who is this you bring no it can't be master broker i share in your grief truly i do your brother was the worthiest of dwarves more so than you will ever know oh simply no no my dear century the funeral arrangements are being made outside i must use this chance to bend broker to my will i must the wolves have come up with to my wishes you lied to me you said you would save him i said i would find him that ain't my brother not anymore what happened tell me everything as i neared the village i i heard a great roar like that of a wounded bear soon after i witnessed the final act of a mighty battle cindy beset by giants on all sides it was he who made the godlike roars he he always did have a deep voice he wielded his hammer and chiseled with uncommon skill yes yes i've seen him do it many times in the workshop giants lay strewn about slain by cinder's hand but then one of cowardly aspects struck your brother treacherously in the back yet even a simply succumbed to the blow he locked his chisel and struck the coward dead right between the eyes central dead old hand so it will be written i'll cut down that oak tree now cinder is gone can't stand the sight of it without him here last time i saw the master he was sitting under his oak tree roasting his acorns oiling his favorite how can i tell blocker we're missing the tools where could they be there's something wrong basil everything is wrong we're burying the greatest smith who ever lived and we don't have his tools to put with him i came across some of dalethorpe if you want i confess those are just the spares he never took his best ones from the shelter i see how is it that such valuable instruments have been misplaced misplaced don't be duffed hidden more like by cindery to make sure no one else ever touched them particularly brooker except now we can't find them you have no idea where they might be well they're inside the shelter i can tell you that well they can't be too far i'd be surprised if they're somewhere up high i thought dwarves were afraid of heights not our cindy he was quite the climber now me well i prefer to keep my feet on the ground right where they should be not now i need time to grieve i'm very fond of the dwarves it's exhausting oh loki friend betrayer what i'd give for a moment of your guilty conversation even the lies [Music] if i was my beloved tools somewhere higher somewhere high up perhaps [Music] [Music] hmm if i had wings i could reach decently enough finally the tools of cindy's trade i must reunite these tools with cinderelly's remains before the ceremony begins i hear vessel can't find the master's tools it's too horrible to even think about the disaster has been averted now i see why some call you god you're making me blush still i have my moments heroes die but not their legacy such was cindy's courage but tonight he feasts in valhalla the first of his kind to ever do so [Music] perhaps he can be of use i'm here for the mead not the company you dwarves and your love of meat it's cost me enough trouble already it wasn't a dwarf who ransacked half of jottenheim in search of some mysterious mid i wouldn't know anything about that you know old friend now would be a good time for some grand gesture like what a respectful speech from you cindery's greatest rival would surely ah [ __ ] off we must all make compromises i can even give you the honeyed words time soothes the well of suffering brings hope that sees beyond chill death we cast the whirlpool of sorrow into the placid waters of the philosophic mind are those words for cindy or balder balder lives why would he need such words of course of course i didn't mean to well you know fine i'll do the speech but it will be one of my making not yours we dwarfs don't care much for poetry still we can't set about making speeches until the torches are all lit up who knows how long it will take before the dwarves get around to lighting the torches we'll be faster if i do it the dwarves have saved the place for me this is [Music] my brother a true master he was i did not like sindri and he did not like me still he was good with the hammer and the chisel and the sword and he knew how to work the bellows some said better than anyone even me [Music] broker your brother was a very fine smithy i i admired him greatly master broker we've given cindery an excellent send off it's the least he deserves but is it really true he feasts in valhalla it is i saw it in a vision come let's take a stroll now tell me are you prepared to continue cindy's good work helping evaldi was not my brother's work but the fine sutra was it's what got him killed greed for me is what got him killed it took courage to go after that meat a direct challenge to sutures authority this is crooked thinking seems straight enough to me you know i don't reckon i owe you a bloody thing i risked my life to retrieve your brother's body now i'll prepare to risk it again for you and all of swat self him bollocks you ain't doing anything out of the goodness of your art i know what you're after i know all about your lad boulder i have ears you know even in my grief so don't pretend you're here for us because i know you have me abandon my own son and strive only for your salvation okay when you say it like that i i need time i'm still grieving you know let me think on it all right a little old think [Music] if he hasn't i must encourage him further how can so many starving dwarves produce so much [ __ ] you're back yes goodbye for now these are the finest tools you'll ever lie eyes on the finest i've forged better in my sleep yeah is that why you were snooping about in the ruins of the old workshop only because the most spells stole everything i had teamwit good to see you getting along so broker do you accept your duty don't have much choice do i last thing i need is a godly smiting up me ass let this be the start of a beautiful new friendship to study the salah card i'll need the very best of tools too bad this workshop is lacking bagger off i got more stuff here than you can wag a finger at if you find something you don't know how to use just ask i'll be giving you lessons on how to use your occurring dwarves how unusual acer you return what you deal with a fire nymph not this again what news do you bring my stepmother is stubborn i cannot push too hard or she will grow suspicious she has no interest in a trait interest yes but not yet the will i don't understand the salah is all but indestructible you on the other hand are not she assumes she'll catch me kill me and retrieve the salah time is on her side then i must strip her off this illusion if i were to make a nuisance of myself one that cannot be ignored sin mata prepares to lead my father's next major invasion but if i were to disrupt her plans it may force her to the bargaining table sounds risky to me i once plotted and carried out the murder of emir himself what do i care of risk well since you put it like that where must i strike at all my stepmother develops a strange army at your first meda she breeds beasts of war and finally there's threethorpe her supplies hub i'll deal with all three in the meantime i shall return to etri i will send word once my stepmother has become more amenable i'll return when i'm done and i will expect answers regarding the seller car let's get on with it then yes you just follow my lead who put you in charge you were once your brother's apprentice now you are mine apprentice are you having a laugh this is my shelter and my rules [Music] never ends he worried when his sons turned against him dwarfs believe it to be cursed i don't think they'll mind if i believe them of this male addiction [Music] um so [Applause] we read so this is you're mine [Music] split your skull oh oh this is help you out here oh keep your card up hey come here a moment [Music] um twisted operations uh wow ah give me a hand over here [Music] over here come help me with this time you died uh [Music] this is just a small vengeance for what you did to freak [Music] uh [Music] right [Applause] oh oh i have to repair that meteor sometimes warriors will have grumbling bellies and only sticks with a [ __ ] to fight ah hey uh back to the ship um [ __ ] [ __ ] i wait [ __ ] gods here are vigilant unleash the beasts [Music] reverse uh come on she ah ugh i must release them too right [Music] the pigs run wild have a look soon uh without these plans no further beasts can be bred no more piggies for you do not draw their eyes once bothers free he and i shall feast on the roasted flesh of these mighty pigs now sin mara will negotiate baldur for the salah car and then together he and i will steal it back hopefully the dwarves have gained an understanding of the salikar's true use my future may depend on it it's inevitable to avoid it impossible but if there's one thing i know impossible is impossible why are you here you'll oh you're back cinemas plans lion ruins i just hope you know what you're doing surely i should be asking that of you now tell me what does it do i got a clue these light elves and their sneaky you've learned nothing whatever its use the power it contains it holds more than what you said such as well for a start there's a bloody dwarf in there anyone we know no and it's not important dwarf hoogers don't carry much weight not even mine so what does it contain all i know is that it's more than malviger calder and some dwarf that one cares about fine in the stories what was the actual point of the salah cars cougars were what vitalized them but it was the magic that gave them their purpose and that magic was different to each one magic you mean seda nah some elf [ __ ] no one knows anymore except sutra that fire nymph she sent word and your plan worked shin maori's ready to barter if it means getting you out of the way where at the bridge leading to fagada light the beacon and she'll come out with your lad the power that the salah holds it must not fall into certain grasp i'll reclaim it once boulder is safe oh my goodness who would have guessed those golden threads can it be the golden hair of sif wife of thor why loki cut it off only loki knows what thong was less than pleased loki wisely chose to make amends a new head of hair for sif finer than the last and so he set off for swat tel theme at loki's request evil these sons made for him dresses of the purest gold which would fix the sith's scalp and grow his real hair would loki had what he needed but now that he'd seen what the master smiths of spartafame could do he wanted more oh uh down to me uh [Music] i don't care what anyone said is everything all right i wish i knew highway you recognize me of course but i have no quarrel with you even if i did i have more pressing matters i i must get into the dwarf shelter you have a death wish no but if that's what it takes to be reunited with my love it is a risk i must bear they hold a yoton captain no the one i love is a dwarf and as strange as it might sound i think he loves me with everything happening in this crazed world i know how important it is to hold on to things that are precious do you think you could help me all i want is to speak to him to know i'm not alone in feeling what i feel very well but i cannot take you inside looking like this can you shape-shift how's this had to be a wolf didn't it come again just stay by my side and don't eat anybody i'm not an animal you know so what's your plan i don't know and stop talking or you'll give us

illusion to have worked aid me be my eyes uh let's uh others behind one of these doors locked cells i must find the proper keys hang on not getting away from me [Music] [Music] one of the many prison of keys i think there's something hidden in the back personas weren't just lying around oh so a hidden room behind this wall seems nothing can contain these tricky inventors i guess i shouldn't piece of paper i find lying around so much this blood trail whoever was tracked here was badly wounded yet he was strong it took at least four jailers to hold him the high one brought low mistletoe symbol of hope renewal but not for boulder we forced so many drafts down his gullet his torment was quite beautiful blind fool you never saw what was in front of you here is your child his light gone before you even set foot here when the rest of him it now skulks in helheim [Music] allow me to reunite you with your boy no you were never worth my effort i've seen dwarves with better stature take care of it like oh uh finally the hero of asgard but you are an imposter monstrous you've locked that truth away built a code to act as its jailer but the darkness cannot be kept hidden it oozes out like pus from a wound poisoning everything it touches that is what it means to be odin the deceiver come to the flame you [ __ ] and scratch like an old hen by my command ah if you're going to fight fight [Music] [Music] here comes the place that's right you never failed [Music] uh [Applause] come on scratch like an old head [Music] uh [Music] um [Music] uh ugh [Music] [Music] ah [Music] ah that ugh ah

fate as was foretold ever you have sought to elude the looms of the nornes but we are all caught in their weave no i will not believe it there's more to see yet why was i thrown for my dream perhaps it was not the vision that rejected you but you who rejected the vision perhaps you are afraid of it i fear nothing i think you do and until you recognize that fear give into it embrace it the vision will not return some walls cannot be overcome by potions alone tell me what i must do this soccer does not end here it cannot meet me in the forest when darkness lays upon the land there we shall see how fearless you truly are these new visions of vote in trouble me am i alone in seeing them what would the tales of svatel fame hold some other meaning perhaps i should warm my bones by the fire gather my thoughts for a moment huh uh avor whatever is the matter have you been spending too much time drinking vulgar special sauces again i'm troubled by visions of odin and of smart sulphame they plot my mind without warning without invitation aha which is how thor flooded spartafain thor fast to act but not so fast to think would stomp and thump and fight and bump everywhere he and mjolnir should go one day he fought a giant in jotunheim with such ferocity that thor's killing blow was felt through all nine realms the ground shook mountains rose up hills tore apart creating canyons and north of smalladal the massive lake that housed the springs of incredibles split open flooding all of smart fame the dwarf king craze acted swiftly he built three mighty dams preventing further damage to his realm working alongside his beloved subjects so surprised was one builder to see the great king working as an equal that he slept tumbling into the raging waters below without hesitation once from his horse and again from the center of the damn's lip diving into the frightful torrent before the builder could even cry for help rademar was pulling him onto dry land and so two giant statues were built to honor the king one for each leap of unthinking bravery and stood until the end of days until ragnarok aye so you see actions ripple outwards like a stone falling into a lake or like thor crushing a yoton skull with mjolnir affecting everything neither foretold or unknown i fear my tale has only worsened your concerns no a good story is a lock that feeds a mind's flame thank you friend it's over how have you been the fire made me think of the myths and legends slender would you indulge me with the tail i would be glad to hear svatself i would not tell it half as well but his favorite was a fable to remind us to find meaning in our deeds and not in how others think of us smartphone was not short of letting dairy dwarven blacksmiths everyone has heard of evil deal but this tale is of a stonemason he lived as far south as he could where gunamar meets van gaal his workshop sat upon the shoreline obsessed with glory his love of masonry had all but died he scoured the shore seeking precious stones washed up from other arms then he saw it something beautiful glittering shimmering across the water upon an island he had never dared to travel to he hastily built the boat working long into the night he set sail and found many rocks that sparkled and dazzled upon the island he cried out in joy to craft anything from such stones he would be remembered for all time then he felt a sudden sting on his foot then another and another his eyes adjusted to the dark so consumed was he by his desire for renown he failed to realize he had walked into a nest of snakes until it was already too late and so clutching the stone that sealed his feet there he died remembered yes but only for his folly a fine tail toby and well told this man would be proud [Music] in every great story there's truth to be found i wonder what could be found in smart television the place they spoke of go oh this is the spot now i need only wait for volker to arrive i will tie your hands now what purpose will that serve you are too much the warrior ever you will not recognize your fear until you are helpless before it drink and you say this will bring the vision back is that all you mean to leave me here bunker this is why must not be tired okay [Applause] huh [Music] untie me the wolf is coming and i i cannot reach my weapons [Applause] so many where did they come from i have to break these bones [Music] the more i struggle the tighter the bones become there must be a trick to this what did funko say give into it be still [Music] it's working the barns are loosening [Music] illusion is this accursed phantoms come then you will not let me laughing um but i am not a child anymore curse you no more will you stalk me the wolf is gone for now i'm ready valka it is time three even after all these eternities away i still hate the place yet it offers me the hope of revenge sweetest of morsels the realm is changed but this is not sutras doing is something more i must find broker and evaldi they'd better still have my salaco nice and safe what has the shelter fallen these moose spells are a plague [Music] oh yes [Music] yes oh uh over have you lost it broker left the shelter yesterday before the raid even happened took the salah car with him where has he taken it since you went away he has become erratic the it's all that matters to him now you should learn from his example now where is he where the other night he spoke of exploring the creator of hatred to seek out more answers he takes the salaka to sutra's front door wait where have you been these past few days days no matter it is where i go that matters and where is that atri wherever i can find vengeance calm yourself javi collect your wits an eye for an eye will leave us all blind what do i care about so many dead my friends my brothers all gone it was so sudden we had no time to defend ourselves ah [Music] let's we must find broker matrices crater the brave fool means well but risks cheating me of my vengeance what is it with these two brothers who died sneaking after me the other now risks death by taking his jump to form ah um i see you dwarf broken where is my salad car take it easy it's right here nice and safe i wanted to investigate something but then i tripped and can you walk no oh then i shall carry you oh gentle i hate to bleed sack of spuds you know what have you learned off the salad car my just know how to use it of course you're going after you'll most likely end up feasting in valhalla valhalla is for the feeble and the blundering no i shall not die worlds may end but i harvey shall abide what about shindri you calling him fable what would he be doing in ah yes yes he is there in valhalla of course for one such as he is a great honor now then this looks like a good place to put you down so tell me the solocar's purpose a clue can it kill sutra well that ain't its purpose but yeah i think it can how it harnesses the light a lot of light that was baldur's gift to turn day to night and back is that why certainly stole his hooker yeah the others they're just for balance but see there is one more in there like boulders incomplete who's this this hooga an itsy bitsy snippet mind you i don't understand i think i think if the salah card touches surtur the two will come together the salad car is already complete nothing gets in or out our torn hooga will always try to reunite itself his might just be strong enough to do it if that happens he will become the salah then nothing can stop him only if he can control all that light but i don't think he can his old carcass ain't made for it it'll be like trying to hold the ocean in a single hogs bladder this thinking how can i be sure you're right you ain't heard all me workings out do you truly believe that coming together will be too much for sutra try it when he's weak ideally dead well not dead dead of course just normal dead before he wakes up all over again you've done well now give me the salah car and leave this place it is too dangerous i ain't leaving i've come this far do as you're told friend i wonder this broker sent me to my death no my destiny is to lack the rook far in the future that's what i should not be seen in this area be turn them into savage victory here fool your twilight comes still drawing breath i have a cure for that oh hmm blustery on youtube feel great i will be master of all nine realms [Music] you look cool destroyer died hey give us a hand this is no place for dwarves i've heard my right to see this through hey i told you it would work and there

claim it i don't run from the fire i am the fire uh come here sir right hmm oh [Music] uh uh you feel stronger already ah [Music] so much for your grand plan you fool you sought to harness the power of the light the power of my son it would have turned you into the wrecker of worlds but in this feeble state this light will devour you oh i must return to the shelter and share the news of my triumph smell that the breath of liberty my gift to you why are the sour faces would you rather remain fugitives hurricane so the whispers were true you were here in svatel fame all alone you have been busy high one your vengeance floods the entire land like a raging river that has burst its banks why are you here i too bring a gift dread rumors from asgard rumors you would have heard had you not been so preoccupied what has loki done now escaped the cell in which you left him to rot unbound fenrir awoken yormangander rallied hell now raising an army like no other clearly he has been busy

you really think he will miss this chance to settle old scores your vengeance comes at a price high one and you and everything you hold dear are it so there is to be a fight i haven't lost one yet you have heard of the twilight sword shooter's blade destined to cut the sky and signal ragnarok i stuffed it down his gullet as i came here a great beam of light rose from that lone tower tore the sky

amid the ashes take it why it offers a way to deliver the one you have lost yet but first it must be emptied of those lost souls within i already have a plan to rescue my love there's always a better one now [Music] what is this trick you don't care about her lost love i care about balder if she can free him even unintentionally he may yet make it to the other side of ragnarok ragnarok comes yet

their dearest allies they won't let us down hi it's cara isn't it so you do remember why wouldn't i remember my own valkyries it has been many ages since odin son of boer father of thor took his duties seriously instead he frets about the future tries to wriggle free of fate that's what i hear mind your words squirrel whatever you say my lord and master now let's discuss your duties this field of battle does it bear fruit the harvest proves underwhelming many have died but without valour unlike real heroes they flaunt their wounds on their backsides not their chests what use will they
