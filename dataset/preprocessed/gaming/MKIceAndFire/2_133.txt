they nail your ass on your way out slam the lever and gravity will do the rest the doors will drop on either side trapping the buggers inside sounds dangerous why am i doing this if you set up the traps cause we got bigger fish to fry and the bobby here says you're more than capable don't worry we'll be doing our part if you did your part right you'll see some gas coming out the top of the trap that's released when the door shut sending our little babies into dreamland if they dream anymore how am i supposed to harvest samples if they're trapped inside that's where we come in once the critters are trapped your job's over we'll come in later harvest what's needed and deliver it to the baba ourselves all right i can work with that great this much medicine is gonna save a lot of lives

new skirt but you're not sure tell me what you need okay but this is just between you and me can't let dad find out oh so it's his money you plan on spending nonsense i'm trying to stop dad's girlfriend from spending his money elena she's got him wrapped around her finger they've only been together a month and she's gone through his savings already he's even mortgaged the shop she has to be stopped or we'll have nothing left take this it's all i have if this goes any further she'll kill him wait what kill him like she did several so-called boyfriends before him all fallen dead shortly after falling for her you have proof how about four bodies all her exes except the last one his name is josh managed to escape her clutches alive he can tell you all about her i bet find josh ask him it may be the only way to save my father from his own stupidity where can i find josh spends a lot of time at frank's half in the bag usually after sunset but i bet he can prove elena is a killer [Music] nothing like it swell for a second he was flying oh come on man all the weird [ __ ] that's out there suiciders goons hell night runners who says a man can't fly for a tick and no way jack and joe can stand up to that i heard he was a pilgrim they is nuts payton aaron something whatevs the water's back don't care and why do you think the power's on who did that sophie duh certainly wasn't no carl no man it's this dude ah because we don't know if there's anywhere else to go they harm me you know and whose legs i watch get torn off by a volleyball edgar all of them but the real past is stupid kid let's talk about something else you know frank lay off the bottle you reek don't like to stink then leave gillian i can't watch you do this anymore [Music] then we'd all be dead oh shut up by doing this we agreed to die there are more important things not everyone would understand it they don't have to we face death solemnly this is the way from darkness to light not everyone will understand it they don't have to we face dead solemnly this is the way from darkness to light load of [ __ ] garbage frank get over yourself what's done is done out of my [ __ ] face killian something something don't remember [Music] aidan we're about to meet up in the canteen join us roger used to live above the antique show i'm looking for josh ah think of your teeth he's not here thank god [Music] you know what josh i'm looking for him buy me a shot maybe i'll remember something first info another shot and you'll be completely worthless josh you gotta be swimming in booth somewhere around here either that or this thief in someone's face just cause you've got holes in your shoes [Music] is my guardian angel guardian angel if you hadn't helped with the renegades i'd be out of work right now or worse that's more maths doing hey don't be modest on the house i'm nicholas tell me about lawrence frank says women like her were given call signs based on cocktails bloody mary margarita rocks lawn is hot [ __ ] with a hot temper you do not want to get on her bad side cross her once and that's it game over so you know frank well not all military buds well but well enough to know back then he was a big shot a special forces commando a night runner quite the high ranking monkey muck until one mission he led people into the television tower ended in a massacre after that he ditched the uniform and started the fisheye took out a new lease on life but he became a haunted man frank relives that tower mission start to bloody finish every day the booze helps him get through it all i've seen him on a bender drinking like that isn't helping him get through anything then imagine what he's like when he's not drinking so how do things work in this place the fisheye they work better than anyone predicted when frank set up shop two days and the peacekeepers would take it over while the renegades will blow it up and nobody blew anything up it's the safest place around by far neutral turf even bad has come here just to hash out deals over booze anyone can relax without the threat of violence rivalries are checked at the door that's a good place to have i gotta go wait you interested in making a bit of money then how would i do that it's a simple job there's a metro station under the fisheye used to be uv lamps in the metro that kept the infected at bay but they stopped working because every tunnel and station is infested what happened might be the lamps but i doubted we've replaced them recently maybe something cut the cables but what it's not like the infected bit through them they take a lot of biters to accomplish that on the other hand heard a couple stories like that about infected who work together somehow coordinated as if they're smarter than we think once this guy at the bar told me he fell into a trap he claimed a group of biters herded him into a dead end in a dark zone intentionally they didn't act like a typical mindless swarm said he only managed to survive by climbing onto a trash bin to reach a fire escape above the pack but no i wouldn't put much faith in that if that were possible i think we'd see it more often could be a blown fuse best bet would be to start at the electrical room so you want me to turn on the lamps yeah get to the electrical room for all we know could just be a blown fuse if so you could just reset the main power supply from there before you go got a little something that'll help you out a health specialty guaranteed to warn those biters bellies just a bit of house hooch a bottle and an old rag but powerful stuff or you can always just sneak in past the biters if you don't want to make a ruckus once you turn on the uvs they'll fry anyway and you won't end up wasting good hooch all right i'll take care of it great during the day it's filled with nasties yeah thanks good luck you're aiden they're waiting for you come on the meeting's in the vip room the mood's friendly like [ __ ] christmas at my family home who do you think you are a [ __ ] liar calm down jack before you pop a vessel this planet's total [ __ ] do better how about this do nothing it's definitely man there isn't a high time we put this [ __ ] before a firing squad wow the dog started barking i guess i better behave all right whoa fellas you brought me here to play in something right aidan these are the vnc tower plans once we get the power back on we can reestablish communication people throughout the city will learn about our mission they'll be able to join in and help us so you plan on broadcasting propaganda whatever it takes to defend against the renegades when the butcher sees how strong we are he'll retreat we'll prevent war however there are a few matters we need to take care of first the whole district is powered by an electrical substation i was going to send a squad to turn it on but i heard you already did that good job kid too bad you handed it over to the civilians we could have used it doesn't matter now row at least we don't have to worry about electricity anymore step one is securing the perimeter around the tv station my metal do that i'll head out sir of course rogue good luck we won't disappoint you sir yes we'll do our best sir who asked you where's bowsky now move your ass to great house the next time you speak to me like that in front of my soldiers i'll take my knife and cut your [ __ ] [ __ ] off oh imagine all the grieving times can we just get back to the plan thank you after jack's puppies secure the entrance my men will bring the lamps and set up an outpost and then if everything goes smoothly which it definitely will since the plan's author is the commander-in-chief himself you'll turn on the elevators and ride it to the top and when you get to the roof you attach the transmitter to the antenna got it a lot of people say this place is dangerous oh you don't say dangerous what place isn't dangerous in this town our best people are on this mission you'll be working with roe he can be a real pain in the ass but him you can rely up and you can always get in touch with me the entire building is powered by the electrical substation rose men will secure the perimeter with lamps got it you see juan that's how you obey orders or get yourself killed but my neck's not on the line here see you at the tv station it's a great day we've all been waiting for yes a great day to die [ __ ] meet me outside the canteen [Music] if elena ever hits on you be careful oh took a break from assassinations to come see me i'm just trying to keep you out of trouble what are those war mongers want ask me to climb to the top of the vnc tower what sons of [ __ ] you know what that place is the tallest building in the whole damn city but i can do it i hate those [ __ ] roe meier they're solid but jack and juan they're destined to stab you in the back what's the problem oh nothing except that's where frank lost all the night runners and his leg jack and juan are throwing you to the infected wolves to further their own goals you're just a tool to them [ __ ] lunatics that's all right the pks will be with me jack said did jack maybe mention the creatures that live there i know it's dangerous luan i have to do this i've heard there are things there things no one has seen or actually seen and lived to tell you sound scared of course i'm scared aiden oh i didn't know you cared [ __ ] you look a few years ago frank tried to do what jack is planning and it was a tragedy don't believe me ask him yourself aidan the entrance to the tv station is secured we're just waiting for your lazy ass you're there talk to frank aiden please don't do this aidan answer okay i'll talk to frank thanks aiden you're doing the right thing ro i'll be there as soon as i can something came up hurry aidan we're all waiting for you alamed all over again hey um what's all this about we are rehearsing a play my dear boy a comedy to be precise an art form that has nearly vanished in these dark times ah i see so did you write this play i wish i did but no it's the merchant of venice by william shakespeare a classic of theater classic how old is it almost half a millennium that is why we must not forget it it's a crucial part of our cultural history but you care to join our little theater group join no no i was just curious i love it when you juggins get curious listen if you want to know more go find albert he's on a mission to collect all the works of classical literature his endeavors would surely satiate your curiosity and then some sounds interesting where can i find him he set up a modest library in the peacekeepers ship has stockpiled lots of books so far and he's on a constant search for more so even if books themselves don't capture your imagination you can still make a pretty penny there may series protect our crops from the winter cold frank are you alive man ravic i told you to [ __ ] leave me alone now it's me ayden who uh it's you what do you want tell me about the vnc tower we were so close back then eden so close despite what the others said i really did have a good plan a solid plan but it was a bloodbath

place on the ship okay i'll take a look [Music] so um uh nicholas i'm in the control room nice nicholas switch didn't work damn it there's another way i'll forgive you to try let's finish this with military generators further below look for an elevator maybe go down the shaft [Music] what are military generators doing in the metro it seems the tunnels work great for moving troops around the city only first they had to clean the infected air and to do that they needed a lot of light that called for a lot of power [Music] uh uh oh [Music] so uh [Music] inhibitor container detected [Music] nicholas it worked generators are up and running so the intel wasn't some booze induced fantasy now get back up here i got some beers on ice with your name on them [Music] i'm impressed honestly i

i'm a bartender i'd get gre guys in here incognito of course military brass trying to lie low even big shot ministers of whatever after a few generously poured shots they all had stories to tell i learned about the metro generators from the skittish guy in glasses the retired history teacher type all buttoned down needed to spill his guts to someone later they hanged him for war crimes where's that chemical gunk i ran into come from it was created to fast forward the infection to the terminal stage basically kill the infected with a form of premature aging it wasn't supposed to have any effect on the healthy or recently bitten like you and me but it didn't work out that way so that's why my biomarker goes crazy when i get near it yep but that's not the worst of it some say the military knew how lethal the stuff really was suited them to finish off every last one of us why only the colonel knows but the old bastard never leaves his fortress but if you really want to know the truth about the gre just check out their laps they're scattered all over town lord the [ __ ] that must have gone down i there go thanks aiden with skills like that you'll find plenty to do around

anything else about rome when he and matt had a major falling out yeah it was hell squad 101 had orders to take over the old city warehouse thought it was empty until they went inside they turned on their flashlights and looked up ceiling was weird covered with clumps of rags and then the rags jumped down they were a [ __ ] scary breed of infected clinging to the roofs and walls hundreds of them god you could hear the boys screams for miles [ __ ] imagine that they radioed command but the orders were to hold position they didn't they ran away at least those who could afterwards jack ordered their executions they were deserters but roe defied jack said that sending them there was a mistake in the first place we thought jack would have roshan for insubordination sure did [Music] okay time

strategic place and no renegades at all ah it's not like anything else they're doing makes sense good point first someone turned on the electricity no idea why and then when i questioned the renegade officer he babbled something about gre facilities they're trying to locate didn't make much sense if you ask me x-13 or something like that but i'm worried what they're planning x-13 i've heard about that place before oh yeah what did you hear i know that waltz is hunting for it as well any idea where it could be well if it's real it could be a gre complex top secret well hidden but once we're
