[Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] so this place looks like a real monster magnet [Music] the story will go on as long as there is someone there to listen let's see says it's time to set the outpost free inflict as little damage as possible as you make your way through to the rival captain freedom is not worth having in a world that's doomed here's the first line of defense [Applause] oh two times that's a bomb lover wrecked it a barrel shoot smack it to get a barrel out of it then hit it toward the gate and blast it that looks slowly shoot it and watch it blow not too close though you're in keep going [Music] here's the second line of defense it's oh it's smoldering already give it a good smack give it a good smack [Music] almost there the outpost belongs to your tribe now [Music] he says you made them weaker but they won't give up your sifu thanks you your tribe is growing stronger he says you did a great job capturing the outpost you're one step closer to ending the tribe wall hello says you're in good company there the light you see at night is brighter than you [Music] think up so sometimes what you'll see doesn't feel real until it brings you back to that particular moment like it's hard to shake these memories and their accompanying feelings our brains play tricks on us so it will take effort to avoid them however there's no doubt that what you remember makes your future different so you remembered the automatons power up feature that's a boost [Music] you found a crossway now which way to go the quirk quark outpost the netra tribe first beat this into shape let's see you'll have to be extra sneaky says they've been waiting for you to help them liberate the outpost they've scouted the outpost while they were waiting and suggest you have a look at what they found before entering there is a high boom team ready to help with taking over that outpost but it seems their arc shooter is busted seems happy to hear the arc shooter will be dropping high booms down on the outpost quick like [Music] trapped hard come on you cleared so uh this story needs a hero admission [Music] crusher just a few moves left make them count all fixed up the arc shooters are already gearing up the high booms hope their aimers are fixed too the outpost belongs to your tribe now he says you made them weaker but they won't give up your sifu thanks you your tribe is growing stronger [Music] he says you did a great job capturing the outpost says you didn't have much of a choice let's see [Music] there's the sovereign who runs this outpost [Music] he didn't expect his outpost to be invaded but now that you're working with their uh soon there's no way he'll surrender just because of threats [Music] he can recognize the strength of a good argument and agrees it's for the best he'll surrender the outpost to you the outpost belongs to your tribe now he says you made them weaker but they won't give up your sifu thanks you your tribe is growing stronger thinks you did a great job capturing the rivals third outpost and believes the rival is weak enough to engage them at their fort they all hope you can lead them to peace [Music] what they've been waiting for you taking control of this fort will bring peace between your tribes the scouts have reported activity nearby that's worth looking into the plan is to fling you over the wall with a sling lobber however he wants you to secure a hard hat first should anything go wrong it's better you go and find one for yourself it can't be too much trouble though it's one size fits all let's see great shot [Music] your key energy is nothing blasting him microwave [Music] [Music] find as a sunset to ride into heads up that's peak spot a great place to watch the world who knows who might be watching you um super effective irradiated get up looks like you've got this control your destiny or someone else will that seems the keys need to be in sequence to make the ring dinger work just a few moves left make them count you need to get the keys in sequence sometimes no message is a message you need to get the keys in sequence uh so the technology from yesterday's is still here today even if its message is getting old [Music] so it's time to set the rival tribe free inflictors between fight between the eyes [Music] you've been working out that's a fire starter the dry grass looks like it would ignite easily you just need to create a spark to light a fire it burns brighter than the light [Music] stand against that uh bang bang if a story is about you care for it [Music] the battering bunker looks like a great way to get through the gate [Music] bet you just need to knock and it'll open up that's bonkers [Music] the netra driver values liberty and is striving to protect freedom they want to continue with each tribe being responsible for their own and believe that uniting the tribes is the only way you can survive he was hoping it wouldn't end this way there's no reason to fight instead of uniting it would be fighting over nothing he just needs a logical reason to trust you with the thought and fate of his tribe if fight is all you do he can't stand by you he recognizes the strength of a good argument and agrees it's for the best he'll give up the fault to you the rival sifu is defeated and the destiny of their tribe is in your hands you are free to choose their fate but not free from them he'll leave it up to you to decide the fate of the rival sifu but suggests you be merciful thinks it's a good gesture to offer support to others when you can see that they need and it by side they'll stand until order and stability is reinstituted he's gotten news that the other tribes have realized there are no winners in this war there's no purpose in antagonism the way he sees it is that you've been forced into opposition your tribe didn't start the war but it's fallen to you to end it it's clear your efforts have been successful there's light at the end of the tunnel the tribes are tired of war and will remember the one who brought them peace whether you decide it'll be now or later so do you want to end the war now or continue the crusade he agrees better save your energy for something meaningful [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] it's the netra claw chain [Applause] [Music] ah out of date says there'll be consequences of the war but there are more pressing matters at hand the last world eater has been left undisturbed with the tree while you focused on the war he thought someone with your light perspective and key would have had different priorities and faced the world eaters before resolving the tribe regardless out of date is grateful the tribe war is over out of date understands the road has been rough but you already know what's left to end this journey and it'll be tough you're the only one that's strong enough to face the last world eater the future depends on someone with a light perspective to give the world a chance to survive only time will tell what the future holds and if it will bring a lasting peace for those that make it to the end out of date says the word about what you've done so far is spreading the tribes haven't lost hope yet he appreciates what you've done so far but unfortunately he's had urgent news from his friend whiz in the north west he's unsure about your intentions but hopes you'll support wiz he says he'll point you in the right direction but finding whiz and making sure he gets what he needs is up to you that doesn't sound good out of date's hunch is real the merc puff is up next [Music] out of date says that whiz is worried now that the north west world eater is stepping up its activity he explains that whiz is working on an underserved vessel in order to get to the world eater but needs help to get it done out of date suggests that you should head north west as fast as possible and see what you can do to help you've discovered fanaki leaves the densest jungle in the land better get hacking [Music] if you close your eyes hard enough to reality your mind opens to let memories in that's one way to remember what's forgotten [Music] when an unwanted memory intrudes on the mind it is a natural reaction to want to block it out or just change it [Music] [Music] however there's no doubt that what you remember makes your future different good thing you recalled how to activate the automaton's health injector [Music] [Music] [Music] bring on the night uh swinging [Music] uh uh itchy trigger finger made it count there are tough times ahead no matter where you go so you found the moly hole outpost an old pichu tribe hole in the wall oh [Music] [Music] the surge surf factory keep your eye out for whiz while you're here let's see [Music] toxinol's mining led to mass deforestation and increased global warming as nature couldn't absorb the carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions without the trees these irreversible changes to the climate also contributed to the evolution and modified our genetic code look at the notices on that board no one paid much attention to them it looks like whiz should be around here somewhere probably taking care of his guppos a surge surf factory was one of the cleaner ways to make power until the surf turned into goo and clogged it all up that is the power comes from turning the movement of the surf into surge sparks sometimes science is beyond belief there are sure to be more tracks around here maybe by the shore [Music] [Music] isn't easy on the tongue but i think he says he's happy to see a friendly face not too many of those around these days says it's good to see you again he's whiz you might remember him from the old days when he let you try his octopod whiz remembers you were such a cheery kid and he's glad to see that light hasn't faded from you despite the years but wiz understands it was a long time ago and memories get murkier the deeper you go but says it helps to have friends with you to plumb those deaths it was a tragedy but all so sad that you chose to leave it's a miracle you made it on the outside on your own that land is harsh they say says our memory keeps things for us preserves them until we are ready to face them again he knows you've returned to face looper looping and that confrontation is as inevitable as the tides he's not surprised that the loss of your family could plunge you into the depths forever but you've always been able to rise like a bubble to the surface no matter what he knows that though the tides of history may push you in one direction you can always lay your own course ultimately it's your choice you were the one to be wronged and have lived with the consequences he believes in consequences it's a direct result of action there's a bright day coming hey that's going to get you burned the only one getting burned around here is you that stings oh do you what's up if you ever think about freedom and whether any of us really has it did you make the decisions that brought you here or are you just a pawn of fate the world is going to continue on but happy to hear it still so many things to invent impressed that you fought so hard to keep the world spinning thinks you were smart to join with the myriad they have a rainbow of ways to approach any problem says they're unified in the ways that matter but that's not nearly as important as this says that you should let the past dwell in the depths but there's something else down there too gnawing at the tree of life he's named it the merck puff this is why he's tinker tonkering with the octopod but the lid got stuck so he needs a big enough tug twister to open it up and let you are going is he can't leave the surge station so you must help him find a tug twister there's a wound up mecca fingro in the mecca stadium that still has one stuck on its back find it and you will find the tug twister it's definitely made to lend a helping hand and do the heavy lifting toxinol records mention it as an automaton made for moving bionucleus matter into storage areas [Music] legend has it that activating the four of them together will form a band of your aura in the sky tell it to gallop here is the village called diddling do by those lucky enough to live there let's see move before it decides to have lunch at various stages of life we all become memories for others and just seeing someone act as a catalyst for the past to seep in again memory distortions are troubling illusions your mind creates to avoid the memories of being bullied as a kid [Music] however there's no doubt that what you remember makes your future different i was wondering when you'd recall how to spring the automaton air gliders [Music] [Music] [Music] you found a brick rack that's not absolutely flat don't want to point a finger but the mecca stadium is near here this could be the beginning of the end of everything gonna need a key of some kind that's not opening on its own [Music] just a few moves left make them count [Music] yuck fire hazard you need to line up the switches so they match good that's enough electric current to initiate the actuators and activate the framework you need to loosen the bolts without unsettling it [Music] just a few moves left make them count that's it the tug twisters loose let's hope it turned the grabbing hand into a helping hand too [Music] he believed the tug twister would do the trick but now realizes brute force won't do the trick you need some none he agrees that it's an option if you want to break stuff but in this case you want to keep things intact so it won't leak once you get underserved he says the lid should open if you sprinkle grease it problem is he's all out he knows his old friend chuchu always keeps his grease sprinklers well filled he should have an extra that you can borrow he stresses that you should come back as soon as you've retrieved the grease sprinkler the merc puff is crunching bark by the minute [Music] he's currently stranded at the end of the line so it should be easier to track him down now compared to when he's running rails [Music] you're in charge of that mount act like it that's punchy's place up in that little blimp no better upgrade bench around let's see tail a deal to be proud [Music] you've reached the end of the line that you can find choo-choo here [Music] we're all heroes of our own stories or so we hope let's see [Music] choo-choo knew you would make it to him one day all you had to do was follow the steel path the rails might be getting rusty but eventually they all converge on him [Music] claims rails are like rules if you follow them the way you're supposed to everything good in life can roll your way says you followed the rails to where you need to be but tracks have switches in them too the question is then will you keep on the same track or look for a way to hit that switch you seem like you're on the right track already he just hopes you don't get sidetracked onto a darker path whichever way you go he wants you to know that the rails never steer you wrong stick to them and they always bring you right to where you're meant to wants to be if you've ever regretted taking one track in life instead of another if you could go back would you switch tracks or keep chugging along the one you're on likes your sureness the way you keep at it like a chug chug with no way to reverse [Music] seems like the world came out of its rut and is chugging toward higher ground again can't thank you enough for hitting the brakes and working to turn the world chug around but let's not get derailed says he's surprised to see anyone this far out but sometimes the wrong train does take you to the right station as you can see he didn't plan to make a stop here but now that he had to he's really happy to see you he says his name is chuchu he's been off track since the world started dying but he's trained his mind to stay positive regardless of the situation says sometimes life runs off the rails but it's always better when they're good and greased he's convinced the tracks are like the paths our lives take and you must deal with the outcome even if you didn't lay them yourself this time though he was sidetracked and needs a new wing nut to get back on track nuts are easy to find as they're fitted on any in front chugga chugga out there the challenge is taking them off so he's happy you're here to do it for him says he knew you would like he knows the way the rails run looks like the control box handles need to be wheeled to buzz the watch just a few moves left make them wired up and ready to go you look civilized now you're covered [Music] ride like the wind the wingnut chug tunnel it goes on forever it's more than a little scary down here emissive shot [Music] [Music] [Music] boom boom made to be broken atomized top quality scrap in this piece oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] just a few moves left make them count [Music] yorum [Music] says he knew you'd come through if someone makes a stop at your station it's for a good reason but he understands no one gets their tracks greased for free he'd be happy to part with his spare grease sprinkler as he believes it's a great fit for any of your business that needs to be unstuck he keeps it safe in a box on my hand card in case of emergency yes for something catastrophic like something squeaky in need of greasing or an ointment to ease the pain in these dark times in general says you should help yourself to the grease sprinkler it's a versatile tool from the bygone a last of its kind so don't let it go to he's waste you'll put it to good use as there are lots of stuckey's out there that need greasing to open [Music] seems glad you think so you're on the right rail wait choo choo says he can't wait to get out of this place so dumbledore has plenty wonders what kind of good you'll get up to today you shouldn't worry about smashing up the box choo choo has no use for it now choo choo says he feels strongly about helping his next just like you did for him he's convinced there was a bigger reason you met sometimes the wrong train will take you to the right place he believes you've got what it takes to make a difference he's witnessed it himself says he can't see the end of your rails but if you grease them up good he hopes you'll enjoy an easier ride for choo choo's thrilled you found the ark just imagine how much faster than a chug that thing must be and no rails needed needs no rails no roads nothing but air the world's on the mend so no need to leave it but just think of all the places the ark could take you [Music] says he's happy to see the ark in your hands knows you'll go great places with it and do some good wonders who you might call aboard the ark with you so what we have here is an opportunity why you don't need anyone else but just if you want to go quickly but you know you can't go on without i think we can finally agree on something it [Music] is after spending a life on the rails he's eager to ride the skies with you just let him pack his rollerboard and he'll roll aboard chuchu says he's ready to pack up and leave he's picked up a thing or two over the years fair enough all around you're not staying here for long so don't get too used to it [Music] says that there's no plan to confront the merk puff until the octopod is properly armed he's happy to tell you that the cannon he's been working on now just needs ammunition he says his old friend boom makes all things that go bang there's a rumor that some of boom's pyro sticks shot off and are out there roaming free you should keep an eye on the horizon for pyros if you're fast you have a shot at catching some of them before they go off he's a peculiar little fellow that's been fiddling with splodies since he was a kidding it runs in his blood their family recipes pack a punch [Music] that's a bang plant where toxinol used to make all sorts of splody things before it blew up in their faces [Music] great shot everything is at stake [Music] two molecule [Music] [Applause] so that looks like an unbanged pyro stick on the loose better catch it before it goes off uh you could try living in harmony with what you can't see so the pyro sticks will cause a bang but targeting is on you at least now you have a chance to hurt the merc puff where it counts you should aim for the head that's the murk puffs weak spot thinking doesn't seem to be his strong point whiz has been working on another canon but instead of pyro sticks it squirts guppos scaly distractions for anyone with an appetite disorder and irresistible for the murk puff in particular seems the best way to find guppo's is go talk to gil he has a natural sonar and knows where the guppo's sub the surf this means you'll have to go visit gill at burble bottom find gill and he'll be able to tell you where to find the guppos guppos are lively beings and they're fast too they're here there and everywhere or at least they used to be oh smell that biohazard nearby that there is a fume foundry where toxinol processed goat juice gonna need a key of some kind [Music] [Music] let's see this is bubble bottom residence of gil happy to finally get to meet you he's seen a lot of things wash up on his miniature shore but nothing as exciting as you sorry figures it's impossible as bad as the air might be the goo is even worse it must have been upstream only to get to this point in your histo future but which way are you going now with the flow or against children crazy hard to flipper against the surf but you can't save the world if you let it sweep you away either way it's a shame the surf has gotten so nasty thinks life is like trying to ride a wave you need to pick the right one but you don't really know which one that is until you're on top of it better to ride a wave than let the perfect one pass you by me wonders who would want to the right wave takes you where you want to go i can't imagine how wonderful it's going to be to surf on [Music] happy you ride alongside the myriad they bring a real shine to everything [Music] is life work is not nearly as fun but none of that's nearly as important as enjoying the day right he never drank from this pond because of the disgusting things done there too leeway our photo i even the fish stopped drinking here after the pollution made the surf mucked and the air blocked his gills [Music] he figures the tree of life isn't drinking either or well that's not true he said it does drink as it has no other choice it's a tree but it's forced to drink poison traffic and claims the surf is poison now anything that drinks it becomes poison two including the tree of life his friend whiz needs guppos for one reason or another and gill is ready to point you in the right direction but here you're only going to find dead ones he's pretty sure whiz wants them alive well at least the ones that aren't already rotting if you head in the right direction you'll find a clean enough bit of surf to snag yourself some guppos then you can get them to whiz for whatever he has in mind he doesn't have any guppos and whiz is particular about the kind he needs best part of a mountain no need to refuel so so [Music] so this is guppy grotto just a few moves left make them count that paid off sometimes the smallest pieces of scrap are the ones you make yourself weldy done hard and sharp feels like a monster's lair down here that made it all worth it couldn't just be opening uh uh [Music] wow lucky so hmm huh just a few moves left make them count so the dark is almost over [Music] that seems to be enough guppos to provide the octopod with infinite ammunition he's surprised the merc puffs been able to hold its breath all this time it's just another proof of the evolutionary change this means the northwest route has suffered more damage than the others he's realized there's a chance all of you who are gifted with traits beyond the ordinary mammal wouldn't have been so lucky if it wasn't for the contamination's effect on [Music] evolution the light of day shows how bad the world has become [Applause] [Applause] foreign that was the last of them you've sealed the fate of the tribe and the tree it's time for the end game you have your destiny follow it all the way back to out of date he never told anyone about what's next but he's just continue to stay true to yourself and respect others whatever happens you've become their pride the guiding light of the tribe it's time to return to the tree one last time knows it's the same old understand it's time to create your own path go on catch it didn't hurt it a bit [Music] uh three out of date says the signs of the end of the world are everywhere it seems nature is preparing to take revenge the day of reckoning is coming and you are invited he can feel you're approaching the end date said if you haven't decided whom of all like-minded light-hearted beings you've met have earned a seat on the ark yet it's time to do that now then grasp your last chance to make sure luperlupin stopped for good the tree settled its score but it left yours half done [Music] [Music] around when you return [Music] [Music] give it a little kick so so [Music] the sifu is seeking revenge too he hasn't forgotten what looper lupin did but he also wants to stop him from attacking his tribe that the world seems to survive doesn't mean he must he hopes you agree even if it goes against your light-hearted nature there's no room for predators in the world the myriad tribe is building but he knows this is your fight you should handle it lupa lupin's own fear was his shackles not the roots of the tree it just you changed a chance to stand back and let the tribe handle it the seafood ready to step into the fray are the odds about the change if a friend dies something inside you you can save the seafood by making yourself shock waves spread when the world crumbles this is not a prophecy me telling you about the future it's you shaping it here's a vulgar display of power [Music] the more he does the stronger he becomes it's time you remember who the real enemy is and stop playing the game so this is how it ends the predator and the world itself suffering but at least it's a sign they're both still alive so what we have here is a clear matter of life and death and only you can make a difference you continue to make bad decisions and mistakes oh it never ends it's easy to make a good decision when there's only one option the only mistake here is you my mistake is letting you speak my conviction is that the world would be a better place without your voice convincing yourself doesn't win the argument in the end we won't remember the words of our enemies but the silences of our friends the weak can't forgive forgiveness is a strength it's not all life and death [Music] it's no better time than now to accept a helping hand [Music] wow do you wonder what turn life might have taken if you've done things different a left when you went right a yes when you said no you've walked the thin line between survival and disaster and haven't lost your balance yet it's because of you the tree of life and the world has been given a second chance you carried the light in a world full of dark and made a difference in a place that needed change you allied with the myriad tribe and acted on understanding of the greater good and a code of honor however light and dark does simply represent the polarities of life one can't exist without the other this isn't the end just being surrounded by nature as it heals itself will rejuvenate us nature will teach us how to survive so trust your conscience to show you the way and everything else will follow he knows things that you need to know has plenty [Music] [Music] but you're not alone you filled the ark and those that shared your perspective and gained your trust will accompany you on your journey is there a world out there that's better suited for those imbalanced in their life nature than this one whether or not we'll leave your story on record so those who come after will know you followed your light nature and saved the world so when all is said and done it turned out to be an unusual ending after all what could be better than ending the story the right way ending it your way a beginning of something new [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] you
