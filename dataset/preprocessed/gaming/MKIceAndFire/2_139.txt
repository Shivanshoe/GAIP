aider i worked for myself no one can remain neutral in this ayden we're fighting for survival without water the whole bazaar will die in under a month and the peacekeepers they won't help us just like when my mother died they just sat and watched us die turns out you're one of them you don't care about us tell me why should i not kill you sophie shoot what are you waiting for [Music] because we can help each other who killed lucas he thinks we killed him sophie talk to me did you do it no sophie what the hell why do you care about this murderer what did aydor promise you [Music] if it's not you who could have killed him i wonder myself certainly none of my people if you find out who did it tell us i'd like to hug the guy lucas deserved to die live too long as it is we didn't have to kill him we have our own plan for getting the peacekeepers out of the bazaar hater promised me passage to the center that's why i'm helping him and you believe him just like that at least he didn't try to kill me he wasn't the one you betrayed but i can help you too help us with water and i'll take you to the central loop myself okay first i did not betray you i'm helping investigate a murder and that's different as for your offer isn't the only way through controlled by the pk there is another way do you really believe that i just trust you again we need each other you didn't tell us you were working with the pk so we made assumptions things are getting more dangerous and we all need to be careful you tried to kill me sophie i swear on the memory of birdie susie logan ralph and herman i'm sure if you help us we'll take you to the center will you help [Music] fine what's the plan [Music] jack and joe escaped we have a chance to take the tower and finally reclaim the water before [ __ ] ator does we'll deal with the peacekeepers and getting you to the center immediately afterwards first we need to secure access to water how do i get up the tower it's almost impossible without a winch and joe's men sealed off access that's why i'm asking you so you want me to climb it if you do you'll save a great many people aiden we won't forget this didn't you hear sophie you have a job to do um [Music] looks like the bandits fled the water tower it's unoccupied sophie says once i help them get the water back she'll show me another passage to the central loop sounds good she grew up here she knows every inch of this place better than most tacky drivers but watch out for joe ayden the guy's a clown and he's dangerous i doubt he'd just run off like that that's taller than i thought damn [Music] [Applause] sophie jack and joe are in the tower they're gonna blow it up dear god if they do we will have no water source come on aiden the tower is mined try to disarm the charges so um [Music] [Music] inhibitor container [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] give me the detonated jack we were supposed to take tribute just collect money jack give it back they'll get what they deserve they will die jack i'm warning you [Music] [Music] got it and the water is safe [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh made it after all [Music] either the bizarre jag holes or the pk they'll be honest the moment we come down from here that's why it's time for fireworks nobody's getting out alive no i don't want to die you [ __ ] who's there stop over blow the goddamn tower i swear i found the bombs let's talk the time for talking is over we're gonna [ __ ] this place up you're not listening you're done i want it to be over and to leave the city safely help me and i'll help you you're fooling yourself jack nobody's letting us out of here alive look i am a pilgrim let's just blow it up already i dare you i know you won't do it don't listen to him jack it's over [ __ ] it up i dunno i'm scared joe wait joe hey isn't that the pilgrim who showed up at the bazaar recently maybe pilgrim or poe so what don't you get it if he's a pilgrim he can get us out lead us out of the city to some place safe i don't trust that [ __ ] you don't trust anyone i told you to play nice with barney when we had the chance [ __ ] listen to me for once well play nice with barney what for we can get the [ __ ] out of the bazaar after what we found out from the peacekeepers we tipped off the [ __ ] gave him a chance to run but he thought he was too clever for that they warned barney about what well about luke is wanting to take him in on weapons charges among others but set a trap for him for weeks and instead of politely getting the [ __ ] out of here he tried to play q instead so barney knew lucas was after him the [ __ ] wanted to start a war in old villadore and you ask me war's the last thing we need money crystals that's a different story that's why i tried to put an end to that rabbit dog and his sister so pilgrim will you get us out of the city or what calm down joe i won't [ __ ] calm down get us out of the city pilgrim to the nearest safe settlement and no one will die here i can get you out of town but first i have my own business to take care of you need to hide somewhere and wait sounds like a huge risk no risk no gain he's lying jack there's no other way [ __ ] i don't like it i [ __ ] don't but okay we'll be waiting for you in the tunnels near the tango motel we'll give you a signal when we get there good choice now give me the detonator jack [Music] [Music] so [Music] all right so what now aiden smart guy who gets control of the water [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] clear [Music] [Music] [Music] bonnie knew lucas was trying to capture him jack and joe warned him he could have avoided the trap but he went into it anyway that's when lucas was killed maybe we should check out barney's hideout at the hotel tango i'll make sure the place is safe haven't seen my kids in months because of this ridiculous blockade of this center [Music] got nothing to say where's my flower but it's you who owes me teresa months of wages that's it last chance to move your asses out of here with my boat you [ __ ] break it up normally i like a cat fight but bloody hell can you believe just yesterday those two were best friends what happened last night someone stole teresa's flower all of it a major harvest too she could have made a killing without it she got nothing no flower no sales no money she and her son won't last another month without the income oh she must be desperate to blame her best friend ex best friend but it's just an accusation it's not like she's got any evidence she's a bit hot-headed that's for sure but you'd have to ask her yourself you think she needs help teresa why looking to earn some cash well that's not why you're a pilgrim aren't you you guys don't do anything for free how much they fork over for the water if you'll be near a shop thanks for the tip [Music] [ __ ] me people will always complain we're alive and that's what counts don't make me come get you i'd never believe the night runners good morning pilgrim have i already thanked you for for the water i hear you were robbed but my best friend no less i'm devastated really and why on earth would you jump to that conclusion about your best friend i didn't want to but who else could it be she was storing it for me to keep it safe she said and now it's conveniently gone me and my boy are left with nothing if only she'd admit it and return the flower i'd forgive her i swear i would lord is my witness if she's in trouble i'll help her but she's a stubborn one we've had quite a harvest too wouldn't have had us living on easy street but now now we'll starve [Music] how did anna explain the disappearance of the flower theft not a disappearance and she didn't explain anything she's lying through her teeth how do you know see it in her eyes it's a lie i look back and realize anna's been a liar all along do you have any proof that hannah did this not exactly that was in her shed wasn't it in here i thought she was doing me a favor offering to store it turns out she was just making it easier for her to screw over me and my boy talk to her would you she won't listen to me maybe a stranger could get around her stubbornness we can put this behind us if she gives it back and if she stole it because she was hungry she can keep what she needs her shed's near the water tower please go talk to her i'll think about it a friend's betrayal hurts the most hey anna anna i just want to talk go away talk to me and i'll go away it won't take long tonight [Music] and they say pilgrims are thieves and swindlers the guy got him medication and then stayed with him for a week until he got better [Music] please just go away can we please talk i'd like to help help what remind me i'm a widow or that i'm dirt poor or a heinous flower thief i'm not making assumptions i just want to hear your story i want to hear the truth the truth you want the truth here's the truth i would never rob a friend never and that's the end of my story did theresa tell you about the half years wages she owes me i needed to reason to sell that flower so she could pay me why would i risk everything my well-being teresa and her sons by stealing it i thought you were best friends so did i until today since the fall we've been close i lost my child she lost her husband i i became very depressed suicidal teresa got me through it she even cooked for me and my husband who drunk heavily i can't believe she'd accuse me of this she'd mentioned you were storing the flower i figured it was the best way to keep watch over it make sure i got paid so we put it in my shed near the tower i went to check on it this morning and nothing all gone you didn't see anyone lurking nearby or anything suspicious you don't think i would have mentioned that by now i can only tell you that i did not steal that flower i wouldn't do that to theresa order myself the only strange thing was that nothing else was stolen my buckwheat my beats untouched whoever it was only wanted the flower interesting mind if i go check out the shed maybe it just needs to be looked at with a fresh pair of eyes knock yourself out help us end this madness please [Music] [Music] somebody must add keys the rest of the supplies are untouched they knew exactly what they were looking for [Music] nothing's broken someone was very familiar with this place [Music] in footprints one set of shoes thief worked alone flower trail on the ground bags dragged this way i wonder what the hell is going on in the central loop since pk's trail ends here [Music] who had the keys to the shed me and my husband but he's dead nobody else you're sure there's no sign of forced entry anna whoever took the flower had the keys or made copies so you do think it was me it's not out of the question i thought at least you would believe me what next how do i return something i haven't taken you can't draw blood from a stone calm down and think who else would do this and why help me help you unless theresa's right after all hard to tell someone from the bazaar perhaps there's dodger that guy is capable of anything and then there's benny teresa's son and that's all i can come up with why would this dodger character steal the flower haven't a clue other than it's just the kind of thing i'd expect from a shady guy like him his kind never dirty their hands with real work they just sit there living large of others misfortune but i i anna hey got carried away sorry i only just lost my husband and it still hits me at random times sorry where was i oh right so dodger kept asking teresa about her harvest her her grain how much etc i i didn't think much of it at the time i try not to pay attention to scum like that if you want to talk to him you'll find him at the bazaar but watch your back he doesn't give a rat's ass about people only money what about to raise his son why would he do this normally i wouldn't suspect him nice kid i've known him all his life he's like a son to me but lately he's been quiet like he's got something to hide and maybe he does but no many wouldn't have done this it would break teresa's heart and he knows it and even if he had taken the flower why that seems to be the central question for everyone involved where can i find benny not sure he's been making himself pretty scarce that said i'm sure teresa's got him guarding their storehouses make sure what meager goods they have left are safe i'll look for him can you tell me where you were the night the flower was stolen mourning my husband that night like every night since i lost him i'm sorry for your loss i'm sure you are let's get this over with accusations are devastating enough around here i'm ruined and not if we find the flower and prove it with someone else perhaps but in my experience the damage has been done maybe maybe not let's see what i can find out [Music] [Music] you can go search barney's stuff clear now [Music] take dear uh hey little one how are you i'm not little but hey wait we've met before i'm aiden what's your name again maya what are you doing here maya looking for bandits gonna beat the crap out of them but i'm hiding from the infected right now ah so what did these bandits do to you they stole lots of stuff but the most important thing was oh they're here there she is you're done following us around you little [ __ ] told ya you're dead kid don't worry how about i beat him up hide this won't take long what's happening [Music] you ever seen something like this thanks that was amazing and gross too and they're the ones who stole your stuff no there are more of them before the rest probably have it what's this most important thing they took my music box why is it so important to you it belong to my mother that's all i have left of her that does sound important you need to find it and i'll let you keep it if you do you did save my life the bandits went into that building overlooking construction site on william the ninth road you got to get it from them if you won't then i will well whoa little i mean my lady don't worry i'll handle them if you can't find them just stop and listen the music box plays a melody like this [Music] i'll keep that in mind but they won't be there during the day go at night they always go back to that building at night why don't i take you home where do you live i'll go to the bazaar by myself i'm not a baby if you don't want to keep the music box you could sell it there it's worth a lot [Music] wow jackass [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] hello lightning yo what's up so you've heard about me sure who hasn't yeah i'm a [ __ ] legend what are they saying any hot chicks asking about me oh man plenty all dreaming to meet the legend that's my life what can i say providing the fastest water delivery on the rooftops gives you celebrity status i have also the most diverse selection still water sparkling water lavender flavor honey flavor even urtica flavor wait what urtica flavor who knows but it sounds intriguing right it's called marketing people drink it up doesn't matter what it is but if it sounds fresh indifferent they want it so did you come here to challenge me to get your ass kicked by fabulous sadio well i know i have no chance but to be defeated by you would be an honor darn right it would men so when you're ready take these bottles for a brisk run just try not to break your legs [Music] probably not [Music] ugh that music box melody seems to be coming from that infected uh [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] aiden did you do it did you find the music box [Music] yes and you were right it really was valuable oh so you sold it we agreed remember i could keep it and do whatever i want with it yeah i guess [Music] i've never seen someone bought your job so badly in my life are you dodger well well the pilgrim himself here's a piece of advice the next time you offer someone water ask if they're thirsty first what's your problem my problem is a whole tank of agua fresca that nobody wants to buy anymore just want to ask you a few questions are you [ __ ] me do i look like an information booth i've got a business to run here you don't have business get out of my face [Music] quit barking and listen and if i don't then you won't find out that theresa's flower is gone what the [ __ ] are you talking about [Music] know where benny might be do i look like his mother believe me he's on top of my where are they now list he went down in flames in our last card game he almost literally bet the farm and lost so if you're looking for that flower it's not the razors or bennies no more it's mine the kid owed it to me and if it's missing it was stolen from me so benny's in your debt big time up to his ears you might say in flower you think he stole it could be he's a dumb kid who might think that will stop me from trying to collect i need to find him man ask mother teresa she's usually got the boy on a short leash except for poker nights clearly [Music] what do you know about a woman named anna what the one who works for theresa not all that much i used to play cards with her husband before he you know beat it he never said boo about her not even a few pints in that says something right there so now you know i have the most skin in this game that flower isn't found i am the big loser so maybe check out teresa's storehouses seems like just the place a dumb kid like benny would think he could hide and if you do get your hands on the flower just kindly bring it straight to me i'll pay you handsomely for the service of course but it will save everyone a lot of grief and hey i get my flower we can put this behind us [Music] seriously there's no time for delay [Music] hmm oh that floor doesn't look safe maybe there's another way uh pretty empty as warehouses go hey what the [ __ ] are you doing here is that you pilgrim you shouldn't be here mate how'd you get in benny right we need to talk i don't like this dodger sent you did he tell him i'm pulling together what i owe him i'm just i just haven't got it yet hold up benny so you're saying you're in debt to dodger dodger hasn't sent you no how much do you owe him only you had a reason to steal the flower you bastard do you think that just because you turn on the water you got free run of the place tell me i'm wrong oh ain't telling you nothing bernie um [Music] here your uh ingredients mmm good i wish there was more oil on the metal scraps but oh naira can't you just be thankful for what you've got for once she gives me this [ __ ] every day i swear okay okay voila it's ready here smell it wow it smells it's oh boy it's like heaven what is it silly little boy too young to know aren't you it's new car smell a car are you disappointed the scent of luxury is the base note the smell of confidence is the heart note and the fragrance of risk and adventure as the head note all you dream about is to turn it on and drive away into the distance thanks so much for helping me out unlike some people here have this i rubbed it with turn me on this'll remind you to tune into your sense of smell now and then [Music] where are you benny [Music] uh ugh [Music] oh my i haven't done anything god is my witness let me go please first answer a few questions but i want the truth did you steal the flower no i don't even know where it is so why did you attack me i thought you might have been one of dodgers boys come to collect i see you're in deep with dodger and used your mother's bountiful harvest for collateral i was hot that night mate and the pot was big enough we could have bought the jansen's fields with the water back on and all mum and me would have been sitting pretty for the rest of our days but then things got ugly and ain't no other way to tell it i lost so the dodger take the flower to settle up doubt it could have just made me bring it to him and i would have he's too lazy to do anything himself but you know mate don't tell him i said that [Music] what's the meaning of this stealing the flower was your job teresa so you pilgrims really are crazy he's off his nut mum you shut your trap and listen young man i've had enough of you as well benny wouldn't have pulled this off on his own he's not exactly the brightest chap no offense ma'am none taken lump of coal for brains that one mom very well i did it but i really had no choice aidan we worked for months on that crop worked our fingers to the bone it yielded enough to last for months there'd be bread enough to feed the whole bizarre but you know what dodgy would do if he got it sell it back to us for triple the price we'd end up paying for our own flower a cruel joke all because of a stupid card game we'd be ruined i couldn't allow that i wouldn't so where is the flower under the water tower you must understand it can't go to dodger and why not he wanted fair and square dodger fair and square hardly he's a cheat everyone knows it we just can't prove it okay say you're right is there a middle ground can we give him something else instead someone like dodger doesn't seem all that flexible he's got to be me talk to him please ask him for more time anything we're begging you let me think about that you are our only hope don't get melodramatic benny the pilgrim knows what he's doing something's off how intruder over here just let me go it's easy i wonder what the hell is going on in the central loop since pk's restricted access two [Music] ugh [Applause] what do you think so ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh so [Music] [Music] five years ago everything would have been okay let's make things lively 100 more no freaking way unless you're willing to cut the time by 10 seconds deal living dangerously it was already an impossible task well we'll see about that aidan you find my flower yet yeah that's what i'm here about teresa and benny are in dire straits can you forgive their debt or at least give them more time [ __ ] that how many times do i have to say i'm not running a charity i didn't force benny to play cards you know a man can play his deaths well he's not a man is he stupid is as stupid does maybe when they got nothing left but the skivvies on their butts they'll have learned a valuable lesson you know what aiden actually yeah i think i got something to help everyone honestly yeah who cares about flower what am i going to be a baker all of a sudden don't think so but i do want what i'm old and me and urban we've got this bed wait whoa no fair not him he runs on walls of course it's fair there's no rule against having him get them you pull this off aiden and what urban will have to pay me will more than cover my losses on the flower and there'll be extra i can throw your way wait what exactly are you talking about here you see on top of the church there's this song well let's just call it a flag you can't see it from the ground but this flag well it's not a flag yeah you'll know when you see it urban and i made a bet that i could find someone who could nab it for us i've been raising the stakes for years and urbans called me every time but with the amount on the line now you know it would be a scene not to give it a try ah i'm in no hurry rather you just keep raising the stakes till it gets real juicy what's that [Music] fear suddenly got you all puckered nah i'm just looking out for you it'll ruin you if you lose now being out the flower and all i'm game if hidden the time limit is pretty [ __ ] brutal but you know i've got faith in nathan here so you in [Music] let's do this well then let's just get to it shall we three two one go anda leader make me proud [Music] [Music] you
