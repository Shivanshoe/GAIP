[Music] if you want to survive the walker onslaught you'll need a bit of training first let's take a look at your controls how do you want to turn try each option and see what's comfortable for you how do you want to move around try each style they're all pretty different looking good now move towards the door you can bash doors and other objects in the environment bash the door to open it uh oh here comes a walker you can shove walkers to get some space try it now good you can also grab walkers and a choke to hold them in place now throw the walker away from you to make space only one way to keep him down for good choke the walker and stab it in the head fighting isn't the only way to survive time to learn about scavenging if you see any useful materials out there be sure to take them with you we can use anything you find now that you have everything let's focus on the locked door locks can be broken by bashing them with any weapon nice job keep moving sometimes you can find materials inside containers bash the container to open it bring back all the food you can find so our community can grow if a container is on the ground you'll kick it open if you bump into it some items are rarer than others and can be used to upgrade weapons head through the next door when you're ready let's see what that hammer can do to a walker there's another one waggling your weapons won't do anything try it on this one of course there are ways to kill walkers without getting too close let's test your aim try grabbing that pistol some weapons can be stabilized with your offhand steady the pistol and take a shot at those walkers when you want to reload eject the magazine and grab a new one from your hip using your offhand you can aim down the sights of your gun for more accuracy keep shooting the walkers in the range nice shooting why don't you try this one out this lever action shotgun packs a punch use both hands to keep it stable lever action guns need to be cycled each shot quickly flick the gun to cycle it make sure to reload there's more ammo on the table nice work you can carry four weapons at once on your weapon wheel release the button on the weapon you would like to switch to if you pick up another weapon you'll swap it for whatever you're holding pick up this machete perfect it's best to keep a balance of firearms and melee weapons at all times time for a live test don't move a walker's gonna break through that door remember you can shove walkers away using your hands or any weapon shove it with your off hand first you need to shove it with your empty hand good now try it with your weapon now move forward and finish it off clear head through where the walker came in look out behind you turn around and kill it watch your back out there if a walker grabs you it'll pin you down welcome to the new world [Music] damn it the hell was daryl thinking coming out here by himself dictates that things are going to heat up real fast out there no kidding be ready to meet at the fallback spot i will await your signal and arrange your rendezvous when mission success has been achieved uh definitely daryl it looks like him daryl you better have a damn good reason for running off are you saying you wouldn't come with don't mean i can't do it myself i told you not to go don't answer to you rick i have people to protect that includes you there's a life at stake do you even care that isn't one of them maximum walker's coming this way i want to hunker down drive to the fallback spot eugene we can settle this later here take this vans moving to the east road let's go yeah i know the way watch it [ __ ] i'll be fine take the path to your left i'll see you at the van darryl [ __ ] gotta get to the van fast [Music] foreign [Music] can't be far now [Music] [Applause] finally let's get out of here your leg just a little banged up from the bridge i'll be fine it doesn't look fine to me can we go already eugene get that engine running you still owe me a talk that leg isn't gonna heal anytime soon hope it was worth it won't take too long feels better than it looks rick we got a line on those supplies you ready to go stay here we'll talk when i get back michonne i'm on my way hey now that the war is over we can finally focus on rebuilding alexandria glad you're here to help you finish us plans in yeah we're organizing efforts to scavenge food and materials with enough food we can bring in new survivors with enough materials we can build out the community and the arsenal if you want to go out there use the map sounds good the first thing to do is pick where you want to go options are limited for now but once we recruit more survivors we'll be able to search farther out once you select a site check out all the info the scouts gathered on it like what materials can be found there make sure to lock in your plans before you go hotter scavenger trips are risky but they usually mean there's better stuff to find in the area i think i'm ready you still need to gear up head over to the armory while i get things prepped may not seem like much now but as you discover weapons the armory will grow take a look at what we've got get the right materials you'll be able to looks like you're ready get to the van eugene is waiting [Music] so so me i would like to believe this will go smoothly mostly because that means i won't have to exit this fine vehicle find supplies and outrun the hurt see you at the pickup maggie said the military had to leave their supplies behind as long as no one got here first we should find something we need supplies weapons ammo stay focused foreign walker cut me off walker's got me you won't find much on the main path try indoors uh another walker on me heard's probably close watch [Music] walker get off what's got me find anything if the path is empty try looking deeper in um [Music] this is one invitation that's too sweet to decline we need to go now well these will require a thorough scrubbing but we made it great effort let's see how we did any food or fuel you scavenge will go to our scouting parties once they're prepped they'll head out to look for a survivor as alexandria's population grows our world will too new people means new locations to explore as well as new weapons and ways to increase their stopping power someone left a message for you with the community board head over there next any letters you get from the community will go on this board take a look now sounds like rajul has plans for a town hall [Music] maggie sent some materials over from hilltop with the materials maggie sent we have enough to finish that town hall go over to the drafting table and we can finalize plans expanding alexandria will offer you different perks in the field try building the town hall we have all the materials and enough workers to support it staffing a building with additional workers will improve its efficiency with some work alexandria could start looking like the world we had before guess i should get to it see what i can scavenge out there all right daryl's been looking for you finally ready to talk i told you not to go out why didn't you listen she's still out there who the girl i told you just need another day i can find her you came back in a cop car covered in blood i asked you to tell me what happened and instead you ran off what's going on with you i need you to trust me no daryl i'm trying to rebuild after a war i need everybody here now fine you really want to know what happened out there started with the herd the one that ran me off the road [ __ ] [Music] [Music] first thing i heard was eugene on the radio anybody there i heard one hell of a cacophonous crash next i heard the walkers i needed a weapon fast can you hear me i believe your vehicle may have been compromised if you can hear me um you where'd you end up i was in the middle of a camp look destroyed any survivors nah i was just hoping for meds shrivers state park heard of it why were you out so far was supposed to be a shortcut back eventually i found some meds fixed me up but it wasn't long to rest place was crawling had to keep moving [Music] why didn't you tell me any of this before didn't have time still don't it took you two days to get back you don't think i need to know what's going on winchester was turning into the only choice i had found a cop car that's the one you drove home wasn't that easy the gun on the hood helped though right in time too my arms were getting tired hmm place was [ __ ] housed people must have panicked military had put up some kind of a barricade they were probably trying to keep things under control if you say so ah walkers had to get ready before the barricade came down only choice was to fight [Music] got through barely and i headed toward town this is taking too long need to keep looking before the trail goes cold not until you tell me the whole story you haven't even said who you're looking for your life's in danger ain't right if we leave things here might fall apart we're trying to rebuild i'll tell you the rest but if you won't help i'll find someone who will tell me everything and you might not have to [Music] so so how's daryl holding up stubborn as ever already trying to run off again i'm sure he has his reasons and at least the scouting efforts are going well how can i help out you found some good spots to scavenge try to get out there later [Music] so good work [Music] there's work that needs to get into in quote house that need killing let's get this done pronto be sure to stay ahead of the herd the supplies are here stay ahead of the herd and grab what you can if whatever's left of this community can save ours then that's what it takes it may not be immediately apparent from our surroundings but i've been absolutely 100 sure that this is the spot you should be at the evac side grab what you can eugene will be in touch won't be much on the main path be sure to look all over like riding a bicycle never forget how to shoot looks like we're approaching time to rendezvous you might want to prepare for a mass of the deceased we'll be there soon don't worry i can get some use out of this it might even save a life the recently owned deceaser headed your way this be prepared we're halfway to rendezvous okay shouldn't be too long just hold out [Applause] [Music] [Music] i need you in route to the vehicle i assure you it is significantly safer than me coming down there to get you let's go the van can't wait right in this man's opinion that was damn near perfect [Music] so you're cleaning up that weapon you found in the armory check there [Music] looking forward to seeing judith tonight you
