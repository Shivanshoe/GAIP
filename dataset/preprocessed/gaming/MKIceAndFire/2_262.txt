so the matriarch asked for us by name you specifically although i cannot fathom why peter's constantly surprising us too if he's first in line for brainwashing i gotta say is that what you think that we're brainwashing we've met your recent converts overly zealous doesn't even begin to describe they have embraced the matriarch's promise a life-altering experience yes but one that must be freely accepted well his drone is her ticket out of here what how what are you two whispering about well [Music] he wants to know if you know you're the bad guy reductive concepts like good and bad led us into the galactic war and what was gained actually we were just admiring how huge this place is it is grand isn't it belief in the matriarch restored it to what it was before the war just as her promise will restore everyone we lost mothers [Music] sons this promise raise the dead of course it won't it can't bring people back we can't but the matriarch the divine vessel i got an idea but i need time stalum what join me if i intended to kill you wow oh okay that uh that is a cool trick i'll explain how you did it sorcery i can understand how some might see it that way but i used science the science of faith faith is not science but faith energy is this skiff my inquisitors even sacrosanct yourself all powered by the same miraculous energy energy i discovered i'm going for the drone keep them talking but now what what is it it's just um you uh you uh discovered stuff and you claim to uh control energy faith energy right uh well it just seems like all this faith energy is is really really powerful and uh um must be hard to uh hold on a sec you uh um this is really embarrassing you have a uh my what yeah it's like this golden oily thing on your you know face i was disfigured during an explosion one of the many tragedies for which i blame him [Music] so you were saying wait weren't there more of you what no no no no no no it seems like the kind of thing that we would be aware of indeed please continue your fascinating account of you know you were saying something about him it seems super important right right uh your father uncle son my son died of disease the hymn i was referring to was someone else the first divine vessel of this church before it was even a church an absurd faith healer bathed in gold and light and wielding unfathomable power he saw my loss our collective loss knew its cause but refused to reverse it because he personally never felt what we feel that is why i founded this church to heal to give hope to those who have lost everything wait there were more of you the little one is missing perhaps you died like your son what [Music] the bright yes good point group he is totally into his spiritual mission but i think i figured out all of this those were some pretty sweet holograms i think even the world might be jealous i mean they must have cost you an arm and a another arm right and this that's a pretty sweet trick too but everybody's got anti-gravity oh and let me guess you got your own personal shield generator tucked under that territory don't you a little makeup some color coordination of love in the gold laser light show by the way in [Music] pretty sweet little scan i'm actually impressed wow good for you hey i get it man you got to sell the brand before you stage the miracle oh man this one time on rigel 3 you think you're all very clear you hope to delay me because you're afraid but there is nothing to fear why get back here where i can see you yeah yeah [Music] it's time to meet the matriarch rocket tell me you have an escape plan we're going to summon the milan my new buddy will show us the way we're being very cryptic yeah well i get twitchy when i'm surrounded by giant murderbot they just want us to meet their new mommy speaking who else thinks quill's ex-girlfriend traded in her cop badge for cult ropes [Music] [Music] my lady as requested the guardians of the

you see the look on their faces when they see me razoring down from on high haha or the ones they make when they realize groots got entirely no never thought i'd say this but fighting with you guys is fun okay yes i get that it's all bubbling sparkly out there we're blasting shots of them and it's so much fun but if we lose our focus if we can't let go of these crazy thoughts spinning us upside down we're done who's with me victory is ours let's do this field feel my rock these guys win the prize for creepiest costumes [Music] we're easy targets down here how do we get out raker's drone gave me a peek at the ship's layout i'll get us to the calm center where we can call the milano to come bail us out of this scuttle flock okay but do you see a way up i see your way up how thoughtful laura wait time down track destroy don't get shot i don't know where she's going but she's gonna get herself killed [Music] [Music] go go no one said anything about running when i signed my win oh just jump [Music] that's bad that's very bad we need an exit then make one well use your head i'm thinking use the thing attached to your head tracks hit this part of the wall as hard as you can why because we're about to die right [Music] come on we can escape through that drain are you nuts that's highly toxic warp drive coolant we can't just jump in there we need to keep moving maybe i wasn't clear that's a pool of instant death drax man uh everything okay yes okay so maybe it ain't warp drive cooling [Music] that's tingly well we need to talk about your kid trying to kill us raker did something to her this is his mind no the grand unifier said lichter drones into the lower halls the heretics would have yeah maybe but if we are lost at least they can't find us we're i screwed need to get my bearings i never been on a ship this big trust your instincts new one a little one guess it's better than abomination you are a silly little thing right there's good done so this is all about bringing back the debt half the people i've ever known are dead and you don't see me trying to burn the world i would raise planets for a chance to restore my camario you kinda did no that was for me you what do you mean are you a new group that omits scott what are they doing blocking our way forward so many doors you two know the way out right i do now there's gubbins you named it gubbins yup watch this he's gonna take us to the calm center there that's our exit [Music] okay we got this [Music] hey look these idiots don't see us yet no time to stand around fighting these dudes as fast as we get out go back to the safe dixie i will enjoy [Music] they're just gonna keep sending more guards keep taking them [Music] somebody's gonna have to give up their room [Music] he was [Music] [Music] his belief could now save him from death crap it's a dead end now what up there that cat walks our way out if we can get across that gap  we got a bigger problem drone's back will find us a way after that catwalk before we're extra crispy peter tell me you've got an idea here that pillar's top heavy drax push that across the gap yes no no no wrong way tracks what the skutt man doesn't [Music] well that thing really wants a piece of you too bad they're my pieces we should keep moving this doesn't look good peter [Music] whoa is this some kind of torture chamber you look peaceful death can be very peaceful it's like they're getting their lives sucked out or their faith it's like paying for nothing hey uh are you okay i might as well be back on half world some of my fellow experiments bought into this kind of scud the cree scientists told them we were chosen and they tailed snout believed it even as they were dying but you didn't i was one of the smart ones me and lila stand looking at it let's get the flark out of here i've had enough of this nightmare tell me we're close to your calm center goblin santa's biscuit he sent us to a dead end it wasn't a dead end for him actually let's just hope drax's shortcut leads us in the same direction yes a shortcut [Music] i'm gonna put a bullet in one of these [Music] do they really believe they can spread their lives to everybody out there did the galactic war teach them anything he seems to believe the lies that he creates a dangerous trait now you're speaking my language [Music] all those people stuck in their promises do they even know they're dying people will do anything for easy answers [Music] that felt good now let's see where we are [Music] rocket do your magic yeah yeah just let me do it [Music] that must be the calm relay or take it off this heap so uh how long's this gonna take i'm gonna need your help sure all right just stand right here okay perfect [Music] why are we pretending we did not witness what we witnessed in the ceremonial chamber [Music] because the promise is an insidious lie how can you be certain because i wanted to believe it but i knew when i woke up it will be gone what did you see [Music] i saw my mom in life there's something else there too shadow yeah exactly whatever it is it's using a girl probably fed her alive around about her i know she's still cool what that was completely intentional the milano's on her way all right let's split before the faith brigade realizes what we did there's the milano supposed to dock it's cute they use the word doc she doesn't have hanger clearance so we're gonna have to get creative okay just don't go overboard that's exactly what we're gonna do i found a rendezvous spot near the hall wait what relax i know where we're going [Music] this sucks and i hate it yeah [Music] peter there's a workbench we can use do it fast if you're gonna that drone's still hunting us just not now but this looks like something rocket would like [Music] [Music] better safe than sorry let's get it done all right [Music] so about my raise now let's get out of here while we still can [Music] uh we need to get through here but the stupid faith tech door ain't powered so how do we charge it gotta find something compatible with that power port maybe i can just zap it runs on faith unless your guns can squeeze out some faith juice we're screwed got a lazy death bot here his battery might still have some juice worth a try okay you just keep on sleeping buddy i'm just gonna not cool do you know what you're doing sure battery in the battery slot right will this work one way to find out hook it up looks like it worked somebody want to fetch the destroyer drax you coming man drax hello [Music] hey drax what's wrong it has occurred to me that this may be nothing more than a lingering dream it's not i promise but we need to go very well yeah that is kind of scary i've never heard any make that noise not even chitari is that singing more like distant chanting whatever it is that's a lot of people we have to go this way we need to keep pushing forward our luck's got to change i mean once you shoot your own mom in the face things have to go up from there right peter flock whatever that is it's really close [Music] [Music] we need to worry about getting our own tails off this death trap we survive and we make sure cosmo knows everything about this nightmare you'll know what to do the church comes for us flock i think we can hijack that skiff probably it'll be an ugly hack take this off people i'm surprised your gun even has safety [Music] one [Music] i can't do anything from here [Music] this is taking too long don't blame me i'm doing the best with what i got okay let's see what we can do with this gun come on come on you sure you can whoa if just one small phase battery can power one of their robots imagine the power they harness here and they're conquering planets now even this is small scale did you hear that hear what it was we're okay they're just bouncing off the field shields down blast them keep your heads down i got this [Music] what is all this fuel depot for the skips looks like [Music] [Music] why do they fight us save your animals they're trying to drop us here that one's landing what are you waiting for shoot him in the face guys huddle up [Music] this battle could be over traitor if you would leave the bludgeoning to me not my fault you're slower than my sword you're both slow 50 units as me and groot can mow them all down without you don't keep saying you're better than the rest like a dance competition where the losers failed the test those skutt plugs on the field only want to take us out so if we don't dance together this whole fight will be around who's with me feel my rock bring it on let's watch your back [Music] [Music] we don't want to be here for reinforcements we just need to find a dog's one [Music] we were here first get off people there's our ride come on a risky proposal tree there's no end to them rocky can you outrun them now we've got the same skill wrap the shield flow you gotta keep them off of us [Music] we can't stay here we're here [Music] don't be an easy target we need to focus on taking it down [Music] there has to be a way [Music] we must take it out first release the red ones or face the destroyer sick of drags [Music] [Music] it's gonna cost [Music] man [Music] what is all dead we don't want to be here for reinforcements why do they bike [Music] been too long since i blew something up these deluded souls do not know when to quit skip here you want to get onto another one of those death traps you want to stay on this one good point where's the shield i don't know it ain't working gonna have to do without it they're on us again they're trying to distract us [Music] we can't stay here lord these guys are stubborn [Music] get the flock off of my platform i think we trashed them all anyways hang on you feel that no the vibrations are different here we're getting close to the edge of the ship and our way out of here you can detect that hello whiskers [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] with he is pleasure of his madness now don't mourn him beat him okay let's keep it down there he is i'm going after raker don't follow gamora trust me peter uh-oh we got another scott ton of goans coming our way [Music] where is the assistant i believe she just ran off she knows what she's doing [Music] i know it's like they want me to keep blowing them up and i got to admit every time they go splat it paints an awfully nice picture there's no way we lose today quill we are painting the battlefield right now rocket in so many shades but if we're too excited this glove fest this dazzling euphoria it'll all disappear who's with me [Music] let's make him very well where is the assassin [Music] come on gotta be around here somewhere we got a problem uh no no problem groot you do the honors yeah what happens if gamora don't catch up once they realize we're on the milano they'll throw everything they got at us i will not leave hovat behind again hovat you mean gamora yes of course the the lethal one gamora asked me to trust her that's what i'm wow yeah we can hear it how's that thing still dogging us run go [Music] i hate everything in this go go go i only got little legs with your feet peter quill jump what job we need to keep moving forward [Music] come on everybody get in here [Music] should get here any tick now should yeah well it's the best thing to do and our window the meter is getting smaller you know they're gonna open fire as soon as they detect it yep but who knows what kind of sensors send it their way tracks [Music] [Music] throw that tracks i traveled more than his brain with that one [Music] [Music] lookout [Music] i have slain the believer don't be sad keep punching their lights out [Music] [Music] rush up tracks we can't keep out running the whole army we've got to cut them off we're going to die here i i got an idea maybe i can overload these batteries make this part of the ship go boom how big of a boom are we talking about can't wait to find out keep him busy while i rig this place here come the creeps i need time coil keeping the floor off my tail incoming why couldn't they have used one of the 242 programming languages i know i know you do hey scott yeah you put down my friend or else man that giant robot can take a lot of pain things we're taking care of it let's see those rockets how's it going don't distract me when i'm hot deep in explosives [Music] my knuckles failed to crack his metallic carabiners [Music] [Music] this one's set keep the loonies busy while i ring the next one i don't know if we can keep this up you have to me why couldn't they have used one of the 242 programming languages i know you got this i know you do [Music] when have i ever failed to blow something up do not attack but we will also be perfect [Music] good job buddy let's give him hell blast should we be shooting this close to these things good question in theory we probably won't blow up [Music] this adversary is well fortified belief in the matriarch could not save this one [Music] [Music] rocket should we be shooting this close to these things good question [Music] how much time do we have i might have overdone it oh stay together people don't pull off the edge [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] we must go back are you crazy i like killing sprees as much as the next guy but we barely got out of there alive what about gamora she made a choice so you're just gonna abandon her and nicki what if it was groot you leave him behind too oh don't talk like that that's not what this is about isn't it though we're supposed to be a team teams don't leave people behind tell that to the giant kratakin army of robots and brainwashed believers we barely got away from is that yes how'd you get back it doesn't matter i failed raker lives for now we have to go back we can't leave nikki there what he'll turn her into blah blah blah so you got step daddy issues and had a horrible childhood oh rocket what it's true guess what you ain't the only one here who had it bad it don't mean we're angling to commit suicide because some pseudo priest nut job is doing surprise nut job stuff if we go back there we're dead d-e-d dead i rather die with honor than without who crawled up her butt and died [Music] so get the flark out of dodge not yet you should try to get a hold of cosmo instead great plan only he ain't answering the passport okay but what choice do we have we don't have comms well actually we might have comps it turns out they weren't as flarked as i originally thought really groot should be able to race [Music] okay sounds like murder mom's feeling more stabby than usual hey better not slice through anything in that cargo bay we ain't restocking anytime soon harsh excuse me i ain't the one advocating to throw ourselves to the flerkins right drax yes [Music] you
