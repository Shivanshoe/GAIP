hello off-worlder i'm glad that we aren't totally forgotten by the rest of the galaxy dear please try to rest you're not ready to speak but they should know uh i mean they are very important yes that's better is there anything i can do for you i'm fine i just need to try to think clearly it's just a lingering pain from from the last attack i'll be fine i can't see any significant damage but something is clearly causing her pain please just let her rest she just needs rest you will have to forgive my wife kalantha's not in her right mind she just needs to relax and accept what's happened do you know anything about this planet just what i was told by colonial affairs it's a little different from what they claimed it it's not all bad though when the geth are gone we'll have a chance to create something even more spectacular than before i have to go please do what you can to stop the attacks you're the one who repelled that last wave they'll be back and if the geth don't kill us we'll die of hunger soon enough are you doing anything to remedy the situation i need to boost rations with varun meat but it's too dangerous the alphabet he's huge and he's mad rabid maybe totally uncontrollable i can't do anything until he's dead i have a ship i could bring in supplies from off world i'd rather you concentrated on the gaff food won't help us if they breach our defenses tell me about zoo's hope the colony is growing or it was but you should speak with phi dan he is our leader why should i speak to fiden why can't you tell me i don't want to talk about that right now speak with phi dan i have to go so long commander this work must be complete you're the commander of the ship that just landed are you the captain of this freighter not originally the captain died in one of the death rays i'm the last crew member we shouldn't even be here the solarian merchant promised us a fortune i wish i suppose it could be worse what's wrong with the ship isn't she space worthy there's too much damage maybe if the guests stopped attacking i could fix her then again if there were no death i might just stay on a while goodbye good luck out there they'll try to rebuild the command commander i was told to make my supplies available to you if you wish let me see what you have of course i may be able to provide a few interesting items nice work with those geth glad you showed up i still need the power cells for this generator though would it help if i brought in some power cells from the normandy we can certainly spare a few your top of the line ship doesn't use the same parts as the old generator we've got cells just aren't compatible if i find anything while i'm looking around i'll send it your way thank you commander i appreciate it i'll hold this position in case those things try to attack again they're still out there but at least they've been slow i'm sorry but i can't stop to talk i have to deal with the water shortage is there anything i can do the utilities building was one of the first to fall under gas control find the mains and turn them back on until then this colony is dry i have to go i will commander what can i do for you i'll talk to you when i learn more [Music] shhh oh god they're everywhere she this valve looks like part of a large system there are likely others we need to activate so [Music] so shhh you don't want to go down there what are you doing down here nothing i should be and anything i shouldn't no that was a good one very intense what's the matter with you just invoking the master's whip helps remind me i'm still alive you're here for the geth aren't you you're not the only one interested in those things who else is looking for the gift not looking for looking to get rid of there were thorn in the side of the ah trying to get to the dying [Music] [Laughter] let's go he can't help us is there anything i can do to help you do you even want help help me no no one can help me now i'd rather die fighting fighting what not that kind of fight it's like running through a thorn bush the more you struggle time's up company's coming ask phi dad ask him about the ah look out i won't i won't do can't it can't do it doesn't look like it's on yet we should keep looking so shhh [Music] so i'm a little busy here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] uh [Music] [Music] so [Music] turning this last valve [Music] commander what can i do for you i'll talk to you when i learn more [Music] hello again commander i killed the big varan the rest of yours excellent i'll organize a hunt when the immediate threat of the geth is gone i have to go here for your trouble it's not much i know but it's all we can spare nice work with those geth glad you showed up i still need the power cells for this generator though i found these power cells in the tunnels are they what you're looking for i knew they'd turn up eventually here fight and gave me some requisition money it's all yours now if i can kick these power cells into place i'll have this colony up and running in no time the water started running not long ago thanks to you i assume now we just need to deal with the gas and we can get back to growing this colony here a few credits for your trouble thank you again commander what can i do for you there's a guy living down in the tunnels is he one of yours that would be ian he's very sick he seems to be more than just sick he hasn't been the same since the attack we tried to help him but he wouldn't listen to us i can't help my people if they won't listen commander don't you have medical supplies something to help him i wish it was that simple ian was a good man i'd like to have with us please commander i'd prefer not to talk about it anymore what else can you tell me about exogeny exogeny funded this colony without them we wouldn't be stuck here they special turn for bankrolling the colony we work for them their main goal is the retrieval of valuable artifacts or resources except there isn't anything here or if there is we didn't find it i wonder if that's what the guests are looking for perhaps as she said we never found anything of value of course the gath could know something we don't i'll talk to you when i learn more good luck [Music] [Music] i don't know how much more i can take all this rubble makes good cover for snipers and now to the get face something an intelligent mind expects picking up stuart [Music] more on the top but i still can't get a pixel movement she's my daughter i'll wait as long so we've got movement some kind of vehicle not one of the guests they must be close enough to see us forget them that's close enough relax jong they're obviously not geth get back juliana who are you what do you want commander shepard i'm here to remove your death problem you see you worry too much and you trust too easily to the face i thought we were the only humans left on this planet by dan and some of the members of zoo's hope are still alive i thought you said they were all dead i said they were probably all dead they're surviving but the death really hit them hard we know what that's like those damn synthetics are relentless i'll do whatever i can to keep them away from you but i need some information what kind of information ignore him the gether up in the exogeny headquarters just a bit further along the skyway those headquarters a private property soldier remove the geth and nothing else i'm not interested in your company's secrets commander before you go my daughter elizabeth she's missing they shouldn't waste time poking around we can do a proper accounting of our casualties after the gether gun that's my daughter you're talking about she's still alive i know it where is your daughter juliana she was working in the exogeny building when the attacks came oh yeah there were several places she could hide for a short time if she's in there i'll get her out thank you commander thank you was the building used for oh yeah we repurposed that structure to serve as headquarters for exogeny that's mostly offices with a number of light duty r d labs exogeny is a master at repurposing anything and everything the company has to make a profit somehow juliana pharos is a long way from self-sufficient stay bunkered down until i find out what the guests are after of course and please remember if you see my daughter i think it's your bible i was hoping you'd have a moment to speak with me i've got a bit of a problem what do you need i need to retrieve some data it's not a big job but it pays well sounds easier now what's the catch no catch really it's dangerous work but not for someone like you why do people always assume we enjoy putting ourselves in harm's way it's not that bad really all you need to do is find my console at exogeny headquarters and drop the data onto this osd it's that simple i'll look around if i get the chance i appreciate it that data could be worth a lot of money of course this all depends on getting out of here alive tell me about the data i'm getting for you plans for a few prototype mods i'm a freelancer some of my mods are highly sought after time to get moving just keep in mind what i said so you owe us for this the skyway package is secure we're leaving now wait shut down the car we've got it coming damn it shut down the calm [Music] oh true so oh there's no point to this unless they're looking for something [Music] uh so this looks like a one-way drop commander damn it i'm so sorry i thought you were guest or one of those baron you're safe now but why were you here in the first place it's my own fault everyone else was running and i stayed to back up data next thing i knew the guest ship latched on and the power went out i was trapped i i tried to get out but the way was blocked we'll get you out as soon as we find out what the guests are after it's not the geth it's the energy field they put up they don't want anyone else getting access to the i'm here for the get it's very important i find out what they're after i don't know for certain but i'm guessing they're here for the thorium what's a thorium it's an indigenous life form exogeny was studying it what else can you tell me do you know where i can find this thorium i i might be able to but not with those guts crawling around everywhere look we need to get out of here past that field you know how we can shut it down no not exactly but i think the geths ship is powering it i've noticed the gatling power cables everywhere you can follow those cables but there's gath all over the place tell me about yourself i'm just a research assistant for exogeny i came here with my mother i don't even know if she made it out alive she's with some others from the colony she's safe for now she's alive oh thank god i thought i was the only one left please commander just get that field down so i can see my mother again tell me what you know about the thorium i really don't know that much about it i think it's some kind of plant being i know it's very old thousands of years even why do you think the geth would be interested in the thorium it's just a plant i don't know why the guest would care exogeny was studying it but i don't think they found anything special you stay put i'll go open some doors oh here take my id this should get you past any locked doors good luck with that field [Music] [Music] stupid machine access encrypted file no i don't want to review protocol i am unable to comply please contact your supervisor damn it tell me what i wander i'll blast your virtual ass into actual dust please contact your supervisor for a level 4 security exemption or make an appointment with stupid machine if there is nothing else please step aside there is a queue forming behind you for the use of this console exogeny corporation reminds all staff that the discharging of weapons while on company property is strictly forbidden welcome back research assistant elizabeth baynam what can i do for you how do you know i'm lisbon your access card identifies you as elizabeth baynam is there something you require dr baynam what information was the last user attempting to access fetching data the previous user was attempting to access details on the study of subject species 37 the thorium tell me everything you told the krogan i was unable to provide the previous user with any relevant data aside from lacking proper access there has been no new data available on species 37 all sensors monitoring the observation post at zoo's hope have been inactive for several cycles what does zoos hope have to do with authority species 37 is located within the substructure of the zoo's hope outpost tell me everything you know about the thorium the thorium is a simple plant life form that exhibits a sentient behavior uncommon with other flora through dispersion and the eventual inhalation of spores it can affect and control other organisms including humans the zoo's hope control group has yielded interesting results before sensors went offline almost 85 percent of all test subjects were infected are you saying exogeny knew its people were getting infected it was deemed necessary to assess the true potential of species 37. that's why they were acting so strange you should contact joker joker come in joker damn it that field's blocking us got to drop that shield and get back to the outpost vi what can you tell me about the guest ship and the field it's generating i have limited data on the get they have effectively blocked all sensors within the facility i have detected unusual power fluctuations but am unable to determine the source we need to find that ship let's get moving going to standby mode [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] how do we cut the power if it's coming from the ship we need a way to give it a kick let's check the other claws damn things can't be perfect this place seems almost peaceful do you think the guest we're using this room as some kind of religious temple [Music] so [Music] uh time to clean [Music] shhh here it comes i'm a little busy here this claw is identical to the last will have to keep going [Music] ship is gone so so [Music] exceptional commander the fields will be down we can go deal with this thorian creature now this was my kind of mission kill a bunch of guests and end things off with a huge crash keep your guard up there still might be a few geth inside the base i repeat normandy to shore party are you reading anyone there norm indeed a short party come on commander talk to me is that you joker what's going on over there we're in lockdown here commander something happened to the colonists they're banging on the hull trying to claw their way inside the ship they're freaking out they can't do any real damage we're on our way back just hold your position uh yeah okay well we'll just wait right here for you commander this place will be crawling with geth in a minute keep together and we'll get out of here in one piece [Music] so there you are we should get out of here i don't think this place is safe i need some answers you knew more about the thorium than you let on i i was afraid i wanted to stop the tests but they threatened me told me i'd be next when the geth attacked i stayed behind to send a message to colonial affairs i tried to tell them where to find the thorian but the power cut before i could send the message i i never meant for this to happen you did what you could i'll help them if you can tell me where to find the thorium the thorian is underneath zoo's hope but the entrance is blocked the colonists covered it with the freighter just before the geth attacked but why are the geth after the thorium what could saren want with it well it does have unique mind control capabilities that's what exergenie was interested in normandy the short party come in what is it joker we're getting a lot of geth com chatter looks like they're headed your way thanks for the heads up joker you heard the man let's move out i'm coming with you i might be able to help undo the mess i helped create so is there anybody is there anyone picking this up what was that all about this is here we go you can't do this john everyone shut up uh let me think what's going on you won't get away with this get her out of here get away from her you son of a elizabeth damn it come come out where i can see you all of you shepard damn it i knew it was too much to hope that geth would kill you i found some interesting facts about you in the exergenic database i know what you did during the blitz but your heroics aren't needed here we can talk this out nobody needs to get hurt you you don't understand it's not that easy communications are back up exergenic wants this place purged this is a human colony john you can't just repurpose us it's not just you there's something here far more valuable than a few colonists you're after the one unique thing pharos has the thorian the what it's a telepathic life form living under zoo's hope it's taking control of the colonists there exogeny knew all along you won't get away with this jong so you keep saying but nobody's gonna miss a few colonists i won't let you hurt these people anymore drop your weapon or be prepared to use it if that's the way it has to be heck come on come on as if we don't have enough problems now we're shooting each other in the back it's my fault i knew what was going on and i didn't do anything don't you start you do good work and you know it so what now commander i'll deal with the thorian then make sure you're safe the colonists won't let you near the thorian they die first they're under its control what else am i supposed to do there's got to be another way i think there is you could safely use a nerve agent to neutralize the colonists like a gas grenade releasing clouds of nerve gas doesn't seem like a particularly good idea it's not like it's weapons grade the insecticide we use in the grow labs contains trace amounts of tetraclopine a neuromuscular degenerator if their nervous systems are already weakened it may act as a paralyzing agent if we must consider it drop it in a concussion grenade sounds good i'll do what i can excellent thank you so much commander we'll stay out of your way until you've heard [Music] any luck finding my workstation out in the ruins i managed to find the data and transfer it to your osd that's very good news indeed thank you i was there anyway it was the least i could do well i appreciate it here you've certainly earned this thanks again commander shhh so what was that creature certainly wasn't human no hitting the colonists even if the thorian makes them fire on us that's what the gas grenades are for very welcome man let's go so so [Music] [Music] you've got to move one of those [Music] so there's [Music] i tried to fight it but it gets in your head you can't imagine the pain you're supposed to be their leader these people trust me it wants me to stop you but i won't i won't [Music] [Music] so all right we just need to find this creature and determine what it what this was not covered by my training that does not look like any plant i've ever seen this may be problematic [Music] invaders your every step is a transgression a thousand feelers appraise you as meat good only to dig or decompose i speak for the old growth as i did for saren you are within and before the thorian it commands that you be in awe you gave something to sarah something i need seren sought knowledge of those who are gone the old growth listened to flesh for the first time in the long cycle trades were made then cold ones began killing the flesh that would tend the next cycle flesh fairly given the old growth sees the air you push as lies it will listen no more i won't let you keep your thralls release them now no more will the thorian listen to those that scurry your lives are short but have gone on too long so definitely few more of those and it's in trouble so so [Music] so [Music] so okay so oh [Music] uh [Music] foreign so so so [Music] okay [Music] so no [Music] i'm free i i suppose i should thank you for releasing me is everything all right are you hurt i am fine or i will be in time my name is shiala i serve i served matriarch benezia when she allied herself with saren so did i benezia foresaw the influence sarin would have she joined him to guide him down a gentler path but saren is compelling vanessa lost her way are you saying saren can control minds benezia underestimated saren as i did we came to believe in his cause and his goals the strength of his influence is troubling she tried to manipulate saren but in the end her plan backfire asari matriarchs are among the most intelligent and powerful beings in the galaxy how could one fall under saren's control saren has a vessel an enormous warship unlike anything i've ever seen he calls it sovereign it can dominate the minds of his followers they become indoctrinated to saren's will the process is subtle it can take days weeks but in the end it is absolute i was a willing slave when saren brought me to this world he needed my biotics to communicate with the thorian to learn its secrets saren offered me in trade i was sacrificed to secure an alliance between saren and the thorium seren's pretty quick to betray his own people he was quick to betray the thorian too after he had what he wanted he ordered the geth to destroy all evidence of his existence saren knows you are searching for the conduit he knows you're following his steps he attacked the thorian so you could not gain the cipher what's the cipher and why did sarah need it the beacon on eden prime gave you visions but the visions are unclear confusing they were meant for a prothean mind to truly comprehend them you must think like a prothean he must understand their culture their history their very existence the thorian was here long before the protheans built this city it watched and studied them when they died it consumed them they became a part of it so the thorian taught saren to think like a prothean how the cipher is the very essence of being a prothean it cannot be described or explained it would be like describing color to a creature without eyes to understand you must have access to endemic ancestral memory a viewpoint spanning thousands of prothean generations i sensed this ancestral memory the cipher when i melded it with a thorium our identities merged our minds intertwined such knowledge cannot be taught it simply exists i need that knowledge to stop sarin there is a way i can transfer the knowledge from my mind to yours as i did with saren try to relax commander slow deep breaths let go of your physical shell reach out to grasp the threads that bind us one to another every action sends ripples across the galaxy every idea must touch another mind to live each emotion must mark another's spirit we are all connected every living being united in a single glorious existence open yourself to the universe commander embrace eternity [Music] i have given you the cipher just as it was given to saren the ancestral memories of the protheans are part of you now are you all right what just happened i saw something it still didn't make any sense you have been given a great gift the experience of an entire people it will take time for your mind to process this information we should get you back to the ship commander medical needs to know about this i'm sorry if you have suffered but there was no other way you needed the cipher in time it will help you understand the vision from the beacon i want to know more about you there is nothing remarkable about me i was merely one of matriarch benezia's disciples for nearly two centuries i followed her learning at her feet when benezia revealed her plan to join saren she gave her disciples a choice only those who were willing had to follow her many felt her plan was too dangerous but i believed in her i thought she could turn saren away from his insanity instead we joined him in it what else can you tell me about saren there is little i could tell you that you do not already know he's powerful he's charismatic and he's dangerous once i followed him blind to his true nature but now i see he's leading the galaxy into an age of darkness and suffering now that you're free of the thorian what are you planning to do next if you allow it i would like to stay here with the colonists they have suffered greatly and i played a role in their suffering i would like to make amends the colonists will need all the help they can get they'll be happy to have you on their side thank you commander may fortune smile upon you you did it with the thorian gone we can start rebuilding for ourselves again and we're free of exogenesis threats we're back to being just a little nowhere colony thank you commander thank you for freeing us [Music] hmm stand standby shore party decontamination in progress commander you look pale are you suffering any ill effects from the cipher the cipher shook me up a bit i might be able to help you i am an expert on the protheans if i join my consciousness to yours maybe we can make some sense of it do it hurry we don't have much time relax commander embrace eternity that was incredible all this time all my research yet i i never dreamed i am sorry the images were so vivid i never imagined the experience would be so intense you are remarkably strong-willed commander what you have been through what you have seen would have destroyed a lesser mind come on get to the point what did you see the beacon on eden prime must have been badly damaged large parts of the vision are are missing the data transferred into the commander's mind is incomplete you must have seen something i was able to interpret the data relayed through your vision what was there at least but something was missing saren must have the missing information maybe he found another beacon if we can find the missing data from your vision i can again oh i am sorry the joining is exhausting i should go to the medical bay and lie down for a moment doctor chakwa should take a look at you that will not be necessary i just need some rest somewhere quiet we're done here dismissed i've sent off the pharos report commander you want me to patch you through to the council patch him through joker setting up the link now commander commander exogenous should have told us about the thorium it would have made your job much easier you might have been able to capture it for study instead of destroying it the thorian liked to enslave minds anyone who studied it would have ended up as one of its thralls perhaps it's for the best then at least the colony was saved of course it was saved shepard would go to any lengths to help a human colony being human had nothing to do with it they were in trouble admirable but sometimes spectres have to make sacrifices i hope you're willing to do that when the time comes goodbye commander we will be waiting for your next report miss williams commander we need to talk if we do not resolve this situation now i am afraid things might become awkward oh awkward huh i hope we can keep this civilized i do not want things to become unpleasant because it's been so pleasant between us lately look somebody in this room needs to make a choice it ain't me and it ain't you maybe we should try to work this out i think we must i may not know much about human relationships but i understand the concept of jealousy jealous of you you're not even our species perhaps that is why you feel threatened i am a rival unlike any you have faced before hostility is a common reaction to the unfamiliar doctor you keep smart-assing me i'll show you what my hostile reaction is like both of you settle down we can handle this like mature adults this is stupid you're not married shepard you want to get involved with some alien go ahead it's none of my business i never meant for you to get hurt but liara's the one i really care about hey we're all grown-ups here right hope you two will be happy together if you don't mind i need to clean my gear i feel bad for her shepard i hope she'll be okay i'll go talk with her in a while give her a chance to cool down i suppose you're right i'm sorry you were put in this position but i'm glad you chose me i don't believe we should continue this discussion here in the calm room shepard you know where to find me if you want to have a more private conversation shhh i get the feeling you want to ask me something commander i like talking with you liara no matter what the subject you have been very understanding with me shepard very patient i appreciate that i know there are some strange beliefs about my people i am familiar with the legend of a sorry promiscuity but those rumors have little basis in fact when one of my people joins with an individual from another species it is a very deep and spiritual exchange we do not enter lightly into a union you make it sound almost mystical a true union goes far beyond an ordinary melding it is a connection that transcends the physical universe two become one thoughts and senses merge identities intertwine memories and emotions weave themselves together becoming entangled in a single rapturous hole it is unlike any other experience in some cases it can be a truly life-changing event it sounds amazing are you saying no oh no uh i am not very good at this am i i'm sorry shepard i am trying to explain why i have been so reserved the union is more than just sex it is the lifeblood of my species the way we asari evolve and grow as a society that is why i have never uh i mean that is why we must choose our partners with great care i want you to be absolutely sure about this liara i am only 106. barely an adult by asari standards and i spend most of my time absorbed in my research i never really thought about it not until i met you you are very special to me shepard but with all that's happened sarin the geth the reapers i do not know if we are ready for this i'm ready if you are eager is not the same as ready shepard there is too much at stake we need to put aside our personal feelings and focus on stopping saren i wish it did not have to be that way but we all have to make sacrifices let's let's talk about something else i should go goodbye shepard commander good to see you you've been with c-sec a while have you seen much action well not as much as you but yeah i've seen some interesting things i'll bet you have anything in particular that stands out i remember this solarian geneticist i was sent to investigate that case was a bit disturbing what happened why were you investigating them i was tasked with tracking black market trade on the citadel most of it harmless nothing i needed to pursue but during the course of my investigation i noticed an increase in the trade of body parts organs mostly we usually get a few of those but not the numbers i will see we weren't sure if there was a new black market lab or if some freak was harvesting organs from citizens you've seen this before on the citadel every so often some lab sells unwanted parts through the black market but they're not as bad as the cycles i remember this one elkhorn diplomat we caught in my first year on the job he was hacking people up and selling their organs and the station in a bit of a panic but this case wasn't that clear cut turns out there was more going on than we first realized so how did you figure out what was happening first we got a hold of a sample and ran dna tests the weird thing was the match led us to a turian who was still alive and was very convinced he'd never lost his liver after a bit of digging i discovered this turian worked briefly for dr saleon the geneticist so he went to his lab hoping to find evidence of cloned organ development but there was nothing no salarian hearts no turian livers not one krogan testicle you're kidding right why would anyone want krogan testicles some krogan believe that testicle transplants can increase their virility counteract the effects of the genophage it doesn't work but that doesn't stop them from buying they'll pay up to 10 000 credits each that's 40 000 for a full set somebody's making a killing out there what did you do about the geneticist i brought in some of his employees for interrogation to see if i could get them to talk while i was interviewing one of them i came across something suspicious you mean threatened was that really necessary maybe maybe not either way it paid off one of my detainees started bleeding profusely during the interview we offered to patch him up and he got frantic freaked out i ordered a full exam to find out what was going on our medics found incisions all over his body some of them fresh that was a big break these people weren't just dr saleon's employees they were test tubes walking living test tubes he was growing parts inside these people exactly they cloned their organs right inside their own bodies then he harvested them and sold them off most of the victims were poor you'd pay them each a small percentage of the sales but only if the organs were good sometimes morgan wouldn't grow properly so he'd just leave it in them most of them are a mess but only on the inside hidden so nobody could see it i hope he got what he deserved that's the worst part we never caught him why not what the hell happened he ran blew his lab grabbed some of his employees and headed for the nearest space dock by the time i found out his ship was already leaving he threatened to kill his hostages if you tried to stop him but you went after him anyway right i ordered citadel defense to shoot him down but c-sec headquarters countermanded my order they were worried about the hostages worried about civilian casualties if the ship was destroyed so close to the citadel i told them those hostages were dead anyway we just used them to make more organs but they wouldn't listen no you can't get them all no but letting him get away like that all they had to do was disable that ship stop him from running maybe the hostages die maybe they don't but at least we stop the bastard responsible for it all a few casualties is a small price to pay to stop someone like that yeah exactly i mean those hostages might be wishing they'd died by now anyway just wish i could have stopped him that's all do you have any idea what happened to dr saleon i sent out feelers from time to time hoping to find something i thought i'd found him a while back he changed ships and changed his name to dr hart his idea of a joke i guess i told the military but they weren't convinced it was him i got the transponder frequency for his new ship but i just can't get anyone to check it out i'll check out the coordinates when i get a chance i was hoping you'd say that but commander take me with you when you go if it's a leon i want to be there when you find him commander do you have a few minutes to talk one on one i'm off duty until tomorrow i was gonna have a small drink bit of a celebration if you're interested what's the occasion it's armistice day when the first contact war ended my family always marks it since i'm the only williams aboard i thought i'd ask you you can't think i'm the most patriotic person on the ship nah you just happened by at the right time don't tell me you don't know about my family my commanders always find out it's not my files or something i don't know what you're talking about i'm general williams granddaughter the commander of the shanshi garrison in the war the only human ever to surrender to an alien race i see that's why you drive yourself so hard a williams has to be better than the best if only to avoid suspicion that's what my dad told me the night before he retired takes a special kind of big headed to march into a job where your family's blacklisted i did it anyway i'm not gonna let our name go down with arnold and quizling granddad deserved better than that sometimes you have to fight to the bitter end you plan to bail if saren gets the upper hand no sir i die to stop him if that's what it takes him and anyone else who tries to screw with the alliance so now you know gonna kick me off the ship skipper you're a valuable part of my crew williams if i want an opinion from the head i go to alenka when i want one from the heart i go to you [Music] i also play a mean game of pool but anyway i've got things to do before we land i'm sure you do too dismiss chief sir what do you want shepard why did you become a mercenary lots of reasons such as such as i needed to get out of our system i needed to eat i needed to survive why not stay and help your people i tried to help that's why i had to leave what happened i was betrayed i was head of a small tribe we were trying to restore order after the war but the other tribes were against us they followed jared one of the few warlords who survived the war with the turians but he was old and so were his ideas he wanted to continue the war he wanted us to fight turians salarians each other it didn't matter who as long as we were fighting what did you want i just wanted jared to shut up to stop his ranting i wanted him to stop leading the tribes astray but he couldn't understand how much things had changed we didn't have the numbers to go to war even if we did the genophage made sure we couldn't replenish our numbers fast enough i told them all to forget about war we needed to focus on breeding at least for one generation and for a while we were getting through some of the tribes started coming around i take it the warlord didn't appreciate that no he didn't he arranged a crush with the tribes a meeting on neutral ground he wanted to talk we met at the hollows near the graves of our ancestors the skulls of our dead lay bare to remind us where we come from and where we all go it's as sacred as any krogan place can be violence is forbidden it sounds like a trap to me you must have suspected as much i did but when your father invites you to a crush well there are some laws that even we hold sacred jared was your father he was until that day we talked but we didn't get anywhere when it was clear that i wouldn't join him he gave this signal his men leapt from the graves of our ancestors like crooked undead the few that were loyal to me died quickly i escaped with my life but not before i sank my dagger deep into my father's chest that is why i left and that's why i'll never go back so long rex shepard oh hello shepherd are you okay i don't know your ship is amazing and your crew's been really great to me especially your chief engineer but i just sort of feel out of place the normandy runs so smooth it feels like we're not even moving and the engines are so quiet how do you sleep at night the silence wakes you up back on the flotilla the last thing you want to hear is silence it means an engine's died or an air filter shut down i guess you don't have to worry about that here but old habits die hard but it's more than just a silence this ship feels so empty it's like half the crew is missing back home i couldn't wait to go on my pilgrimage i couldn't wait to get away from the crowds now that i'm out here i kind of miss them sometimes we don't appreciate what we have until it's gone that's true i'm starting to wonder if that's what the pilgrimage is really about it's given me a whole new perspective on my people and our culture you know there's always a few who go on their pilgrimages and never return i always assumed something bad happened to them but maybe they just wanted a different life you do plan to return to the migrant fleet right i could never abandon my people shepard i will go back eventually but we have to stop sarin first otherwise i might not have a home to go back to i should go see you later looking for supplies let's see what you've got you bet anything you need commander what's your opinion on the last mission i'm glad there aren't many aliens like the thorian i don't think my stomach could take it one of my cousins has an agribusiness i was thinking of calling him maybe he can get some shipments into pharaohs i mean now that they're cut off from the company just trying to get a sense of where the crew's at i didn't figure you'd have time to talk with all that's going on there's got to be some xenobiologists who want to read about the thorium the paperwork will keep something on your mind i'm just looking for an ear that a briefing wasn't the right place to say how ridiculous this is seems like every other race in the galaxy is wrapped up in their own problems they don't want to see what's coming wanting to believe everything will be fine it sounds like human nature to me yeah i guess some things carry across species well enough i should remember that after what happened with furnace i think you'd carry a grudge over the crap you took from vernus before i met vernus i knew as much as any other civilian aliens were weird superior and tried to tell us what to do i mean it's only been 26 years since first contact that's not a lot of time to understand them it was vernis who made me see how human aliens are they're not different or special they're jerks and saints just like us hell by the time i got payback i didn't even want it anymore i don't see you snapping very easily what finally did it he heard rana broke her arm she reached for a glass of water instead of pulling it biotically she just wanted a drink without getting a nosebleed you know like an idiot i stood up didn't know what i was gonna do just something and vernis lost it beat the crap out of him he kept shouting how they should have bombed us back to the stone age that's when the knife came up a military issue talon right in my face when cut loose full biotic kick right in the teeth almost as strong as i can manage now at 17 that's something you wanted to help a girl you cared for that's a noble thing maybe my intentions were noble but i i lost control i killed him shepard snapped his neck they probably could have saved him if they got him to an infirmary quick enough but they didn't caused a stir when they shipped him home bot training was shut down kinetics folded a couple of years later so yeah maybe i hated that tyrion i mean if one ass was enough to judge a whole race i'd hate humans too a reasonable stance keep that level head and we'll do fine staying reasonable is about all we've got left everyone else in this galaxy seems to have gone out of their minds present company accepted of course [Music] uh so thank you thank you for saving me from those things commander that's him that's dr saleon what my name is hart dr hart please get me out of here are you sure it's him positive there's no escape this time doctor i'd harvest your organs first but we don't have the time you're crazy he's crazy please don't let him do this to me we'll take him in drop him off with the military but we have him we can't let him get away not again if he dies we'll never know what he's been up to or how he did it we'll take him in interrogate him and he'll serve his time i've okay you're right you're a very lucky salarian you owe the commander your life oh thank you so very much and so he dies anyway what was the point of that you can't predict how people will act garrus but you can control how you'll respond in the end that's what really matters yeah i don't think i ever met anyone like you commander well i guess we're done here [Music] [Music] so tell me who'd win in a fight between you and shepard that question smacks of impertinence commander shepard is a specter with a distinguished service record so saren think about it got an idea and i wanted to run it by you i've got a lot going on right now but i can spare a moment great this will just take a minute with so many human colonies being attacked i'm not sure that one specter is enough what if you signed me on as another spectre conrad i don't think that's a good idea but i'd make a great spectre i'd be right there with you showing the council what humanity is capable of i want to be with you fighting the good fight like you did on elysium during the skillion blitz i believe you conrad but there's another fight that needs you what i i don't understand you know what keeps me going out here knowing that people back home are keeping humanity strong you you're right i just got so caught up in all of it i wanted to help i'll go home thanks for setting me straight [Music] you
