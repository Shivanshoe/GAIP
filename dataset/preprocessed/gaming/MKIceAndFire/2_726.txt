you're full of [ __ ] got it uh no no how's that any different from some dull house ass cause the ass is meat not latex that's so hard to understand meat right no feeling going on no thinking no awareness it's empty might as well be latex masturbation sophisticated kind that's all it is oh [ __ ] makes perfect sense that so welcome to clouds where we know what you're looking for would you care to jack it to the terminal looking for evelyn parker she work here hmm give me a moment evelyn's not available at this time need to see her it's important the algorithm knows best trust me it will choose a doll that will thrill you our dolls can change their hair and eye color in real time to look just as you wish i'm not a customer well all the more reason to be excited there's a first time for everyone at clouds it's no reason to dawdle all you need to do is jack in we'll create your personal profile and you'll be good to go huh i'm sorry did she finally say anything useful [ __ ] the menu let's ditch this waitress and take our special order to the chef point blank meaning meaning you go in as a customer keep a low profile they want to keep their cards close fine we'll play our own game how could you possibly know what i'm looking for clouds always knows your deepest desire we find it you'll have your needs fulfilled and maybe much more less is not a word we use around here so how's this all work an algorithm pilots the doll's motor functions it takes your profile data and transforms into experiences in real time memory dampers on the doll's behavioral chip block any recall of the session so there'll be no trace of the meeting well i could say yes but that would strip it of mystery and suspense wouldn't it once you're in there you set the stakes you're saying it's not dangerous but there's some risk involved that is one way to put it one thing is for sure you never get what you expect consider my interest peaked all right let's do this this will be a live session so events may take an unexpected turn but don't quit if you feel uncomfortable you could miss out on something truly remarkable if you feel unready to handle what comes next you can interrupt the session immediately now for your safe word samurai and saved now bear with me a moment scanning your personal profile you should see compatible dolls in just a second two matches interesting is that normal or who can say what is normal you're clearly a unique person with unique tastes our system can handle it so who will it be angel or sky rather go with sky i couldn't have chosen better myself now for the payment and you'll venture into the clouds not here to pay and play just want some info ah unfortunately that we do not sell should you change your mind come back all right i changed my mind i'll pay temptation is often too strong to resist please jack in there you go and the payments come through the entire floor is open to you if you wish to wind down first skye awaits

how'd you know i'm dying deep inside you fear this cower before it so what if i do why do you care of all the voices in your head the loudest is that calling for help look around all of this is your doing there's something in those mirrors way back it's a projection your inner landscape just what i needed therapy with a robo-hooker i'm not here to analyze you that's not something i do i'm here to fulfill your deepest most hidden desire looking for someone named evelyn parker used to work here nowhere know where she is you need answers that's clear just not the ones you think you need i asked you a simple question evelyn parker not the most important thing you're looking for is she i can smell your fear you're afraid of something else you're just gonna talk in circles that it i can't help you if you don't want to be helped what's next meditation something like that try me just answer my question tell me where evelyn is don't have time for a debate why the manager say she doesn't work here anymore when was evelyn last here you know anything evelyn had her own story before it collided with yours but i know you'll find her you always get your way i stole this place to fulfill my deepest desires not what i was expecting this when true desires go unfulfilled they turn into needs we are here to reach for them and beyond we are here to understand so what is it i need so badly to come to terms with the fact that you died now move on already that's tough rather let it eat away at me a bit more fear of death is what drives us all to do what we do you're scared because you've given up on your dreams what happened to becoming the best in all of night city still want to be the best never gave up on that goal chances of getting there is starting to look pretty slim though i just want the world to know that i was here that i mattered instead of a dream you're living a nightmare you're afraid of being erased as if you never existed or is it just the fear of becoming someone else different death is death is death you're gone game over you can't know that for certain even if you've been there and back believe me i've seen it and it's [ __ ] boring you haven't stopped grieving since or for what's to come what i've been through tough to move on from that death was something that happened to other people hell that i dealt to others now my number will be up wasn't enough i died once i have to go and do it again death's absurdity the futile struggle before these terrify you so what now you find out what it is you need to do which is you're gonna tell me you've never backed down from anything in your life even when you may be should have you go through night city knowing a stray bullet could end you while hailing a cab but that's never stopped you from taking action going where you needed to go and it won't stop you now but how do i keep up with everything that's changing you have been keeping up you've made an impact not a single thing in this world isn't in the process of becoming something else likewise you never look back if you got a kill kill if you've gotta burn it all to the ground then let it burn thanks so for all this geez don't even feel like getting up if you do but everything has its end samurai oh what's going on goddamn thing threw me out i need to talk to you talk you pulled the emergency brake ripped me out just to

try to rearrange no you gotta help me please i'm no threat but she could be in trouble just want to talk to her find out if she's okay in case you haven't noticed doll works not the most secure job in the world one day you're in the next you're out and maybe gone anything out of the ordinary happened here lately fine heard a customer did a number on her but that's all i know [ __ ] like that happens around here way more often than anybody care to admit you ought to ask tom two of them were inseparable gossiping for hours on end the customer attacked her i guess i don't know real mess that

the ass what do you think cyberpsychosis sounds crazy but she could have been remotely hacked the netrunner weird this not bad but it would be much better real i would eat those thighs what do you mean real she's all ones and zeros do you mean i can ask her to do anything literally anything ask it's not about asking man just gotta be programmed as establishments [ __ ] sideways go this one takes the whole damn pie hear that at least i would hear no laments about pain it hurts it hurts it's a hologram what's so hard to get let me have my fantasy not like you know how to hack it so why

oslo uh oslo yeah definitely oslo that accident involved the client did it found blood in her booth uh you know [ __ ] like that happens here sometimes and everyone's cool with that we get new implants recovery leave and well sometimes even a bail now that i think about it it is weird she went away so far tell you herself she was skipping town nah just didn't show up for work wasn't picking up either so i asked woodman what was up told me she left like i said where can i find this woodman probably got his feet up in the back office except it's off limits to customers woodman who is he mr
