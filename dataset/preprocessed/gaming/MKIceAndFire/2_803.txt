here no moment like the present thank you craig never mind we're good let's get started look around and familiarize yourself with the items i'll be waiting by the baku statue when you're ready to begin can do fist cut peter opened like a pork sausage with this the first time they fought pete got away collapsed in my yard half dead and i had to steal my dad's car to drive him to the er the first of many nurse mj moments too many i remember when fisk started illegally importing artifacts like this he bought the local harbor to cover his tracks and laid off the old staff including my dad i wish dad was here now to see how the tables have turned hmm simcaria weren't they just in the news sometimes i feel like the whole history of the world is just boys playing dress-up getting into fights i can't get over this image so much tension between these two figures kyoto so beautiful part of me wishes i could drop everything and travel the world but life and work are here let me know when you're ready to begin sounds good starting with the prize a one-of-a-kind kakemon baku beautiful it's a mifune correct mr fisk has exceptional taste did you know him well before his arrest in a professional context i handled many of his sales let's move on please so now this exquisite piece exemplifies the traditional tarashikomi puddled ink effect the two neo are so imposing i can see why fisk liked this piece definitely his style he loved the duality destruction screams but creation toils in silence was there ever anything irregular in any of the sales you handled for him no no of of course not not that i was aware of notice the intricate gold inlay on this ceremonial tea set it's just a friend in the da's office mentioned that fisk used art sales to launder stolen goods i'm sure i wouldn't know anything about that oh i know i was just wondering now that he's arrested if you had ever noticed anything strange you know what i'm actually running short of time why don't we grab the cover photo while we can when i told my da friend i was doing a piece on you he mentioned your name was familiar just the photo please stand right there are you sure there's nothing you'd like to say maybe off the record regarding fisk's activities i don't think your readers would have any interest in damn it wait here please wait i recognize that statue god i got it craig i'll call you back my dear i think it's time for you to go oh um could i use the restroom real quick fine follow me thank you this this is a really lovely space it is and this will be the last time you see it the ladies is around the corner be quick of course be right back hello craig funny you should call because the reporter you sent is clearly not working the puff piece we agreed upon no she's here now i've got to get into that back room if that statue is what i think it is this just turned into a huge story what do you mean he had to reschedule quiet if she's not your reporter who is she craig who is in my auction house oh my god no i do not trust you to fix this well the first thing i'm going to do is have miss investigative journalists arrested and the second thing i'm going to do is pete told me about this fisk used it to hide evidence why didn't the cops take it i know this statue opens but how that's the neo behind them but it looks different statue can move most common pose is latent power mouth closed left arm down right palm facing forward hmm he's holding something maybe these pieces move nice so close but a piece is missing i've seen these before that's it norman osborne what is this devil's breath what is devil's what the excuse me sir you you can't be not good where's the statue in in there by one jen's else who lie i was on my way to the exit when i saw you you're lucky to be alive this is the guy i saved five minutes ago listen whoever these masked guys are they're after this vial but i'll never get it out of here while the place is swarming with them right okay um you hide back there i take out the bad guys you make a break when it's clear sounds like a plan good to see you pete yeah you too not exactly how i pictured us meeting again though honey that's exactly how i pictured it did she change her perfume focus pete focus yes all right of course should clear these guys out before i push forward because how about that file what's in it that these guys want so bad notes on something called devil's breath fisk was hired to build a secret research lab for it not clear what devil's breath is but it seemed to scare fisk he compares it to pandora's box not much shook fisk we need to get you and that file out of here hang tight there we go [Music] where is it [Music] no let me go m.j stop no hide [Music] not cool with the hostage taken guys what is up with that glowy stuff on your hands are you guys ghosts before i mean i've fought spectres but you know technically spectres aren't ghosts all ghosts are specters but not all specters are ghosts you know what i mean seems like this is an energy thing not a ghost thing [Music] yes [Music] that was a workout huh looks antique i think i know someone who could help track down where this came from a job for later i just talked to craig you are not the reporter he was sending you don't even work for heritage arts never said i did hi mary jane watson daily bugle you you will not write a word of what you saw the record what do you know about the file those masked men stole that i don't what about the long history of stolen goods fisk has laundered at this auction house your editor will be hearing from our attorney like the last six months never happened since when did mix become italian no idea but i'm still glad he makes these fries totally best in city so how's the grind at the bugle well yeah well i just got an all-caps text from robbie about my so-called antics tonight so it looks like i'll be meeting with a legal team again uh as soon as he reads the article you're gonna write guaranteed promotion so you'd be masked guys what's your take just another night in the city it's your take i feel like there's a bigger story there let's not make this all about business how's how's it going with you did did you get that promotion no but we're on the cusp of something really big you know ozcorp would hire you in a heartbeat right one phone call to him sure but dr octavius's work will help millions i'm right where i want to be right where i should be almost sounds like it's more important than your other job i've never heard you talk like that before a lot can change in six months why did you ask me here pete you know just uh just dinner between friends friends was that what we are well maybe we could be you know if that's what you wanted there's a lot of baggage here yeah sure but is that so bad i mean baggage can carry good things too like uh like money and keys raspberry lip balm do you remember why we broke up this is a trick question isn't it saved by the siren talk to you later go [Music] love seeing you two together again you always were my favorites [Music] hey it's me what's with the units heading down third looks like our old friend herman schultz is at it again shocker did you just get paroled yeah well i guess it didn't take no worries herman's just a big cupcake i'll have him back in rikers by bedtime [Music] just had dinner with my ex after saving her from mass criminals and now i'm gonna go beat up a maniac who uses shock waves to rob people what a perfectly normal life you have peter parker [Music] so [Music] peter i just want to make sure you haven't left any equipment you've built for your friend around the lab it's no bother to me but if the grant committee stops by again don't worry doc i make a point not to leave anything there but i know my friend appreciates you looking out for him there's a lot of people who don't like him very much that buffoon jameson and his audience of sheep please the people who do great things in this world are those who don't let bullies like him stand in their way people like us you said a mouthful doc take care pursuit in progress backup requested incident is active near grand central

emotional level wait i forgot you don't have emotions come on herman at least talk to me so we can make it interesting herman what do you gotcha now let's talk [Music] honestly herman why are you robbing again you know the police are watching your every move i mean we all know you're kind of dumb but i didn't think you were this dumb you must be desperate which means you're not just feeling for yourself must be working with someone or for someone you can tell me who it is uh you know what herman that's like zero personality but your suit is awesome can we talk design details [Music] maybe later good work spider-man did you learn anything about his motive i tried but he's not very talkative plus i think he hates me you have that effect on a lot of people but you love me right yuri

up on the news looks like you had quite an adventure with shocker tonight yeah he was unusually combative anyway thanks again for dinner what do i owe you how about a favor you still have that mask from the gallery yeah i'm actually on my way to the feast center now to ask martin lee about it martin lee why he has a degree in art history if anyone knows about the origins of that mask he will just keep me in the loop like i said i think there's a bigger story here and i plan to be the one to break it up sure so i can call you like whenever yeah whenever whatever i guess we're talking again almost morning mr lee will be here soon i could use a snack mr lee's usually in his office to now of multiple active shooters peter what can i do for you i'm sorry to bother you mr lee i have a friend mary jane she's a reporter she's doing a story on art imports and she found this piece well she wanted an expert opinion on it and i know you have a degree and this might be the first time i actually get to use it let's see what you have interesting where'd she find it i'm really not sure why what is it a replica of an antique chinese opera mask i haven't seen one in years this symbol here roughly translates to demon demon well my father read me ghost stories with that mask and symbol in it when i was young scared the hell out of me peter listen that mask it's it could be connected to dangerous people mary jane might want to find a different story do you think she's in trouble i don't know why i take the risk hey the symbol inside the mask means demon it really spooked mr lee never seen him like that he even said you should drop the story fat chance do you think mr lee knows more than he's letting on no i think he just had a weird flashback or something i know his childhood was pretty

i totally forgot i mean i mean i didn't forget forget i just i'll be there soon his tardiness is starting to become a pattern come on parker you're better than this ah that's right how did i lose track of time so attention unit armed robbery in progress location is hudson town 1080 vehicle pursuit is currently in progress please proceed to chelsea asap spider-man the situation's under control how does it work just like a natural arm you think of what you want it to do and [Music] yes hey hey what do you think you're doing this site's been declared a safety hazard [Music] stop that right now this is highly sensitive equipment that's it i'm calling the mayor's office directly peter parker how the hell are you speak of the devil mr osborne oh please how long have we known each other it's mr mayor it's norman norman norman what do you think you're doing the grant agreement you signed has strict safety provisions this isn't your first violation those were excused by me we should have confiscated this equipment long ago but but i've had a breakthrough thank you for your great service to our country these folks will escort you to oscorp robotics where you'll receive the latest in prosthetics no charge this isn't about safety infractions is it i'm trying to help you otto you're free to continue your work in a secure environment at oz corp you always were the smartest guy in the room you haven't changed a bit neither of you hey peter harry will be coming back from europe early next year maybe the two of you can start that business you always talked about this is opportunity knocking [Music] he's easy easy they didn't take everything maybe we could start over peter there's no we without the grant from the city i can no longer pay you i need some time to think if i were you i'd look for a new job i wish i could do something to help doc maybe call harry ask him to talk to his dad no norman never listens to harry even tried to kill funding for his research stations hey one of those stations is nearby should see how they're doing while harry's in europe there must be some way to help doc i'll think of something harry left me a message about these before he left for europe pete hey i need a favor my mom's pet project was research stations that could benefit the public now i launched them but now that i'm away oscorp's gonna shut them down unless they prove their value i was hoping you could watch them i left details in each one thanks man as long as they're here it's like a part of my mom is too well it's not gonna pay the bills but it sounds like it means a lot to him i'll do what i can to help got a couple stations measuring air pollution the idea is to catch the um what's the word contaminants before they reach toxic levels between you and me i think oscorp wants this to fail because it might show they're polluting the amount of polycyclic hydrocarbons in the air is way too high and rising if it keeps getting worse people could die particles are concentrating in trouble spots like mini clouds of smog i'll swing through them and get samples then trace them to the source nasty as they are i gotta swing right through those clouds so for these clouds to be visible to the naked eye the level of toxins must be up there and gotcha i'm getting some good stuff well it's good samples of bad stuff anyway got it feels like i'm breathing from a tailpipe i must be freaking these people out what else is new huh the toxins coming from two types of cars and a faulty smoke stack i better get photos perfect great light on that one best smokestack picture i ever took the department of environmental protection will take it from here maybe i should make a green spider costume for earth day well harry station just stopped the

fisks or the demon's hands snipers everywhere might need to deal with them first i heard a lot of junk scattered around here a well-placed web shot could make a great distraction that sniper has a guard watching him i need to divide and conquer a dozen different owners before him dope smugglers in the 80s runners back in the 20s you two cut the chatter we're here to work anyone sleep it you

feel like i'm in a horror movie hello any fisherman with a grudge and a hook for a hand jeff you there i'm doing my best to refrain from knock knock jokes appreciate it you see a junction box powering the door yeah got it if we can overload it that should force the door open smart but i don't have anything that packs enough current try this stun gun genius capacitors in this are just what i need for an upgrade i've been thinking of electric web for the wind a gadget man huh you remind me of my son started taking apart the tv when he was five now he's unlocking his friend's phones sounds like

would have found it without you [Music] hmm i got a big fat nothing well there's one secret room that could be more notice anything about the floor they can hide the doors but not the scrapes they leave keep an eye out for more of those found a scrape oh i guess normal doors don't count huh good guess now that i know i'm after scrapes i should take another look around hey dirt scrape no door none i can see anyway great be right there maybe not elevators busted sit tight i'll pull you up second floor rusted machine parts big honking rats careful the bridge is out i got this one nice stuck the landing and everything we're not all donut eaters fair enough another secret door i'll rig the lock let me know if you find the junction box yep on it found one nailed it hey check this out nothing i'm starting to feel like this is fisk's way of messing with me but look at the walls they kept guns here they wouldn't have moved them to the front door got to be a passageway we're missing check out the wall this might control access to another area fisk's men we're talking about a vault maybe we're close bet on it looks like a dual circuit see if we can find a second junction box i found it clear you were right jeff trap door outstanding think you can help me out this thing's heavy one two three well that isn't spooky at all probably an old bootleggers tunnel and it looks like no one's cleaned it since al capone [Music] big chunk of concrete in the way i can't get through let me see how it looks from the top room to maneuver here hang on what was that subway maybe let's hustle the place is unstable okay that definitely wasn't a subway no sounded like explosives and that sounds like demons the vault hurry come on let's go damn demons are already gone how'd they beat

and is expected to make a full recovery excuse me miss are you supposed to be here more than you after that auction house thing the bugle put me on the city beat which means i get to focus full-time on real stories like this and the demons you know the closer you get to them the more you become a target right the closer i get the better chance we have to stop them we officer davis mary jane watson daily bugle no comment i don't blame you but these guys are gonna tell their story with or without you and they thrive on controversy so what's hearing i don't have one i just listen okay hop

center last year you think he's hiding out there maybe we know he's not at feast if he's not at the recycling center maybe you'll find some evidence as to where he might be yeah good work mj i'll let you know what i find oh one more thing i talked to the detective about questioning the arrested demons they're all claiming martin lee has the power to quote corrupt people corrupt what does that mean they say it's sort of like mind control it brings out the negative part of you it makes you do things you wouldn't normally do huh sounds a little far-fetched this is coming from a guy who can run up walls [Music] mj's hunch was right police is crawling with demons gotta take these guys out then have a look around [Music] [Music] okay that's all of them high security lock they use these on banks not recycling centers maybe if i can find where it gets its power from this must get powered up somewhere huh they've been working on their power systems looks like i could override the circuit i need my electric well website did something looks like the circuits need a little more juice there looks like the circuit's still stable maybe there's another junction box close by gotcha almost there one more box should do it that's it [Music] oh man lots of high-tech equipment maybe later i can recycle this stuff into some weapons of my own these must be where they're planning to attack wait these are osborne campaign offices all the paths originate from the same address guns from fisk's armory truck bombs this is crazy explosives from fisk's construction site this wasn't a gang war the demons were stealing from fisk to go after mayor osborne hey did you find lee no but you were right lee's using this place as a front for the demons bomb making gun running oh my god and it looks like they're planning another attack this time on norman osborn's campaign offices we must have some kind of beef with norman osborn i found an address here i think it's their staging area if i hurry i might be able to stop them be careful yuri it's me make it quick i'm busy getting yelled at by my boss martin lee and the demons are planning another attack this time on norman osborn's campaign offices are you sure we've had a lot of false leads in the past week trust me on this one i'm sending you the address of a recycling center you'll find all the evidence there got it i'll get those campaign offices evacuated but if you're wrong about this you're gonna help me find a new job up uh [Music] so consolidated shipping a lot of guys i should try to do this quietly but also with style i

gotten more aggressive post fisk missed another call from doc peter i wanted to make sure you're still available but i've pulled enough strings to keep the wolves from the door a bit longer if we can get up and running i know this new version of the project will attract investment massive investment stay ready fingers triple crossed doc leave us huh fisk did keep these wannabe pushers in check peter so if you're running this place while mr lee's out of town who's doing your old job me but i could always use more help you know anyone actually i do his name is miles morales why does that

number is in mr lee's office which is inaccessible i will call you back as soon as i can get that information that room i saw from the crawl space it should be right on the other side of the shrine lee's journal a key i wonder where the lock is lee sounds conflicted almost like he didn't want to head down this path looks like this note is for me hmm some kind of puzzle lock that seems right oh i see yes whoa what are you hiding lee lee sure is obsessed with masks is it a jungian thing like he needed to pretend to be someone else to let his darkest feelings out pretended to be a demon until he became one this is all about norman osborn his whole career lee must have been obsessed with him can feel my power growing feeding off my anger father would say i've lost the path of balance that he could never understand the only way to fight a monster is to become one whoa this is the folder mj found at the auction house this might help us figure out what lee's planning next yeah it's a burn room wired to destroy everything one more the police that found this or may i don't want to think of what could have happened now how do i get out of here hello peter mr lee i thought you were out of town did you find what you were looking for martin you're back you get that thank you and heading off again shortly i'm afraid just needed a few things from my office you must have heard about city hall yes tragic peter was there he was very lucky and an osborne rally i didn't know you were a fan well what matters is you are both safe amen but the bombers are still out there who knows what they've planned next i don't think you or may have anything to worry about as long as you stay away from places you're not supposed to be well i should go when will you be back when my work is done wait wait i finally got your evidence head to the feast center in chinatown what am i going to find a nice lady named mae parker and some really weird stuff hidden in lee's office but listen he's got another attack planned where when still working on that but i think he's going to use something called devil's breath sounds destructive what is it a substance created by oscorp probably a bioweapon of some kind i have a folder full of info on it i'm holding on to it for now i'll send copies as soon as i can okay we'll check his office if the evidence stands up i'll put out an apb mj hey just checking in peter hey can i call you back i think you'll want to hear this wait why are you whispering just in the middle of something how about we catch up over dinner my place oh sure i'll even cook cool see ya wait remember how you told me about lee's corrupting touch i think i just saw it in action how some perfectly nice homeless people just jumped me thing is they had glowing eyes and i remembered yuri telling me something similar about the guard who released shocker so shocker was working for me ah it's all connected there's more but i guess we'll talk about it at dinner yeah dinner huh what should i cook so oh hi doctor how are you parker exciting news come by the lab uh like now this is my defining moment can't wait to show you cool um i've got dinner plans can i come by later dinner can wait you need to see this peter uh okay uh be right there if it means i have a job again yes i can stop by just for a minute oh uh but it was fun need officers to respond to a car crash civilians are trapped incident is ongoing in the west village [Music] so [Music] hey doctor hello peter i'll be just a minute wow look at all this new stuff we really need to get better about where did you get all this equipment called in every last favor took out a few loans it's like we're starting over once again but this time's going to be different you've been busy just getting started you know until now we've been looking at prosthetics from the wrong perspective why restore people to what they were when we can make them better okay i think that should do it ready so [Music] everything okay damn it this is all your fault norman you son of a well i know who you're not voting for in the next election sorry i uh have a habit of making bad jokes intense situations uh it was a good joke parker just a bit of an overreaction on my part no don't worry why don't you take a break i'll uh i'll clean this up and uh get us ready for another test [Music] so uh i hope you don't mind me asking but it seems you and norman have a bit of a history we were lab partners in college became friends decided to start a business we both had visions of changing the world just in different ways wait you were at oscorp when it started i'm half the reason it's called oscorp in grad school everyone called us the o's add corp to that and well it is a catchy name but why'd you leave norman became more and more obsessed with genetics he started a project i considered unethical and there was this anyway lawyers got involved i chose to leave in exchange for a settlement but that money didn't last very long i've relied on grants ever since if this project doesn't work don't worry it'll work uh let me let me just fix this up i'll brew some fresh coffee be sure to run a diagnostic on the control unit could be a short huh no good gotta reroute this circuit [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh why don't you do the honors this time i think we did it next step neural interface that's a lot of work for you to do by yourself sure you can handle it apparently not judging by today's debacle because i still haven't found another job my funds are still i know it's okay don't worry i'll figure it out what's a few bucks when you're trying to change the world right to changing the world i missed call from mj doctor i need to go but i'll be back later don't worry the work will still be here when you get back what's that hey sorry i missed your call we still on for dinner dinner oh yeah i was calling you about something else but yeah we should talk over dinner offer still stands for me to come

fighting for a new and better world you have no right to hold us we do not recognize your corrupt law uh ah demons are getting more and more brutal i can't believe martin lee is really behind all this spiderman thank god demons have rigged explosives all over the building but we can't get close point me at him officer i'm here to help we've located the primary device if you can disable it it'll cough up an arm and key you can use that to locate and disable the secondary devices got it keep your men back i'll radio when it's clear [Music] not again not on my one [Music] [Music] don't think about the blocker c4 this is wired too [Music] [Music] great disarmed [Music] thanks for that spider-man you got it officer always ready to do my part stable teams this is control what's the status in murray hill i'll post x-ray under attack it's the demons hey pal this station tests particulate matter in the air now you'd probably have some science jargony way to say this but basically too much is not good hmm readings are troubling but inconsistent the only way i'll figure out what's going on is to test nearby emissions but i've got other problems the sampler's detecting toxic particles better check it out that steam vent's a good place to start [Music] there's something in here that doesn't belong let's analyze it [Music] [Music] mercury bonded with something else i can't tell what this obviously isn't confined to one building a lot of people are at risk let's see what a sample from this can tell me [Music] [Music] nitric acid in there too but also something else i'm on the right track just need to keep following the trail this is more widespread than i thought the whole neighborhood's in danger from this [Applause] so [Music] phew that stinks to high heaven time to find out what's in it [Music] [Music] ethanol why is this sounding so familiar mercury with nitrogen and ethanol got to get back on the trail when this is over i'll alert the health department so they can check on the local residents i think i found the problem caustic chemicals are leaking out of those barrels and into the plumbing need to clean up the site fast huh the calcium and silicon in concrete makes it an ideal absorption material looks like i'll have to make a mess to fix this mess [Music] one down nice it's warm breathing this stuff in not good just a couple more barrels last one that's it sealing the grate with webbing should stop any residual drainage that could have been way worse harry's research station just proved why it needs to stay open hey mj all right i picked up a bunch of stuff at the store can't wait to see what you come up with swinging over now prepare to be amazed [Music] this is table control requesting update from valerie demons are firing on tcp bravo need backup [Music] [Applause] [Music] so peter you are not going to believe what happened so you know that address you gave me i went there mj i know i know but wait what is this just listen this is the address pete found men are all carrying firearms what is this place that office might be something inside that connects this to lee i need to get back there huh what was that what dumbass can't put their [ __ ] away i bet it was happy i shot a rat mon lee's really what are they building is this careful well you better clean your slag off that sloppy well hey what was that easy does it what kind of vehicle needs tires this big where is it i swear i left it over here that guy's not going anywhere what is this some kind of military hardware office must be to my right need to move careful through here hey i heard something why is that so familiar what's in these but come on tombstone you're right rick won't notice ah cousin won't be there god damn it and settle fix it you got some stones rick let's see if they break [Music] such a disappointment now i need a new welder can't turn back now i need to get into that office come on now the hell was that made it blueprints an apc this is what they're building for lee but why didn't here we go gps trackers what is tombstone using these for all right boys time to move get the gear for my office time to go okay i want to say

weakness mine is whatever you're cooking right now smells amazing the chicken curry uh just needs some time to simmer no dumplings i hope you're never gonna let me live that one down are you nope the great dumpling catastrophe i still can't believe they evacuated the entire building and went in january too your neighbors hated me yeah they were pretty happy when we broke up yeah so let's talk about what you found in lee's office well lee clearly has issues with norman osborn yeah but but why i don't know yet but his next move looks like it involves devil's breath whatever that is yeah i'll dig into it so i was thinking what if we teamed up wait what you want to be my sidekick like a spider girl spider woman no woman no not a sidekick a partner oh not again hey it's your crime system thingy looks like a residential break-in charles standish hmm that sounds familiar oh oscar cfo wait you don't think this has anything to do with lee do you sorry to cook and run did you just leave your clothes on the kitchen floor ah where do you want me to uh the couch is fine dad see you later yeah hey it's me this curry is legit so what do we know about charles standish let's see she's financial officer ozcorp single known for his art collection if lee's after him it's got to be related to devil's breath i'll run a search on everything in that file let me know the second you find something i think lee might be planning something even worse than city hall so are we partners now because it sure feels like we are partners uh sounds good okay see ya partner so [Applause] police look like they could use some help [Music] ah [Music] somebody was in a hurry spiderman you're hurt i'm okay but you gotta find mr standish fast those guys in the masks kidnapped him and forced him up to his place he lives in the penthouse top floor okay sit tight so glad you're here i can't find my car i could have sworn i parked on this level [Music] yes [Music] hmm run wait you guys work here too this building is serious about parking enforcement [Music] good fight hey for effort the elevator won't work they know i'm here but maybe i can sneak up through the elevator shaft i should be able to make it up to the penthouse from here foreign [Music] okay almost there stay out of the light oh nice and easy not good catch it there's standish okay now what enter your password he sounds nervous maybe i should take him out [Music] literally didn't see that coming good one pete oh nap time there you go [Music] [Music] sweet dreams okay all clear hope standish is all right let's try this again it's safe now what were they after just financial records about devil's breath how do you know about that why do they want it i don't even know what it is mr osborn's been pouring money into it for years but he keeps the whole project a secret i'm the only one who has any record of it not anymore looks like they copied some records to a secure server payroll information on a dr isaac delaney who is he i honestly don't know damn come on come on almost got him try to fall slower [Music] you okay yeah i think so good good you know as elevator chefs go this is pretty nice hey yuri you okay yeah but i didn't get much out of standish before these sable guys stepped in and told me to back off what's the deal i get the sense all they care about is keeping him quiet because he knows about devil's breath right whatever the hell that is i'm working on that i think i just got a lead a lead you sound like a cop don't you mean spider cop [Music] uh yuri that's fair peter what happened with standish he's safe okay good and the demons they were looking for a name you got a pen yeah go dr isaac delaney okay who is he what's his deal i was hoping you could tell me i'm on it just give me a few oh and before i forget you left that tracker from tombstones at my place i'll drop it at dr octavius's lab let you know what i find on delaney attention agents this is control need an update on the situation in madison need reinforcements at outpost foxtrot we're taking fire ground teams report on the situation in the flat iron from sorry to call so late my mind's bursting with ideas we're thinking too

something out for me no but if you ask nicely just got a call about a suspicious looking box on a rooftop in hell's kitchen i could call in the bomb squad but if it's just some kid's science project yeah i know budget crisis yada yada so will you please check it out there's the magic word i hope it's some kid's science project man i miss those days school projects are so much easier than real life projects all units mass terrorists have been identified driving a box truck witness reported location spider-man so you found one of my recon points who is this wrong question the correct one is can you stop the bombs i've planted mystery man's got recon points spread all over the city [Music] this computer's tracking bombs around the district and they're about to go off i gotta move these bombs aren't going to defuse themselves okay take care of that one so gotta find the last bomb should have done better nice work with the bombs but you lean into your throat too much hurts the accuracy is this some kind of sick game to you games are for kids and i'm a professional and i get paid like it guess your client wasted their money sometimes information's worth more than money and i've learned plenty watching you mj what did you find out about isaac delaney check out the picture i just sent which one is delaney i don't know i guess you'll have to go to the party to find out good thing i already have a costume so this is control where are we with union square i'll post x-ray under attack hey halloween party guess i don't have to change [Applause] should we go out this

[Music] [Applause] stop them from hurting each other you'll be okay later apologies not that again what did lee do to these people believe me this is for your own good ugh yuri i need your help i've got reports of shots fired at dsu yeah that's me i'll explain later but right now you need to find a dr morgan michaels martin lee's coming after him copy that spider-man who is this dr michaels i think he's the head scientist on this devil's breath project did you find him yes and no sable says they have him under protection at a safe house somewhere in the city but they won't tell me where i thought you guys were working together so did i okay i have an idea on how to find him i'll let you know if it works hey did you find dr delaney at the party yeah but so did lee oh no what happened lee corrupted him and made him kill himself that's horrible we have to stop this guy we will before delaney died he gave lea a name morgan michaels morgan michaels who is he not sure but i bet he works on the devil's breath projects have you learned anything from that devil's breath file yeah get this a few years ago osborne came to fisk and asked him to build a lab but to keep it hidden from regulators secret lab for devil's breath if it's as dangerous as we think it is i can see why where's the lab that's not in the file osborne made destroy all records of it all i have are invoices from osborne's personal account to fist construction knowing fisk he kept the invoices around for blackmail material on the mayor everything leads back to norman osborn guess it's time to pay him a visit i doubt he's gonna tell you anything i wasn't planning to ask okay that's how i can get into norman's office can't get in there without shutting down some security systems but if they see me they'll put the whole place on lockdown i should be able to hack into the security network modules from the outside they're the network cables just need to follow them to the security module looks like there's four of these around the building that should make things easier what the hell security teams call in stable team alpha standing by looks like an electrical problem copy that keep an eye on the exterior while we try to track down the issue just when i thought it would be easy all stable teams looks like we have some sort of software problem we're calling in a specialist copy that continuing exterior sweep what all ages someone's taking control of one of our subsystems initiating delta protocol stable teams i need a status report exterior sweep negative we are all clear still look like a software issue we don't know we're evaluating please maintain current alert levels attention all stable teams there's a small possibility we have a trip damn it another subsystem is going offline i need a team to scan the 85th floor exterior copy control bird inbound gotta move hi i'm jay a little busy right now i'll be quick listen i gotta lead on charles standish's location i think if i can get to him i can make him talk he knew about dr delaney he probably knows about morgan michaels as well okay just don't do anything crazy speaking of crazy gotta find that last module nice now i can get into norman's office and hopefully find out more about morgan michaels and devil's breath exterior sweep negative should we go on lockdown not yet mr osborne is in the middle of an important call but keep tracking there must be someone out there hold on switching to a secure line i'm way ahead of you wilson i had my people go through all your files if you try to expose our business arrangement it'll be your word against mine and i'm not the one behind bars right now wait is norman talking to wilson fisk neo statue what are you talking about the neo statue from the auction house they must be talking about that file mj found jackpot gr27 dr morgan michaels is the chief scientist but the location of the lab is redacted ai controlled crispr if that actually works it could cure any genetic disease cystic fibrosis huntington's this is crazy creepy whoa gr27 is devil's breath it's designed to cure diseases but in its current form it's like a bio weapon dr michaels keeps the only sample with him at all times that's why lee wants him we find michaels we find devil's breath hey pete what's up mj get this devil's breath wasn't designed to be a weapon it's a treatment for genetic disorders but its current form is wildly imperfect in trying to fix the body it rips it apart we need to locate dr michaels i don't trust sable to contain something this deadly charles standish is being held at stable central park compound if anyone knows michael's location it'll be oscorp's cfo i'm trying to reach it now reach him that place is crawling with guards how are you trying to reach him very very quietly gotta go partner sneaking into a sable compound that could go bad fast i should head to central park [Applause] near atlantic [Music] [Music] demons have a bomb rigged in one of those cars you need to stop them looks like doc checked it i've had an epiphany for example a mind of unlimited potential shackled to a tired old body think of what that mind could achieve if it were freed in developing our neural interface we need to think beyond replicating the tired putterings of our physical forms instead reach into imagination and possibility reach into the mind i've never heard doc this excited by a project i hope he's not too excited where are you mj crap reach him that place is crawling with guards how are you trying to reach him very very quietly gotta go partner this stand is just somewhere in there gotta get past that guard time to see if these lore's pete gave me work that gap in the fence looks promising just need to distract the guard whose bright idea was it to put a circuit board in a fence gotta move now gonna check on our house guest stay here copy house guest must be standish he's here somewhere what's that demons are killing anyone related to devil's breath standish is in real danger got it time to move standish i knew it i've got to get to that tent she's nervous standish must know something about dr michaels continuing sector sweep crap generator tripped i won't distract him for long [Music] how's it looking convoy gonna be ready [Music] should use it as cover go go go made it control status nothing to report robo and charlie are both on deck for dr michael's relocation man add two more units he carries the only sample of devil's press i will not be responsible for pandemic i'm hearing things looks important safe houses if dr michaels is in one of these standish might know which one there's dandish's tent or us continuing sweep almost there charles standish holy crap charles where is dr morgan michaels please sent you didn't he no [Music] he wants to kill me he told him to do it do it himself i'm not with the demons i'm not with sable i'm a reporter and i want to see lee stopped just like you what i've heard your byline this table won't listen to me she has michael's in the bowery they're moving him to a new safe house tomorrow at noon but she's totally ignoring grand central grand central the demons were talking about it when they held me they're going there to get to get what charles what are the demons need to get at grand central what the oh what if i was not a disabled guy definitely not a stable guy sorry charlie okay time to go no he knows something [Music] well that was maybe the most awkward swing in my life mj is not happy hey okay another thing sorry charlie you knock a man out destroy my background research and the best you've got is sorry charlie is everything a joke to you what mg no i i screwed up it was a tension breaker tension breaker right you know this is exactly why we broke up i thought we broke up so you could focus on your career we broke up because you wouldn't stop treating me like a baby don't do this mj don't do that mj oh that's too dangerous mj i may not have super spider powers but i'm not made out of glass you snuck into the middle of an armed military you know what can we not do this right now please did you learn anything about dr michaels fine michaels is in the bowery somewhere sable's moving him tomorrow at noon awesome anything else was he saying something about grand central before i jumped in he was no it was nothing listen i gotta go peter filing deadline peter that's how you know she's still mad peter nice work mr superhero man i'm worked up gotta blow off some steam on patrol all units officers are under fire from masked hostile incident is ongoing near union square please copy dunes are getting worse than fisk ever hold tight officers the web swinging cavalry's here hello and please call me peter mr parker is probably someone more together than me i should tell you he has reservations i finally gave him a choice this or more therapy he needs this he just feels like a victim or be pity gotcha i'm the same way i'll let me know and i'll make sure i'm there his first day thank you again [Music] foreign so [Music] max thank you missed a call from aunt may peter i spoke to miles mother and she loved the idea of him working here oh the poor woman is grieving herself while trying to be strong for her son she needs some time to just grieve and he needs to see that life's still worth living that was a very thoughtful suggestion peter the kind that would have made them proud [Applause] once we're on scene [Music] peter i'm about to begin another test oh sorry my bus broke down and there were no cabs but i'll be there as soon as i can hey sorry i'm late morning parker or is it evening that doesn't matter check the neurosensors would you we need a faster response time on it try to get it under three milliseconds [Music] okay looks like i could optimize this power really [Music] [Music] nice okay what next [Music] looks like some impedance in this neurosensor circuit [Music] so finished signal to noise is out of whack a new signal processor should reduce lag so so [Music] i got it doc 2.8 milliseconds good work peter yes [Music] i'd call that a mile success i'd call that unbelievable do you need some help yes doctor what's going on has become that obvious my doctors call it a degenerative neurological disorder probably caused by overexposure to toxic chemicals in my reckless youth sorry is is there anything i can do you already are the worst part is it only affects the muscles the mind continues to work but it can no longer do you're the only one who knows peter i'd like to keep it that way of course uh if you'd like to seek a position with more of a future i i came here to work for you because of what you've got up here and that's not going anywhere so neither am i oh peter before i forget i read the most fascinating article outlines possible next steps for the neural interface i'll take a look thanks doc man direct interface with the basal ganglia exciting but risky i don't know doc you'll need a gallium silk array to make it work even then odds of injury are pretty high gallium genius never mind the risks we'll work them out in time doc's really sick at this rate he'll lose control of his motor functions within a year and if we're not careful an intracranial implant could make things even worse even alter his personality we need to proceed carefully peter is starting to suspect he hides it but i can tell he's seen my twitch noticed the decay of my fine motor control well i'm the one who wanted a genius for an assistant of course he knows i just need more time my work can improve millions of lives save millions of lives it can also save my own i just need more time hmm um doc i'm sorry my aunt just texted no worries peter i was thinking of taking a break myself as soon as i checked hi mei let me guess running late nope i'm actually on my way now have you heard from miles no but his mother said he was coming so good i'll be there soon bye need immediate response at union square [Music] what are you doing here you just made your last mistake punk what the does it seriously take this many guys to rob a teenager [Music] [Music] you hurt you're spider-man you're the amazing spider-man you're the spectacular spider-man and a few other choice adjectives jameson uses look that was really brave but next time leave the fighting to the pros okay okay but what if there aren't any around well you can't just go swinging at someone twice your size i mean don't get me wrong i fight guys stronger than me all the time but when i do it i have oh like that time you fought rhino on the brooklyn bridge that was so awesome perfect example if the other guy's bigger you got to be quicker okay okay but that's it's easy for you to say sorry i just can't do what you do all right put them up seriously yeah come on first thing don't let the adrenaline get to you breathe slow breathe deep relax hip square to your opponent let them make the first move now

[Music] and norman wanted to use him a futile gesture in the end and where was norman during all this slinking away like a rat he knew what was going to happen and he fled norman is a hidden cancer on

transit hubs are the most likely release points for devil's breath airports bus terminals train stations it'll spread like wildfire from there why the hell is ozcorp developing a fire weapon in the city shouldn't this be an arctic bunker devil's breath is personal for norman it's been his obsession for decades the project breaks every state and federal regulation on the books but he doesn't care if the city finds out he can kiss re-election goodbye never mind re-election he'd be tried in the hague for war crimes why are you telling me all this aren't you just as culpable as norman yes completely but lee's actions have been a wake-up call we've ignored the project's risk for too long i trust you spider-man you're the only one trying to do the right thing please protect the city from our mistakes damn devil's breath is gone i should call mj and warner this is mary jane watson please leave a detailed message and i'll get back to you as soon as i can what are you up to now mj

fully disclosed i bankrolled the experiment that gave him superior strength speed and that unsightly cyborg tail the idea was to create an anti-spider-man who is not a threat and stops menaces i had no idea he was crazy do you think his resume said psycho with a poisoning fetish his lawsuit is a transparent attempt to reduce his sense of the raft by placing the blame for his deeds on me and that

international who maintain tight security over all transit points throughout the city police and stable agents continue to battle with rikers and raft escapees meanwhile mayor osborne has gone on record blaming spider-man for the prison break and city-wide sickness and branding him a fugitive but he has yet to provide evidence and many believe the mayor is just deflecting blame since an exclusive report by the bugle revealed that this disease originated in a secret unregulated oscorp laboratory here in manhattan mayor osborne insists that oscar heard it all but has not provided any further evidence to support this claim [Music] dr octavius why how did i let this happen just got a call from the hospital they said you went awol i need to get back to work the doctor said you still

always hey uh so i didn't know if uh you wanted sparkling or or flat or spring or mountain spring so i got one of each am i interrupting no um mj ms watson and i were just talking strategy strategy that's right the city is in danger it needs our help all of our help all right well call the play coach okay divide and conquer ms watson we need an anti-serum for devil's breath ozcorp's developing

number are you spiderman's girlfriend that'd be so cool come on sherlock show me what you got in this watersh mortgage board the city feels a little more under control miles is watching feast mj is tracking a devil's breath cure time for me to focus on finding otto stopping whatever he has planned yuri we need to start tracking the big boys still no leads on octavius no nothing forensics can't even do a sweep of times square everyone in that department but the intern is sick i might be able to turn something up let you know what i find [Music] so this is control what's the situation in brian we have obtained an authorized gathering of civilians proceeding to question an arrest what i like about you kid you're always getting better gee thanks creepy stalker guy [Music] spider-man here to lend a hand i thought you might need one officer you don't know the half of it never seen anything like this devil's breath stuff forensics is having a hell of a time news reports say this is where otto released devil's breath might have left some residue i can track some residue on this sign maybe i can isolate it [Music] a.t rich leader sequence this looks promising so us corpse modified cpf1 definitely devil's breath should be able to track the dispersal path now trail goes in a few directions need to find the right one trail's gone cold you're telling me vapor trail heads up that building [Music] trail jumps between these buildings trail leads down into those vents what was otto doing up here should be a door or an access hatch around here [Music] well this is moody there must be some way to hit the lights there be light whoa was otto using this as a staging ground chaos of the prison break would have been perfect cover to move in otto's rage is driving him the neural interface is exacerbating it but his hate is genuine he'll destroy the whole city to hurt norman martin lee can't believe this is the same man i knew it feast norman feel like i can't turn around without seeing his face he smiles for the cameras collects his accolades and keeps his booty oppressed against my neck why can't anyone else see how selfish he is how reckless how evil if only they could be made to see the norman i know the man behind the mask looks like otto's been studying sable's tech for weaknesses good old rhino my second favorite russian otto developed a corrosive to free rhino from his suit a certain government agency spent years trying and failing to do that only took otto a few days looks like otto recorded messages for his crew alexi i've followed your career with great interest the world sees you as a witness dullard i see a warrior with a poet's heart i know you desire freedom from the battle suit you're sealed inside help me achieve my goals and freedom shall be yours matt gargan aka scorpion aka crazy pants mccrazy scorpions helping otto in exchange for a clean slate criminal record expunged gambling debts erased it's rare for me to admit this mr gargan clearing your debts was more difficult than i anticipated you're in arrears to some demanding but once the reservoir job is finished your financial obligations will be finished as well otto octavius is nothing if not persuasive old man vulture i've tangled with him more than anyone else here power source for vultures wings gave him spinal cancer and otto's developing an experimental treatment to save him electro total live wire that one electro's big pipe dream is to become pure energy duck actually managed to modify his harness to get a little closer to that goal max when you first conveyed your dream to me i thought you insane pure energy but as i dove deeper into the problem i discovered a way to give us both what we desire i promise you when we are done you will be pure energy or so close to it is to make the difference irrelevant what's this now otto must have used this map to plan but it's blank unless there's something here i'm missing uv bulb huh nothing happened must be a way to get that lamp on there we go hidden markings otto's tasked the villains to destroy oscorp holdings throughout the city he's trying to take apart norman's empire piece by piece please going after the devil's breath anti-serum using something called icarus seems like the last stage of the plan is a direct assault on oscorp and most likely norman scorpion must be trying to poison the city's reservoir another oscorp owned property rhinos targeting oscorp's shoreline properties which is he hitting first and why electro's disabling oscorp power plants makes sense what's vulture doing

mj hey you mind if i toss a kind of thorny ethical question at you when is it okay to give up on a friend oh wow pete thinking of otto that obvious huh yeah understandable though man the high-minded generous part of me wants to say never being a true friend means being there even when people lose their way but with what otto's done i just don't know pete i guess you have to decide if the auto octavius you knew is still in there or not maybe if he was ever even in there at all yeah yeah thanks mj i gotta process some stuff i think call me anytime pete i'm here right over here until miles gets back the best thing we can do is keep everyone fed oh peter it is so good to see you how are you healthy i'm good how are you holding up man good but busy oh let me go oh there i'm okay didn't

through oscorp records hey this is random but you remember that trip we took to staten island with harry to find the best pizza in the city yeah 10 hour odyssey for burnt toast with cold american cheese how could i forget something about all these old oscorp files made that day pop into my head harry was so excited about riding the ferry just made me think about how much simpler things were back then no jobs no super villains we could throw away a whole day looking for bad pizza just cuz now it feels like if you take a nap the world will fall apart yeah this adult thing is rough but i guess the work we do means today's kids can have their own staten island adventures in safety kind of a circle of life thing circle of bad pizza yeah you're right that's a good way to look at it thanks pete [Music] this is stable control what's the situation in colombia control a group of civilians violence against peacekeepers we're detaining and questioning great leaders [Music] armed hostiles [Music] officer please proceed to manhattan all units be advised escape prisoners are inciting a riot pick on someone your own size rhino there is no one my size maybe we could just talk it

know what octavius will do if he finds out you failed i failed yes you freaked joe didn't i hear you took a poetry class in the raft like a therapy thing [Music] a little sports together time might help you boys learn to play nice all right yuri that's four down just octavius and lee left something tells me they won't be as easy they're only half our problem though devil's breast cases are getting worse and oscorp is being coy about an anti-serum i'm worried they're seeing dollar signs in a seller's market i'd expect nothing less from our beloved mayor leaf devil's breath to me one of my best people is on it it's off the books the only other place i can think to look is in norman's personal files i've already been through his office computer are you thinking his penthouse that building's full of staples man if they spot me other residents could get hurt in a fire fight i know but i might be able to get in undetected i can sneak in find the lab location and get out if anything goes wrong i'll call you for backup okay it's risky but we need that location wait for me to get nearby then make your move i'll be ready okay mj i'm a couple blocks away let me know if you get into trouble thanks pete wish me luck okay norman's penthouse is on the top floor but the elevator's on lockdown need to get into the security room to unlock it mayor osborne really lives here there's the security room but that guard will see me if i go in residents are pretty upset maybe i can rile them up to create a distraction oh every second we stay down here we risk catching that plague definitely stay away from the receptionist i've been coughing up a storm what they have to let us back upstairs why isn't osborne down here this sort of thing never happens to him the mayor and his friends are exempt security let one of his biggest donors back upstairs right away i knew it it's all one big boys club come on he's got some fancy new system installed in the back security room no sweeps needed they said plus you know he's the mayor what a jerk he's definitely lost my boat left my stupid inhaler upstairs i heard they'll let you up if you claim special circumstances the health emergency might do it really come on let's go talk to security that should do it jerry get out here we got a situation oh man i can't breathe let me back up just need to get to the door without being seen everyone please stay calm sable international has nearly finished their sweep that's what you said an hour ago i know this is frustrating hello i know a few sable agents who would love to meet you swear your way out of here okay okay i'm gone i like this thing gotta turn him around i'm sure sable offers elevator controls in the security room next to the seat mary jane watson super spy time to unlock that elevator that did it norman's clearing out and the elevator's unlocked time to head upstairs penthouse elevator this is it norman and sable right on cue find the alarm technician fire him stupid useless button [Music] norman's guards have all cleared out if he's hiding something up here i'm gonna find it what is this thing hmm schematics for a prototype combat mask looks like it can reveal structural weaknesses whoa this mask is incredible is it showing a door hidden in that wall i wonder where it leads the fact norman bids his son farewell huh this must be from when harry left for europe last year why was norman so dramatic about a trip to secret keypad behind the family portrait norman must like spy movies i need to find the code for that keypad doors are locked till the system check finishes work order for a padlock looks like he used harry's last day as the code that must be the day harry left for europe norman locked up perry's room wants it untouched for when harry returns from europe but where did he put the key hey dad on my way to dr michaels for one last shot before the um on the big trip uh hey if you're gonna meet me there could you grab my journal from my room i just wanted to record some thoughts on the big bon voyage day anyway listen i know i don't say this enough but thank you dad you know for doing this i love you wow haven't heard harry's voice in so long he sounds so tired let's hope that journal is still here gotta check his room god pete and i loved coming over here to watch movies when we were kids a different world from queens funny how harry always wanted the opposite nothing made him happier than watching cartoons on the little tv in may's kitchen i used to be so jealous of harry's family they were so happy at least compared to me and my dad but when emily got sick everything changed harry's room but it's locked i wonder where norman keeps the key norman and otto wow they look like they used to be so close what could have ruined a friendship like this harry's mom emily we used to make fun of him for calling her the prettiest mom at midtown but he might have been right feels like there's something attached to the back of the frame score this must be the key for harry's room what this can't be for harry can it harry's journal his last entry is marked july 18. that must be the code to that room no i am saying we should not rush off without a plan you are staying here the anti-serum is ready and i'm going to supervise production you will be completely vulnerable without me i seem to be completely vulnerable with you i'm going alone end of discussion keep team two on standby i'm getting some air pete norman's cure is ready he's headed to the lab it's at now can you follow not without alerting him somebody spiked sable's coffee today her men are set on double secret probation alert okay then stay ready i've almost got the location the hell with that foreign okay july 18 bingo gotta find the location of the devil's breath lab something in this room must be useful norman osborne gr27 research log the whole project has gone to hell dr 27 is a cure not a disease but try telling that to the evening news somehow they've picked up the technician's morbid nickname devil's breath and are using it to stoke hysteria they have no idea what it's really capable of a cure for cancer genetic disorders birth defects with just a little more research i know we could perfect it instead i'll spend the next 18 months on pr mop-up what a waste of time devil's breath isn't a disease it's an attempt at a cure i almost can't believe it spiders is norman trying to reverse engineer peter's abilities the labels on these cages bioelectrokinesis optical camouflage what the hell is he trying to create what are these things prototype hand grenades thing going on looks like a map of the upper west side looks like norman's tracking dr michael's movements creep fest kind of makes sense though michaels is the lead on devil's breath huh this shows all of oscorp's properties had no idea they owned so much of new york disabled troop deployments they're stationed all over the city i bet i can find the devil's breath lab with this it must be an oscorp property with a ton of sable protection frequented by dr michaels oscorp building but no michaels are stable that's not it nope that's just disable patrol bravo bravo nice got some overlap with dr michael's path don't think i've chosen the right categories commercial build wow so many records facilities gr27 that's the code name for devil's breath this is it 10th and cathedral isn't that i knew it 10th in cathedral oscorp's records department perfect place to hide a secret biotech facility gr27 martin lee incident what is this and we are rolling i will be right next door just relax and let the medicine do its work i thought this was just a consultation ready what have you done oh my god norman and otto they started all this they created lee i have to get this who's there [Music] damn it we have a breach high alert pete i've got the lab location and a lot more how far away are you two avenues over say the word and i'm

look after feast you you find norman you find the cure thanks partner [Music] i have to get that anti-serum and start putting things right there must be some way to reach leonardo convince them to give up this crusade for revenge they've both done so much good for the world they can't throw their legacies away just despite norman okay norman's on his way to get the anti-serum better update yuri i hope this is good news it is oscorp just created an anti-serum there's a cure oh thank god how quickly can we get it to people i'm on my way to find out the lab is at 10th and cathedral wait i just got a report of a helicopter going down in that area oh no that could be norman's helicopter i'd send officers your way but i don't have any don't worry i'm on it this will all be over soon i promise [Music] now reports are coming in that martin lee along with exhibiting freakish abilities like those of you know who has lately seemed to display almost a split personality this is hogwash and a clear attempt to evade justice for his crimes only a fool would believe that he's mr positive one moment helping the poor with a smile then suddenly he's mr negative blowing up wait a minute mr negative that's gold jared gold trade market stat as i was saying folks martin lee's evil side or as everyone is now calling him mr negative has been revealed [Music] [Music] [Music] ah open it have to take care of these demons before i can follow lee into the lap time to ko those snipers sleep it off [Music] so we need to get through these demons quick before lee gets a hold of the anti-serum you literally didn't see that coming up lee wiped out the agent's station here they're not handling anything you have been warned sable made good under threat but these guys aren't looking to team up tired of you harassing our agents spider-man this ends tonight you guys think i took out your men you gotta be kidding me [Music] [Music] go this fast oh i really wish sable would cut me some slack we should be on the same team [Music] he's [Music] [Music] demons and sable are down time to follow lee inside why are you so heavy you harass my men destroy my equipment and cost my client millions give me one good the reason i should not kill you right now listen i don't like you you don't like me but lee has your client inside this building right now and he's gonna kill him if we don't do something

world you have to be the kind of man who can make the hardest decisions i couldn't agree more [Music] [Applause] [Music] peter i saw you as a son i should have known you turned on me just like all the others turn tur i've worshipped you your mind your conscience wanting to help others the way you never gave up that's because men like us have a duty a responsibility to use our talents in the service of others even if they don't appreciate it we have to do what's best for those beneath us whether they understand it or not no you're wrong you are everything i wanted to be you just threw it away yes of course you're right peter oh i see that now the neural interface affected my mind but i can fix it we can fix it together if you'll help me do everything i can i'll make sure you get the best out

knowing your secret is safe with me you do what you think is best doc it's all any of us can you do it even when hurts like hell you know where are you going [Music] fear peter [Music] it's still viable we'll need the entire sample as a base to produce more doses how long will that take a few hours maybe a day what if we use it to cure someone right now then there won't be enough to cure the others [Music] i'll give you a few minutes [Music] you're gonna be okay ma'am i've got the cure right here take off your mask wanna see my nephew you knew i've known for a while i never wanted you to
