[Music] he trained in some sort of room where he had control over gravity I need to access that room that annoying woman's old man is the only one who could construct something like that where is he [Music] where is that damn geezer at there is [Music] there you are yes can I help you what is going on with that training room I asked you to build basic construction is complete I just need a few

shopping and you finish the room that right that's right you got it here's what I need you to get for me and that about does it for the things I need you want me to get this huh [Music] you'll see

forgot what you asked for that better be all of it now that I have this the rooms as good as ready we here [Music] all right it's finished Kakarot trained under 100 times gravity so I'll have to triple that and trained under 300 times gravity actually I wouldn't do that if I were you assuming you weigh say about 175 or so pounds that'd be approximately 18 tons of pressure that's only three times what tech rock did there's no way I can't handle it [Music] fat Vegeta is unbelievable training under 300 times gravity is he trying to kill himself [Music] Gina what are you doing shut up woman leave me be oh you don't want my help suit yourself why why can't I reach his level I I am the Prince of the Saiyans there's just no getting through to you is there you are insane have you been added this whole time you're not going to make any progress if you keep this up so why don't you just ask Goku what he does to turn into a Super Saiyan losers help yeah then why don't you try dying what did you say [Music] I've prepared a special training partner for you in the simulator think you can beat them do you have any idea who you're talking to you ridiculous woman your Vegeta the almighty saying Prince right I guess that settles it then good luck and one more thing my name's Bulma not woman think you can remember that do you know who you're talking to [Music] woman [Music] you this place this is the wasteland where I first fought Kakarot which means but how I'm fighting myself what the hell consider yourself lucky a super elite like myself wasting his time playing with scum like problem don't tell me this is all you've got oh it's not I'm only just getting started [Music] prepare your turn [Music] [Music] prepare yourself during the retreat prepare yourself [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] got a gun [Music] is robbing away here wasting my time [Music] [Music] I will surpass I will punish myself for lagging behind Kakarot oh I guess that wasn't enough of a challenge for you huh you really know how to piss me off oh come on I was just messing around with you more huh you're right it wasn't enough you're going to make me a stronger opponent don't you take that tone with me I'm going to get stronger and use that strength to crush those androids you have a problem with that bull mop fine your real pain you know that wait he just called me Bulma for the first time didn't he Kakarot I will surpass you just wait you'll realize that I'm number one you [Music] hey chichi her back hi mom man we really worked up a sweat today Goku do you have a second sure chichi but can it wait I'm starving don't you I'm starving me I got a bone to pick with you yeah why can't you act more like our neighbors and drive us to the store once in a while but chichi we don't have a car and even if we did I couldn't drive it I have a license you need to get a driver's license you're the only one around here who still doesn't have something that basic piccolo doesn't have one either what use what I have for that then you need to go to drivers ad think of it is training to become normal everyday people you're both obsessed with training right then you can't say no what what do I have to [Music] the next day after catching an earful from chichi Goku and piccolo reluctantly made for town to enroll in driving school now then shall we begin the trial essen this is how it's gonna be then I'm all-in listen up Goku whether it's in battle or on the road I'm not losing to you all right I get you this is a different type of training it's on piccolo um there's no need to view this as a competition are you all right [Music] you let's do this remember safety first okay putting safety fast feels great they can go even faster don't forget about swifty [Music] don't forget about 50 we should be able to make it right [Music] feels great you go even faster we won't be able to make it right great [Music] hey not too bad this isn't putting safety first [Music] don't forget about 50 we should be able to mix right great [Applause] putting safety first we should be able to make it right how is that all right looks like I'm the winner piccolo oh wow who are these guys one more time joke ooh wait I said wait a license isn't some prize for bragging rights it's to ensure that you can drive safely and responsibly like I care about that I will not accept defeat from the likes of him I think I'm starting to get a hang of this whole driving thing don't you let's go piccolo come on let's do this thing with pleasure it's on Goku oh yeah piccolo Keiichi g4 back joke ooh so how'd it go handled it like a complete pro I beat piccolo no problem you what I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that but whatever did you get your license Oh actually there's probably something you should know I think the instructor was a little freaked out by how he drove she told us she'd give us our licenses if we promised to never come back yeah so so you you didn't actually pass the test well at least you got your license yep now we can buy a car and finally go on this family drives I've been dreaming about well the thing is they also said we'd have to pay for all the damages caused during the test and I can't even guess how much that'd be what I'm not so good with money so I'll let you handle that thank you yeah well now that that's done let's get back to training mom whoa Tee tee you all right [Music] [Music] I know it wasn't easy but you finally got your license Goku I'm proud of you now all we need is a car a car do we even have money for that kind of purchase well not after paying back the city for all the damages you caused when you are taking the test to get your driver's license I'm counting on you to get us that car Goku Oh Frank I see sorry about that hey why don't why don't I ask Bulma she's a whiz with machines cars and machines good idea Bulma always has a solution up her sleeve that's true I guess I'll hit her up about it then you do that oh hey Goku what brings you here well it's not a big deal but I was hoping you could help me with a little problem sure what's up not sure if you heard but chichi made me get a driver's license which is fine but the thing is now she wants a car got an extra one lying around in those tiny capsules doesn't that beat all Earth's champion now a licensed driver oh sure I can get you a car seriously you don't strike me as a responsible driver any normal car would turn to scrap with you behind the wheel find me the stuff I need and I'll hook you up with an extra sturdy set of wheels all right then so what do you think we need it's all on this list be sure to refer to it when you're out scavenging so you don't forget anything oh and one more thing leave all matters of maintenance and upgrades to me excellent thanks a lot Bulma don't mention it after all happy wife happy life [Music] you [Music] you [Music] come home tgd Wow did you get us a car after I round up a bunch of materials Palma's gonna make one for us really that's wonderful go girl then you'd better get to finding those materials I'm sure it'll be good training too I don't know if I'd go that far but then again you never know until you try [Music] [Music] all right what should i do today dad mom's calling for you really okay hey piccolo do you think you could take Gohan and train him for a while at least until I can catch up fine Goku I just got a call from Master Roshi he said launch is back at calm a house oh yeah talk about a blast from the past so what's going on with her I'm not sure but he said she wanted to talk to you about something but I've got training to do don't you dare be disrespectful to Master Roshi just head over there and

wait a little longer well perhaps we can strike a deal how's this sound let me test the results of my training on you that all shoot I'd do that for free it's been far too long since we went toe-to-toe yeah I come [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you never cease to amaze me likewise TN you've gotten a lot stronger apparently not strong enough but learning that as a milestone in itself as promised I'll wait for this mystery guest through my sparring with you I discovered a few things I need to improve I think I'll train here for a little while longer do you mind no thanks by the way who is it that wants to meet me oh crap I left that part out it's launched oh oh I have no idea how much that makes me want to get back to training but a promise is a promise tell her she can find me here you bet you [Music] [Music] Hey I'm so glad you're back well did you find TN sure did listen up so just go to the place I told you about and he'll be there waiting ah reunited at last this has been a long time in the making thanks here this is for you I fixed some grub to take with me but went a little overboard you can have the leftovers thanks you know me I'd never turn down food hold on to your hat TN I'm coming for you [Music] if I can push myself just a little bit more I should be able to turn into a Super Saiyan I see your heart at work as always Vegeta what do you want I've made some slight modifications to the training room would you like to see what I came up with oh go on then show me what you've done I knew you'd be interested come with me she's a new researcher I'd hired to help me work on the training room upgrade be nice to her Vegeta it's a pleasure to meet you fine allow me to explain the new feature to you [Music] interesting I might have to give this thing a try now we should have room for a few more upgrades but we're a little short on power if you find any large sources of energy give them to my fellow researcher here and she should be able to make the necessary improvements got it [Music] [Music] how's your training going mind your own business well don't overdo it though I'm sure someone as tough as you will be just fine you've got that right that should but Baba's mind just you wait Kakarot it won't be long until you're struggling to keep up with me [Music] [Music] that took longer than I thought it would I'd better hurry back to pick along go on [Music] man but everyone's stronger now that they've been training [Music] you I have no idea what to expect with these androids but I really want to test my moves on your late what have you Barry ran into a few hitches but I did manage to get in a good bit of training though I got to pop I figured as much luckily for us we took the liberty of starting without you sorry about that [Music] how's the training coming along Goku [Music] we've done so much to prepare yes we're about to find out whether our training is sufficient enough to handle these Androids [Music] three years had passed and the fated day of May 12th had finally come all right you three be careful out there you sure you don't want to take some lunch no we're good mom Thanks sorry chichi all right we're off [Music] it's probably nothing you [Music] hey Goku tell me the truth these androids do you think we have a chance against these guys well I obviously can't tell you if we do I won't know until we actually fight them [Music] [Music] [Music] five and a half miles [Music] there it is and so the Warriors gathered at the time and place that trunks had mentioned Bulma who was eager to see the androids for herself greeted them but she wasn't alone she had a baby boy in tow that boy was a young trunks the child she had with Vegeta all except Goku were surprised to see the child however the impending arrival of the androids quickly put everyone back on edge then as Goku and the others stood ready flames suddenly began to break out in the city in the city it is if the androids could be but there's no way to tell from here hey what gives I couldn't sense their power at all that's it they're Androids which means we can't sense their energy you're kidding right where could they be but we can't sniff them out and we're just gonna have to hunt them down all right guys split up if you spot then let the rest of us know got it go hon you go help the people who are caught up in that explosion okay okay the androids attack let's go [Music] you
