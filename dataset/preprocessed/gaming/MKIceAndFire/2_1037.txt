about the tracking device i put in roman's car before we dropped it off now look who's turned pro [Music] let's hope they didn't find the tracker and disable it signal's still coming through though doesn't mean roman's anywhere near it romans is survived [Applause] looks like the car is heading north towards the river roman's still going north not slowing down much either [Applause] okay he's not heading north anymore going west now at the end of the road you're on take a left at the upcoming junction he's still headed west he just passed the marina you should be able to catch up to him soon oh looks like he's heading onto the causeway up ahead thought you'd want to know that i did a facial recognition search on the camera footage and got two hits on ormster's henchmen first is lamar reyes he's the contact roman mentioned at the club some arrest a few years back for vehicle theft but then he's been off the radar ever since presumably working for ormstrid the second is salome hassan we met her back in morocco at the data center nigerian french private military contractor now turned mercenary and with a pension for explosives okay thanks for the heads up it seems like he's been building his own crew over the years whatever he's preparing must be yup he's on the causeway you should be able to see him by now according to the tracker he's just ahead i don't see him and it's not like roman exactly fades into the background there's a car where it's in a ride he knows we're here we gotta stop him before he starts killing people it's not stopping pick up the back tires
