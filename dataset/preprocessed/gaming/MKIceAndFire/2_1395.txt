how's it going on I'm good but listen I need to show you something over there on the table recognize him yes name is Victor cost he's old school black ops my guess is he's here with the CIA well if he's a mole then you might be able to help us from what I can tell his location is somewhere near the channels you might want to start by looking there all right I'll head over and see what I can dig up this was a good find thought I can help even if I am all dinged up and one of those Sam's go down you got a plan for that will you just [ __ ] out a lot well sir I don't know that we would even be a target if they came to that that's enough you two can go about you were you doing one here why are you working with Sentinel and don't [ __ ] me I know all about you Oh what is it you think you know I know you're not just here to help Sentinel so what else are you here for I also came to help out an old friend I believe you two already know each other from Bolivia you mean listen I think you're better off talking to our friend I'm just here to help he can fill you in on all the juicy stuff now I can't get any comms off a rower but this works on the island it'll put the to you in contact and tell you its last position I appreciate the Intel now get moving this whole operation goes to [ __ ] if we're seen together looks like you've still got your mojo glad you haven't gotten soft since Bolivia yeah you me bills so what's the plan watch my back I need to retrieve some data so what brings the mighty Sam Fisher to a roll I'm after someone called the strategist he's been linked to several kidnappings around the world all military specialists we don't know what he's up to but we know he's here on this island if I can get him in front of Congress they should be able to authorize an invasion of Aurora hmm so they'll finally send in the cavalry right for now it's just us go take a look - tough son-of-a-bitch you really can't survive anything but we won't if we don't get moving seven over knows someone accessed this computer and they'll come looking reminds me of Iraq [Music] keep an eye on me get on that turret I'll get us out of here the strategist has you he's using him for some special project now is Midas involved in this project it's not clear all I know is the strategist is working on some kind of new drones walk weapon look the only thing I care about is getting lights back no the strategist is not what I'm after I understand that I'd be the same way if it was one of my guys what do you think the strategist is up to why does he want Midas I wish I knew but you can bet your ass they're putting the screws to huh we need to make that son of a [ __ ] pay and pay hard don't worry you'll pay but first I need him alive and off this island so he can stand tall before the man how do you plan to do that my team tried to come in on choppers and they took us out with a drone swarm nothing gets in around I have an aircraft on standby ready to come in I'll figure out how to get it past that drone and swarm every lock can be picked now the strategist has Midas but I can't take him down alone you help me catch him and I promise he'll lead us to your guy partner up huh and why not worked in Bolivia I got a location on some new Intel need to be sneaky on this one which means you're going to have to master some new tricks su LAN tricks you're ready meet me at the rendezvous point we'll get started from there nomads you ready to earn your pay born ready what's the up according to the data we found there was a power plant near that's just been reassigned and designated as a skel secret project the whole thing is classified and very hush-hush military and tech specialists have been secretly flowing in to work on the project you think the shredder just could be involved not only that I think it's our lead to finding Midas then let's get moving the strategist is careful he uses service with advanced encryption that we'll never be able to get past but if we can knock out the power planning the system will start to pack up the files the backup server has less encryption that's the weak point that's our way in got it you survey the network and I'll take down the power plant we'll split up I'll prep the main facility while you take point on the pumping station and start working once you get the pumps down into the main facility let's do this hi this place is really something else what the hell you're talking about well I just heard about Maggie Hanover that famous archaeologist works by the ancient meeting place deep blue.the pumping stations ready I'm headed to the main facility now get ready for fireworks I found a weakness in the pipes is that gonna give up my position our plan is down everything set on your rent deed blue this is no Med other files transferring what is anything about Midas [Music] deep blue I'm in [Music] you sure that thing's not gonna fry your brain Jesus relax you don't have to wear it relax all of our asses are on the line if this plan fails and so far your project hasn't delivered you're a smart man stone but you lack vision Wonderland requires vision start the test may I present project claw [Music] [Music] what's the promising start sure against dummies but it's got to work in the real world it's real targets oh it will so you say I do say and when I speak the world listens though I'm not surprised that someone like you can't understand that perhaps when Klaw is complete you can use it to finally put down the rebel insurrection you can't seem to manage we don't tolerate failure mr. stone is that clear crystal sir good that's enough shut it down what the hell was that the dog I said no guy named stone the man in the wheelchair acted like a superior I bet that's the strategist you find anything about the location of claw the project is massive somebody must know something - got it let's get moving I'll be in touch my bastards killed his wife no sign of Van Dyck anywhere though when Van Dyke where is he that's what they're calling beehives why did she have to die it's alright I I'm not here to hurt you yes oh this is my fault Rhonda would still be alive if I if I hadn't I'm so stupid I killed her I killed my wife that's not true no listen your wife was protecting you she believed in what you could do Oh Rhonda my sweet Rhonda there was a lot on the line here and I need you to work with me Stewart for her okay I'll help you she would have wanted that you know something that can take down Claude don't you tell me what you need we can help each other out all my research is stored in a server at the solar power plant but if you can get me there maybe I can wipe it and then they'll be running blind lead the way god-forsaken company no matter what the project with a Java they wanted an algorithm for their factory drums why'd they come to you I'm an expert on B behavior know all about swarm psychology how to recognize and influence it you didn't know they were building weapons not until it was too late the situation escalated they attacked me I didn't know what else to do [Music] all my research is in here the alarm will trigger when I start to wipe it you'll need to cover me how are you old enough my world is shattered I I just need to keep going to honor her make sure my work doesn't fall into the wrong hands so how were you involved with claw I developed the algorithm the language that made the drones able to behave autonomously I gave them the power to think for themselves there anything I can use against them to stop them the only thing that can stop the algorithm is a virus corrupt the communication and you defeat the swarm this will overload the processors but you'll need to access their relay to make it work thank you now there's a bounty on your head you'll probably be safest with the outcasts I know a few I can call when they hear about Rhonda maybe they'll help me a venture maybe now you take care of yourself nomads deep-blue I think it might have found a way to destroy Clough it comes after us [Music] Kenzie's location nobody until owner what now I guess I'll have to figure it out there are you Holly McKenzie I've already told you I don't know where my daughter is I'm not from centeno in case you haven't noticed I'm here to talk about claw how do you know that name who are you I want to be with the strategist I gather you work for him I don't know who he is and I don't care - I'm being forced to work like everyone else here I'm trying to put an end to all this but I'll need your help to do it why should I trust you I don't even know who you are you mentioned something about your daughter if she's in trouble I can help and prove I'm worthy of you trust my daughter will you be she's going through a rebellious phase spends her time sabotaging Sentinel drones and holding illegal drone races well-wrought gone right but sentinels wising up to her they expect full cooperation from me ruby's safety hangs in the balance so what can I do you can convince her to come home she might hear you out if you try after all you want me got it now you should go home and wait there just tell me where to find her you must be Ruby who the hell are you a simple thank you would suffice I could have handled them on my own thanks anyway what do you want you don't like a drone racer names Nomad your mom sent me I'm not coming home your mom and I made a deal rescuing you was the only way I got her to agree to help me do I look like a damsel in distress to you my mom works for Sentinel did she tell you that besides I'm busy preparing for a race Sentinel is forcing your mom to work for them now she's just trying to keep you safe rebelling would be more effective I have something I need to do before I head home since you're being generous with your services maybe you can help me with it I'm listening cool there's a series of antennas that have been emitting a strange signal recently the signals interfering with the races my guess is that it's linked to new drone tech they're testing a nearby camp we want me to do destroy the antennas caused mayhem for Sentinel sound straightfoward were the antennas I don't know the only way to find them is to follow the test drones that's what I was doing when they swarmed me their network key will pinpoint which antennas they connect to extract the drones motherboard and I'll tell you what to do next [Music] internals have been destroyed and I'm mostly in one piece yo this badass has bigger fish to fry I need you to play nice mom is gonna help me take down a sizeable scale project business black-and-white is you think I think I'm just trying to be nice for her good in that just my damage the situation is complicated I told you you two seem to be getting along well Ruby just refuses to listen my wit's end Nomad probably has better things to do than hear us arguing it's your time to step up Nomad did what you asked I study group pattern dynamics animals synchronicity while migrating it's useful research to anyone that wants to enhance AI communication I helped develop the drone swarm Legion with it the strategist has since asked me to improve our mutual project of interest in a similar fashion synchronised group communication that's never been seen before well we have a plan ready to extract the strategist and bring him to justice there anything you can do I can help with Legion get you a 10-minute window so the plane can break in and then leave it's not much I know but it's all I can do I'll take what I can get thank you dr. Mackenzie are you leaving now Nomad needed elsewhere kid you stay out of trouble and stay out of my comms good luck old timer you know what I kind of feel sorry for Sentinel deep-blue got some good news for you dr. Mackenzie worked on the Legion swarm she says she can get you a 10-minute window for your plane you should drop her a line when you can oh just a tip keep an eye on your daughter Ruby whip-smart kids going places [Music] I hope I'm not disturbing your work the work can wait who are you and what are you doing here my name is nomad I have some questions for general Paxton oh great the old geezer went and got himself into trouble with Sentinel this time I'm not from Sentinel but there's some shady stuff going on I just need to see if he's connected to it the old man always grabs his fishing pole and heads out about this time of day he has a watering hole around these parts but he never catches anything I don't think he's much of a fisherman oh yeah where's this fishing hole of his he's pretty secretive about it and then maybe snapshots of it in his office though feel free to take a look will do thanks seems like somebody's lying about their fishing trips why [Music] [Music] you it seems the last of the data was uploaded from the dryer you should have everything you need very good the fun should be in your account as we speak thank you for your service general I look forward to future updates general Paxton you can't sneak up on me like that you almost gave me a heart attack say you're you're gonna Feroz guys right I just uploaded this stuff from the drive and just sent it to him I we should be all square you're pathetic who the hell do you think you are I was a four-star general never volunteer information general you carelessly give up the name of your accomplice oh you're a ghost well I did I did for the good of my country right we need new warfare technology to protect America from its enemies but in the process you turned yourself into one of America's enemies you used your position to justify acts of treason listen if you had even the slightest idea what I've sacrificed for America you'd piss yourself well I respect your rank but I don't have to respect you now this this needs to end am I making myself clear good cuz I would hate to come back here wouldn't be pleasant for either of us you Stephanie Burgess who are you you don't look like Sentinel names Nomad found your name tied to the claw project and an individual known as the strategist I'm investigating the matter and I have some concerns keep your voice down I don't want people to hear us let's get out of town you find someplace safe where we can talk [Music] [Music] like an outcast are you here to stop claw I'm not an outcast law is far too dangerous to stay under Sentinels control I'd like to help you but I can't tell you anything they have eyes and ears everywhere anything I say will be traced back to me what can I do to protect your safety I was planning on running away from all of this but in order to do that I need to disappear from senator Mills database if you can erase my entire existence from The Sentinel files I can talk a lot more freely I'm not trying to be perfect it's super important just lead me in the right direction thank you I'll give you a burner phone call me when you're done don't worry it's encrypted where am I headed there are boats on the shore just west of Liberty City take one and you'll be able to reach the Naval Base that's where my data is being kept okay I'll call you when I'm done [Music] [Music] can you hear me [Music] thank you [Music] yeah details about the location any idea where it is all very useful thank you duh might want to double-check the records we have clean the slate for you you've been scruff in the system think you can talk freely now thanks looking forward to it [Music] risa rendezvous point Stephanie who are you where are you I'm sorry I won't be joining you I can't wait what why I have no choice I need you to disappear we never met getting Stephanie Burgess and I don't like what I'm finding we need to be careful that she's not tipping off the strategist about our activities by the name of Carl Coolidge this part of cause the IP security detail Jarrell seafood doesn't like flawless yeah I guess it's dead we investigate the hell happened here you must be the ghost that I've been hearing so much about you Carol's the Coolidge I am yes You Know Who I am and you know what I do you're being awfully cavalier especially for a wolf I just heard from Stephanie it sounds like she gave you some trouble so you two were close huh well I've been through worse but I'm certainly not too keen on her right now listen I can lead you to her I can even make sure she gives you all the info she has on claw but first I need a favor I'm listening the thing of it is I'm looking to disappear defect as it were from the wolves the corpses in the mission schedule it was all falsified as part of my ploy to escape this life was a pretty severe plan that's not even half of it I wanted others to think I was hot on the ghost trail I had plans to stage a whole ghost operation at the dam where I died in a transformer explosion but then you show up and you thought that dying at the hands of an actual ghost was more credible Jess there disagree something like that I'm glad to hear we're on the same page do me a favor place these on the body you'll also find a radio device on the body so that we can communicate once this is all finished I'll tell you anything you need to know about claw and the strategist works for me [Music] [Music] got the radio yes I was watching from a distance I wouldn't like to do this completely on your own all right I'm forbidden someone is Sentinel is online I don't want them listening hearing us so I've helped you out with your problem can you help me out with mine I consulted the classifieds SpecOps tactics I'm guessing it involved one of your friends why does difficult time with interrogation quite difficult where can I find him I'll send you the details and everything I know what the strategist strongest however and I cannot stress this strongly enough do not attempt to breach the facility without the knowledge of cloth you know that Stephanie had tires had to be topped in the pilot soon I'll set your from a location when you get there I'll make sure she gives you all the Intel she promised looking forward to it deep blue got a minute you know Stephanie Burgess I figure you're gonna want to be on line for this these are about to get interesting well you have a good explanation for all of this if they come after us it'll be your fault Carol I understand listen I'm on your side if we can just get to claw nobody will come after you being a ghost is great and all but you have no idea what you're up against look I work for Lomax Farrell the developers behind Klaw one of the founders is Michael Lomax a u.s. senator from the subcommittee of defense he's been using his influence to create mandates and fund his own research and projects like Klaw so he uses taxpayer money to fund his claw project and he has mandates to develop it that complicates my job the other co-founder is Lomax's associate pharaoh he's the strategist and he's been using all of that money control and power to further this project seems like some very deep state stuff it is whichever US official it was who sent you after Klaw is thinking several steps ahead either they know about the strategist plans or something else is brewing I wish I could tell you more that should be enough info for you to get started I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun digging through this [ __ ] it's time we go the island is locked down where will you go don't worry about us I know a couple of places that will keep us safe keep close to your radio no I'm sure our paths will cross again deep blue you got all that you don't mind me asking who sent you this assignment you're the same way the rest of my assignments to think of it the timing seems a little suspicious it just seems too convenient if someone in the CIA new role is gonna be on lockdown then there's more to this mission than simply capturing the strategist but if they knew about a role their activities might alert that goes worse that we would intervene me or any of the other ghosts got her hands on Farrow weed leaned on him his friends in the Senate and all their private interests it'd be a bad bad scene deep state stuff of conspiracy I know it's hard to believe but you might be working for the wrong side you think about it if slush fund money can control technology like clogged and if it's dictating company and the and there's no telling how deep it runs find anything I found construction blueprints to show away in you figure out what we need to extract a strategist I leaned on a few of the strategist as people they told me what we need to know the blueprints show an emergency escape route we're gonna need to lock the place down first or the strategist my bug heart I got access clothes from one of my friendly little chats I can lock this place down tight good we're also gonna need to take out the Sam launchers before we can call him the Paladin aircraft for exfil well there's an engineer named Holly McKenzie who's agreed to disable the drone swarm guarding a raw contact her when you're ready to dust off she gave you ten minutes of clear skies after that you're on your own then we're set I can get to the strategist but I'll need a distraction done whatever it takes I don't give a [ __ ] the faster we take them down the faster we get to Midas hmm remember slow is smooth and smooth is fast don't let your emotions walk you into a trap you don't worry about me I'm buttoned up good I'll meet you at the base let's move [Music] [Music] I'm gonna go check it out pulled off my shutting down swarm wait I'll be right back - could be in trouble [Music] [Music] [Applause] I still got a few more flights watch this shouldn't take long [Music] you're a relic nomad you belong in a museum the future is here and it's going to kill you [Music] why don't you just die and make way for the true Wonderland [Music] of us even if you take out their flaw you'll never stop the inevitable the future is coming our future Wonderland I want immunity I want to talk to a government official I know things valuable things let's negotiate what's going on playtime's over you think you can stop me you're the old world I can control an army with just my mind ah that's better you get authorization for a ground attack now you keep the pressure on here I'll make sure he gets in front of the right people in Washington other than that I've learned not to promise anything you know I'm sure there's some people at echelon who would love to meet us snake eater like you know I'd find out another day have someone finished business to take care of right that's what really matters never leave her brother behind [Music] you what the hell waitis [Music] [ __ ] Hey look what I found Pope goddamn now it's good to see you brother thanks boss [Music] and you look like [ __ ] yeah well you don't look so good yourself yeah they put a hurtin on me I don't know how much more that I could have taken where's Weaver Weaver didn't make it [Music] hey there's nothing any of us could have done he was a good man [Music] best but the mission continues now I know you're both banged up I'm gonna need your help one way or another you with me good is this thing is far from over [Music] you
