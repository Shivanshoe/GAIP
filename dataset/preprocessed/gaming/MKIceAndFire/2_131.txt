looking for someone ah aidan you might come in handy yes one of my men deserted his post that's serious who was it that's what pisses me off it was a friend a guy named bart maybe it's my fault i know he had it rough here i tried to protect him i guess it wasn't enough to protect him from who the other soldiers they had a problem with him which was their problem not bart's believe me i know what it's like to be the odd man or woman out in old school military culture but here's my problem desertion alone will get him the death penalty but what he took could get others good men killed what did he steal let's call it a map that's all i can tell you the rest is on a need to know basis only and you don't need to know you need me to track him down yes with everything going on i just don't have the manpower to spare but i must get that map back okay i get the map but what about bart when you bring the map back just tell me where he is and leave the rest to me it's my job okay where should i start looking try his bunk it's in the barracks a deck above us can i ask anyone about bart sure he was pretty well known whether he liked it or not he was popular among the new recruits try asking mateo he's usually hanging around the armory then there's magda never had a kind word to say about bart nor anyone for that matter she works in the hospital on the next floor okay i think i can take it from here good luck aiden i hope the kids are all right haven't seen him for weeks [Music] tell me what's up with you instead yesterday my youngest session when i grow up i want to hit the winner not work on the boat like you and daddy they wouldn't do that [Music] stop one wrong move and i skewer you like a pig you so you're a thief tell me about this [ __ ] you this is my apartment get out now before i call the guard i'll go for it sure they'd want to know about your poison too so you found josh and he said that i tried to poison him right yeah and that you're currently conning a man so that'll turn over his shop and money to you right except you've got plenty of experience killing right hey we all got our ways to survive if mine is to have chumps throw their money at me and their way is to throw all their money at me well win-win i say but i've never killed anyone no way why should i believe you you took the drums word for it why not take mine hey there's more than that here remember four dead men all while involved with you what makes you think i killed them and not oh i don't know the virus or zombies look wet behind the ears that's medicine my mother was a medic and taught me a few things it's nothing just a disagreement a loud one i guess what's that in your hand got an anonymous tip to search this apartment for poison there's talk of a murder if this really is poison as suspected this woman will hang tomorrow you've got to help me you hear me please i'm not a murderer find baba she has a shelf on saint paul island she'll pair my name she's a privilege show her what you found [Music] [Music] [Music] so i need to find out if this is a poison can you help me it's urgent you don't need me take a swig and we'll both find out soon enough i'm serious a woman's life literally hangs in the balance come on help me damn it you fight for this woman yet she is not the one you struggle to find [Music] familiar and yet yes you must bring me the proper reagents reagents there's no time can this go faster fast as you want to down that bottle boy are you again fine i'll get you reagents where they're scarce but you might find some in the gre field hospital in the cathedral [Music] [Music] detected ah uh hmm oh [Music] protected ugh you're back i thought maybe you'd given up on your lady friend [Music] with reagents from the gre is this poison let us see carefully stirring i hold my breath will this heal or bring on death um what was that the kid is like that a little rhyme to pass the time so is it poison not at all these are antibiotics why i haven't seen antibiotics by years so those couldn't be used to kill anyone not likely these were made by a skilled herbalist exceptional work i could go on but didn't you see someone's life hangs in the balance [Music] you're just jealous your daddy wanted to spend time with someone else than you you warned him you ruined us you [ __ ] jolly what are you doing here i'm watching justice finally being served hey zip it ladies it's a prison not a wet market wait meijer it's not poison they're antibiotics antibiotics [ __ ] there have been no antibiotics for 20 years get the [ __ ] out of here it's true she made him i'll bite you drink down that stuff and prove it's not poison bottoms up sunshine otherwise she hangs i trust the baba down the hatch [Music] i hereby bear witness this man drank the contents of this container this is no poison in light of this new evidence elena will be set free no this can't end like that thank you aiden i owe you my life where will you go anywhere long as it's far from here they loaded my apartment during the night i have nothing left here i certainly am too well known to play my usual trade any longer oh well onto greener pastures as they say you know she would have taken everything from us you did the right thing reporting her to the guards i did what you asked i found what you needed to know jolly what is he talking about oh just a little competitive research dad to boost business wait here i'll be right back you failed aiden elena's still alive oh now the deal was to find out the truth not kill her how did you convince your father to call the guards on her it wasn't easy but i panicked didn't know if i could trust you turns out i couldn't just get away from me i don't want to look at you ever again [Music] [Music] [Music] back to the outlands keep that what a sweet sweet killing machine [Music] hey you mateo we've met new dawn park you were looking for lieutenant ro you saved me from the renegades oh right

you want i'm busy i'm trying to find someone a man named bart you familiar with him bart [ __ ] yes don't get me started ah so you know him yep but i got no time to talk to you especially about a perv like bart besides boss says i got to watch my mouth that's [ __ ] if you ask me can't tell me anything i just did you [ __ ] do i have to spell it out for you people like that shouldn't be around children if you ask me but that's all i'm saying i see thank you gotta report to supply after my shift [Music] you garrett i'm trying to find bart i hear you know him maybe i'm not depends your friend to fall uh undecided cute listen you can count me as one of bart's friends when asked for those rumors that bart's done something wrong total [ __ ] [ __ ] give me a break whatever's going on it's a setup i'm sure the other pks are behind this which pks throw a rock you'd probably hit one and it'd bounce off and hit another and so on how did they set up one of their brothers like this don't believe everything you hear about dignity and brotherhood around here i see except you know where bart might be i don't but even if i did don't know if i tell you mr undecided right well thanks for the insight [Music] can i ask you a question okay but then scram before we both get in trouble um looking for a guy named bart you know sure do he's famous not in a good way have you been acting suspicious or anything lately i don't know never met him actually fresh off the boat as of today ah got it uh thanks yeah hope you find him i'd be happier knowing i don't have to bunk with a guy like that interesting i'll keep looking find something hmm you know anything about this not really but it's good full cream work if you ask me who drew it couldn't tell you i've seen bart be pitches like this off and on over the last year but as far as i know he doesn't have children of his own ah children mine are all grown not all is still alive either sadly but i remember when they were young and happy drawing constantly they scribbled their way through boxes and boxes of crayons the kid who drew that he's a happy kid well if bart doesn't have kids where to get it probably a child of a friend or something he was kind to everyone here there everywhere unless you were a bully hmm this doesn't help now what do i do you might ask stack over at the canteen seen them together a few times bart helped him when he was in some trouble helped everyone a lot thanks i'll go talk to that star [Music] where is [Music] good seeing you [Music] who doesn't know bart what's this all about anyway that's between bart and me bart's my friend buddy if it involves bart it involves me you want info you're gonna tell me why you're looking for bart fair enough now he's been accused of theft well that's nonsense that is bart is honest as the day is long he's got no reason to steal from anyone the ceo doesn't want to believe it either you mean meyer you hear any other [ __ ] about bart i left his post he's accused of desertion son of a [ __ ] he finally went for it good for him good for them if i were you i'd just leave him be we all should this probably happened cause meyer can't keep a leash on her men that's all i've been told trust me a lot of other pk have had it in for bart since day one meyer's respected mostly but when it came to bart her men refused to follow her lead i trust you so i'll tell you this bart's loyal military but he had another side like the outdoors always out near the fields as the field workers on top of the old office building at the intersection of van peele and st paul boulevard it's right here in new dorne park thanks i'll do just that [Music] how you doing [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] i keep telling everyone i'm looking for bart hasn't been here for a while might be watching andy's kid been doing that more and more lately andy yeah bart's friend and he's got the cutest kid liam the way bart acts you'd think that he was liam's father huh where can i find him don't riley no i've only seen them when they brought lame here but you could ask around thanks for the tip i've never believed the night runners were real just fairy tales if you ask me you know a guy named bart of course is he here i mean he usually brings me books and i'm excited for the next one i see i'm looking for him actually damn i really want to talk to bart about the last book he loaned me the bhagavad-gita man some of the material in that book was well challenging to say the least just because you got holes in your shoes doesn't mean you're poor if you got no one to lean on that's when you know you hit rock bottom aidan you've traveled through the outlands any other city still standing you heard people say the night runners are back god i hear pks were butchered in the vnc tower i had a feeling it would end the same way hi looking for bart can you tell me anything about him oh for one you're not his type wait wait what relax honey i was just pulling your leg the look on your face my to answer your question i can tell you that bart is as fine a man as i've ever known high praise i know but i'm not just talking his looks he's brave kind karen loves children especially andy's son liam andy bart's bestie andy those two are like two peas in a pot and liam he's well like a spring pea i guess how bart thoughts on that boy hmm so where can i find him probably at andy's they had a few of us up for some cool drinks just yesterday such kind souls up where andy's place is over there not far you can get there quicker if you're any good at climbing yeah good to know thanks a lot my pleasure you tell those boys i said hi [ __ ] me people will always complain hmm i bet i know who this belongs to i can't be far huh steve what does this mean looks like i'm in luck let's have ourselves a little chat introductions are norther i presume no uh why do you ask no then you must be andy nope wrong again then stop wasting my twin and tell me who you are a competitor apparently so you're after back too i am huh she must be really jonesing for what bert's thoughts she's heard in any old tom ticker hardy i didn't realize this was a horse race either normally situations like this piss me off but if moyer hired us both means we're on the same side i can share an intel so did you dig up nada besides not sure how being hired by the same person makes us partners suddenly then get the [ __ ] out of my way and let me work [Music] stop aiden here you familiar with some guy named steve you mean slippery steve what's he got to do with bart i don't like the sound of that for sure i know steve haven't you met him he comes to the canteen most nights stay close to your radio i'll let you know when he shows up you too can have a chat then thanks doc aiden out [Music] [Music] yeah steve just rolled in he's in the main room with a deck of cards scrawling his name on the joker inhibitor container detected [Music] inhibitor container [Applause] where are you i'm near the dam meet me and then we'll go to the observatory that's the place you're looking for but the observatory's soaked in chemicals find me in the two-story building squeezed between the dam and the promenade boxes to your door right here so this car belonged to you well it sure does where'd you find it how may i serve you well you can serve me by telling me what you know of bart and andy never heard of him even if i had i take client confidentiality very seriously and i take finding them very seriously how seriously stop [ __ ] with me talk unless you want the pks to know you're hiding their fugitive are you out of your [ __ ] mind i ain't hiding no one it's so what you'll have to explain yourself to him so talk fine your bobsy twins hired me to make sure they and their kid got to the colonel safely paid well easy job really but we ran into a peacekeeper patrol along the way nasty bunch ugh your boys freaked the hell out worried about the kid and happy to leave them right then and there i mean what do i care they paid up front all right then tell me where you left them okay there's an old coffee shop not far from here by the off-ramp from the e-12 by a metro stop you can figure it out from there watch yourself i'm telling you signs of a fight recent too very recent the weapon broke looks familiar they're hiding nearby based on this they gotta be oh ugh oh yes who the hell are you and what do you want whoa calm down yeah i'm just here to talk you look familiar you bart yeah you're eating demeyer sent you yeah she told me to find you and get back what you stole but i talked to star and more than a few others about you maybe think there's more to this situation than meets the eye meyer tried but she couldn't help i couldn't take it anymore day after day will you two keep it down liam's asleep in the next room whatever your personal issues are desertion and theft are serious she plans to center men for you she'll get a lot of volunteers for the search team i'll be executed on the spot if they find me probably why she sent you give me a running start so you did steal the map it isn't a map per se but tells the location of some secret pk stash weapons i bet it's all i could think of to offer in exchange for the colonel granting safe haven to the three of us i see like hell people like you never do you never see andy stay out of this it's too late for that you know it [ __ ] this map or stash or whatever the [ __ ] it is the pk are the monsters here surely you understand you've taken this from me by now if you didn't is that what you think i do if you go back to meyer and tell her you've killed us i'll give you the coded message and my dog tags do this please just let us be i sympathize but desertion and theft are serious crimes and i have a job to do please this isn't desertion this is survival not just for me but andy and liam as well would you please just help us none of you deserve this least of all liam i'll help you oh thank god andy you've ate in the message and my dog tags it's okay if you say so i had planned on going to the ship's library finding a book or two that could help me decipher it but things went south real quick i didn't have time to check maybe i'll check i'm curious what this is all about just don't get caught or you'll be right behind us assuming you don't get caught she'll never see us again you're better off not going to the colonel anyway you know they call him the butcher right we don't have a choice what do you do stay here for now till we figure out what to do next yeah i wouldn't recommend that if i could find you here others could just as easily you should keep moving you're right we got to keep a low profile in any case but at least we're alive and we'll be together i wish you all luck take care looks like we got a real party going on here you're clint's man i gather yep you weren't kidding you're a real bloodhound to track these pervs down like you did wait there i'll handle this well look who we have here managed to escape our boss did you kind of wish one of you had gone down would've meant bigger shares of the bounty for the rest of us it'll certainly be a bigger share with you out of the picture you gonna walk away or have we gotta convince you violently [Music] you talk tough think you can back that up oh we're gonna back it up all right kill him enjoy killing you you're safe they can't hurt you now if only that was the last of our worries don't talk like that we're alive thanks to aiden i suppose what'll happen to us now one step at a time andy let's get packing quickly good idea you don't want anyone else finding you [Music] ah you're back and and your boy clint was a real charmer thanks for that look i had to double down on finding bart tell me you found him at least i did and here's his dog tax he's a little too dead right now to need them anymore but aiden you weren't supposed to kill him even i wasn't gonna let that happen he attacked me i had to defend myself i i see but the map tell me you at least got the map nope [ __ ] what happened to it from what i can tell he realized he was in over his head and ditched it the whole point had been to keep the boys safe and he played it wrong damn it not knowing where it is could be worse than knowing it fell into enemy hands if it'll make you feel any better you can send the team to where i found them building not far from the freeway overpass that'll help won't stop the [ __ ] storm if we still can't find the map though sounds rough forget about it just get out of here i gotta figure out how i'm gonna break this [ __ ] to matt okay then i'll catch you [Music] until later i thought our chances to get some red guys pretty good now i'm not so sure [Music] let me go i'm innocent [Music] tell me what's up with you instead i don't know recently i had the honor of getting chewed out by raven's mouth he took the effort to do it again yes you come here i'm albert and from what i hear you're aiden you have quite the reputation my boy for being fearless for boldly crisscrossing the city at night as if it were broad daylight you believe all that at first i didn't believe because a pilgrim's always a guy with some kind of dark past abandoned rebel and outcast but from what they say about you i'm sure whatever you've heard is an exaggeration nonsense my boy i have something you probably don't come across all that much faith faith in you i'd be careful with that it's no time to be careful my boy i believe that your strength determination and courage are just what you need to retrieve priceless treasures before they are lost forever before mankind is plunged irrevocably into the intellectual and philosophical dark ages so your books then this isn't about dime store paperbacks boy i'm talking about the greatest works of literature ever created through the eons of human existence the greatest thought pieces philosophical treatises works of romance drama and horror all of which serve to illuminate and uplift humanity itself losing such a heritage would reduce us to cave men with no better way to express ourselves than through savage grunts as we scratch crude figures on walls sure how can i help work with me please to find and secure these treasures i've been researching the local private book collections if i'm right many priceless volumes may be found all around the city of course many of the dwellings are now infested by these horrible creatures of the night that's where you come in here take this list each title on it corresponds to one of the many facets of humanity fail to save them and the diamond of mankind will dull and shatter like cheap glass remember we are not simply creatures of flesh and blood but also of mind and ideas i am charging you with the salvation of the very spirit of man right i'm often [Music] hey albert i got a question for you you know i appreciate a curious behind my boy ask away do you have any books on ciphers or code breaking oh a fascinating subject then are you familiar with alan turing he pioneered code breaking and in fact is considered the man who invented computers back in world war ii brilliant man and what thanks did he get from his government chemical castration and an ignoble death poor man well um just looking for some books albert of course of course looking to be more useful to the pk are you by all means from what i can see this book on the bacon cipher should do the trick and i have another two volumes on codes if you're feeling studious you'll be able to find them on the shelves nearby all right thanks albert [Music] [Music] [Music] so until today i thought our chances against renegades were pretty good but now i'm not so sure this is the drop point for the coded message [Music] ugh [Music] it's an emergency somebody there who's there i have a man in dire need of a healer shh she's asleep she'd be awake soon it's an emergency always an emergency like the time that young woman needed a potion to induce labor and the guy who needed herself for his hernia and what else was there please wake her up a man's life is in danger it better be if i find out he just has a hangover i'll wake her up but you'll still have to wait i haven't seen you before how'd you know where to find us from the peacekeepers then you've come to the wrong healer get out haven't you all made her suffer enough and now those renegades there'd been a ceasefire for years they left us alone and then all of a sudden they went mad where were you when they were taking over the island for the first time we really needed you and what you didn't come and they're gone i just took care of them i don't believe you you're lying just to get what you want like all peacekeepers do we have a visitor gerard i'll be there in a moment it's a peacekeeper why does it matter is it peacekeepers life of less value listen you arrogant little [ __ ] your people call healers like margaret witches people fear healers when they could be helping people then one wrong move and you peacekeepers are quick to hang them so you ask if a peacekeeper's life is worth less it is to me worth less far as i'm concerned well i'm not a peacekeeper i'm only trying to help one all the same to me let him in gerard i'm just a messenger a doctor sent me his name's steven doctors shun folk healers these days using a folk remedy would harm his reputation it already has he sent me to you against the wishes of the man's family gerard yes you said there was a man he saved us from the renegades is this the man what's your name boy aiden so you are the one who saved us we owe you a great debt and who is the dying man his name's ader he's a high-ranking officer margaret don't if something goes wrong you'll be blamed again but if this goes well perhaps it's a chance to help more people [Music] [Music] blamed again what do you mean the last peacekeeper to ask me for help blamed me for his own incompetence gave his wounded soldiers the wrong herb despite my clear instructions and several died blamed it all on me i'm only still alive because jack matt deigned to be merciful decided it was a tragic accident he spared my life but took my eyes [Music] this mean you'll help me i'm out of the herbs you need but i can tell you where to find them you'll be looking for a flower called the recluse it thrives in soil soaked in toxic sludge you will be able to pick it up safely only at night when its petals glow but it's not enough to simply pick it willy-nilly only the small petals have the healing qualities beware of the big ones they contain deadly poison can you remember that small petal teal big one's poison i'll remember we'll regret this i assure you you're the one i need your help sure you do what's up i'm looking for an herb it's called the recluse oh yeah i'm familiar with it i think those funny flowers grow by the canal north of all saints bridge that's where i look it's a lead and actually i'd wait until night oh thanks ugh [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] oh maybe it'll go away on its own he's starting to wake up thank you for your help you can go wait what's going on here you went to the witch didn't you to this margaret she gave me herbs that might help him she's not a witch there's no such thing as witches that's superstition

they always should have been well good for her and for all of old vilidor [Music] i'm looking for dr veronica ryan you're not the only one man what do you mean the good doctor's in trouble and uh weird kind of trouble you see a group of renegades appeared in old villadore first we braced ourselves for another battle but they didn't attack the bizarre just ask for dr ryan of course we didn't tell them where she is and where is veronica you can tell me right in a hideout vincenzo and a few of our people are protecting her there but the less people know about that place the safer she is where is it barney if the renegades are hunting veronica a few people may not be enough you just can't walk away from a fight can you the building is north of quarry end courtesan rose street but you didn't hear it from me and you why are you here and not with vincenzo and the rest i want it to be but sophie talked me out of it said something about not wanting them to have to deal with my attitude what attitude for [ __ ] sake i have no idea okay [Music] thanks for the info i'll go and give him a hand the folks say i'm the one always itching for a fight anyway good luck man sometimes i wake up at night forget the fall even happened that's about the only time i smile then i [Music] in the middle of the bazaar [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] renegade [Music] myself oh uh you will talk

veronica veronica are you safe veronica [ __ ] something's not right yes i'm safe are you oh i am now there is someone who needs to speak to you yeah dr ryan i'm aiden i know that you're being hunted by the renegades hurry aidan more renegades may be here any minute frank told me you worked for the gre i need access to the gre database in the observatory i i have a gre key a gre access key that's what i've been told you think you can let's meet i'll be in a small building near the dam not far from the observatory okay okay hello be careful aiden the place is soaked in chemicals i will thanks for the heads up vincenzo thank you i'm lucky you showed up farewell aiden farewell hmm oh yes [Music] uh oh my god [Applause] [Applause] uh it's had a feeling we'd cross paths sooner or later you patched up barney right he whimpered like a baby soon as he saw the needle and those renegades why are they after you probably the same reason as you to access the gre database what do you want from it aiden why are you risking so much i'm looking for my sister your sister was in the gre she no she was a prisoner i haven't seen her in 15 years a prisoner you mean a test subject i don't know what i'll find she's she's the only family i've got the only answer to what waltz has done to us welts he held us there had a hobby of experimenting on kids did you know about that i was only a mid-level doctor aiden i'm sorry want to know anything else or can we go why are you helping me are you looking for something in the database as well aiden those vaults contain my organization's biggest secrets i almost died because i was a part of it i need to know what they were hiding what if you don't like what you discover nothing ventured nothing gained how did a gre doctor wind up at the bazaar by not letting anyone know i was a gre doctor after the revolution the gre were blamed for the disaster personnel were rounded up and executed people used revenge to relieve the pain doesn't matter if it doesn't work what happened happened now i'm someone else how are you planning to get us inside the observatory look there's a security tunnel into the complex it was locked up years ago give me the key aiden are you sure the key is functional well it has been maybe the problem is that the building has no electricity is there any other way to get in there it depends how much we're prepared to risk a lot if you ask me okay then come with me i have something to show you uh then hmm see those domes sure but the place is flooded with chemicals the gre had a solution for that when they created the thv gen mod they had to protect their employees from exposure with the thv what the chemicals they came up with blockers shots that would shield their workers for a few minutes from the fumes fortunately i still have two doses had a feeling they'd come in handy one day well those must be worth a pretty penny they are extremely rare for now we will need only one for you wait you're not coming no i will join you but first i'd like you to restore the power to the building you see i have panic attacks when i'm in tight spaces or in the dark now you probably think i'm a coward not at all i think it took guts to come here so let's do this when you get there first restore the power then i'll be able to join you hold out your arm remember the shot shields you from the chemicals for a limited time only can't i take the other one too no not at the same time this stuff's too strong go as fast as you can to the smaller dome and from there to the higher one you should find a door leading inside there you'll be safe then head to the b block there you should find the building's main circuit breaker as soon as you turn on the electricity the security door will unlock and i can join you by going through the tunnel i showed you now go the blocker is working the locker is working time that blocker won't protect you forever just go good job warning main power circuit malfunction in block b emergency protocol initiated i made it through the chemicals to the first dome great now just get to the second one find a door a hatch or whatever leads underground right [Music] veronica found the entrance so far so good how do you know this place so well by the way i was here just once long ago but i have a good memory that sounds useful well sometimes it's a curse really veronica i have a hornet infected here [ __ ] i hoped it would be empty by now well it isn't i don't know if i can get through use the uv flashlight on your belt that you keep them at bay just don't stop aiden ah [Music] [Music] uh veronica i made it the electricity's on great the security tunnel is open i'll try to take the elevator down to you this place was quite the hive plenty of infected but i got rid of them they deserve respect aiden what what's going on the elevator it stopped i see i think it blew a fuse i'm checking do something quick please don't worry i'll fix it please don't leave me here don't be afraid i just need a moment don't meet me don't leave me [Music] oh my god please please let me out [ __ ] aiden i knew something let me out i'm working on it just let me let me out [Music] i'm not sitting on my hands here veronica try to breathe slowly don't leave me just don't leave me here shouting won't do anything except attract infected calm down i won't leave you [Music] [Music] veronica i'll meet you by the elevators [Music] are you all right see told you everything would work out just get in [Music] [Music] you always been claustrophobic seriously for over 10 years so what happened then aiden for god's sake can we not talk about this right now the database where is it just give me a moment below us even farther than this another six floors down this is a pretty high tech before the gre this complex was run by the military they used it to monitor threats rocket attacks that sort of thing that's why they called it the observatory then the virus came and that was the end so what happened here in the end well the gre lost control of the situation and it all went to hell everything collapsed from what i know the scientists at first barricaded themselves inside but soon conditions in here were as bad as they were in the city so some of them quietly slipped out and those who stayed are the ones you got rid of earlier so the military ran this place before the gre yes it used to be a cold war command bunker cold war a period in the last century wars back then were fought on a grander scale it wasn't just about day-to-day matters like having enough water uv lamps and food scraps in a way though it was just like things are now people lived every day in constant fear that's quite the story they used to call places like this witnesses to history great dark again wait i'll try and figure something out if we have electricity here we could use it to power up the whole floor [Music] so you
