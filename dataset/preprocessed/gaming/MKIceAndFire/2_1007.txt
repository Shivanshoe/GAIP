everything's fine [Music] oh come on why do i still have this every time i look at it it reminds me of how very single i am all set i think still need to find those damn house keys i should probably check my email one more time before i go no i've already done that three times this morning [Music] michael and tyler are so gonna hit it off it's gonna be so crazy to see him after all these years is he gonna like this or is it too much i need to bring this with me to juno i should probably get rid of this i mean i can stream it anytime i want but it makes me happy just to look at the box not here i have got to make solid plans to see the geminids i wonder if tyler'd want to go oh ooh i can't wait to force tyler to watch this with me he's totally gonna hate it oh right i stashed them down here so that's where you've been hiding all right i think i'm ready to go now one more season what am i even gonna do with myself when it's over get invested in the lives of real people i don't really have time to dig through this right now probably not going to see any stars at this time of day not the prettiest of my creations but she weirdly kind of looks like me in the morning [Music] i could look at this artwork all day i haven't practiced since high school i'm probably super rusty uh allie she's gonna be so awkward so i can't believe i'm about to leave this room for the last time okay i'm pretty much done here i just need to grab my goblin and i'm off uh gonna miss these dum-dums problems i have to leave this behind but the old house would probably collapse if i blasted this inside i've been listening to this in a loop lately man the soundtrack to my angsty teen years i'll leave it for the next rebel they're gonna need it more than i do and he's going places and i'll be able to say i helped him on his way hmm is there any way i can no that's someone else's problem now man i'm gonna miss that view i know most of these by heart at this point i wish i could have finished this before i left but god it was a slog hey little guy you're gonna be reunited with your sister soon cool i guess i'm totally ready to go now the crafty goblins are two cunning little thiefs who live under the princess's house they're always getting into mischief but they have good hearts bye herbert [Music] you stay here educate the youngsters in classic cinema denali i need to get my application ready for next summer [Music] [Music] hi tyler hi first time we see each other in 10 years and it's hi tyler oh sorry i it's fine alison hi is a good place to start god it's good to see you [Music] likewise you have anything else you need to get nope this is it my last 10 years in a bag then we should get going we just have time to make the morning ferry you look good in that thanks one of my mentees designed it that's really good yeah he's so incredibly talented i got a couple of local coffee shops to hang his arm tyler ronan shaping the leaders of tomorrow yup we're screwed so are you gonna miss anything about this place honestly people the other residents my mentees my counselor aaron took me a while to fit in but once i did it felt like home they made me feel safe safe enough to be me that's so great i'm really happy for you we planning to drive to delos crossing or push you are welcome to walk nah i'll take my chances need one last look or anything looked let's go [Music] [Music] no really i am 100 not creative enough to make that stuff up oh and just last week they had to turn the ferry around because a bear was on board no way someone heard a commotion in the back of a delivery truck so they opened it up and there was the bear fat and happy on a literal mountain of empty chip bags you go where the food is oh i can relate to that so then what happened i'm not sure i think they couldn't get him to leave so they tranqed him oh poor buddy shot in the ass just forgetting the munchies yeah well you know what they say safety first and bear country yeah but prevention is best common sense goes a long way in keeping them from getting shot the bear is fine tyler for now you hear they've been talking about loosening up regulations on trophy hunting again higher bag limits inhumane ground traps even bringing back hibernation hunting what kind of [ __ ] gets off on killing a sleeping animal i'm not against hunting but predators play a vital role in the health of our natural parks what why are you smiling i'm being serious oh i can tell ranger tyler not yet but at least i got the school part out of the way i can't believe you've got a bachelor's already while i boast a half-completed certificate in accounting from an online college that may have stolen my credit card number you'll figure out what you want you have time how are you feeling like i'm about to drive straight into a white out and my fog lights are dead what about you allison well zoned out there for a second sorry what's up i'm sorry i'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that you're right here standing beside me on our way to delos you don't have to apologize it's a lot [Music] why did we take the ferry instead of the coast road because i didn't want to be stuck in the car with you for an extra two hours ha ha we have to take the ferry it's the only way to reach delos from fireweed i see well good i don't think my stomach could have taken two more hours of how you handle curves i'm sorry do you want to take over driving when we dock no you're gonna have to get back behind that wheel at some point you know look i put a fireweed van nose first in a ditch hey at least you missed the porcupine i'm guessing things haven't changed much you mean in delos still the capital of east jesus nowhere can't wait to get out of here was it really that bad pretty much but it could definitely have been worse like if you'd been tucked away in a center for troubled youth right at least you had michael yeah i don't think i'd have survived high school without him bet you're gonna miss him when you move to juneau how's he doing good good good but i haven't seen him much outside of work lately he's been busy with his dance and helping his clan organize a potlatch [Music] is that smoke coming out of stonehouse guess someone finally bought that old shack that or the ghosts are cozying up by the fire think the new owners know it's totally haunted i'm sure tina did her best to keep them from figuring it out at least until the paperwork was signed ugh that house always gave me the crepes those windows are like huge gawking eyes you think people talk about our house this way probably so we're really going back there huh just stone house and then we're going home yeah yeah we are think the house will sell no interested buyers yet turns out people don't line up to buy murder houses with no electricity at least it's got one hell of a view unlike juno hey juno has mountain views of plenty it just also has people and fun you still thinking you might be my roomie i'm thinking about it hey can i ask you a question [Music] shoot i was told i'm i mean after you well graduated i guess and became a mentor three years ago you still basically spent all your time at fireweed right pretty much there were a few times i tried to go to these meetups for trans people in juno but something always came up i probably should have put myself out there more but it was better to be around in case the residents needed me so you were free to come and go as you pleased yeah uh why do you ask oh nothing just being an overly invested sister curious how you spent your time [Music] alison yeah [Music] spit it out okay you need to promise not to freak out what is it [Music] it's a gift from eddie i know he's not your favorite person but i'm sorry when you said eddie i thought you meant chief brown as in the police officer who arrested me come on ty don't and your adopted father the man who didn't let you visit me for seven years the fireweed administration backed him up tyler they thought it was best for both of us yeah well it wasn't it's a peace offering and you're the two most important people in my life please for me he can't buy my forgiveness with some cheap ass trinket it's a gift tyler you know what gift-giving means in clinkett culture and what it means to refuse one i can't accept this i'm just not there yet all right you gonna mope about that for the rest of the day or what i just hoped you might make an effort that's all an effort it's an effort not to punch something whenever you say his name can you just cut him a break he was doing the best he could with a truly shitty situation did you hear that [Music] whoa so i'm a jerk you just always need to have the last word in other words a jerk i didn't need to dig in like that i'm sorry i'm sorry too i just hoped we could wrap everything up with a grand gesture and move on to our perfectly normal lives what this isn't normal still your brother still your sister would it ruin the moment if i said i needed to call home uh yes completely sorry go ahead and stop apologizing all the time okay sorry thanks it's so weird being back on this boat he he wasn't ready to take it i'm sorry uncle yeah the drive took longer than i thought it would more on the ferry right now uh-huh i know i know yeah i've been driving in this stuff for five years i'll be fine that's not going to happen okay see you soon yikes hey i heard that hey man it's your truck you do you same to you live and let live just a sticker enjoying the ride i'm more of a dry land firm ground kind of guy i hear you but this sure beats a city any day where are you headed uh delos crossing same here you from around here born and bred oh you don't say i have moved anchorage around your age delos was mostly alaskan natives then clay kid hyder i haven't been home in five years oh so you owed your family a visit i'll say you may not know it yet but your folks they get old real fast right i'm alex by the way alex gershwin no relation huh george gershwin um gershwin the pianist folks are always asking for related so i try to head it off in the past oh uh would you say your name was i didn't i'm tyler tyler ronin i uh ronan huh ronan as in the roland's uh huh so uh i never knew those girls had a brother we didn't uh hi nice talking yeah enjoy your time in town tyler i'll see you around town isn't hunting season almost over almost want to draw for one of the last hunts of the season whoa look at that antique you're not one of those odd six is old and boring folks are you wonder if there'll be time to hit the buzzard hole while i'm here what's that note oh uh nothing what a waste of a good punk hey again fancy meeting you here damn watch the cell footage you sent me seeing it for real is wild yeah it was terrible you could smell the smoke all the way over in delos crossing two years later and they haven't cleaned it up at all the company went under after surprise no one else is eager to take it on someone died right yeah it was a crazy day hey didn't we used to swim off that dock wait no that was um oh uh they pulled that one out what no man so many good memories of pushing me into the lake sorry about that kids are dicks yes well i only accept apologies in the form of chocolate deal there's nothing like the open air hey you sent your application to denali yet uh not yet i need way more experience you're not applying to run the entire national park they've got to have something entry-level right yeah but i've done no internships no volunteer work they probably get hundreds of applicants and i've got nothing to show come on you don't know that doesn't hurt to try cannery still going strong huh not sure what people would do around here if it weren't did you make a friend i did we're hitting bernie's tonight to watch the game drink beer and complain about our wives oh sounds like an enchanting evening yeah no he uh spooked at the name ronin i think i'm gonna sit in the car for the rest of the ride yeah i'm good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wow it's basically exactly like i remember it only faded like a polaroid left on a window cell from the outside it almost looks charming charm's not the problem structural integrity may be an issue you think there's a chance whoever buys it will just tear it down if someone buys it they can do whatever they want with it you wouldn't care at all would you sure everywhere i look i see a piece of one of our adventures everywhere i look i just see her alison we could go grab a bite start this tomorrow no the only way to get this done is to do it after you uh did you smoke something before you left fireweed the door's right there locked well it's a good thing i remember this you sure that's the right key yes maybe someone changed the lock who would change the lock on us i don't know we're screwed you got a plan b yeah we find another way in i never knew a locked door that could keep the crafty goblins out yeah we had a million ways in and out of this old house at least one of them's gotta work [Music] the crafty goblins i haven't thought about them in forever or should i say us we almost spend more time as goblins than we did as kids oh do you remember all the other characters the moon hack the ice king the old bear most of them i think but the details are fuzzy hey do you know what happened to the book with all the stories no no idea but i'm sure it'll turn up when we clean this place out how did she get around on these roads with this thing she'd rather have broken her neck than spend money on a new one yeah still waiting for those bikes she promised us uncle eddie got me one but i hardly ever used it at least the shed's still standing yep i don't want to think about what might be living inside it though well better alive than dead ugh yes let's deal with that later plenty else to do first [Music] hey it's locked all right what was she doing out here that night come on man stop thinking about that she did not like us using her tools she was probably just afraid we'd hurt ourselves or she thought we'd go on a rampage and tear up her precious plants and we would have so well at least the tools are still here that'll help with the repairs they're good quality too mary anne wanted stuff like that to last homemade cleaning products may be better for the planet but they do not have the same shelf life oh add it to the shopping list i can't believe these are still here yeah we should hide them so they don't frighten away potential buyers remember how mad she'd get if we didn't use the compost and she always knew when we were lying waste not or kiss the planet goodbye you need a hand with that no it should be fine okay all right if we just get this board out of the way i could probably squeeze through so we need something to pry it off it screwed in pretty good we need a screwdriver i think i saw one back in the shed let's go check uh you really want to go out there no you're right okay there should be something in here that i guess mary anne left us something useful huh yeah we still have to find a way to get inside though and please no broken windows we'll see ya what's happening do you feel that and don't leave this room until everything looks as clean as a whistle ugh this is the millionth time i've gotten in trouble because of you you and your big mouth hey you were thinking the same thing you just weren't brave enough to tell her what good would it do it's not like she ever listens to us anyway well i'd rather scream it right in her stupid face than be a quiet little mouse oh we forgot the key we need to put it back maybe we could hide it somewhere you know for fun goblins are supposed to help the princess not play mean tricks whatever you're not fun i'm only trying not to make her even worse whoa did that just happen i don't know but i saw it too it felt like it did when we used to share thoughts with our voice it did but that was a memory of us 10 years ago right i vaguely remember it happening i think so and uh that's new right yeah we could share thoughts and feelings but we never replayed memories like that why would it happen and why that memory i don't know it's pretty eerie it's weird but our voice was always a good thing this could be too i'm feeling something again near the barn yeah me too hurry let's go see the silent frog coming i'm coming what stop sulking i told you already i'm sorry no you're not okay guess you don't want to see what i put in the treasure room then what no i want to see [Music] i guess we know where to search now we just have to remember which one is the silent frog so which one of you is hiding the key nothing here damn where's the key seriously kidding oh come on okay okay sorry nice job keeping a secret buddy huh who left this box here it looks brand new it wasn't me has someone been out here recently guess it's your lucky day bird friends got it all this for a screwdriver you got a better idea how to get in are you sure you want to go in there this was our very first den remember who knows what lives down there now everything okay down there tyler oh that's not funny then why am i laughing okay fine but you're still an idiot all right i'm going in for real this time okay i'll see you at the front door in a few minutes ouch are you okay what happened i just hit my head like an idiot wait wait where are you ty i'm outside but i can hear you in my head our voice it's back holy [ __ ] i don't suppose you remember how to get to the hatch i think so we'll figure it out together dragons straight ahead need to go left i think you were right nothing here of course i was [Music] the mad hunter is a cruel and ruthless creature once he starts hunting someone he never stops he'll chase his prey to the ends of the earth if he needs to no one can escape his piercing eye i would have taken gold not even in your dreams [Music] then left again after the goblins wow can't say i ever expected to see you again it's been a long time buddy wow can't say i ever expected to see you again it's been a long time buddy nope it was on the right my bad wait that was our treasure it's just trash we could make treasure out of anything our imaginations were that powerful marianne grilled us about all these missing dishes but a goblin never gives up their treasure pink it always had to be pink past the treasure straight ahead you know i almost convinced myself our voice was just another childhood fantasy me too but we really are connected the mad hunter why am i still afraid to say his name he was mary ann's creation she made all the creepy characters [Music] [Music] tyler are you in there tyler coming [Music] are you okay i'll live good to hear your voice again yeah same here so coming in or what just working up to it [Music] well we're here here we are so how do we get started we figure out what to keep what to trash and see what else this house might be trying to show us wow it doesn't seem real [Music] all right let's see broken shelf broken jar and the washing machine broken the dryer never worked to begin with mary ann thought dryers were straight up evil energy hogs i hated hanging drippy laundry i refused to change for a few weeks once so i wouldn't have to do it we should take down the creepy masks if we don't want to scare the buyers away oh so now you don't want to scare someone with those masks hey i just put on the mask and pretended to be a warrior you were the one who got freaked out by it right not that she ever let me wear him very long huh this bathroom still smells like marianne good scrub and we'll be rid of that too i tried to bury this dress in the backyard but marianne caught me it was a pretty dress yeah well we both know pretty was never my thing [Music] wow i forgot all about her weird concoctions and how she was always testing them on us like we were lab rats handmade soap still here after 10 years impressive you could say that about the entire house what are we gonna do with all her jewelry well i'm certainly not gonna wear it donation pile it is then what would little tyler think if he walked in here right now and saw me string glue duct tape the holy trinity of house repair marianne loved having something to fix yeah well she could have tried a little harder to fix her own head can you picture marianne talking to a shrink no and speaking of therapy is expensive and i'm fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what are you reading a letter we wrote her to apologize for breaking that stupid face remember bore your kids into good behavior great parenting strategy she pinched every penny old textbooks tessa gave them to us right yeah she thought we were gifted [Music] we were just not like she thought you think she knew we were sharing answers we shared for fun we both knew them all anyway [Music] [Music] i don't remember these it's probably one of marianne's unfinished masterpieces there's two of them maybe they were us in some weird way that only made sense to mary ann [Music] she took so many pictures yeah like she had to document every second of our lives it made her happy and it was kind of nice to see her smile i guess you okay all these happy pictures he looks so sad now so staged i know wow i'm so embarrassed for us many da vinci's we were not she saved every drawing we ever did there's a couple of these in my keep she was trying to save the planet way before out warming cool has al gore ever made anything cool nah i guess she was right about one thing but you can't really blame anyone for not listening to crazy marianne ronan [Music] mom about me joining the hockey team mom sorry what not now maybe next year but you promised keep whining and my next year will become never can you cut my hair your hair is fine but i want to cut it short really short what look i'm tired and i'm busy let's talk about this later you always say that [Music] marianne said no to everything made me so pissed she was always on edge those last few months yeah and completely deaf to everything i was telling her i needed she pretty much always said no to me too true but it felt personal with me i didn't realize how much i missed the smell of firewood i missed the cold winter nights curled up here with big mugs of hot cocoa yeah marianne was so tired she was usually asleep on the couch ah that's why it was so nice no marianne we'd use our voice so we didn't wake her up and then we'd be up all night telling stories and watching the fire die and marianne was none the wiser very answer let's not go in there until we absolutely have to agreed if you don't come up soon i'm gonna take whatever i want from our bedroom no way wait for me [Music] know this this feels like home how did you convince me to let you put this up it was my favorite movie back then so much for my dream of being a hockey star mary ann thought sports were too aggressive too competitive and too group-thinky you know if there's one thing you gotta give marianne it's that she let us explore our artistic side he should have seen eddie's face when i tried to repaint his car yeah i bet uncle eddie didn't appreciate your artistic touch i'd rather you call them chief brown if you're gonna be an ass about it look what i found what only our greatest creation the book of goblins seriously he was in that chest the whole time all these stories i had ideas for so many more marianne wrote a lot of them yeah it's one of the only times i remember her being at peace ah where is it you looking for something in particular my diary you never told me about it yeah with the way marianne was i tried extra hard to keep it a secret marianne yeah that day she found out about it [Music] [Applause] mama mom mom where is it what did you do with it what now i can't find my diary i know you stole it give it back sweetie whatever i do it's just for your benefit you read it didn't you you had no right to do that i have the right to do whatever i need to protect my little girl i'm not your girl i hate you you will always be my little girl and no matter how hard you fight me i'll fight twice as hard to keep you safe [Music] i don't know how i never saw it coming she told me right to my face she was willing to hurt me to keep me from transitioning tyler there is no way you could have known she'd go that far [Music] i want my diary back her room was the only place i didn't look okay but do you need to get it like now that diary was important to me allison writing down my thoughts helped me realize who i am [Music] well and let's go find it [Music] you think her room is still locked it always was i'm not looking forward to going in there i know but we'll have to eventually and i need it back wow look how small these beds are we were so little ah some of our old toys give me the creeps [Music] hey you i just found your twin under the house he's seen better days oh this one wasn't mine look it's the game we made lugian tramway that game never made any sense didn't stop us from playing all day dude we were kids all we needed were rocks and bird feathers hey the postcard we sent ourselves from juno forever alone what we barely had any friends we even had to be our own pen pals [Music] the ice king finally caught the hag his furious voice could be heard throughout the forest for your wickedness you will be eternally bound to the lake what no way quiet let me finish you will no longer be allowed to leave not even under a full moon the moon hag was imprisoned in the lake and she never again tried to escape and then the title what do you think not bad right i guess that's okay but i would have changed the end what no the way king i totally forgot about him that's because it was dangerous to mention his name he was too powerful where'd you come from what was she hoping to do with all these jars she used to barter for our clothes with homemade jam she tried everything to make ends meet well not everything guess we never had time to complete the collection these came out of one of the prize machines at the vecchi store right yeah you'd slide the quarters inside on the little tray and then magic out pops a sticker hold up what remember this unfortunately you must solve my riddle to earn the right to enter the princess's sanctum nothing a good hard shove won't take care of i mean yes we could brute force it but it might be kind of fun to finally solve it right we have different definitions of the word fun okay well if we break it we're just gonna have to fix it for the sale so let's at least try not to you have the book of goblins yep hand it over what are you looking for the image on the door it's making me think of a story from the book one that marianne wrote you have a way better memory than me well the book of goblins was my creation and you'll never let anyone forget it here it is the one about the princess's party give it a read i think the symbols may represent something in the story first ghost memories now storybook puzzles what a weird day what a weird childhood touche are you sure you're gonna be able to crack it i uh need some help i've got a few ideas okay i read the story what was i supposed to get from that look at the wheels the symbols are the same as the animals in the story hmm yeah and the princess had to guess who'd given her the presents yes i bet we have to do the same thing so the torch it's supposed to reveal truth and separate good from evil marianne could have used one of those the animal we're looking for kind of sounds like a judge or a cop hmm we didn't have any cops in the stories but maybe just a rule follower yeah i'll keep looking so one of the animals gave her a sword it must have been from someone who wanted to take care of her physically i'm totally stumped by the bag of coins yeah none of the animals were especially rich maybe it's not about the money then maybe it's about wanting to help someone in need any ideas about the torch hmm they mention fairy lights in the story it could be tied to that [Music] and boom we're in [Music] after so many years i expected this to feel more you know like a win [Music] speak for yourself i'm the one who solved the riddle why do i feel like you're not gonna let me forget that where do you think we should start looking i don't know where in this mess would she stash someone else's personal thoughts hmm i tried to read this one i can never figure out the order of the chapters though didn't the author go insane or something no wonder miriam liked it so she was standing here spying through the window drawing us while we played she always had her eye on us my entire body just shivered sewing lessons were the absolute worst she made all our clothes i'm sure she needed the help and i for one am happy i can fix a torn seam straight in the trash no i bet we could sell it on the internet true maybe we could sell it to the guy who collects john wayne casey's clown paintings she and tessa were best friends until suddenly they weren't wonder what happened either tess i got sick of marianne's moods or marianne got sick of tess's judgment [Music] it's here i knew it i [ __ ] knew it do you think she read it of course she was nosy as hell tyler tyler what look what where did you find that it was on her desk with her papers seriously are you [ __ ] kidding me look we gotta be really careful not to overthink this but it doesn't make any sense sh she was mad right she was mad i i cut my hair she attacked me because i cut my hair she was mad and she attacked you we both saw it then what is this [ __ ] i don't know i don't know tyler come here she can't do this to me not now when i've finally made sense of a few things well that was your first mistake thinking the world made any kind of sense [Music] 10 years in the grave and she's still finding new ways to piss us off [Music] i think i need some air [Music] are you really really sure i am do it okay here we go [Music] whoa is it all gone [Music] it looks amazing really yeah i can't wait to show mom she's been so sad lately more than sad she's been scary yeah but not tonight though it was almost like a party [Music] thank you alison you don't have to thank me you're my sister i feel more like like your brother brother sister we look out for each other but i'm pretty sure i just gave you a really bad haircut [Music] mom mom [Music] [Music] god [Music] okay [Music] mom [Music] oh no no no no no this is wrong this is all wrong wait stop [Music] [Music] [Music] glad we found your diary [Music] me too i guess she was trying to figure out where you were at yeah well she should have asked i wasn't some goddamn research project i was her child [Music] about the book raising your transgender child do you even know how rare these books were in 2005 was she trying to figure out how to support me maybe which she wasn't trying she never it doesn't make sense i know you cutting your hair was what set her off right allison she read my diary she already knew it wasn't my hair and if we were wrong about that [ __ ] you think she read it it's possible she never even opened the diary and that things are exactly like we always thought they were but if she did and they aren't god tyler sure i mean we could have been wrong but what good does it do to ask the question now you mean other than not having to live with the thought that my mom tried to kill me for being me tyler i know you want there to be something to find something that'll make it all make sense but she was unhinged so that's it then she was crazy nothing else to say i think we'd be better off if we tried to move on why don't we talk to a few people who knew her see if that book makes any sense to them people don't want to talk about marianne they pretend like that night never happened [Music] what about tessa she was marianne's closest friend let's ask her about it sure but i'll warn you she's particularly touchy about this subject well maybe she'll talk to me i was always her favorite operative word was but we need to go by the store anyway to get a few things for the repairs great two seagulls one stale hunger bread i'm not sure i like that analogy listen i know you don't want to keep talking about this but you're obviously not gonna be satisfied until we do so let's talk so i was thinking do we need to be in such a rush to sell this place oh my god tyler really what everything we thought we knew about marianne just got thrown out the window maybe it did or maybe nothing's changed and we dig up that nightmare for no reason so it's not worth the risk to you not if it means throwing away all our plans your plans it's your plan to sell the house your plan to go to juno me i'm just looking for some goddamn peace of mind how about you start digging without putting off the sale and if it seems like we need more time we'll talk about it then okay you've been on edge all day is there something more going on with you it's nothing pretty sure it's not nothing i'd like us to be on the same page i thought we were on the same page sell this place as quick as possible and move on and then we found the book and things changed you really don't get that it's just with the way you avoided this place for the last three years i thought you wouldn't want to spend any extra time here oh so that's what this is about maybe a little yeah it's just you graduated three years ago and this is the first time we've seen each other in person it's not that i didn't want to see you i just wasn't ready to be tyler in delos crossing i tried to visit you i tried to go to your fireweed graduation i wanted to bake you a crappy boxed cake and take awkwardly posed photos i know but you shut me out all i got was non-responses and half-assed evasions look i didn't want to see anyone i just started testosterone and oh god i had the worst acne my emotions were all over the place and the smells alison the smells men smell bad i know i've dated a few look i needed some time to figure my [ __ ] out before i asked anyone else to try does that make sense yeah yeah it does so we have a plan yep we ask around about marianne but we also stick to our repair schedule sounds good to me ollie's diary it's been a long time since i heard that name was i the only one who ever called you that actually no i used it at fireweed for a while until i settled on tyler most people were pretty chill about the switch not everyone though what do you mean i had a mentee who refused to call me tyler he didn't want my help he didn't want anyone's help i'm sorry i like the name tyler by the way thanks [Music] so [Music] okay [Music] not a bad view right i forgot how beautiful it is remember that time we tried to cross the lake after it froze over oh yeah how can i forget marianne lectured us for an hour well she wasn't wrong at least it was really dangerous if we'd fallen in no more goblins we grew up on this lake we know how to spot thin ice [Music] i think i'd like to end up somewhere like this just not here somewhere with more trees than people exactly just go into it with a little more of a plan than marianne did i think marianne had a plan at some point she had all that survivalist gear a mostly working generator i think she was making it up as she went along maybe but maybe that's just how she was at the end after she lost it at least the glacier's still there you have to wonder just what kind of stories it could tell you know if it had a mouth [Music] remember the ice cave the old bear's den that's the one it would have made a perfect secret base if we'd ever been able to find it again you know i actually went looking for it a few years ago really no way so we found it but the entrance had collapsed ah bummer [Music] nice ring get from your boyfriend come on i told you i'm not with anyone right now don't rub it in why does it look familiar it was a gift from eddie he had them both made at the same time both oh wait yeah this ring is supposed to be linked to the one eddie had made for you you know twins rings something like that oh um that's a little weird but also kind of cool i've still got it right here in my pocket nice try but not today maybe another time though if you squint you could almost forget tell those crossings only a few miles away i'm sure mary ann tried to can't blame her we're headed there for supplies later you ready for that yeah but i was really enjoying a day without [ __ ] just a little longer and every day will be [ __ ] free that might be asking a lot well guess we better get going and here i thought you'd never tear yourself away yeah sorry confused like this i just tend to get lost in them go ahead i'll catch up need to respond to a message my sister the social butterfly [Music] seems we got a trespasser what the [ __ ] you got five seconds to talk piano defending my property your property five four i'm tyler don't know any tylers three two sam ellie what are you doing out here girl this is our house was i talking to you sam put the gun down this is tyler my brother or your brother oh [ __ ] huh i guess i heard about that but [Music] never you look like a real man so do you sam you know what i mean i just didn't know they could make a woman look so much like a man you know i'm just trying to be me it's just who i am hmm well i've seen a couple of lady transvestites on the tv before but uh huh i've never seen a dude sam that's not how you say that say what transvestites yes it's transgender transgender men uh i'm sorry if sorry to keep track out here in delos crossing the world's just moving on without us it's fine let's just change the subject works for me tyler thanks sam [Music] so what are you doing here exactly oh well yeah i've been kind of keeping an eye on this place for you you know it's like patching the roof checking pipes and all that stuff thank you sam oh yeah yeah it's that's no big deal i just you know your mama she was uh she was a special lady she deserved much better than you know uh what you got didn't you used to help mary ann with repairs and building projects oh yeah as soon as your mama never had a man around i just took it on myself to help her keep this place standing how antiquated of you thanks yeah i guess you two are still aiming to sell the place that's the plan which by the way we need your keys since apparently you went and changed the locks oh yeah absolutely but uh selling your mother's house are you sure bad or good it's all you've got left of her not all i'm sure the gun she tried to kill us with is still somewhere in there tyler what what tyler means is a fresh start is what we both need of course this place has got to be full of all kinds of bad memories but maybe some good ones too [Music] but this is pointless he's hammered he's always hammered and who knows maybe it'll make him chatty now come on people think our family is weird enough um everything okay with you two yes no oh all right [Music] how well did you know her not as well as i thought well i heard what happened that night well i figured people were bullshitting me it really surprised you didn't it much as anything ever has other folks say they saw it coming let me [Music] did you help with her door her door the puzzle on her bedroom door oh oh yeah you two kept sneaking in giving her no privacy huh you ever solve it yep better late than never i guess never solved it myself i mean not that i wanted to i i uh uh so uh guess you know all your mama's secrets now huh well she may have one or two left [Music] we should get going that's all you think we'll get out of him [Music] i guess i could ask him a few more questions okay [Music] we should get going that's all you think we'll get out of him [Music] but he's too wasted to be of any more help i'll tell him to get a move on then well we've got a supply run to make and uncle eddie's expecting a visit so right yeah of course get going you two um sam we all got to get going oh uh of course of course yeah i got lost to do myself i lots of to-do's on old sam's list and you don't want to keep brown waiting you know thanks for looking out for this place happy to do it i uh don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything anything at all you're here sam uh sam the keys oh yeah of course of course yeah they're yours this place it meant a lot to your mother it almost felt like it was a part of her and it's like some part of her is alive here still hopefully the house doesn't turn out to be a murderous psycho that tries to kill us in our sleep huh uh yeah well uh take care of yourself both of you hey so we really do have a lot to do okay go on i'll be right behind you ready to veni vidi vecchi i'm ready to talk to tessa just try to keep in mind that your memory of her is 10 years out of date yeah well it wouldn't be if she reached out to me while i was in fireweed which she didn't so i'm guessing this is michael hey you hey isn't it your day off yep we're here as patrons tyler meet michael this is the annoying co-worker i was telling you about i was there for your introduction of marshmallow vodka and wine coolers and i've only worked my way up to annoying co-worker rude don't worry she told me exactly how miserable she'd be in this town without you it's so good to finally meet you the tyler talk goes on 24 7 so i feel like i already know you so uh you here to grab some stuff for the homestead or yeah we decided it'd be easiest if we just stayed out there we'll get it cleaned up faster if we literally cannot escape it hey i'm all for efficiency cannot wait for us to get out of here what's that uh michael is moving to juno too we were thinking of being roommates oh okay thinking about it you better not be backing out on me the only thing that gets me up some mornings is marking one more day off the calendar don't worry she won't we'll get the house sold and you guys can move on there could be room for you too for sure the more ronin's the merrier i'm studying to be a chef so uh you know it'll be good eating and hey i only snore during allergy season and baseball how can i say no to that are you okay dead on my feet girl got up at four to fish before work it's been a day oh you like to fish yeah there's this spot called buzzard hall i go to at least twice a week it's like an hour drive but it's so chill especially first thing in the morning shut up i used to go there all the time for real yeah hey well if you want to go sometime holler at me i don't mind sharing cool most guys i know get all smeagle about their fishing spots oh look at you two bonding over the most slow and boring way to kill an animal she's just jealous because she couldn't catch a fish even if she filled the lake with cyanide first never mind tyler we better get started with our shopping yeah i'll be around if you need anything the future mayor of delos crossing tom vecchi yep is it really that big of a shock he owns the only store in delos crossing and he's chummy with the old boys club uh i guess he never really struck me as having ideas and he's not exactly charismatic [Music] i want to have the crispy casino and noodles and spring rolls and can we get the coconut cake for dessert easy easy my hungry goblins we have to leave some food for the other customers but auntie tessa said we can have whatever we want [Music] man i miss tessa's cooking she still make those what are they called fried banana rolls tehran right um no i'm pretty sure she made them special for us really hope they get enough signatures on this on what they want to build a fancy hunting lodge up the river it's gonna totally screw up salmon migration should we go inside or stand around until we become human popsicles tess is still doing that bible study here every wednesday mm-hmm wednesday nights are always packed she cooks tons of bibica and the hail marys start flowing there's gonna be a lot of leftovers after the rapture more for us crazy that they haven't caught him yet well hello miss ronan did you forget something in the office no just doing some shopping you remember my brother tyler your brother oh right tyler what a pleasant surprise didn't allison tell you i'd be by today yes i think she did i just didn't expect to see such a dapper young man [Music] well i did shower this morning did you just get back into town or more or less we've been working out at the old house but surprise surprise after 10 years of sitting empty it was missing a few things hence the supply run oh right well we'll get you set right up it must be nice to be home uh i'm not sure nice is the word for it oh of course i assume being there feels complicated that's one way to describe it well don't let me keep you any longer i'll be here if you need anything oh hey is tessa around today um the wife's not in at the moment i'm sure she'll be around later though okay so we need candles and an all-purpose cleaner plus snacks and drinks you think you could take a picture of this look all the good fishing spots are marked i don't have my phone on me and you know you could just google all this later right are you kidding alison old fishermen aren't gonna share this kind of juicy intel on the internet no way the trout king is still here hey tyler remember the trout king yeah i saw it i thought tom might have retired him by now are you kidding he never misses a chance to tell customers he won a trout derby it was a 12 pounder hey have you still not picked anything out oh uh remind me what we need again repeat after me an all-purpose cleaner candles drinks and some snacks all right i got it i got it hey tom when'd you get that new california plate you remember that nice young couple who came through town last summer with the funky van they sent you their license plate their van got impounded then i pulled some strings to get it out so by pulled strings you mean you gave eddie a discount on those new waiters i've got friends in right places inventory huh yeah my mind is so numb right now anyway how's the shopping spree going finding everything you need yeah i'd be done already but i'm letting tyler browse and take it all in must be weird for him to be back here yeah i don't know but today's been crazy defined crazy we uh we found some stuff in marion's room that really threw us for a loop do you want to talk about it i do but not here and i think it also might not be my story to tell everything but maybe all of us can hang out later and you can get the whole messy story all right well i'll be here if you need me hey tyler candy or chips you know i got a sweet tooth sis damn those life jackets are snazzy sugar rush it is let's see fresh cut peonies triple layer chocolate chip cake toasted marshmallow are you doing a dramatic reading of a fancy-ass cookbook nope just browsing these fancy-ass candles hmm plain candles are fine [Music] michael you want me to pick up some birch syrup for you this has some roundabout way of asking me to make you two my world famous pancakes ooh busted that pumpkin's huge that really is one enormous pumpkin what do we still need to get i haven't found the cleaning stuff yet and i'm still debating whether to get the off-brand cola or something fancy like orange soda man i haven't shopped like this in ages take your time and enjoy it tyler you want water soda juice whatever you want i'm not picky wish any of it sounded good i'm grabbing some water you do you girl oh canned ham how do people eat this snob much it's not that bad weren't you the picky eater when we were kids strawberries in november athletic graceful and spirited sounds like you sorry i might be movie star handsome but i can't act for [ __ ] hmm i should write down their info for after the move what do we still need to get i haven't found the cleaning stuff yet any opinion on cleaning products only that using them is an unfortunate way to spend an afternoon [Music] i'll take the strong one okay i think we're done here tom will ring us up at the counter can you believe tessa and tom were ever young i heard that i may have a little less going on in the hair department but you should see the rest of delos high class of 81. i'm waiting fair enough pay for the groceries aren't you running for more gun control my platform calls for sensible regulations but folks around here need guns for safety and as you know we run extensive background checks before each and every sale hmm will that be all yes thank you tom oh hi tessa we were just meaning to come talk to you hi tessa long time no see my god you look like a completely different person it's me plus beard yes so we were out at the old house today evans why would you go there surprised it's even still standing we found some stuff in mary ann's room that took us by surprise oh really we want to ask you some questions about her you're the only person who might have known marianne better than us i i don't know about that it's been a decade kids i know but i need to ask what is it did she ever talk about me being a boy no it never came up i found out much later just like everybody else marianne was obviously concerned she really didn't confide in you at all your mother was intensely private she didn't need anyone else and she made that clear but this was about tyler she was always willing to ask for help when it came to us not at the end look i have a lot of my plate today i'm sorry my advice to you would be to try to move on it's not that easy what happened that night you can't understand something like that but it was god's plan that's all we can know i need to go now best of luck to you truly what the hell was that i told you she wouldn't talk it's like she's got cia training something's weird here it's weird right yeah i feel it too it's like something's on the tip of my tongue [Music] hey guys you all done yet yeah mom can we go outside while you intensify cards i'm afraid there's no time for games today sweetie now let's go marianne can you come here sorry tessa i'm in a bit of a hurry oh what's your excuse this time emergency repairs for the beaver dam test can i help you allison oh no no thanks i'm good i'm just looking for something that i forgot what's this doing here man tessa keeps track of everything in these notebooks like what any loans she's given out stuff she lets regulars take for free even her tithes and then what she starts passing out horse heads if people don't pay her back i think she just likes having a record she's gonna hand it off to st paul like a resume is there something i can do for you so what are you doing there oh just inventory guess i'm lucky i had the day off huh yes what a lucky coincidence no never mind hey guys you all done yet yeah mom can we go outside while you and tessa play cards games today sweetie now let's go marianne can you come here sorry tessa i'm in a bit of a hurry oh what's your excuse this time emergency repairs for the beaver dam tessa look no i don't want to hear it i want to talk to you now or do i need to start calling in your debts huh i'd completely forgotten about that i remember it but not exactly like that here let's see if we can call up my version okay uh mom can we go outside while you and tessa play cards no there's no time for games today marianne can we talk [Music] no we can't just leave the groceries kids let's go don't please let's just talk for a few minutes okay okay we remember that slightly differently i guess that makes sense rashmon you know but whatever happened after that they walked to the counter and then marianne lashed out a test right please let's just marianne defended us because tessa got all preachy which is it going to be please let's just talk for a few minutes okay i want to talk you hearing this marianne is looking for a fight please let's just talk for a few minutes okay please marianne i'm just trying stay away from my children they don't need your guidance i'm just trying to help i don't need help not from you not from anyone else in this [ __ ] town i'm done with all of you you're done with the food i give you the fuel maybe you are do i'm still skeptical but okay for now let's say marianne was being marianne but once they got into the office they both went at it hard what do you think they were arguing about me don't know it was impossible to hear anything after she cranked up the music but hey now that we know she was lying to our faces let's ask her is there something i can do for you earlier you said marianne kept everything to herself but you two had a big fight a few months before her death didn't you we argued all the time you'll have to be more specific this wasn't about who cheated at canasta this was intense you locked yourselves in the office so we couldn't hear i'm sorry it was a long time ago now i was in the middle of something okay we'll leave you to it damn it i think she knows more than she's letting on a duh but there's no way to nail her down when we don't even know what we mean if we could pinpoint what it was about she'd be out of excuses sure but how do we do that the music was too loud to make out what they were saying marianne and tessa were obsessed with that song it was on all the time what are you thinking we've been getting these visions whenever we see or hear something really emotional maybe listening to it will trigger something you may be onto something here ronan we can't go back to her with anything half-assed we should go talk to tom make sure we build as strong of a case as possible okay let's see if we can figure out what song it was we should go talk to tom right see if he remembers the song hello there are you here for me or my cigarettes hey you're more than just a pack of cigarettes to me so your deadline for the culinary academy was monday right i turned in my application mother dear oh i'm so excited are you excited well i will be once i know i got in i am not worried about that did you give them my recommendation letter no hon while that paragraph about my salmon puff recipe was truly moving it it doesn't work like that just tell them i discovered bourdain then they'll take my opinion seriously taking a break already yeah i needed a moment of zen tess has been on my ass all day look i get one count wrong she has to triple check everything like we'd go full-on lord of the flies if there's one too many frozen pizzas it kind of sounds like she has a good reason to doubt your commitment to the inventory process brutus you working tonight no thank god i've been pulling doubles all week i'm working at the diner all day tomorrow though you want me to bring you anything uh i'm trying to cut out carbs and grease for a while girl you may as well just lay down in the dirt and let the bears take you because that is no way to live later hey tom there's something i can help you with this might be a weird question but do you remember the song that tessa and marianne used to love they played it all the time [Laughter] oh could i forget ah i think she's still got the cd back here a little worse for the wear of course oh hold on uh here it is i was happy when it got put away to be honest a bit cheesy for my tastes this is it right i think so [Laughter] whoa i just got hit with a flood of memories you seeing what i'm seeing should we check this one out mom stop that's so embarrassing oh yeah tessa come join me i know you love this song no i couldn't possibly some of us are actually trying to get work done here i forgot how carefree she could be yeah what the hell happened you think there's more memories lurking around i don't know [Music] the kids keep pestering me for these candies but they're so expensive i'll just grab it back it's fine oh no i i can't tessa it's nothing okay but write it down in your little notebook okay okay whatever you want there happy yes and i'll be by on wednesday to help you close like i promised jessa acted like she was marianne's mom sometimes i think you mean tessa was self-righteous and treated marianne like a charity case she was trying to help we should go find that notebook she was holding pretty sure i saw one mark 2004 in the office closet earlier what are you doing here i thought you needed help with this tour i needed help two hours ago have you been drinking what no i just had a day okay i took a pill i'm fine marianne i said i'm fine kids come on let's go wait please i have something for you take a look at this when you get home okay they could handle this confusion i've been working with these people for years they can help what do you think that pamphlet was tessa gave to marianne i don't know i saw it in marianne's room it had a creepy vibe but i didn't think much about it it was bad though like maybe conversion therapy bad i'm sorry wow this is true i want to know how marion felt about it and we need to hit tessa with some hard proof uh tessa is it okay if i run a quick google search my phone's dead sure but make it quick i'm going to need the computer virtue seekers youth camp wait what is that what she recommended for tyler i don't know what to say i'm sorry taylor yeah let's see how tessa explains this one away um can i help you allison oh no no thanks i'm good i'm just looking for something that i forgot ah 2004 anything interesting no show it looks like marianne started flaking on her debt in october 2004. five months before that night i think we've seen enough yeah we've got a good sense of what went down let's talk to tessa oh got it hypothesis is there something i can do for you we're back with details that should help your memory oh really yes really marianne was having one of her days you were trying to talk but she wasn't cooperating the two of you started arguing and you went in the office and cranked up that song you both loved hmm and when was that well our memories don't exactly have time stamps october 2004 that was when she stopped trying to pay her deaths right yes i don't know why she always found a way to pay before that but we never argued about money i was frustrated but you can't squeeze blood from a stone yeah we didn't think you guys were arguing about money we know you support the alliance for traditional families and that you gave her the pamphlet about their camp what camp the virtue seekers youth camp it was conversion therapy you told her that tyler should go there i um look your mother was in a bad place it was clear she was coming apart at the seams she told me she'd been struggling with you and i'd heard such good things about that camp your answer to my mother's bad moods was to send me to conversion therapy it's what i thought would help both of you at the time tyler it was worse than bad moods she was not well not well at all do you know what they do to kids in those places i do now how did marianne take your helpful suggestion badly she wanted to let you be whatever perfect little butterfly was in that cocoon and yes we argued about it so she was cool with who i was she was more than that she loved you listen i don't mean to be rude but i really do have a lot on my plate today okay we'll get out of your way then thanks tessa can we grab our groceries ah um michael already put them in your trunk okay thanks bye tom see you later what are you thinking i'm starving trying to wrap my brain around all that i can't believe you got tessa vecchi to talk about the past bravo yeah marianne she had my back it it really doesn't change much right she was so [ __ ] crazy she still tried to kill me but knowing she was trying to protect me before whatever the hell happened that pushed her over the edge it feels good allison hey look at me you are allowed to feel however you were feeling about this god i could use a smoke you're speaking my language [Music] what sorry i'm just thinking about what this means yeah me too [Music] well it's a good thing eddie's expecting us he knew marianne pretty well and he was in charge of her case did he ever mention anything about the investigation to you no i never asked and i'm sure he thought i was better off not knowing i guess that might have made for some awkward dinner conversation exactly but i mean he's a good cop thorough i'm sure he's got something let's go down this is kind of bleak it's usually more crowded but the other officers punch out at six o'clock sharp there's no crime after six in the mean streets of delos crossing just bears and drunken disorderlies and uncle eddie can usually handle them on his own what a hero anyway he's probably in his office upstairs damn they've still got this creepy mascot huh what officer justin beaver is not creepy he's stella's crossing's longest serving officer 100 college tuition paid damn maybe i should have joined the national guard beats having your credit card stolen by an online college too soon tyler too soon well should i decide the wild world of accounting isn't for me uh i can't really picture you in the uniform really i think i could pull it off too little too late that's still not cleaned up [ __ ] i wonder if the black oyster catchers were still nesting during the spill god i hope not home sweet home hmm you spend a lot of time here growing up yeah whenever eddie was working the whole precinct's basically family it's freezing in here locked what claire brown went missing on a snowmobile trip yeah i thought you were still here when it happened i don't remember it that is going to smell lovely tomorrow it's from tessa's restaurant right uh-huh everyone eats there all the time it's as exciting as food gets in delos crossings come on man we can't make these poor kids sleep here well where do you suggest they go social services will be here in a few hours and this is the only room with a bed anywhere but a cell will find some other place [Music] here we go again god not here too i'm not ready me neither [Music] oh greg's just leaving this out on display again craigs like officer greggs the one who was with us that night yeah he's still here he became a bit of a local celebrity after nabbing a murderer from juneau the guy was hiding out on a fishing boat and got really really sick after eating out of the chum bucket so it was actually a pretty easy takedown huh is that liking [ __ ] stop touching everything butterfingers sorry [Music] the delos crossing raiders they got a basketball team now yep a few cops from this station and some firefighters from the next town over how good are they um eddie's within your shot right i think so then they're great you remember dan and shelby i think so the high schoolers who are always pissing tessa off because they would blast fish and make out in the vecchi's parking lot yep dan's a cop now they're married and have a kid a dog the whole shebang damn when did everybody decide to become an adult something's in the way tyler you coming allison hey just finishing up a call trying to convince melinda the ravens in her garbage aren't police business give me a few minutes sure make yourselves a cup of coffee here's the key to the break room thanks come back upstairs when you're done okay coffee sound good machine is in the break room downstairs you think we could find some files about marianne in the archives i don't know but it's off limits anyway maybe eddie would show us her file [Music] you know i really thought i'd lock those memories in some deep deep part of my brain something's in the way man they are never gonna catch this guy what exactly did he do this guy keeps stealing out of people's mailboxes [ __ ] snagged a box of fancy washi tape i ordered online uh see i was picturing an actual mailbox bandit you know like hopping around on a post with a little mask on the door huh you know the mailbox is the bandit sorry it was a bad joke rose never left me back here where are we going we're just gonna sit down in here i'm gonna ask you a few questions okay [Laughter] okay [Music] huh rose left the computer on okay let's go in did brown just flat out ignore me um i didn't notice but i mean he's probably feeling awkward since you know you didn't take his gift great he's making it weird yep it's locked yeah they've let this place get gross i'm not that hungry you think they'll mind if i take one these are definitely the same cookies that were here last week but knock yourself out ugh i'm so hungry check out this masterpiece you made it uh-huh i glued it to the pot one day when i was bored and nobody has bothered to peel it off how is this still warm you sure you want coffee this late in the day you'll be up all night uh i don't think i'll sleep much anyways too much in my mind those dusty couches won't make it any easier hey you okay i can't do this calm down allison stick to the plan come on don't freak out on me now i can't please i can't lie we already lied it's all gonna be fine okay you okay [Music] honestly no do you ever regret no no way well maybe once or twice early on but now no way i mean look where we're at look where i'm at [Music] uncle eddie's probably done by now we should go find him do you mind if i go inside that room for a second uh you sure it's the first time i've been in here since that night [Music] eddie was so uncomfortable he dropped a bait here have a seat all right ah damn it sorry huh they kept this what it's that vase they glued it back together huh what's that back there no way have you been hiding back here all this [Music] time [Music] i'm pretty sure chief brown is done with his phone call by now [Music] [Music] this is heavier than i expected [Music] why did you separate us is ollie okay ollie's just fine honey they're all in the other room having cocoa everything's gonna be okay i need to ask you a few questions now come with me you're awfully quiet yeah sorry trying to deal but it's a lot remember mr haynes vaguely he had that workshop in his garage right made those huge glass sculptures yeah he's been missing for a couple months damn always liked his art they never did find him this happened when we were kids right yeah marianne freaked out and wouldn't drive after dark for a few weeks i can't believe they're going to prison for nothing that's denise wilson's desk remember her oh no it was her birthday i completely forgot you're a terrible person it's your fault i was so excited to see you that it completely slipped my mind remember this fella no way is that jet yep he uh he died last year putting himself between d and a bear oh damn poor d she's obsessed with sled dog races now is that even a thing oh yeah she goes to the iditarod every year and she's got a fantasy league called musher's little helpers it's really cool man i forgot what kind of kooky [ __ ] people are into out here hey now i'm in the league maybe she won't notice that i added it afterwards so she's gonna give me so much crap for forgetting her birthday she won't notice if we borrow this right long as we put it back right where we found it we're good so we really shouldn't be in here yes but you never know where we might find information about that night i guess so didn't test so wilson leaves her locker key and her desk and her password reminder in her locker that's so irresponsible an intruder could easily access all kinds of police files with this yeah like two goblin intruders balto came through winner on my 20th birthday hmm oh that's got to be a new record what's on your mind just thinking about how we slept in that corner over there yeah on that paper-thin mattress from the cell it could have been a pillow top and i wouldn't have slept a wink i don't know how you come here every week i've been here 10 minutes and it's already [ __ ] me up it never really stopped hurting hey do you have any reoccurring nightmares about that night yeah why well remember that nice lady from social services who picked us up oh what was her name uh sandy i think yeah i used to dream about her a lot um sorry what yeah it would always start out pretty normal like we'd be sitting in the living room with marianne doing a sewing lesson and then suddenly she would turn into sandy and she would hold us in her arms pulling us in tighter and tighter until i would wake up practically choking jesus so are things gonna be weird at all between you and eddie only if he makes it weird good because he's more likely to tell us about marianne if you don't antagonize him i know don't worry i just want answers let's go yep i should take her out for a birthday drink remember this fella no way is that jet yep he uh he died last year putting himself between d and a bear oh damn poor d she's obsessed with sled dog races now is that even a thing oh yeah she goes to the iditarod every year and she's got a fantasy league called musher's little helpers it's really cool man i forgot what kind of kooky [ __ ] people are into out here hey now i'm in the league bingo oh sam what about him he got arrested for public intoxication last week and that was not his first offense he's on a bit of a downward spiral so isn't brown waiting for us we should head back to his office hey sorry that took so long sometimes these old folks want us to come out just because they're lonely no worries uncle uh hey you remember this guy of course tyler ronan the prodigal son returns yep look at you i didn't even recognize you at first i heard that a lot today chief brown chief brown no need for that kind of formality not with family how you finding delos crossing change much uh same dump different year well we're no juno but lots of folks feel at home here it's gotta be good to be back with your sister huh yeah it's been a long time coming look eddie we are here just to say hi we found something in marion's room things aren't really adding up anymore and we've got questions oh yeah did she mention anything about us that might have been worrying her about tyler in particular no she dealt with those kind of worries all on her own kept the rest of us at arm's length i see i will tell you one thing though your mom never knew where to hate anyone for being unconventional usually it's the other way around [Music] did anyone mention anything about her behavior in the days leading up to that day anything at all no everyone i talked to said it took them by surprise did you see hurdle like in those last few days no i hadn't seen her for weeks maybe a month before [Music] thanks uncle eddie if you want my advice nothing good comes from stirring up old memories we don't really have a choice about that there's always a choice son i know sometimes it doesn't seem like it but there is can we take a look at her file maybe we'd see something you didn't or file her case file or police file whatever you call it you keep those pretty much forever right we do but i can't just pull it out right here right now they're perceived you're the chief which makes it even more important that i follow procedures chief brown are you gonna help us are you gonna be a cop tyler no it's fine tyler i know you resent me but fireweed was the best deal i could get you i'm not mad about fireweed but i may be a little salty you kept my sister away for seven [ __ ] years that's what this is about look that was the court's recommendation they're the experts i just went along yeah sure you did trust me son we all believed that what happened that night was self-defense but we couldn't be sure i can't believe this look we couldn't be sure okay i was trying to protect you both so you still not sure what you still think keeping us apart was the right call she was traumatized we needed each other to heal and you took that away from us so why didn't you let your sister visit when you turned 18 then huh please let's move on she's never gonna tell you how much that hurt her but it did that was about me it wasn't about her alison gets that and three years is nothing compared to seven right ally look uncle separating us like that did not help me heal if anything it was the opposite even if he had been dangerous i'd have taken the risk being apart was that miserable i didn't know you felt that way little moose it was hard to talk to you about it i didn't want to seem ungrateful look we've all [ __ ] up we've all hurt each other but isn't that what family's for can't we just move on sounds like the right call times like this i i wonder who raised two we're gonna stay the night at the old house we better get going you want to grab a bite first it's on me i want to send you out there with empty stomachs i would not turn that down okay let's go [Music] stop allison [Music] man hunter [Music] please mom i'm sorry i cut my hair i won't do it again i'm going to kill you no please please [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh was it killed her i killed her allison we need to call for help i killed her no you didn't i killed her and when they come that's what we're going to tell them no no yes we look out for each other that's what goblins do and brothers and sisters this is gonna be okay we're gonna be okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so what now well he's obviously not going to give us the truth so i say we go get it ourselves wait you're not seriously thinking of breaking and entering a police archive go big or go home the pious pelican is the princess's generous friend she has a magical beak that is always full of food and never empties the ice king is the lord of the whole forest
