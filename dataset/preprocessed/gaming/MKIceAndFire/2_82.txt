me [Music] [Music] what did you want to talk to me about i realized this is kind of a big ask but i want to defend my wwe championship against john cena beating him would solidify my title reign and put me up there with some of the top champions of all time so any chance you can make that happen you know maybe give him one of those mandates to show up and face me yeah i wish it was that easy i mean don't you think i've already tried to get cena to appear on raw before he would bring instant star power along with a guaranteed ratings boost but the reality is he's busy with various tv and film projects and isn't interested in a return right now so it's pretty much a lost cause if i were you i'd focus on something else i wouldn't be where i am today if i just quit anytime i was up against some adversity i'm gonna get john cena to come back to wwe and face me and how are you going to do that i'm going to take a little trip down memory lane and revisit some of cena's career highlights maybe that will get his attention the red brands rolling out the red carpet tonight as the current wwe champion has invited none other than the miz to monday night raw to square off one on one it's a heck of a gambit michael using the miz to provoke one of wwe's greatest champions of all time john cena and it's a gamut that could easily blow up in the wwe champion's face saw that one coming finds the advantage after a string of counters samoan dropped byron stomping looking a little bit shaken turn your lights out you can see the dismay on the face of the miz not an a-list performance here from miz turns the tables yeah miz able to stop that surge dead in its tracks [Applause] and he rolls out to create some separation he should have created separation by never coming out here impressive ring iq on display there great job refocusing to reverse that one he reverses it counters [Applause] check out this power this is ridiculous there's been plenty of action in this match and the cost of that is really showing now [Applause] and that seemed like a pretty easy [Music] so this whole cena thing hate to say i told you so but you know what i don't hate it at all i told you so i know how it looks from your perspective but i promise it's gonna work i just need more time and besides i never said this would be easy fine but if you don't get at least some kind of acknowledgement soon from cena then i'm pulling the plug what's your next move spotlighting a major loss didn't seem to work so i'm gonna go in the other direction oh yeah i actually got wind of your idea for this already trying to replicate cena's first wwe championship win by beating jbl don't think it's going to matter but i'll make it happen the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds the wwe champion [Applause] scorpion this guy used to stick to one weight class backing him fresh off a big way against the miz the wwe champion will try to get john cena's attention one more time tonight against one of cena's former wrestlemania foes jbl jbl is a hall of famer that can still go in the ring and has a hall of fame voice to boot give that butt kiss and a rest saxton just dating back story just like that bradshaw finds a counter [Applause] baffling decision here oh well measured strike [Applause] wow into the pin attempt he's able to kick out before two he is gonna take this match as long and as far as he needs to oh well he's looking a little weary now not a bad place to be in but the longer this goes the more trouble a superstar exposes himself to he catches jbl with a counter trying to find his berries but it looks like his end is near looking for the victory two three kicked out how was that not three does bradshaw have any fight left wow [Applause] and that was a well-targeted attack [Applause] not quite enough to put him away he's got his best opportunity [Applause] here is your winner [Music] uh there was a potential opening with cena and you blew it i don't think it's over are you crazy he turned you down and then you insulted him we can forget about a match he probably won't even come back for a simple appearance now so thanks for that i'm telling you i think i struck a nerve with him and a man like that is too proud to just let that go let me do one more thing to get his attention and if this doesn't work then i'll move on you've already tried one more thing two or three times he's gonna respect the fact that i won't give up and then you'll get your star power and your ratings boost that you want so bad what do you want to do i want the undertaker what let me explain cena was in the exact same position i'm in with the undertaker a few years ago at wrestlemania he was so desperate for a match he bought a ticket and sat in the audience waiting when undertaker eventually did appear cena lost in five minutes i remember all that what's your point i want to send cena a final message by doing what he couldn't do at wrestlemania i want to defeat the undertaker that's really pushing it but i think i can make it happen and if cena sticks to his word and never answers your challenge then at least i'll get the ratings boost i was looking for with the undertaker and if cena does change his mind then even better all right looks like you got yourself a match against the phenom the wwe champion has been on a roll but tonight the champ will have to take his game to an entirely new level as he takes on the incredible wwe legend the undertaker it's the wwe champion first the dead man on raw this is huge i have a feeling that even john cena is going to be taking a break from his busy hollywood schedule to watch this one that's certainly the champion's plan let's see if it works landing samoan dropped byron oh no it's the hawaiian drive treading all over there oh undertaker moves return fire from the undertaker [Applause] you can bet the dead man won't rest here and now there's an opening great reversal good night what a stunner you can see the anguish growing on his face yeah it's the pull up some form of offense here a monumental victory tonight for the wwe champion over the phenom himself the undertaker you never want to overlook an accomplishment like that but i think the champion still has other things on his mind john cena over the past few weeks i've done everything i can to prove to you that i'm worthy of a match that i'm worthy of your time i mean i just beat the undertaker which is something you couldn't do so you know what maybe maybe i've been looking at this the wrong way maybe it's not about proving that i'm worthy of your time maybe you're not worth mine i have to agree with the wwe champion here it's time to move on from this whole john cena thing wait a second it's john cena the face of wwe has come home i can't believe it after weeks of unanswered challenges and then cena himself saying it wasn't going to happen the wwe champion has gotten john cena to return to monday night raw and there you have it cena is back for one thing the wwe championship hey this is the matchup that no one thought we'd ever see and now it looks like it's happening this is gonna be one for the ages the following contest is scheduled for one fall it is for the wwe chair cory what do you think of the champs chances here tonight i love them i'm not like everybody else cole it seems like everybody's ready to write the champs demise but not me many have written him off as champion but he is determined to prove his doubters wrong [Applause] in my estimation the greatest of all time the 16-time world champion john cena there aren't too many people who would argue with you michael cole time to do it one time again let's go to work john cena certainly no stranger to high pressure situations to big stages that is exactly why cena has earned the nickname big match john 16-time world champion in my estimation the greatest competitor ever stepped foot in the ring in wwe his sustained excellence for a decade and a half is unparalleled at this level it's moments like this that john cena lives for the pressure the spotlight and the ability to deliver when it matters most cena's beaten up who's who in this business hall of famers living legends triple h hbk the rock the list goes on and introducing the challenger from west newburgh massachusetts weighing in at 251 he's also on the hearts and minds of the wwe universe as quickly as the audience can be at times they know true greatness when they see introducing the champions he is the wwe champion sub the stakes could not be any higher it is time for our wwe championship match wakes the grueling battles have all led the wwe champion at this moment a chance to etch his name into the wwe history books against the one and only john cena talk about box office two of the biggest straws in sports entertainment are fighting for the right to call themselves the true face of wwe you want to talk faces the wwe champion finally got his witch a chance to carve his mug right up there onto wwe's mount rushmore look at him totally fighting with the wwe universe right now [Music] he catches cena with a counter producing a trampoline and a kick samoan drop byron challenger's a little worse for wear now he deflects it right back oh he retaliates kick here here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen guys never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about as lopsided as they come the following content introducing the challenger welcome to what should be one of the most brutal championship matches we've ever seen between the defending wwe champion and one of the most decorated superstars in wwe history john cena as they face off in a last man standing match that means that one of these two extraordinary athletes will need to keep the other down for a full ten count to walk out of here tonight with the title it's hard enough keeping cena down for a three count let alone 10. let's see if the wwe champion has what it takes watch out producing a trampoline an agile escape oh my [Applause] that kick will stop you in your tracks big knee to the midsection the challenger is looking shaken and cena's starting to falter here cena has to find a way to reassert himself and then cut cena right off oh bolting down on the opponent the scene is looking absolutely powerless himself up but he's also giving his opponent a chance to recover staggering to his feet but he won't like what's coming next oh my gosh this is an incessant attack being brought to him he's got to wake up and get in the fight look at this it looks like they're not done punishment referee has to break the 10 count now he's able to fend off the attack able to get out of the way oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms a championship level move two three four five six oh man the referee just counted to seven eight this match ain't over yet all the way [Applause] wow is unable to stop this string of offense cena needs to find some energy fast just like that cena gets intercepted he's piling up the damage now this is sadistic saw that one coming took advantage stick to the midsection he was waiting for him to make his move that was the best one i've ever seen outside of the ring now gets inside the ring cutting off the count here maybe with a little something extra in mind coming in hot and he'll leave the ring for this next stretch oh strong impact look at this now draping his opponent over the announced desk these two showing how well scotty they each are and the hits to the core keep coming from the suplex a defenseless cena here an uninterrupted surge against cena here cena's just trying to weather the storm he has got something destructive in his mind [Applause] looks like now here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero so and if you want to reach the pinnacle of sports entertainment there's an argument to be made that you must win the wwe title absolutely right there have been legends and hall of famers who never won the title but putting this on your resume moves you into a different class of competitors bicycle knee strike on the jaw [Applause] wow really just landed it got him scouted he manages to escape it challenger's a little worse for wear now good timing with that reversal oh right to the kidneys [Applause] ow jeez a flurry of brutality floating through the wow devastating kick champa avoids damage and he's still in the game i don't believe it how did the challenger survive that by the skin of their teeth and don't expect the chance to start going easy on them now what's the tally and how many [Applause] stands tall once again here is your winner we i've been watching a lot of old andre the giant matches recently nothing like a big man doing big man things i mean can you imagine what it would have been like to face him in his prime and here we have a superstar with a big chip on his shoulder he has certainly felt overworked recently well he has a chance to change that perception in this matchup but across the ring you have a man who's the odds-on favorite in any match andre the giant a competitor who's not only bigger and stronger than almost anyone in the history of wwe but who has traveled the world proving he's the most extraordinary athlete of all time you don't get to be the eighth wonder of the world without conquering the globe and andre's done just that oh look at this oh kicks good great turn your lights out he saw that one coming each competitor showing they've done [Applause] andre might never have experienced a blow like that one what a kick an elusive giant there both superstars showing great awareness of their opponent's repertoire he takes control good contact stops the kick and responds with a counter of their own able to give [Applause] able to get the advantage here got to find a way to get out of this one face first oh it is aggression just pure brutality the giants in real danger nowhere [Applause] here is your winner sub zero me i had the viking raiders on the podcast and we did a segment about the current raw roster who's the biggest prankster the messiest that sort of thing guess who they gave the ugliest scowl and least likely to get a date award i've got your trophy back at the office if you want it this guy is ready handicap match here and by design these matches put a superstar at a very heavy disadvantage yeah you know you're coming in with an instant disadvantage but if you can pull it off you'll have one some serious respect that's a pretty big if saxton when the numbers game is against you like this and that one misses the marks he avoids the damage series of reversals he's lost some of his win now looks like the height and action of this handicap match has caught up with him a little bit face first with a waistlock takedown setting up nice suplex vertical suplay following ddt oh damage pinpointing the leg whatever's playing here can't be good delivering a series of sharp elbows into the corner now he's in off the tag arms and he denies either wow [Music] ivar gets out of there oh my god he's still in the match he got the shoulder up right at the last moment on the ropes is it enough to secure the victory heading up he's thinking big from the top a great counter maybe he's found a new source of aggression to battle back with reversal on top of reversal hits him with the counter oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet a flurry of brutality everything here he goes [Applause] zero me um me me there's really no telling what this match might have in store for us just about the only thing you can count on is chaos is the name of the game here these superstars are going to be living out their most unhinged and dangerous dreams in this one another reversal he's looking a little off balance strikes with a kick man a little extra luster behind that kick just sending a message there and ford had it scouted crafty way to get out of harm there stunner montage is in a very vulnerable position here [Applause] look who it is smackdown's newest superstar smackdown is lucky to have this addition to its roster we'll see how he fares here but i think he has the chance to do big things [Music] you
