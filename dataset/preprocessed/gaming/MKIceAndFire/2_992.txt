all right net what have we got turns out pim has been tracking that thing since it showed up in the sky it doesn't seem to follow a set route so we can't anticipate its movements his best guess is that it responds to activity alerts from ames agents coupled with its own sensors it's going to see us coming probably the resistance will feed us their data so we'll have intel on its location at all times that should at least give us a leg up great get the quinn jet set up i want to be ready for takeoff asap consider it done now good day adventures no no need for coffee adrenaline's running high enough as it is hello avenger ready for the new you [Music] all right what's the play not sure there's any chance of us getting into the city undetected yeah pretty sure you rising from the dead is gonna attract attention then we give them something to draw their attention like maybe a son of odin i will bring the lightning captain they won't even see you on the ground we're being hailed sir put them through hello anyone out there they found us they say we need to be cured but we know what that means please someone what's this someone found a radio don't worry you'll all be cured soon jarvis can you get a location right away sir i've traced the call back to an apartment in the evacuation zone i don't get it why are they evacuating because of us in humans to them we're a disease aim has people believing they're dangerous it's only gotten worse over the years uh immediately there is a chest with gear close by why don't you guys take a break you're safe now okay look for a chest with gear nearby one of our shield allies nearby could use some help please thank you please they've been searching the city for inhumans our friends were on the way to the safe house go now find safety my friend better hurry don't know how many of these guys are out there i've located another containment cell how could we let this happen we have a chance to stop them now there's a chest with special resources close to your location uh one of our resistance allies is close by and could use some help hope they're empty what's there they should stay dead captain and the weak give way to the straw sounds those guys lost let's find the inhumans [Music] we know they're heavily armed and they love to hear themselves talk sounds ooh i feel seen there is an elite aim unit near you defeat them and you may gain something useful uh [Music] [Music] me watch dogs protect the inhumans avengers health get them we can halt the infection no one else will suffer we're not infected uh oh enemies find somewhere to hide while we clear the way to is sending agents to escort the survivors out of the city he's alerted them but they're trapped inside forwarding the code to the safe house entrance that flying thing is heading right for it the trolls must have found it one of us can fly we have to get them out of there they are blocking our way not by accident avengers has been neutralized um another enemy defeated [Music] [Music] his agents are on their way but they'll need time not sure how much we've got watchdogs are closing in safe houses nearby i'm picking up something in the atmosphere a derivative of terrorism but i've never seen anything like it are we in danger here aren't we always true [Music] avengers come on glad you're here we can't they have this thing hunting in humans we tried to sneak out but they have eyes everywhere we'll take care of the watch dogs don't worry not them that thing in the sky it's here stay down until the resistance comes from four looks like we're gonna need some air support on this one whatever this new threat is i will meet it in the sky levels rising activate respirators [Music] that machine is the source of the altered territory it's been genetically modified to seek out the presence of the inhuman gene and eliminate the host it's killing in humans this is it uh good job [Music] bring them down [Music] god uh god oh man this hurts thanks for having me all clear what is this thing let's get its black box back to the chimera i'll do some digging jarvis i've uploaded the warships transmitter database trace launch location retracing flight path that dark terrigen tarleton wants to kill us all we have to do something he can't cure the inhuman so he's going to take them all out and this is just the beginning sir what do we got according to the flight path the machine originated from the san francisco bay no no that's not possible i flew over that area dozens of times after a day perhaps this is a rules they mean to throw us off course unlikely residual radiation and mineral deposits on the wreckage confirms the craft has been in the bay area recently then how did no one see it same way they didn't see the warships coming it's cloaked the quarantine no aircraft no ships in or out hiding in plain sight exactly sir i've just intercepted a signal warships hundreds of them deploying out of san francisco no no they'll kill thousands if we don't stop them then we go to the source and shut it down jarvis plot a course to san francisco okay well if we're going into battle with our big-headed friends death fortress robot army and the flotilla of warships it might as well look good doing it right right [Music] [Music] wait aren't you gonna say the thing what no avengers symbol yeah we don't really say that just be cool okay got it [Music] jarvis do you have the fortress mapping radiation signatures now georgie boy sure has been busy they're right on top of your heat signal cap that must be the source of aim's territory not take us down i will take out the main control tower thor tony knock out as many of those generators as you can we stop that signal we stop those warships hulk clear up hey some people don't have a thousand years of blowing stuff up to look forward to rapunzel oh he missed you thor feels like only yesterday we were all together like this still bringing the dad jokes cap okay uh uh what the hell is this let me guess robots glowing purple yeah he can control units remotely take those out first [Music] oh take him out your time's up george i'm coming for you on me if they wish they had a gamma monster on their team uh they do abomination but is he house trained the gunships are emitting a strange mist what is this people everywhere are starting to panic and screaming some seem affected by the mess it's like it's triggering something inside of them i [Music] was going to change the world i know we made a mistake george don't call me that george failed modoc won't we can't cure this or what we've become what are you saying power cannot be controlled i know that now it has to be destroyed no our sacrifice will be remembered captain i'm guessing you all caught that let's take out that signal tower and his face i'm with her as am i okay we can't get to the last transmitter in the quinjet too much cover fire we got this the door ahead leads to the transmitter's base i'll follow hulk's lead and try not to fall to my desk good plan give me a second accessing the [Music] system get that door open even generators hey i think i understood that whoa whoa whoa there's a teenager on this channel watch your mouth this is monologue thing down doesn't he five years of process she's starting to sound like you stark we'll work on it uh these jetpack guys annoying anyone else i kinda remind me of another flying suit of armor oh how dare you talk about like that i can't believe i'm fighting with the avengers i'm not seeing any yellow force field generators they will be by the door just give me a minute i guess a five-year nap makes land impatient if a captain has high expectations for all of us we shall exceed them see someone's got the right attitude [Music] hmm i've opened the forcefield generators cap take down that shield thanks the defense shield is down that how's that door coming hard to hack and fight at the same time are you not having fun do you see what i'm seeing those are death toys really thanks um [Music] oh [Music] looks like the gloves are off now are they ever on keep them busy i've almost got the door to your way tony how's the suit holding up it's your way of asking me if i put on a few pounds that's not what i mean hey not everyone is a super soldier pal yeah tony's on a juice cleanse i'll take that wager i'll take them yes good [Music] [Music] avengers [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] uh isn't it really monaco's company cap he's overriding the gates i'm in hulk keep him busy i'm in some sort of power conduit room probably for the last transmitter everything's electrified look for fail-safe switches team's gotta have a way to shut things down for repairs oh there's something wrong we should have spotted in humans by now think about how high security the prison was ain't not gonna give them up that easy but we can't free them until we know aim is not gonna gas them into oblivion tony some attack will be good right sorry kamala no you're right we have to stop that signal already on it just keep me covered captain you weren't there you didn't hear the testimonies the pain no one should have to live like this on that at least we agree i've seen what happens when the people in power decide who deserves to live doctor i'm not about to let history repeat itself force us to live through another a day i don't think you and i did george that's part of the problem what's up found my way up here goes nothing i'm almost there i'm picking up strange electromagnetic readings in that tower couldn't be this easy i'll do [Music] focus on those bus kids i've got jarvis working on the best way to get all those people out of here thank you no need just doing what i should have a long time ago not bad tony but remember to tell bruce about my brief moment of maturity you have ruined the moment keep it up ugh huh looks like the transmitter is powered by three cores take these guys out and i'll get you a terminal to open their housing units how many of these guys are there our just cleaning up got you a terminal open the cores destroy them and the signals should die and no more inhumans will we can command this how the giant brain genius got schooled by a teenager oh you almost got it captain they're gonna fight eight foots up before i know we're on the right track captain [Music] [Music] [Music] that's the last core the transmission should be dead no i'm still reading a signal from the excavation site the heat signal i saw on a day it caused the earthquakes whatever's behind those walls modoc doesn't want us to got bigger problems [ __ ] did he just swear was that a square thanks tony a little busy right now you need a hand yeah take out those guns on it good and meet me up ahead uh me [Music] what's your thinking cap the beacon must have been a decoy somehow tarleton's still transmitting this just got a whole lot weirder what has happened to his face you can slowly die but i have enough avengers no more ships make it out of the quarantine zone tony take out those thrusters but you'd never ask come on george you're killing innocent people look out for a giant falling head i'd be able to take out a structure yes yes oh it will make no difference [Music] i'll take it from here everyone fan out buy me some time [Music] thing on his back take out that power story don't do something you'll refresh bring them down huh uh i am that's your life what's up he's down assemble on me matt move in right behind you damn it options people hi on my way as soon as you've got enough power blasted and this shield will fall understood by the power of thunder [Music] this may shock you yes you don't understand you can't help but hurt others the feeling that gem in his forehead isn't just to look pretty i think we've got bigger problems yeah on it you cannot win get up over here get on board kamala heads up big guy come on i need you god [Music] [Music] um

see reason if you wish to stand like your captain you can die come on hurry don't look back hmm ugh don't you understand i was no this isn't how you make things right we deserve a chance i know you think you can use this power for good but you're no hero you're just a mistake the only one left to convince is yourself am vegas good isn't it thing you are born i never was [Music] what's happening oh no no no no you're alive oh take it easy you got a hard kid great job yeah we need to work on that passing out thing but he did good indeed good that was pretty badass thanks hey can you guys give us a moment what all this time i i thought i was mentoring you and i'd given up and i guess what i'm trying to say is thank you can i ask you a favor [Music] hi you know you're grounded till you're 30 yes yes good from now on nothing but school and your your special field trips [Music] i'm so proud of you beta but uh let's not tell amy okay okay do we have snacks of course i'm hungry [Music] [Music] [Music] as the newly elected scientist supreme i will weed out the weak elements from within no more surprises no more distractions from our goals only carefully crafted innovation make no mistake aim is still the future from cloning to time travel the possibilities are endless now let's begin [Music] commander hill what's the situation good to see you again cap i wish it was under better circumstances but we think aim might have a new leader someone with ambitious plans to expand their operations is it really ambition if you have the government and public opinion on your side we can change people's minds tony even if we have to act outside the law well i do love breaking the rules shield is still getting back on its feet but we've been able to gather intel on ames operations they haven't missed a beat since san francisco here's where it gets weird our sources tell us aim has been experimenting with cloning technology new synthoids and we believe they're exploring potential uses of cosmic energy and here i hope cloning would be the weird part the world still needs the avengers maybe now more than ever you can count on us good if our intel is right we're gonna need all the help we can get i've got some field ops lined up when you're ready the harm room is back online on the lower deck so you can train up if you need to we got a big job ahead of us as the new scientist supreme monica rappuccini now directs all daily operations within aim she believes she is spinning up several dangerous new initiatives but to what end we have yet to discover since recovering the shield protocols our priority is now to help commander maria hill get shield back on its feet the protocols have revealed the locations of several shield vaults as well as agents in the field who could use our help the rest of fury's vaults are proving to be well tricky to locate we think some of those caches contain coordinates to the remaining ones what's the longest you've spent undercover aim doesn't even break the top 10 if that's what you're asking who's the current record holder that would be this one natasha romanov avenger ooh good answer never forget what ames done to people remind them no bad deed goes unpunished all shields online full power all clear hello stock everyone here seems to prefer their coffees black can't they appreciate the delicate sweet taste of a well-made latte hey mr stark what's uh what's going on tony monica's too dangerous to be left unchecked i need to stay ahead of her less room she has to think the better at times like this friends it's hard for the average american to untangle fact from fiction this week has seen a series of extraordinary events the return of the avengers sparked an armed response from advanced idea mechanics to the point where many felt aim crossed lines and overstepped their authority we witnessed a near tragic accident in new york an outbreak of the inhuman disease and open conflict between the avengers and the vigilante group known as the watchdogs and now we've received several unsubstantiated reports of a giant humanoid-like figure appearing near the san francisco quarantine zone was it the ant-man and if so what was he doing coming up in the next hour the new ceo of aim monica rapuccini will be holding a press conference to discuss recent events including the revelation of dr george tarleton's removal from the organization stay tuned wow you really haven't done much with the place i've been a little busy stuck are you doing some reading in bed still feels like i'm playing ketchup but one way or another we all are with the team back together i feel like we can finally turn the tide against aim aren't you ripped enough by now it's not about appearances tony why else would you exercise i don't get why thor's room has a bed you
