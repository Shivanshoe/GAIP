ah ever look at me part of flan's war council not bad for a weakened guray you have gained his trust i wouldn't say that no he's a bit suspicious of me in fact but he needs my army so he holds his nose of course he does vikings smell my king we are ready to deliver alec a weighty blow but our enemies are now alerted and we'll rally in greater numbers castle or castle divides ulster and kanak taking it with isolate each from each casual is a stepping stone to all the north it is an imposing fortress atop a steep cliff it must be ours but for that very reason lord it will cost us dearly to storm it loss of men is a price well paid victory will bring many more flock into our cause take care king your ambition may overlap your reason what is your council evil cunning over courage a single spy slips in and breaks the gate locks then our soldiers flood in it is worth the attempt you seem to have a feel for this evor i select you as this single spy avor it's a good challenge we have a scout near the castle she may be able to help you oh what's the matter here foreign uh uh hmm so hmm uh so so hey survey the area soon yes [Music] [Music] oh uh go [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh those defenses could stop the gods my eyes uh i should not be seen in this area hi are you flan scout you are a bold adventurer to ask in these parts yes i am how might i enter the castle alone you can try to climb its walls a foolhardy move for such a small force is there a way to enter unseen there must be a path below builders down there have reinforced the walls a wily viking could use their equipment to find the way in i am that viking hmm uh hate me be my eyes [Music] by freyja this land is green now to open the gate for flan and his army [Music] hey oh [Music] so slow uh shoot bravely don't avor casual will be ours i have your back i count on you cousins the worms yes [Music] press hard oh therefore hand me off in this won't hide you [Music] yours for the taking sack the castle got

where's our court port this deserves a song avar it is essential did you speak with her kira is she here i greeted her arrival she will build my glory throughout ireland her song will be repeated in every village and hamlet you avoir but your keen eye can give details of my bravery the bravery of all my soldiers for her to craft a ballad i will give her your message so brave king brothers you deserve another drink and you as well come back for another before the night is out then come at me eyes blaze like hell fire itself let's see you old friends [Music] oh [Music] [Music] what do you see control yourself [Music] you sing with conviction it is the mournful song of the leah fall the ancient stone you sought the coronation that stone it seemed to it the legend is that the stone will bring wool but the song claims if ireland came to pedal the stone would rain a storm of wonders from where would the song draw this wisdom i did not know but my mother sang it my mother's mother sang it as well and her mother and hers back to the very first woman of the isle the mere sound of the words connects me to my ancestors on this fertile soil you're lucky i've left my land far behind you need not leave to feel the land change beneath you that's why i'm stuck in this court like some sort of dancing goat surely you can leave any time you wish i can and i will but not until flan rules all ireland you see such a great man as that he understands that to be king is to be king of all though i'm pagan he made me court poet he respects the old ways i admire your passion thank you for that not everyone is so appreciative [Music] i appreciate you for all your qualities kira i've got more than a fine voice for singing if that's what you're asking is that what you're asking i'm asking if you'd like to take advantage of a norse who finds himself alone with a bewitching irish woman ara don't you have a way with words evil and i'm not saying never i understand i all but forgot flan sent me to remind you to begin his ballad he needn't worry i know my purpose here if it is as glorious as that song was lovely flan is certain to gain many followers good night avert i'll see you in the morning salon good night a beautiful morning oh boris asked me to return to him last night i should apologize oh the army has been poisoned curse of loki speak her son who that's the man my king you accused baris it's him what gave me the poison seven silvery pit the king of dublin my king i i only the irish were poisoned your danes are hail and hearty my lord flattering words and servile gifts all to mask treachery my lord you know this cannot be true danes don't use poison and bharath is no man of gail my king it was him he says to me poisoned the irish she says he threatened me life silence oh take this man away no no no no no i've done nothing kira i chose to place you at my right hand because you see clear still i cannot trust this dublin dane my king i have faithfully served you trust him better lord i said silence danes often fight for either side bowers stay within these castle walls while i consider your position i must first find care for my soldiers you will know my king i have a friend who can heal most any malady ah one of your scattered coven of forest dwelling pagans let me speak with her she'll find a cure arago take a soldier with her for protection i choose you as my soldier meet me at the stables near the front gate you should be grateful your head is still upon your shoulders i am by the gods i am oh come let us find my friend deirdre who is this healer she is a druid wise despite her youth are you ready i am curious to meet her oh abolish i'm disappointed that the flan even considered the accusation true the poisoning had two goals disable our army and put the blame on barith but who's behind it the soldiers cough blood it must be the poison used by a druid cult the children of danube were they when the christians came with swords and fire some few druids banded together eventually they vowed to destroy the christians they turned to mayhem and murder many disguise themselves and live among the villagers one of theatre and druids like her true druids oppose the daniel but they are scattered and disorganized that is why i am so determined to help flan to the throne as hiking of ireland he will stamp out the children of thanu leaving true druids to carry on tell me more about your friend deirdre is a druid i've known for years we've learned together you were once a druid i was there many pagans and druids isolated in forests through all ireland this way across the river this land is unsettling i'm unsure of the way follow the stone path as best you can kira whoops it's where i'm from she is a druid so a bit eccentric yes that's it eccentric kira are you ready at last to return to the joys of the forest deirdre this is my friend avor i'm sorry to say we've come for help fair me i hoped the argues were mistaken children of danu yes flan's army is spitting blood you know what is needed i'd hoped you'd find another way what is this about the children of danu make the poison but they also hold the key to its cure amber made from the sap of an ancient tree sacred to them each child of danu carries a shard of this amber once steeped in its owner's blood the power that is held deep within the amber is set free this is a samba request how will i find one of these dark druids a friend of ours tried to discover the identities that knew have taken he hoped to find one called the ren then that friend was killed that danu are truly dangerous you may find something in his abandoned house up north near port ali trading post at the mouth of the valley seder i will find this ren steep the amber in his blood and return ones i've done i pray the spirits guide you what do i know of this child of donna [Music] so uh [Applause] i must take care of the spark kid ass leonish oh [Music] uh oh [Music]

one more shot [Music] ah the curse of hiding into him learned the give them the amber stained blood ugh ever i worried you'd come to harm i did not but the ren did may the wren's blood ooze into the lonely earth and feed the forest with red milk give me the shard for the cure the humors of the ancient tree live on in the amber now sparked by blood look it turns deep crimson the cure will be painful the soldiers will rise and plead to be killed as a mercy but in a few hours they will be well thank the spirits of the earth the ren carried a note a note the poisoning and the plan to accuse bharath was the doing of someone called the cursed there is a cottage into him where the cursed heights perhaps we can find who made the poison there it is a small hope but hoped still it is nearby we must go not yet the cure is prepared you must deliver it as quickly as you can i will look for this mysterious cursed you take the cure to catalog tray or four drops on each soldier no more thank you good friend goodbye eva i'll meet you under the tree outside to him heading south the cursed will be your second child of danu avor there are others were you to bring me all their shards i could mix you a potion that will give you the first set of blazing sun i will fail this one then i will think on the others and your mysterious sun before you go there is a darkness rolling toward jira please watch over here [Music] you
