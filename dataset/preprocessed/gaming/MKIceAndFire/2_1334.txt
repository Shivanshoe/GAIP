you Marlene can't wait to take a hot shower she's good to go you should tell those doors it gets in my way attention all citizens attention all citizens this is an alert from the stimuli Emergency Operations Center unidentified intruders have detonated a bomb inside mockery after one multiple explosions have been confirmed as well as ongoing violence in response a disaster warning has been issued in sectors don't rip in the area rendering the entire center hazard no no way this couldn't have been us could it but what if it was what's done is done mercs right it ain't pretty but we can't stop now this was just the first reactor and the planet won't be safe till we get the rest yeah we always knew this was gonna get messy and this is only the beginning y'all gotta look at the bigger picture here nothing worth fighting for was ever won without sacrifice though you may not be crying out I know you in pain just like the planet but it's okay cuz I'm here for you to help take the load

crowning moment of our time but that was then and this is now I have a favor to ask our beloved planet is dying slowly silent Hey can you bear to see the planet summer cloud or the planet to die so many things it's so bright the sound voice leading this barrier the shiver of her flesh that which binds us together would be Elmore and I would be loath to live in such a world which is why I must ask you this one favor don't worry it's a simple thing run cloud run away you have to leave you have to live very good hold on to that hatred I'm seeing things fumes from all the Marco maybe all right you got this [Music] they're at the station sure we can try the alley but is getting to the station really worth breaking our necks over yes because we won't order has been issued [Music] it is not to remain sore please leave your residences at once I repeat this is an alert on the ship not emergency operations an evacuation order has been issued our area man what a mess the reactor had caused numerous ongoing fires many homes are everything it is not an evacuation area do what you like I'm taking the kids to safety learn the other way we stay together [Music] [Music] all those years of instruction the fires cat reaches here my friends at the station don't let the intruder astaire he's everywhere the firewall spread this you are too weak to save anyone not even for yourself are you are you I'm fine here this is for you flower that's right it's a gift you know for scaring those things away what things never mind think of it as a memento Just My Luck I heard that you know how much well that depends on the customer in your case it's on the house huh lovers used to give these when they were reunited look I'm involved in things dangerous things oh I'm sure you are so so keep your distance wait you think someone's out to get you is that what you're all worked up about relax no one's going to attack you I promise hey the Mokka reactor just blew you shouldn't be out here trying to sell [Music] [Music] what are they and drop your weapon are you blind no you're right wait nice meeting you [Music] sort of a crowd right now [Music] [Music] was never in doubt three let's go all

[Music] [Music] [Applause] yeah [Music] [Music] all right here it comes [Music] [Music] that [Music] yeah [Music] sorry primates [Music] [Music] [Music] right anytime now [Music] let's finish brace yourself yeah so wrong [Music] let's do this is sector eight unit to target is surrounded looking to secure wait I know that [Music] just cloud won't be joining us after all no need to assume the worst I'm sure he's fine you saw him in action didn't you guys a soldier goddamn one-man army mm-hmm you think he's a keeper yeah no worry for a minute what the hell you been up to huh giving public security to run around that's why that did trot him away from the station some Oh nicely done well can't argue with results Oh wait got a question for you all what ever been attacked by an invisible enemy wearing robes came and went like the wind thought they were invisible they were at first only saw them after she grabbed me a new Shinra weapon maybe more like a panic induced hallucination never mind forget I said anything suit yourself come on let's move up a lot of people here and in the freight car - because of the evacuation order maybe yes we've got a crowd cooperation is appreciated there's these right for shame on the slums of course they are hey cloud I am if you're about to unburden yourself don't Shh you don't make it easy stop that right now just called in sick just leave me alone all right you're holding up pretty well huh even after what we saw at the station and all over sector eight I'm a soldier Wow why don't you learn you're still shaking you get used to it something to look forward to or maybe not you see my daughter now lives in Sector a little help cloud please I can't stop thinking about it the bomb I made shouldn't have produced an explosion that big it doesn't make any sense the explosion triggered a reaction with the Mach oh you said so yourself that was my first guess but shouldn't the reactor have failsafe to prevent that kind of thing - you mentioned invisible enemies back there right right oh no I'm just looking for excuses for something that was clearly my own fault gotta own up to it if I'm gonna learn from this and move on thanks cloud here a good listener [Music] what kind of maniacs go so far is to bomb a reactor they've yet to announce it publicly but I heard it was avalanches do anything really aren't they the terrorists who tried to kill the president is there nothing they won't do hey we're talking about us everyone knows avalanche only cares about saving the planet just just who do you think you are a law-abiding concerned citizen ha ha fighting really in my humble opinion that explosion was a message a message to the bastard readin our planet dry they got it heard it loud and clear y'all's masters we will not submit to intimidation or violence but work together for peace and prosperity that is how civilized people change the world [Music] that is the Shinra trees in spite words is what we believe we all have to follow our conscience don't we we should go right [Music] Oh you hear that soot syndrich read my ass we're the good guys damn it you hear that soup syndrich read my hey this train is slower than molasses is right they'd probably kill us if they knew we were the ones responsible I get it if you can't relate [Music] shower might help long hot wine [Music] [Music] let's get this out of the way personally I find visual aids make the dull stuff a lot more bearable if it helps think of it as an initiation right how many times do I have to tell you people I'm not there's such a thing as playing too hard to get so here we've got a wireframe model of the great city of Midgar complete with massive steel plates suspended 300 metres above ground level the top which stands a shining beacon of civilization the whole system is sustained by the Mokka reactors which feed the insatiable appetites of the public the drain will be passing through an ID checkpoint shortly this here is the trains route as you can see it'll take us around this main pillar look we're about halfway through it now they've set up a checkpoint here to scan the IDS of all passengers heading in and out date of birth residential status criminal history all that and more is automatically cross-referenced in their databases public security wouldn't have it any other way heads-up don't worry our IDs are impeccable [Music] what'd I tell ya have a little faith won't be long till we reach the bottom relax take a good look it's because of that great big pizza in the sky that people down there gotta struggle to survive Shinra sucks up Mach Oh while the soil turns to dust the air feels with smog and the flowers die then leave and don't look back that's what's always worked for me oh that's all well and good if you only out for yourself but the folks down there don't have the luxury of choice you know like this train is suppose there's only one way it can go you [Music] [Music] bombs detonated one members lost zero and one step closer to a brighter future lower your voices huh people are listening now get some R&R you've earned it just be ready for the next mission All Right see you soon at seventh heaven you know where tifo works don't keep awaiting to worry [Music] not long [Music] are you sure you haven't seen my husband if I did I don't remember office still there somehow as long as the trains are running it'll be work as usual tomorrow he's really tall you'd have no trouble spotting him even if he was in a crowd he doesn't bring any bad [Music] no one right now what are we even doing here no one in their right mind would go into a train graveyard at night people talk rumors spread and kids get curious speaking of which you hear it was supposedly a ghost not a monster must've been seeing things [Music] a reactor bombing [Music] [Music] I'm going on a ghost [Music] office still there let's go someplace train services happen when I put it in charge of my stand I told them son [Music] is to make people happy [Music] just enough fried March hand forward hear me out no words can describe apparently Shinra thinks it's a group called avalanche that's what I heard on the train anyway avalanche that sounds familiar uh-huh what kind of person bombs a reactor the kind of person who goes around putting up fliers all over the slums I expect I've never felt the ground shake like that shinra huh ma KO is the lifeblood of the planet you know the hell it is goddamn eco-warriors with their dumbass posters I tear them down and they're back up inside of an hour like I've got nothing better to do I mean look at all that steel work you're trying to tell me that's not progress you okay buddy ma Co junkie huh Vickers you again that hot shower can't come soon enough I can barely tell my skin from all the ash and sweat when I get back it's refuelling time and you Jessie I don't know figure out how I screwed up huh you're such a kidder [Music] this is

planet of course let that be a lesson to you [Music] you [Music] before we get on to money there's an empty apartment in a place just down the road it's nothing fancy but I was thinking you could stay there for now the landlady is a big friend of the cause so you wouldn't even have to pay rent sound good sure does Thanks follow me then how was it up on the plate it was chaotic sorry for driving home in two ounces it was wrong of me to put you in danger like that I promise I won't do it again dangerous part of the job don't worry about me I'll try always happy to help stick at the Shinra so you make nice with everyone as much as I could all things considered maybe not enough for them good you had me worried you're not exactly a people person I'll give you that I saw sector 8 on the news it was like a war zone the news is just another Shinra mouthpiece I'll spread whatever lies Shinra tells him to oh right and here we are good ol stargazer Heights you're on the second floor room 201 here is where I sleep don't have time for much else what with seventh heaven and all not even time to decorate here's your room - OH - don't worry I already told the landlady about you you did yes oh I mean I told her I had a friend looking for a place to stay was that too much no it's fine and this that one's uh no what it's getting late I'll introduce you tomorrow it's a little bare but should be enough to get you through the night if you want anything else we can always rent one thing my money you guys only 2000 remember I do and we'd love to settle up especially since this was your first job for us but that's it sorry we spent the rest preparing for the mission that really is it but not for long I'm collecting money for filters tomorrow so I can pay you after and you're sure about that of course as long as you help that is wait then I'd have to pay you for that too never mind no mm enough that's what we agreed on so that'll be the price with what you gave me at least 1,500

packet size [Music] what are you doing to Marco this is his apartment he's got a few problems but he's not a bad guy the landlady asked me to check on him now and then to make sure he's okay can I ask you to do the same sure [Music] [Music] [Music] well now you must be cloud I'm Mara your landlady so how'd you like the place you from up on high I've been around I'll bet no matter all kinds come

thing Juma's brain [Music] morning hey just so you know Marlene's still asleep let the down to business shall we her these water filters won't replace themselves although the next batch probably could if Jessi put her mind to it most every home in the area has one folks love them because they practically eliminate the rotten egg smell honestly they make us more money than this place and it's easy money too we bring new filters collect the old ones and get paid what give me a break I'm not a Salesman I'm a soldier which is why no one will refuse to pay what do you say please let's get this over with great and while we're at it I'll give you the Grand Tour [Music] go ahead and keep whatever recline seeing as you didn't bring any luggage I'm guessing there stuff you need to buy Thanks and don't worry we'll pay you the different sounds Barrett's out making us groans - hey they're here to change out your water filter keep the baby how you doin I've been waiting for you to see clouds in charge of collections they'll take your time sounds like a pretty sweet gig if you ever need someone to fill then undermanned in your dreams maybe since we're here maybe we should do a little shopping

your filter next needs changing [Applause] [Music] all the items you can walk straight from the place no matter your needs are your budget he's a regular stock up here and he might throw in a free beer too are you maybe well you could try being a little nicer to get free not my style our next stop is stargazer Heights plan ladies a client just met her then you know what to expect remember she's a good friend of avalanche so be nice please just imagine if rich people start thinking of safer down apparently it was done by a terrorist group called nothing's your report painting surveillance hey

making connections it's not what you know but who you know you know hmm another lesson for life on the ground floor yep connections get you jobs jobs build your rep and more rep gets you better connections how do I start hmm why not help out the neighborhood watch they're mostly volunteers but you'll get to know people yeah okay didn't see anybody at the office so let's head up top no better way to keep you and your family safe and with a weapon of your own come and check out our selection we gotta do something about the monsters on scrap Boulevard I'll head on down there first thing tomorrow huh didn't know you were holding down the fort huh oh hey cloud looking at join the neighborhood watch that depends what is this neighborhood watch do um lots of stuff really and our top priority is taking care of any beasts that wander into town that teaching the locals how to defend themselves like they say the only one who will look out for you is you clouds a great fighter but only we know that if no one knows him no one will hire him thought if he joined the watch he could get his name out there that would work for everybody truth be told we could really use your help we can't pay you in kill but we'll work something out for example what about your sword I could mod it for you no thanks it's fine just the way it is what you some kind of purist I know I'd never pass up a chance to improve Mikey hood come on at least let me show you how it's done [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all set needless to say we'll have to try it out to appreciate the difference thanks huh we'll do you one better spread the word to everyone who listen about the new Merkin town between him and wedge there isn't anyone they don't know I'll march through the street singing your praises even on an empty stomach so where are these monsters scrap boulevard good hunting hey cloud I'll come with no I've got this but you don't know the way do you read on sure thing I

subject [Music] not exactly small talk especially with someone you haven't seen in a while I get it still it's kind of funny us going our separate ways thinking that must be it that we'd never meet again and then here of all places we do you know what we should totally celebrate let's dress up and hit the town really I mean why not it'll be fun do you even have fancy clothes not like fancy fancy

thing for a go-getter like you Thanks no Russian Deepa let me stop by later you gonna bless us with your cocoa tonight [Music] I've chatted with that married guy afield and here we are you must be tired same as you I guess could use a little something to take the edge off right how about a refreshing cocktail made by yours truly that you can sit back and save her Tifa yeah I'm feeling it a bit too hey do you think you'll stick around a little longer maybe work for a minute build up some savings I see so what'll it be wanna head back out for a little while [Music] yeah why not [Music] well

but it shouldn't take much longer in the meantime grab a seat [Music] what'll it be I don't know something hard and bitter [Music] well most people would say something sweet right about now I'm sure they would ah but you're a more discerning customer aren't you in which case [Music] our house special the Cosmo Canyon [Music] beautiful I gotta go enjoy [Music] [Music] hey you see the news the reactor bombing was the work of the Eco extremist group Avalanche public enemy number one gets your heart racing doesn't it they don't know our faces so we're in the clear for now but we'll want to capitalize on this momentum speaking of which you coming on the next one for the right price oh you can bet I'll be pushing hard for a race TfL will be joining us too but I don't know even a blind man can see her heart's not in it she was never on board with the bombings so if it comes down to do or die if I've got to put my life in someone else's hands I'd rather that someone was a professional like you [Music] could still kill some time
