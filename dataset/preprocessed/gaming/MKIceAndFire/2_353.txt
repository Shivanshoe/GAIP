i say we climb so when did you start smoking excuse me a lighter it's nothing just something i picked up back at face are you ready are you this place doesn't look much like a weapon silo to me if there's nothing down here then why were we attacked there's a war on people tend to shoot each other i guess we could classify this as quality time you and i always did have a different view on quality type does this remind you of old times rage you mean the sense of feeling lost [Music] [Music] floor seems stable yeah it looks fine you've got a certain cool under pressure after you left i learned to deal with pressure [Music] what do you think this place is hard to say these carvings look religious i think we might be in a temple do you know watch horror movies you should know the answer to that it's a sumerian demon something to do with plagues i think plagues and demons huh great great that's all we need what is it you didn't hear that i didn't hear anything i thought i heard something down there even in ruins this place is still something special i wonder what happened here that's gunfire where's it coming from we should move can you make anything out that's it's deep that looks safe to you it's our only option get the rope we're going down [Music] so oh unbelievable we're not the first ones here damn it all this crap must be what kayla's detecting i'm sorry eric for real you put everything into this research more than you'll ever know you can't blame yourself i'll learn from this i'll go back and work twice as hard to rewrite the program kayla's will be stronger than ever you don't think i can do it you don't believe in me there's no use in dwelling on it we need to focus on the task ahead and find a way out of this place the hell is that subsidence from the aftershocks this looks like archaeological gear somebody was studying this ruin hey we could use those lamps the light could guide the marines to us do you think that still works it'll work just needs gas we need to find some wherever you are nick i hope you're safe sorry did you say something no nothing eric check this out why would there be a machine gun here it's a world war ii model ties in with the time the archaeologists were here what the [ __ ] happened here i hope we can get this thing started all call signs this is king does anyone copy over this temple it was built to appease the gods we need to get these lights running asap i can't see [ __ ] i'll take that thank you this is king to all call signs are you receiving over [ __ ] that's a hell of a lot of fireworks i'm beginning to think that even the iraqis don't know about this place september the 24th 1945 when lady bradshaw summons you you go mary and i were bound for a honeymoon but the chance to dine with one of britain's finest antiquarians was too great for us to miss when we met brad shaw wore a brooch that caught mary's eye a sumerian relic recovered from a dick site in the hashemite kingdom of iraq after dinner she showed us another find from the same site a gold uniform tablet she called it the final puzzle piece in her life's work a map that pinpoints the tomb of alexander the great if she's right the tomb lies somewhere on the border of iraq lady bradshaw wants us to lead her expedition i realize now that our honeymoon will take place in a dusty dig site in the segros mountains this place is starting to make me feel a little uneasy what happened to these guys eric come give me a hand with these cans oh tell me i had a little luck how's the lake holding up lake oh you mean the prosthesis i lost my leg back on the highway don't i still feel guilty i didn't make it easy on you rage i know that you weren't to blame for that crap mom let's get to work [Music] shining light on the tank ah [ __ ] what's wrong fuel tubes worn loose the damn valve is leaking can it be fixed we have to secure the tube before starting the generator there's gonna be something here to fix it you got it i've got it was this a good time to talk that depends it's on your mind back at the base you said we'd talk when the time is right it looks like we got the whole place to ourselves this has got to be the worst date ever why'd you pick this dump yeah i don't know what happened the reviews were good hang on a sec i think i fixed the leak hold the fuel pipe it's done hey give me a hand with this panel look at the state of these they're shot feels like so long since we worked on something together at the same time feels like yesterday why do we leave things like this i tried but you made it so hard for me to stay we should have stuck together i don't think either of us expected to be out of each other's lives for so long past year or so my husband buried in chaos and i was blind to anything else your work is bigger than the both of us like i don't think either of us could have foreseen the impact it would have rach say what's on your mind i've missed you rage like you wouldn't believe back then i don't know things seemed confused but [Music] now it just seems simpler maybe there's hope for us after all [Music] that should do the trick let's fire up [Music] [Music] we have power there was a way in for these people there's a way out for us let's take a look around [Music] ah hmm we gotta go through it's safe [Music] this way so [Music] so oh [Applause] ah god i hit this place [Applause] let's go [Music] you're regretting not calling for additional air support there you go reading my mind again what do you think the rest of the squad are doing they're tough each and

wasn't about his secret smoking habit eric tell me the truth don't do this admit it if someone else isn't there the bones of this temple are drenched in blood we have set foot on an uncharted shore and allows something ancient and wicked a blasphemy that comes in indescribable shapes and forms the eons we lived as children in this world unaware of the horrors that strum have been found now we have blindly followed from the gates to madness i fear being taken but i must do what i must we will seal this place for eternity for all mankind mary i'm sorry hello [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] the
