i'm seeing [ __ ] these hallucinations describe them to me blinding lights it's loud i'm on stage and i almost can't breathe i'm so damn full of hatred then i let it all out into a mic and i realized it didn't help i don't feel any better and then promise not to laugh i plan a bomb in our soccer tower nothing there to laugh about night city looked different strange and i hated it hated everybody every inch it was too real even for a lucid dream you weren't dreaming v those were memories there's a personality construct on that shard dreams you had or from his past saying i experienced another psyches memories how's that possible you two are connected in a way i can't make head or tail of who me and who vic who's the other johnny silverhand a terrorist real talk of a town back in my day anyway it's not what's important right now never given me that look before vic what is it you uh don't get a lot of time left kid say what now the biochip it's basically a bomb fuse lit already you don't have much time left much life a few weeks tops silver hands construct is overriding your consciousness gradually taking over your body until one day you'll just be gone v it's important you get all this fix me up right vic if i could i would be believe me but this is that's way beyond what i know how to do you're the best of the best fig why can't you help me you want the long story or the short don't admit a thing not one deep okay there was is a construct a psyche on the chip out of johnny's silver hand you jacked it in your chip slot nothing happened right until you died bullet in the head from dexter to sean but how do you come back from something like that low caliber you lucked out not least thanks to another poor decision by mr deshaun the nanites off the chip started fixing the damage then they took your hand and coaxed you off the path toward the light people don't just die and get up like nothing happened used to be true now it's only if they don't have a classified piece of corporate tech primed to resurrect them what about me my psyche i'll make it back from the other side and what i'm supposed to pretend change is normal ask the arasaka engineers who built the thing all i know is your mind's gonna go it won't be pretty from the biochips perspective your brain cells are a tumor that needs to be scooped out well your body's an empty shell to hold the construct so this [ __ ] terrorist wants to wipe me and take my place take my body it's not willful on his part it's automatic inevitable and neither of you can stop it [Music] can't we just take the chip out or switch it off either ways out of the question you die immediately [ __ ] i remember this thing saw it on tv what was that stupid slogan sold something secure your soul but that's it it's just supposed to let you communicate with constructs maybe but this is a prototype by the look of things somehow made it out of arisaka labs vic you've always come through for me if there's nothing you can do to help me then well what the hell do i do tell me please vic i wish i knew kid misty [Music] you're asking too much from an old-timer like vic come on v let's get you home you
