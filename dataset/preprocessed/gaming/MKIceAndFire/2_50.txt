your support general all right we're within range just let me do the talking okay here goes nothing urgent communication from poe dameron of the republic fleet oh it's a very good likeness how is your mother sir obliterate them he's going for the dreadnought huh all right take it up the cannons now tally start your approach man they really went wild with the cannons on this thing huh as well here comes the parade we're still evacuating the base almost everyone's joined the fleet we're just waiting on the last few ships evacuation almost complete just a little longer the evacuation is complete you did it po now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place no general we can do this we have the chance to take out a dreadnought disengage now that's an order uh bad connection gotta go squadron bring the bombs bombers keep that type formation fighters protect the bombers it's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought so let's make this count this one's going in the scrapbook bb-8 [Music] abandon ship we have to protect that last bomber it's our only hope they're targeting the fleet we need to protect that last bomber it's our only chance to bring down that dreadnought [Music] they just won't stop unless we close up their hangars hey bb-8 you're thinking what i'm thinking torpedo time that's right this drug knot is a fleet killer we can't let it get away [Music] it's all down to you bombs away direct hit we have them tied on the end of a the string kylo ren take that ridiculous thing off you're just a child in a mask my ship [Music] well done pal spin naked leaking bag what buddy it's so good to see you we need to get you dressed come on where's ray one thing at a time buddy let's get you dressed first we'll find you a jacket and some pants there's got to be a closet around here or something come on let's get you some clothes that don't leak what there's nothing in here who took it all tell me them people have a habit of borrowing and not returning here if you look around the ship i'm sure you'll find some spares lying around it says here that the last jacket went out to a pea damari don't think i know the guy the jacket should be in that wardrobe there you know what i probably could have just opened the door instead yeah never really liked that wardrobe anyway that should do it all right now let's head back to the closet so you can get changed in peace well i'm dressed so where now all right we've got to go back to the bridge for a debriefing we'll get you all caught up while we're there where's ray huh they've tracked us through light speed that's impossible follow my lead huh [Music] [Music] um so who's in charge next in command is vice admiral holdo thank you commander what's our plan stick to your post and follow my orders what are you doing here just uh doing some checks checking the escape pods this fleet is doomed i need to warn my friend ray if she comes back to it she's doomed too i'm turning you in for desertion i wasn't running away i need to get to my friend and warn her that this ship is doomed we can jump to light speed sticking trackers through light speed they can track us through light speed yeah and we're dangerously low on fuel active tracking hyperspace tracking is new tech but the principle must be the same they're only tracking us from the lead ship we gotta speak the po even if we got on the star destroyer to switch it off who knows where the breaker room even is the guy who used to mop it if i can get us there i can shut their tracker down why would a door be locked behind some target practice it's the only way to ensure everyone is training with their blaster you got that look on your face tell me what's going on the first order is only tracking us from one destroyer the lead one so we blow that one up i like where your head's at but no sneak on board disable the track our fleet escapes before they realize how do we sneak the two of you onto snoke's destroyer find the master code breaker you will find him with a red plum bloom on his lapels in the casino the fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left we gotta hurry i'll be here to jump us to lightspeed cantobyte on kentonica great you know where that is yeah let's grab the pod from the hanger you're not gonna zap me this time right i'm not ready to joke about that yet huh [Music] you sure we can park here don't get distracted remember the master co-breaker will be wearing a red plum bloom sounds like the kind of guy who'd hang out in that fancy building up there so the old lighthouse on the beach gives me the creeps i have so so [Applause] all right red plum bloom where are you let's ask around see if anyone's seen him this place is so much fun we have nothing like it on my home planet i don't even want to go to the private party a red plum bloom i mean that's so last cycle it's a crime that he thinks he looks good with it tried to talk my way into the code breaker's private party but i couldn't understand a word the guard said a twilight i think big guy with the head tentacles looks like he's not gonna let us through then we'll have to find another way in a red plum bloom the master code breaker [Music] yep those are the shuttle parkers all right you two are under arrest for parking violation 2017. without a code breaker to sneak into snoke's star destroyer what do we do i don't know unless you got a thief in your pocket um i can do it what me and the first order codage can go way back did he just [Music] you to keep hmm to a bare minimum during your stay thank you there if we can get that cover up we can escape through the sewer oh we don't have our grapplers we're gonna have to get them back from the guard room the alarm if we set it off the guards will have to come investigate that'll draw them out their room for sure we're gonna need something to weigh this down can you see anything travelling isn't gonna work with just us two someone or something needs to sit on this switch bouncing session over oh this better be the biggest emergency this city's ever seen [Music] now let's get to that guard room [Music] i'm pretty sure it ain't oh are they maintenance guys they're prisoners you moof milker call for backup now [Music] look guard uniforms you think we can use them anyway couldn't bust us out could you okay it's in here somewhere [Music] ah great

laundry room and grab some disguises it's just off the main corridor come on there's a trooper in that corridor we have to take them out won't that create a bunch of noise bb-8 do you think you can make as a distraction well i guess it's worth a try more troopers needed we need reinforcements now this is it the laundry room we gotta get in fast before any troopers find us out here quick huh [Music] so now we look the part oh where are we going uh this way you sure these disguises will work we'll be fine just look casual but not too casual hello there admiral can i get the door for you

that the mineral planet crate that's a rebel base abandoned but heavily armed they're coming shut the door incoming no no no you're not dead is this all that's left everybody oh i'm so glad to see you use whatever power we've got left to broadcast a distressed signal to the outer rim my programming is making me announce i have new what can we do to help we need to get a distress signal out to our allies in the outer rim if they're going to help us it's now or never can you fix up that old radar dish looks pretty bent out of shape you got it bb8 give these guys a hand i need to figure out how we're gonna defend this bait we gotta get this distress signal out quick but the dish has got no power and it's facing the wrong way could you help us out i guess we can spare the power supply from that one it's not doing much anyway now we've got it turned on do you know how this thing works i left the manual back on the radius hey looks like we got it up and running good job [Music] but the dish itself is a bit broken you think you could get on the roof and fix it guess you aren't able to reach the dish bba is there anything around here we can use to give him a boost hmm it's all working we did it great teamwork guys the distress signal is being transmitted imagine if no one responds i'm sure they will i'm not worried finn come up here you're gonna want to see this uh so we got to
