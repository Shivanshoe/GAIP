testing testing comms the bots would have followed the paths marked by the survey rods i'm sure they're listening in on the purple the tremors are increasing in frequency and size safety first try not to trip slip or break anything [Music] there one of my boxes up there greetings we are in the greatness of dangers follow be quick um okay oh no hurry hurry sports first smells awful the blue finally a decent connection very dangerous indeed we should be cautious i am overheating i'll ping her so she comes back to me looks like she picked up an audiophile i'll start cleaning it up there's an old research lab ahead i know jim that's where he'd head first jim oh right another bot on it hey [Music] oh give up yet it'd be great if you did oh that was close behind the safety glass is perhaps she is talking about the safety protocols i know i find red tape constricting makes as much sense as anything identified non-hostile entity hello are you my new best friend uh no you should head back to the chief engineer friendship request denied sad noises returning to chief engineer oh stop fussing jim hopefully he picked up interdimensional messages and didn't get to see friends identified hostile entity hello are you my new best friend [Music] yep i've lost count pretty much everyone i need does work for emperor nefarious ah a fair point real platforms well defunct ones a million percent sure rifts opened over here definitely find the bots [Music] okay i see the bot over on that platform on the right past the broken bridge there must be a way to reach huh we have reached the bot platform but the functional bot is in the intact dimension right missing something hit oh the crane moves the crystal this may bring us one step closer to reaching the body dimensional message sam who is trying to find herself one step closer to figuring out this message that's all of them thanks come back to my survey station let's see what the little box picked up from the other side [Music] facility security lockdown engaged don't worry don't worry i designed a security system myself except that motion traffickers are saying they're inside the house uh through um the ceiling i always forget to look up [Music] destroyed [Music] the emperor will hear of him native light forms no longer detected security walls disarmed thank you and have a blaze and bleeds our day [Music] they're gonna take a little longer to decode huh uh [Music] uh i'm sorry you and ratchet were separated oh well i should have foreseen something going wrong the dimensionator was too powerful to show off in public wow huh hello are you my new best friend uh sure i will take you to our phase course extracting drill in the name of french that can't be good that dimensional anomaly is identical to the one we saw on sargasso good that means you can deal with it as your best friend i must warn you that dimensional integrity could have affected the drill what's that mean as your best friend i do not want you to worry so i will not expound at this time instead impromptu [Music] that tube is cleared we make a great team that is a popular one great start where to next you all come back real soon now [Music] i just saw ratchet on somali you did how is he great but appropriately heroic but i digress your possibilities are waiting for you to guide them to the meta my possibilities cannot pass through with that much wind is there some way i can weigh them down ah that's a heavy sphere it will weigh down any object it touches which sounds rather obvious so what is in that book of yours oh uh the most up-to-date collection of knowledge in the universe as catalogued by my father and who is that i believe you know him as the plumber he is your father what is he doing now taking his first vacation ever so he left me in charge and i'm trying my best so how did you get the title profit oh i actually didn't choose the name it was given to me by the savali monks after i helped them decipher some of their archives what does that mean oh just a lot of pointing and saying stuff like that's a blogian phone book that's a kerchoot that's a terra-clad love poem incredible clank only two more to go how are things going with rhythm well enough she hacked my brain and saw my memories is that what you kids are doing these days i'm sorry it is interesting for being dimensional counterparts ratchet and rivet have surprising differences ratchet never had any weariness of robots when you met me yet rivet does maybe your dimension is the outlier maybe all the other ratchets don't like robots in their dimensions either this should keep things on the down low [Music] my possibilities are a visual representation of my mind trying to understand dimensionality and the more i help them find their way the more i will understand and be able to fix everything everything oh nice i never thought to use the spear like that is there anything about ratchet and rivet that's the same they are both very quick to take action unlike me i always get so caught up in the details and you wish you were better about that not all the time but it would be nice to not have to worry so much this should give me a lift i hope i'm not interrupting the process but i think there are more spears left to find i think i know how to help you with your getting caught up in the details problem you just gotta be confident what do you mean if there's one thing i've learned from my father it's that acting like you know what you're doing can get you everywhere in life that is carrying a plunger oh oh ah the police our anomaly has been fixed great job clank thank you no thank you and remember confidence [Music] now we can deal with the clock hydraulic supply restored with that fixed we should now be able to use that elevator time to drill for some phase courts in case i do not get another chance to say it thank you don't get much yummy now bolts not done yet hey look the bros squad is back [Music] oh i cannot help thinking what we still do not know what happened to your dimensions fleas are we will soon then we can stop it from happening in this dimension [Music] huh ah nowhere to go okay [Music] we are fast approaching the main drill [Music] wow it's been my lifelong dream to operate a drill a hundred times bigger than me really that is very specific specific goals are achievable goals robot brilliant news i decoded the message from beyond listen finally conception listen do not turn on the drill the wrist damaged it drill destroyed our bleezo what we just turned it on [Music] take cover lock down engage i can try a remote shutdown i thought you loved giant machinery [Music] should have upgraded [Music] uh will be you guys we must return to the other dimension quickly uh that is the last of them there's got to be a way back around here [Music] [Music] [Music] oh bad news everybody i can't shut down the drill i forgot to update the tools 4.331 prepare for sweet death and have a blazing blizzard day we are not gonna die blazing or otherwise what is your plan that dropship is big and heavy and full of fuel it is perilously close to becoming a bomb or if we crash it into the drill we could dislodge it and stop the planet from shattering normally i see that's against protocol but this is a free post-apocalypse world we live in so go for it then praise for impact hello it is your best friend jim please do not die because i deleted my sweet as soon as we became best friend rivet [Music] oh no well maybe it's not as bad as it i know this is gonna sound totally weird but the mortgage used to tell me legends about someone on tour and four called the fixer if it's broke the picture will fix it then i suppose we should see if the legends are true i can't believe we saved blizzard how about we fix up this face quartz and save the universe all right folks let's go find the fixer if you are right and the fixer is able to repair the face cords we will have achieved the impossible the morts always spoke so fondly of him and trust me they are terrible liars then perhaps we still stand a chance of saving the dimensions [Music] you hear that that's the sound of me destroying lies dirty filthy lies they say this dimension is unstable we're being sucked into a formless void false think otherwise i order you to throw your eyes into the local incinerator because they are clearly malfunctioning more importantly the long back spenders have not escaped how could they if we haven't even caught them yet huh few morons here you want some truth that's bounty is now 27 squid paradox just look at it all so big surreal so totally not made up and it can all be yours when you cast those stupid lumbases it seems dr nefarious will stop at nothing to catch us we better keep moving if anyone can build a new dimensionator it's ratchet i haven't forgotten about you trudy dialed in let's go what's the matter with judy oh hey there ribbit oh she's just hungry for zerp stones normally she nabs them from those rock islands up there but i guess she's too tired to fly today oh up late partying again don't worry i'll grab them oh you're a peach we'll be waiting right here when you get back oh trudy i know you like mort's parties but you can't just dance this is just what trudy needs that should be more than enough bursts to get trudy here chirping again head on back to the gelatonium factory so we can thank you in person [Music] trudy look ribbit brought you some serve stones you know if you ever wanted to grab some more i'd consider trading those ranger boots behind me for them i'll mark your map with all the surfstones in the area just in case you're interested if we wish to look now i bet this speedle would prove quite useful oh that tasted pretty darn nice huh and you got more coming your lucky little are you [Music] home sweet home i am sorry that it sustained so much damage during my abduction it's not so bad now i have a view invasive action recommended hey there big fella [Music] [Music] peace [Music] will do hey mort this whole zerpstone delivery remind you of anything oh you mean the first time we met making deliveries for the gelatonium factory so i could save up for my own place and those hours were brutal well you've come a long way since then and i've never stopped feeling lucky that we met that day i'll see you soon how long have you known mort since i was a kid they're you know a little odd but feeling better hot dog look at all those slurp stones these ranger boots are all yours [Music] now trudy here's got a big appetite so if you find the rest of the zorbstones i'll give you this rhino spybot too oh what's that just say there tony you wanna help ribbit find them well you heard her just hop on her back when you're ready to go after him trudy's help i'll be able to scope out where the rest of dessert stones are i'll tell ya it just warm gold all right girl let's go how did this get here lisa prime is a regular level mining operation known as the galaxy's main source the blizz-on crystals integrated in high-energy capacitors this material was once prevalent in computers starships and whoopinators these days however the rare ore is mostly shipped to the emperor's research facility on cordelian for various dog projects speaking of which when the dimensional crisis broke out earlier today communication with the miners went silent and their shipments to the empire were missed so ms zirkon thinks that maybe blisar might not be the safest place to be right now the love of doom is now available [Music] [Applause] they will [Music] come on back for upgrades when you level that up nice mod huh thanks for shopping dialed in let's go [Music] at least this mission will be a straightforward one i don't know about your dimension but out here things never go according to plan improvisation is a skill you learn very fast i also have a talent for improvisation well i can't wait to see you in action [Music] let's get some phase courts repaired i hope the fixer is as good as the morts say he is yes i hope so too the bridge seems to be out of commission i bet it was a raid places like this usually have to fend for themselves against bandits or pirates maybe one of the ballards you tell knows where to find it they're very um knowledgeable about the area i hope they are more hospitable than the bollards in my dimensions [Music] pardon me does anyone here know where we can find the fixers [Music] [Music] if i were a fixer where would i be fixing things i suspect oh fancy a shave buzz blades are now in stock tell them miss zerkon sends her love i guessed by a million cats a buzzblade this classic but effective destruction sends razor sharp projectiles bouncing around the environment swift piercing dusty again and again gotta blast some more patties before you can upgrade that one you unlocked it sugar looks like you've got some open cells in the raritanium to match out of raritanium oh what a shame you will be missed new tourists oh welcome to the jewel of our galaxy please enjoy yourselves did you know molina means paradise and junkish is the fixer on this planet he most definitely is great guy the best and single if either of you are interested we were told that he can fix phase quartz phase blaze quartz any quartz anything but uh we've been having trouble with pirates so we asked him to help because you know he's a big guy but after a few days of totally crushing them he just uh broke hmm perhaps we could fix him you two look like you could straighten him out in a molenop minute but the path to him was destroyed in the last pirate raid so you'll need a hurl shot oh and i saw one in the smelting pits further ahead lucky you still after this or you and ratchet going to the lombax dimension it is possible but ratchet is uncertain perhaps he is afraid that afraid why afraid it is complicated well hey if you didn't want to go i will [Music] [Music] uh across the canyon but there is no way to reach it huh a hurdle shot's gonna get us across that chasm it's huge yes and i am not thrilled about the name either but we must find one at the smelting pits watch out [Music] better jump here comes another one a smelting pit is a curious place for a hurl shot to be i'm guessing it has something to do with them while getting recalled recently something about fractured spines oh [Music] very impressive they keep coming oh dear this rail system seems exceedingly dangerous just hang on it goes straight to the smelting pits i am afraid we may end up in a smelting pit [Music] [Music] this looks useful in fact i have a notion that it be crucial it's it's faith has brought us together again mapper deep revenge guess fate really loves seeing you get your butt kicked pierre ah you pirate mateys attack oh here the pirates are waiting for scrap shot it would be worth using the high ground here good idea ah shields looks like we're gonna have to get created but you should did you talk him to death or what i would love to take the credit but no the cause of the pixel's brokenness is a mystery to me i will enjoy his absence however [Music] that's all of them let's get that hurl shot down [Music] we've got the hurl shot now we just have to get across that pirate building and find [Music] small enough is mostly junk what are they hoping to loot here we're better to find buried treasure than on a junk planet if marlon is mostly junk what are they hoping to loot here they're better to find buried treasure than on a junk planet oh [Music] how many pirates does pierre maybe the fixer will help finish them off [Music] then again we seem to be doing pretty well on our own [Music] incoming [Music] did you ever think you're the one getting in my way hello everyone aah [Music] perhaps you would like i knew that now are we going to dance [Music] me oh my expenses [Music] are ya sure [Music] [Music] i suggest we abandon shift suggestion noted [Music] nice one bolts i'd be happy if i never saw a pirate again you know it is quality when you buy from miss zerkon we can now use the hurl shot to reach the fixer [Music] gotta admit the fixture being a giant robot is not what i expected perhaps when he is not fighting pirates he is a gentle giant that's my experience with big robots but we'll see you want more pierre i'm just waiting for you to come down and find me yourself are you saying something here i stopped [Music] good listening you'll never have to find out you and your adorable festive backpacks then no chance sassy backpacks [Music] that's now pierre will take and so shall to the we [Applause] uh what if the face courts cannot be fixed and we're in deep trouble but there's no point in worrying about it now [Music] huh ah [Music] [Music] uh [Music] next time [Music] [Music] how exactly will we fix the fixer hmm i guess we have to turn him on first was he turned off because he was broken huh this must be the fixers on switch [Music] hello are you um okay no i am broken as is everything nothing can be fixed oh my [Music] pirates are taken god of please focus on the grinding he's bringing the whole place down jump [Music] ahead [Music] destruction is our natural state [Music] don't listen to him bolts if you're broken so am i and i think we're pretty awesome [Music] did you have any ideas because i'm having a hard time thinking while running away from a giant homicidal robot i am working on it [Music] science collapses [Music] wisdom i may have an idea i'm all ears [Music] i am broken i cannot fix i cannot be fixed oh dear did everything [Music] [Music] improvising i may be different than i was but you helped me realize i am still clank i am quite relieved when the volunteers asked me to protect them it opened my eyes to a great many broken things so very many and you became distressed but being able to fix another to see that all is not lost how can i ever repay you both can you fix this [Music] thank you you just gave an old giant robot the gift of hope it should be i who is thanking you whew let's get back to the ship shall we yes oh i hope ratchet had an easier time building a new dimensionator so are we gonna talk about you rescuing me back there i did you did looks like you're a natural even in my dimension i thank you rivet you got the bad guy back what did he say actually don't worry about it i'll tell you
