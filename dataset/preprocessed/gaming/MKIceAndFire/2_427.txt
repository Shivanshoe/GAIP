that was certainly worth risking life and limb for not bad at all he survived i mean puzzle the captain is just up ahead finally looks like pierre was telling the truth after all let us see what is up ahead first perhaps that means congratulations in kraken that doesn't make it any better run [Music] so captain what what brings ye here you're uh in danger the emperor has a mentionator you already

quark quark it's quantum captain quantum [Music] murderer no no no no it's me it be me quantum see she will pay for the file in our captain's head like that both are ye [Music] no no this is all your fault captain what you have to save me my name's ratchet will you give us the helmet [Applause] fine you can have the stupid helmet i'm going to try and steer us off this planet but you do have to hold the pirates until we're ready for [Music] takeoff [Music] [Music] [Music] hey that quark guy you mentioned earlier he's our dimensions version of you but we really should talk about this later

[Applause] [Music] it is not working ratchet are you thinking what i'm thinking i am afraid so we have no choice hit the bell [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh fair's fair so this captain quark is he a pirate in your dimension too no he's a hero even though he's betrayed us surrendered to save his own skin taking credit for our he's a hero because no matter how many times he screws up he's
