[Music] our work is finished Lucayan Lord Rayden I am merely Raiden now you have proven worthy to take my place as the new protector of earth realm once it is restored you honor me Raiden the honor is mine Lord Liu Kang the sense of time are now yours to shape it falls upon you to architect a new history the fate of all realms in my hands Raiden I cannot do this alone I shall advise you for as long as my mortality allows but have no doubt you are up to the task then together let us begin [Music] see Liu Kang before you do my soul xiexie I Forge it but I use your magic before the hour glass shatters even here at the dawn of time you spew lies and deceit we will not hear it in defeating chronica you destroyed her crown without it you can't restart history the hourglass will shatter all realms will be lost pooja is this true Crona cos every action was taken to ensure her crowns preparation she would not dare to restart history without it this Kronecker came to each of us for our help she offered places in her new era for refusing her we were banished to avoid beyond time we could observe the events leading up to your siege of the keep but we were powerless to intervene but then you cute chronica the void seal was broken open permitting no escape via the hourglass if you know so much about the hourglass how do you propose I reset the timeline with the crown the crown is destroyed only in our present not in our past and while I cannot restart history without the crown you can send travelers back into the current timeline I see I must return to the moment before Crona cos defeat in that battle differently so that her crown remains intact that leaves too much to chance Chronicle must never possess the crown otherwise you cannot guarantee victory what do you propose sorcerer let you send me into the past to steal the crown from my Island before chronica sends setri on deployment I'll then deliver it to Lord Raiden and together we'll defeat chronica with a crown an hourglass under our control we can restart history safely why are we listening to this snake because I am a snake who's toiled beside Monica learning her secrets I know them do you he has a point rated put it a word [Music] how is it you conspire against Kronecker did her promises of Crenshaw not suit you she wanted me to be her pawn not her partner she sculpted my entire existence to serve her to collect souls for her crown when my purpose was served she betrayed me casting me into the void your grievance does not fool me sang-soo then trust that we have a shared interest in breaking chronica stranglehold on our destinies inevitably our interests will diverge this alliance is temporary have no illusions otherwise I understand your misgivings but it is the only way but the risk looking will be rewarded say nothing tonight move [Music] we will proceed with your plan schenzel I must stay behind to operate the hourglass but nightwolf and Fujian will go with you to supervise I welcome the assistance I will join you no ready I need your counsel here have faith in fortune and night wolf if I have faith in anyone it is you brother [Music] I will try to send you back to the time merger you should have enough time to claim the crown before century art delivers it to chronicle your confidence is inspiring as the keeper of time I am still a novice Knight may the Great Spirit protect us [Music] you'd suffer too long if these pretenders hands but I've returned and I will save you from his madness [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] where's this boldness with hiding that you've shown it before I have had no need for my leader my sister was an unholy monster exactly like you Father [Applause] one of them arrived immediately after the time merger yet the battle between : Schalke no look [Applause] it's much later than that this is katanas battle we shall come then we're almost out of time we must escape quickly changing this battles outcome could cause Centurion to claim the crown earlier than expected and guarantee our failure let's go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] we escaped the battle undetected right soon or not where have you been hiding you can sort with Earthrealm us now his business is none of yours collector my business is collecting what shall come once he will pay handsomely for you you're outnumbered collector these are indeed strange days how did our framers profit by protecting shank soup he shares our goal hanukkah's defeat you will be partners in death Thank You Great Spirit [Music] Kitana has defeated Shao Kahn he always had more ego than skill come let us leave while the crowd is distracted no we're already here later than we wanted to be let's go to your Island now and take the crown no detours a rather public arrival at the Coliseum makes that impossible chronicles out world allies while informal of our presence go to my Island now and could be ambushed by Centurion herself and our combined power won't stop her we need help but whose help we can't recruit any of our allies without altering this timelines events Sindel sandeul's a revenant who can be restored to life and who plays no major part in the battles that lie ahead we can safely recruit her without disrupting events it's a tactic chronica is unlikely to anticipate she was shao kahn's empress is equal in evil because he had her bewitched returning sindell to life will restore her original more heroic self and if we fail the cinder line you wiped out most of Earth realms champions in a single battle if night wolf hadn't sacrificed himself she would have killed them all that is the power we need to assure victory against a tree on sindell is the key and I suppose restoring her will be easy anything but we can use earth rounds jinsei - heels sandals Bobby but the break Wan Chi spell and revive her soul we will need access to Outworld soul chamber you have a different plan Nightwolf a better one one hint of betrayal sorcerer and we will finish you where do we start earth rum to acquire the gene say [Music] [Music] Shang Tsung Fujian Nightwolf all were seen in the Coliseum how is that possible it should not be those cast into the void do not return if Shang Tsung were told I am aware Garrus take Frost and find him we must discern from when and whence they came and that would it be sufficient you two may leave I'll stay behind to secure the grotto your aid is not required traps are excellent new the Shaolin was so diabolical from you that's high praise indeed Nightwolf shang tsung come chronica is keen to question you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Bonita isn't the future frost we've seen it join us on the right side of history the only side is cronic us my place in her new era is assured nothing is assured Frost is he finished I am eternal Fujin my will and my strength Infinite's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] of all the night wolves I have fought you are the fiercest it must be why the Great Spirit chose me to wear the mantle you are also anomalous no one has ever escaped the void [Applause] but is that necessary to buy his time we must be rid of him before he recovers hood you summon the wind [Music] where did you send him chaos around Narvik will keep him entertained let's get to the nether realm we're running out of time to find sundown no sign of sindell not entirely unexpected given that she did not aid in the keeps defense what was her role then you she is such a formidable weapon is it possible that great spirit what is it my revenant [Music] the great spirit cannot save you [Music] [Applause] [Music] take them to the bone temple Nightwolf Shang Tsung Nightwolf Shang Tsung where are we shinnok's bombed temple [Music] Raiden's violence against our Lord will not go unavenged Fuji prepare to pay for your brother sins send em if you look well death becomes always the charmer Shane soon I will

future only to insult me I am no sword for hire this request is far below your present station your highness but defeating chronica depends on us reaching that chamber why because we must restore Sandin my Empress [Music] [Music] you've captured her revenant together Fujin and i can restore her to life why to make a slave of her as Quan Chi did so that she can aid us against Kronecker but you have my vow she will return free of all influence as I recall your blood bound to Empress Sindel I was her protector for life how it must have pained you when she died that was not your fault you could not save her then now you can then I know we must present this to katana Khan respectfully your highness if we approach katana shall cut Shang Tsung's head off katana never appreciated my

must honor her forgive me k'tano Khan [Music] [Music] [Music] what have you done welcome back your highness it pleases me to see you too am i alive is this real it is lady Sindel a miracle we could

second chance your duty is fulfilled I am in your debt now Thank You Empress where is my daughter [Music] Oh katana [Music] it is me katana your mother I I want to feel joy but all I feel is I was only a child when you mean you how could you kill me yourself why did you abandon me I did neither katana after being forced to Wed Shao Kahn I ran afoul of Quan Chi he accused me of distracting Shao Khan then the miscreant murdered me and staged my death as a suicide as I had always suspected but all this time everything I've been told about you it's all lies how can I trust trust that I loved your father Jarrid trust that I love you [Music] now mother this reunion is a blessing but we have little time to celebrate we must leave for Shang Tsung's Island to finish our quest I would go with you fight by your side but out world needs its Khan I know rest assured katana I will come home [Music] Sindel has been restored Shane soon would only undertake such an arduous task if her maid promised a decisive advantage she is but one mortal and one of the few who can harm you I fear no harm they are it's Shang Tsung's island your crown Shang Tsung knows then our time for preparation is over go to the island now we cannot win their hearts so do not try do not permit your better nature to compromise you I understand mother [Music] [Applause] [Music] they couldn't go on I am touched by their difference I question their judgment have neither of you any compassion not for fools who follow you are we not following him now at least we do not follow that fool Rayden then we would surely die [Music] you may run like the wind cabal but I command it you should have devised a better plan there's more to come [Applause] you will be returned to the void not even she can help to slow by expected better Fujin forts [Music] [Applause] leave while you can now do I meet your expectations set rayon must be on her way Sindel and I will occupy her you to get the crown I must ask Sora how long before you betray us I find your lack of faith amusing when it happens we will be ready [Music] do me a favor Fujin and take one giant step back you too sorcerer makes sense we'd meet again down here will you catch me up beat me within an inch of my life the hell if I gonna return the favor how is so generous [Music] a new trick beyond the music but insufficient you lost me at your tempo fortune now colleague eyes made me even stronger you did not win that fight you ran away formed you should have let this fight to [Music] Hey the protocol promises cannot be trusted Jackson beyond Kano Shao Kahn look at the scoundrels she employs that's a card you can't play Fujin not when you're buddied up with Shane suit I Kronecker will not heal your wounds Jackson damnit Fujin you know what I've suffered Protocol's my one chance to prevent all that not just for me but for Jackie for Vera [ __ ] your God ain't no way you get how this feels you know the only time Raiden and I ever fought when I left the sky temple to live among humans do not become attached to them Fujian sentiment will impede the execution of your duty but warriors like you and I we are strengthened by sentiment we do not fight to kill enemies we fight to protect our loved ones that is why it cuts so deeply when we fail well I'll be maybe you do get it prana Chi knows your pain she manipulates you with it Jacquelyn is on her way here Kronecker expects you to fight her worse even break her heart is that someone who cares one whit about you or your family [Music] you were to defeat me I am not finished yet [Music] applied chronic as with tonka Scylla or CCR no Alma ki Oh can you fight I'll do what I can chronica offered the future but instead you will have none blame only yourselves for this fate for [Music] for tonight [Music] it is your fate that should concern you set Rihanna [Music] [Applause] well shang tsung your strategy proved sound after all of course it did you to Sindel that hair so much as twitches ease up baby girl dad how did you get here we're all on the same side against chronica yes and now we must bring this to Raiden is that a crown throne ACCA's crown without it she lacks the power to restart history about time we had some good news now that we have this we're in uncharted territory we've changed this timeline for good correct no one can predict what happens next not even me I must return to Outworld to aid katana Khan thank you for aiding us we will rendezvous at the sea of blood in six hours until our next battle [Music] sorcerer I'll go with the Briggs family to brief the Special Forces may the Great Spirit protect you may she protect you Fujian when Raiden lays eyes on you with Shack soon [Music] I thought the crown there can be no numeira this failure rests on my shoulders no I underestimated Shang Tsung's ingenuity to escape the void only to return from the future I will face him again mother this time I will succeed I must go with shanks only possession of the crown leaves become far too dangerous and I doubt his new allies realize quite how dangerous he is your Shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if Karan does not help us is there any word from Grandmaster Hisashi no if we do not hear soon I will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get Raiden the fire gardens they built the charade are you are indeed restored why are you here scorpion where is Grandmaster Hisashi is dead and now you have come to finish us I understand you mistrust but I am here to assist you I find that impossible to believe what is he doing here we are not together if you are here to help prove it join me against the sorcerer I shall [Music] fortune Rayden thought you lost when the time line was broken but you stand with Shang Tsung we have urgent news for Aidan please let us pass this may be the Sorcerer's trick the fire gardens will not be defiled by his presence why you have joined Shang soon is beyond me Fujin what has he done to corrupt your mind [Applause] [Music] perhaps listen before you judge Thank You footing the storm is not yet past shame soon we must speak with you brother we Fujin since when are you friends with this filth I'm here to save you Raiden we hail from your tragic future in it Liu Kang defeated chronica but their battle destroyed her crown without this broken timeline couldn't be repaired only hope was to return here steal the crown and make use of its power now we can change the outcome of the fight against Kronecker we can defeat her and fix time I had never thought you gullible brother Shan some schemes serve only to benefit him how could you fall for such lies be rational Raiden spread your falsehoods elsewhere sorcerer you will not deceive us Lord Raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out no shakes the truth rate stop this step aside Liu Kang put down the amulet its darkness is taking hold of you you also betray me this is not the way sang song is not the enemy this time the realms hang in the balance and you form this unholy alliance enough of this madness if you both must die so be it my brother is my problem I will signal if I need help she knocks amulet inflames your anger and cloud your judgments have faith in me for it [Applause] I will not [Music] now listen brother we're running out of time I am a fool I have allowed myself to become a slave to anger I will not allow my temper to fracture our resolve further surely you jest lord fujian not at all okay Raiden's power makes you a fire guard of course it does unfortunately I cannot transfer my power to Liu Kang yet first I must free his revenant from Quan Chi's curse we will face their evidence soon enough what else can you tell us about the final battle we must use every advantage [Music] Lord Fujian Shang so I trust you are enjoying your travels you have already been defeated once Kronecker of course Fujin how else could you have escaped the void if you know this accept the inevitable surrender but clearly my loss was not your victory Raiden if your future Savior had gained full control of my hourglass we would not be here this timeline would no longer exist I see no harm in confirming your suspicions even if you defeat me what then who claims the hourglass surely you realize that Shang soon will break your alliance we are prepared Kronecker are you have you wondered why Shang so he knows so much about my crown because he did your bidding gathering souls to fuel it Shang Tsung is far too modest the crowd is his design no one saved me knows more about its power I told you we would still be marooned at the beginning of time bickering among ourselves you must decide Raiden who do you wish to keep time for all of creation me or shanks neither Kronecker you will be beaten and if Shang soon betrays us we will finish him you are a fool ring do not condemn the realms to oblivion [Music] [Applause] the truck it is a mistake challenging at title now I meant your existence [Music] [Applause] you are vulnerable Kronecker [Music] [Music] brother are you alright yes what the crown truly my finest work I will instruct you in its ways what just happened Kanaka came here to retrieve the crown we forced to retreat we must strike while she is weakened let us join the armies massing at the sea of blood together we will storm cronikeys Isle and take command of the hourglass the Isle of chronica no fools believe victory is
