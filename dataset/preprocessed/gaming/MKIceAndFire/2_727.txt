chauffeur ups and drives away from the scene of an accident me oh you don't know me but you will name's dino deal with downtown city center me yeah i know heard about you bad stuff need anything you call me remember nino knows everybody heard your home already you sure got that ear to the ground siempre anyway you need something you know where to find me you hear me he'll run you out of biz would you be so kind as to give me your lawyer's contact information [ __ ] you cirque brain thank you processing data now please wait uh hey dale hello sir or madam how can i be of service what's got into you dell don't recognize me you sent me a message saying i should come in about the accident you are currently speaking to a delivery network subroutine alas my operational capabilities are limited could you please clearly recite your incident report listen i want to talk to delemy your identity has been confirmed based on a facial recognition scan mr hans jonas what phrase would best describe your experience of incident number seven seven one one one one zero one zero nine six and prem accident i [ __ ] green apples now get me the real delamane v my apologies if the receptionist was a bother i'm preoccupied with the crisis that is ongoing and i simply cannot oversee everything i've taken the liberty of transferring a settlement to your account to compensate for the damage done special treatment would you mind if we spoke elsewhere sure let's talk then please follow the drone i'm fully aware customer service is less than satisfactory at the moment perhaps a guided tour will prove some form of compensation this corridor links the shop to the office and here is where the magic happens the shop is fully automated i'm pondering broadening my portfolio to include repair services alas the shop is currently overwhelmed i think i know why i'm still looking into the cause of the delivery network vehicle thinkers my working hypothesis is an advanced virus i must resolve the situation quickly this sudden rise in incidents is proving costly aside from drawing unwanted attention to the company the control room i feel honored to have you here rather surprisingly control rooms are organics what good is it to you there was a time this facility was human operated i simply inherited their infrastructure all these lights what are they for that's what i wish to discuss with you a green light denotes a vehicle with which i am in contact as you can see that is no longer the case for some vehicles those are the red lights repair drones can't take care of this this time i fear human intervention is required i'm aware you offer a broad range of services and are unusually discreet thus i'd like you to assist me in recovering my missing vehicles why is discretion a concern unnoticed unbothered right in my case broadly tolerated yet a marked increase in inspections suggests the authorities have begun monitoring me talking ncpd or netwatch the latter my legal status does not fit neatly within current regulations if i'm not careful i could easily be categorized as an illegal immigrant okay sure i'll go after you missing wheels i'm pleased to hear it i shall send you the coordinates of their last known locations you must simply deactivate each i'll then re-establish the link and return them to my garage see what i can do dela main vehicles are exceptionally secure be sure to have a scanner with decryption capability on your person so foreign get away sit you do not look so bad then in the car i doubt it you would survive why'd you help me anyway i needed you to leave that hasn't changed this is about the biochip that why i'm here i hear it's damaged beyond the repair any attempt to extract it to be disastrous fatal for you vic likes to talk i guess not many could do what he did you should be thankful what you actually want from me to begin you must tell me where to find evelyn parker evelyn what's she to you she and jorino varasaka had intimate relations she knows how to get to him i've been thinking i would have a word with her myself she promised to help me get rid of the chip i would not count on that she's likely gone very far away just answered your own question about where evelyn is long gone why do you believe she could help you remove the chip does a corporation help her you ask a lot of questions you have many interesting things to say might be your turn now to say something interesting i intend to punish your inner boy severely for the crime he has committed sorry couldn't be of any help don't have any time to lose must answer for this crime of patricide looking for justice in night city i seek revenge much more feasible here i have allies prepared to bring ryorino to his knees the only thing i need is proof and you think they'll trust the word of a merc i have nothing better now also i know no one here and i am a fugitive i am hunted what if i say no then i will tell you what rewards await if you help me so what we stroll into arasaka hq and announce that yoronobu is a kin-killer that he murdered sabro we'll get the hearing before reasonable people in a neutral location certain procedures will be used to establish the truth a lie detector forget it in that case another option you are dying you do not know how to save yourself a chip the relic is a culprit technology made by arasaka technology they alone know this cooperation can save you as easily as it can make you disappear it is merely about getting the right people on your side politics exactly what kind of people are we talking about people who hold arasaka deer it's hot people interested in the corporation's stable growth you mean people like anders hellman you know this name how prepped for the heist thoroughly relic is hellman's design his creation and true here's a poem i was thinking of one much more powerful besides anders helmand escaped arasaka betrayed hey i was listening to that shut up nobody except you wants to watch that [ __ ] about that corporal [ __ ] what did you say you heard me let it go takamura hmm at least one of you's got some [ __ ] sense tom's all right not afraid to speak his mind that's all he reminds me of my father he also worked in a kitchen all his life last thing we want to do is to draw attention i'm sorry how stupid the reflex thanks for the offer need to think about it get back to you i need time to plan organize you stand to gain much if you help me all i ask is that you do not leave the city leave why would i leave need help best chance i'll find the right person here someone other than arasaka specialist there's no one no alternative actually we just talked about some a bit of luck i'll track down evelyn if she could not help you before she will not manage to thou honor among thieves ever heard of it yes i thought it ironic thieves have that there's just honor i believe your noble arasaka would agree i'm sure that parka woman will not help you why you i would think about the plan b anders hellman he invented the relic if i want to get rid of it he's my man and if that means picking another fight with arasaka so be it hellman defected from the company i myself spent many days looking for him he what's the expression dropped off the face of the earth somebody's been busy the last few days i will not sit and do nothing when there is information to be found things to prepare your job basically it was my job why are you looking for helmet he was the one to alert sabrosan to urinable's skins he knew both of them well and could be an important witness corporal rats will squeal when hanging by their tails for several days i collected the information always point to one place the club called the afterlife i was quickly dismissed by the queen of fixers there rogue mean to say you worked for saburo yet got no idea how to talk to the high and mighty she wished to have nothing to do with the man accused of murdering sabro arasaka rogue's well informed gets wind of most things that happen in the city might be worth asking her about hellman i wish you luck dolma is choosy expensive and rude i cannot stay here any longer do what you want look for parker hellman forever i must see some friends calling some favors when my people in arasaka are ready to listen i'll call you till then i guess you buy some miracle you'll find hellman please notify me he and i have unfinished the business zapper doubles and filth in some ways night city never changes our soccer's still a despotic machine in the world's on a collision course with chaos but hey at least rogue's still alive you know you got some nerve first you had to kill me now you want to be my pal make like nothing happen you know you don't got to speak out loud to talk to me what do you want and i've processed some [ __ ] changed my mind don't watch it dead anymore go [ __ ] yourself dick wipe hey wasn't easy for me either you woke up in a landfill i woke up in your head wrestling with your thoughts memories think we're evil and i've taken a step back looked at things think we might be able to help each other we could start with rogue her and i go back to the stone age why should i trust you remind me again trust me don't trust me i don't give a [ __ ] it's the least of our worries anyway you're the ghost of christmas past [ __ ] any friends you had are either dead or so old their memory's gone johnny silverhand died a legend nobody forgets that so you [ __ ] no rogue what do i say to her gotta talking brain tumor claims it's her old friend johnny trust me
