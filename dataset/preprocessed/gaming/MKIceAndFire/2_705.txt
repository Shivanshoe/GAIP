say by the way what do you know about biochips arasaka's relic in particular well it's designed to store a person's neural engram oh sorry just imagine copying over a person's memories and personality right i get that more curious what happens if the stored engram overwrites the engrams of the chip carrier over right i i'm not even sure that's possible why do you ask nah never mind not a big deal thanks cops seem to like you careful this one doesn't start sending you out for donuts what no river's all right for a cup you mean not every cop is a bastard just like not every rocker boy is a narcissistic [ __ ] don't know v you ever actually met a rocker boy who didn't fit that description all in all no okay let me hear it so got booted off the force suspended mayor's death stank to high heaven inquest into kicked under the rug so i made a fuss not worth asking how you feel about that nope it's just uh it's not easy for me to talk about what's biting in my ass fair enough could tell me where we're headed though to justice randy's mom she thinks he just ran away from home for now keep the kidnapping between us [Music] where's randy's dad been a few years since he got popped

thought he's keeping his victims in his basement besides we are trying i want to see if we can find some connection to harris and randy's pretty weak lead best we can hope for just now not worried yowan's gonna tell the line right you add to her superiors used to be friends doubt she'd do that plus not that i'd use it but i do know one skeleton she'd prefer remain tucked in her closet [Music] i think y'all want to actually help us all things considered yeah these tips of ours always end up the same way i'll tell you about it over a beer sometime really ought to focus on finding randy now of course [Music] all right this is it sure been a while he used to come over every weekend and change it all since places like this never change lovely neighborhood river you either got business with me

behave josh listen we need to look through randy's things why to find any lead we can trust me joss just don't destroy anything randy doesn't like you when anyone pucks through his stuff let's go v the kids are playing outside tell them it's time to eat what's on your mind i think it's good she learned the truth that's the trailer eyes peeled for details eh uncle river monique dorian hey guys is

well he used to send him an album every year for his b day locked know where the key might be nope expensive tech randy had the scratch for this you're joking no chance randy could afford hardware like this way too pricey and we gotta get in but i doubt anyone knows the password can you crack it got some kind of key here real fossil not quite what we're looking for no some kind of game here shipping code on it let me give it a shot eureka help me scour this will you they caught harrison if you collect that blockaded street [ __ ] river i remember that day he lives close to an old school true angel of empathy this guy huh figured out randy's identity sent him the game as a present the one you found in his drawer the same shipping code suggests the prick scented from the badlands this guy baited randy like a pro river do you are you seeing what i'm seeing no there's no way why would he do that not only did they agree to meet but it looks like randy was as excited as any kid on his way to a theme park [ __ ] this creep definitely scrambled randy's head natalie must have been the only person randy trusted can we view this page with a link something deeply [ __ ] about that cartoon my skin's crawling some kind of link the one randy wrote about let's find out a hidden page set up by anthony harris christ i'm gonna be sick jesus river this is [ __ ] guy preyed on troubled kids made habit to target boys like randy this is my fault if i just paid more attention just talked with them more hey come on you're not the one to blame here there was a file here deleted looks like but the name's still there [Music] it wasn't a video file on randy's comp called something like that hey look the name of this cartoon matches the missing file on harris's page that's what we needed to find for yawin v we've got it randy must have downloaded it sure but v don't you get it this could be the key to harris's mind here's hoping hey uh can you use any of that netrunner magic to shake anything else out of this not that kind of magician oh okay we'll have to manage without it that cartoon river could be what we've been looking for you said yourself we needed something to get harris to dream send it to yarwin right sending it now okay so she'll get back to me by morning and that i am a son of a [ __ ] and uh come on let's grab a bite listen let's not worry joss more than

some errand to run just father and son he came back that night deadass drunk raging at me for calling the cops on him did you river found him in some dive and brought dorian home must have been a relief then when he left for weeks i cried every night my husband was killed the father of my children um i'm sorry randy changed he locked up not to mention the other two i still had to raise life was rough with him and without him sometimes there's no solution how do you die theo de caldos told me he died an honorable death whatever the hell that means they showed me his body where his face

study back at the academy give me a sec to check which school that was laguna bend looks like the whole town got flooded in the 50s well at least we know the general area where harris lived guess that'd be that trophy old one dated from 2042 first place in an interscholastic wrestling tournament tonight where you going now come here coming [Music] tony come here yeah dad you forget something [Music] i asked you a question i i don't know colleen i'm at this levels see anything odd um too low you were supposed to check before school what are you gonna say for yourself i was gonna die because of you gonna kill it like you killed your mama i i'm sorry don't apologize just dial up her hormones and shut off that goddamn cartoon how many times i gotta tell you not to leave it like that half the day i spent trying to turn that [ __ ] off [Music] so [Music] guess that'd be that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh looks like a cattle bioscanner for checking vitals [Music] i asked you a question i don't know supplements in the feed for disease-free livestock [Music] cattle injectors for hormones antibiotics people ate meat loaded with the [ __ ] see that cow's sick like the rest uh and where are you up to mike come here you rascal you'll hurt yourself tony will take good care of you easy now think this might be the place got some cables a recent memory gotta be his hideout got a clock an hour to midnight you must have been in auto shop or something here at some point looks like peter pan turned this farm into a goddamn final bastion [ __ ] me he treats the kidnapped boys like cattle machine controls an injection system for stimulants hormones something look another one the terminal controls depends got to be another deck somewhere for the mines and turrets fire department search stamp right here city south perfect i don't see randy anywhere signage on the farm model points to petrochem hearing what i'm hearing trash barge that's the signal to dump has to be a landfill nearby hey the illuminated towers promoting the us cracks album that came out then colors changed every hour i think that might be it okay so where do we sit now exactly we know harris still lives near an old school that's now underwater you can see the nc skyline and the us cracks towers from the farm it's a few miles out farms located near a landfill we know that too shipping code on the game randy got from harris traces out to the badlands those towers promoting the us cracks album colors change regularly once an hour so we know the time 11 at night right and that puts the farm east of the city southeast actually stamp on the ncfd certificate was from the southern region farm models of petrochem design so that eliminates any others which narrows it down to edgewood farm that's got to be our place so we've got it just hope we didn't [ __ ] it up come on we gotta go damn it let this work don't get distracted gotta focus on the road easy for you to say it's my nephew out there we'll find him river if i'd only known sooner how he felt what was eating at him this isn't your fault i'm miss uncle fee and i wasn't there for him [ __ ] hold on randy please hold on [Music] grab something river this is the farm we got it i know let's get to the barn quick by the barn two more turrets that front gate's a death trap damn it locked up tight need to find another way river come here oh quick he's here ready he's hanging in there we made it v shut down the machine can't unlink randy otherwise randy 10 52. i repeat i've got a 10 52 at a farm south of the city yes and the [ __ ] squad yeah we're laying coordinates now no several at least do it quick damn it oh and watch for automated defenses on the side they're substantial hurry gotta shut it off okay all disconnected check the others could still be alive right live whoa oh easy there easy now hey you're all right now been dead a few days already i'll be with randy it's okay don't be scared we're here to help your bit dehydrated but you're gonna be fine i'll be with randy we did it river yep we sure did but i'm not about to leave it like this the horror that bastard inflicted can't let it go what do you want to do zero him exactly squeeze the life out of him with my bare hands sick [ __ ] has to die no river want that fucker's blood on my hands too appreciate your dedication v but this is between me and harris gonna take him out in my own way amidst all this confusion sure you don't want help they'll catch you no they won't i'm that is i was a detective remember i know how to cover my tracks just remember say the word i'm there you can count on me i need a little time to myself now but i'll remember hey we're ready for evac are you riding along or not really fee thanks couldn't have done it without you don't mention it and holler if you change your mind or if you're just in the mood to holler ah [ __ ] [Music] hmm jefferson you said you needed something i did listen i need your help again matters private okay shoot no not on the hollow come by i'll lay it out explain it all to you got your back jefferson not to worry great we'll see you here then remember where course be there in no time thanks so it's good to see you again something happened come on jeff will explain everything he's just about done prepping for the debate i've rescheduled all his meetings out of the office today the office meeting here so nobody will bother us no i'm not sucking anyone's dick just so they can [ __ ] me in the ass look i gotta go make the amendments we'll pow out later v glad you could make it jefferson grab a seat please i'll explain why i asked you to come over the parade will soon start i will wait where we met before by the stalls delay too long we've had a break-in not the usual kind though so unusual how a couple of days back dead of night something wakes me a noise i grab my pistol and come out of the bedroom see a stranger he looks like he's about to reach for it so i pulled the trigger nail him no idea my head started spinning and i passed out no trace of him the morning after i'd like you to find him find out what he wanted why me of all people wouldn't you rather have a detective look into it prefer to use tried and tested contacts generally wise i guess mayor ryan's death you couldn't quite figure that one out but i like how you work i know i can trust you to be thorough notify the badges yet we don't want any buzz around this no attention whatever you know ncpd is full of people who like the occasional stray eddy if we reported a break in the media descend on us like a swarm of locusts no badges gotcha of course we notified ssi about the incident our private security what did the intruder look like i can't remember much it was dark he was wearing some sort of mask or was it an implant couldn't really get a good look at him elizabeth didn't see him either i slept for the whole thing election season takes its toll on you [Music] intruder take anything uh break anything nothing missing i haven't noticed any damage either jeff must have scared him off before he could do anything said you passed out that's right just after i fired what then nothing i woke up in bed the next morning killer headache to boot any idea how you made it back to your bed nope none elizabeth's at a loss too security look into this say anything this is where things get a little weird they claim there's no sign of a break-in or of a shot being fired security cams didn't record anything guard outside didn't see her hear anything they suggested jeff must have had a bad dream convenient answer liz gave security the day off so i could call you in this um security outfit ssi who are they been on the market the last 15 years they have clients across the city if memory serves they came recommended an acquaintance you think ssi might be behind this well that or someone hiding behind ssi anyone come to mind readily walden holt he's my main rival fighting for the same seat at the table holt's poll numbers have been dropping but it could be anyone really jeff has many enemies a lot of them powerful we could sit here naming names all day i see that's why i called you v i need you to find out what the hell's going on anything else you want to tell me or think you maybe should nope that about covered it liz it seems like everything it's unlikely we'll learn anything anyway honey please i'm sure veal turns something up so you've got all you need for now wouldn't mind taking a look around the apartment of course let's give you the tour got to run to a meeting as soon as you learn anything let me know come on let me show you around you
