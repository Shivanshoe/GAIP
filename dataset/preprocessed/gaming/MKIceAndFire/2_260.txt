[Music] you know for someone who's been here before you ain't saying a whole lot guys this is lamentis home of the priests of panama more religious nut jobs great they aren't nuts they're pacifist exiles pacifists that's even worse you saw them on nowhere that's the last place i'd expect to see a priest especially pacifists yeah i bet they looked uncomfortable exiles from where holla they escaped creep persecution revolutions ago now they offer sanctuary and protection to those in need and you were here before i spent some time here to heal after never mind it's not relevant right now if drax thinks this is the matriarch's planet something's off the village is this way tell me we ain't crossing above an ocean only part of an ocean don't fall you won't get wet yeah well how do you know drax didn't fall well even if he did he knows how to swim quit whirring rocket anything happens gamora will jump in after you i will he will yes because we're a team and gamora is the most sprightly oh i think i'd rather drown we should sink on our plan for when we find drax shoot first plan later we're not shooting drax but you were willing to shoot rocket yeah what does scott quill drax is the one in need right now and i'm gonna do whatever it takes to help him we all are found drax where is she where's the truck a little help here [Music] hi guys [Music] mantis how did you what oh that lysa once taught me the artist striking one spot and many times there's an arm fad who teaches me later don't worry green mimi's fine what are we doing here mantis i told him to come on nowhere i saw a time inside his mind the lies that bind i mean what's a girl to do [Music] whisper of course correct obviously it's okay stay with me in the dark [Music] another one of your girlfriends quill oh no not in this time come on the creepy caves this way the what now the creepy cave where the darkest of our future paths will meet [Music] dark isn't unknown not as in bad i mean it might be bad but no way can it be worse than the futures i did see because those were definitely bad very bad you don't want to know how bad can someone please translate her the point is or what or which parts of the point have i made already uh the creepy cave yes that's right big strong heart carries so much sorrow inside in all futures he's the one who turns and in some we save them here [Music] and here we are where the kotati take root so just to be clear there's a timeline where me and you peter focus right um what's a katardi you plant people like groot but uh lame the kochati are highly evolved highly sacred race of pacifist beings who grace us with their meditative powers they also guard the secrets of the ancient cave can they temporarily unguard it oh no they take this duty quite seriously our only hope of entering is to appeal to their infinite wisdom and we're in [Music] uh what are we looking for in here she doesn't know something that's gonna help drax all just taking the word of the space case she's not a space oh spooky spooky is right more like deadly are we sure about this nope maybe drax just needs to sleep it up i mean he seems fine my telepathic control won't last little fuzzy only green mini's friends ever help them see through the matriarch's lies and it only happens allison sets that one in time [Music] everyone just remember we're here for tracks bro it would be easier if we had some idea this place is really unstable lousy caves gonna kill us all oh no not all of us not this time more water what's wrong with this lousy planet it doesn't seem that bad come on rocket a little water's not gonna hurt you death by drowning is actually quite common throughout little fuzzy's alternate futures i have heard so many of his panicked final gasps okay let's not tell a little fuzzy that's too late i heard i'm sure it'll get drier from here on out oh you were so wrong stir fry stir fry that's a good one you've been smiling a lot more of a morrissey i told you being in a group would help my dad giddy up crap that was kind of close that one sometimes gets gamora i doubt it you're sure we're headed the right way mantis i think so okay well it's too wide to jump here we'll need to look around find another way i spotted a little mousy hole here we could try using that huge crystal somehow maybe mantis any chance tracks can green meanie cannot be burdened it takes all my mental fortitude to keep him enmeshed in lies let's take a look through here maybe there's another way to cross all right gamora let's get up here why don't i just blast some of these rocks no i don't trust them not to kill us what's your reason i have seen so many futures where a little fuzzy dies in this cave rocket you feeling lucky i got this rocket just stay to the side and try not to die [Music] the priesthood [Music] the times drax has done something for us name one time remember when he saved our butts in that mining ship scoff he saved your butt he drags a lot of heavy things around and thrown rocks seems to love throwing rocks throwing rocks is a proud cataphian custom tracks better appreciate how dangerous this dumb planet oh green mini loves you all so uh this is a much of trouble to go to for a freaking colleague tell us how you really feel i just did i mean if push comes to shove we can get another big guy admit it drax means a little more you than that drax has definitely been there for us before like on secondary first time we got jumped by that tiger with the squid face oh stumpy and the second time we got jumped by stumpy uh mantis would be worried about this fog [Music] [Music] sure use drags about now he'll be sorry he missed this one [Music] of course it ain't really stumpy that'd be impossible [Music] maybe make him hurt [Music] okay i take it back having normal tracks around would have been useful just then what are the odds of those things living on this planet maybe they weren't native to secnar and this is where hellbender first got them or maybe hellbender's here tracking us across the ends of the galaxy because she wants us dead lady h has probably moved on by now she literally just sent people to kill us we bludgeoned her favorite monster quilt in no timeline does she ever forget okay okay so negative water fog and monsters what's the fork and deal with this place there has always been a great power here the priests tell tales of those who were here before them and what wonderful things they could do i don't remember hearing anything about that you weren't ready to listen last time you were here oh no sir there's no such thing as the kochati route why were you here again gamora oh i know the answer it's the same across all timelines i told you i was here to recuperate i was in a bad place we had to keep an eye on her [Music] no one in the right mind would be in this cut flacking cave of flark and wonders what's going on so group feels the intrusive eyes watching us don't worry my flora i feel them too what the there's two of them mantis do these things have anything to do with what we're looking for inconclusive but i'm thinking no what do you think [Music] no i don't think you can communicate with these ones [Music] then trip him and watch him go down oh no idea part something bad happens here something we have to avoid mantis over here all right i like drax as much as the next guy but i am officially sick of this stupid cake oh bug lady she couldn't guide her way out of a bathroom are you the rock stage we're looking for not sure if i wanted to answer or not whatever gets us out of here [Music] looks like there's something on the other side two bad tracks out of it i'm sure you'd love to punch a giant face rocket think you can crawl in there for what so i can get eaten by whatever lives inside the stone faces whatever we're looking for is beyond or beneath or behind one of the faces what do you say rocket i bet you can find us a way back there fine whatever smells like rotten spike eggs in here okay setting the charge stand back i don't think this is the one where he kills me is everyone all right that explosion was bigger than i thought all yours quill watch out for the poison what do you mean poison take a look for yourself i'll be out here try not to die [Music] what else did the katardi tell you about this place mantis did they happen to mention the part where it's super dangerous and stupid to enter oh yes it's very dangerous ancient even an ancient danger at least the crystals are kind of pretty yeah i've seen better formations these look like regular silicates oh there's nothing regular about the way they resonate little fuzzies then they might actually be worth the view units i see something but it's foggy hey group buddy think you could lift this there ain't nothing he needs to know about me keep your barcode shut i spy with my little eye screaming is lost in a notion of lies we need to bring him ashore but we also need to remain grounded in the positive we're his lifeline positivity isn't exactly our strong suit see that green meanie that's where we need to be [Music] there's that feeling again the fur on the back of my neck is sticking up i feel it too like a pair of eyes watching you i see something but it's foggy you find anything peter nothing in there that could save drax is there another face somewhere mantis mantis huh oh yeah this cave is multifaceted get it i spy with my little eye can you give me another ride group that's great right there that's where we need to be tomorrow you do it raise that thing group right about there [Music] your bar's crawling i'd almost jump into the water to make the creepy crawly feeling go away i see something but it's foggy [Music] i spied with my little eye [Music] you uh see something out there mantis so many things too many things shadows of a civilization that lived here once before forlorn faces that can see like me horrors yet to come and other shadows too hours not hours a figure that's watching us now or was watching us then i see rocks and uh crystal things a statue that looks like a face more rocks i like yours better i see something else i see friends willing to die for another friend yeah well i'm hoping it doesn't come to that me too star guy me too [Music] [Music] we'll [Music] you know running is sometimes good too for you yes star guy but only until it isn't you'll see that soon enough no wait you should know that already don't you remember your dreams how do you know about that yeah no i just do found another way just me or them crystals looks super dangerous don't worry your fuzzy little head you only die from a great fall in two timelines this probably isn't one of them [Music] [Music] we need to get on those crystals brute just let will get out there first i don't want you falling oh definitely remembering something now i think we need to be careful here i think what you're seeing is some version of me pushing you off a cliff a little fuzzy your volatility is surprisingly consistent through all versions of time and space you're like my angry little through life mantis back in nowhere did you know what the church was gonna do i don't know i see so many different things at the same time it's sometimes hard to know where i am do they try to take over the galaxy in all realities not all but most sometimes it's so noisy like a bajillion ships taking off at the same time you even have a chance of stopping them oh yes but only if you cure draxi waxy here the five of you are the only ones who ever do anything [Music] finally the face of a thousand lies i think it's gonna help us save racks it tries to keep us from saving him we seek something behind the face beyond the lies you want me to blow it up that shouldn't be our answer to everything [Music] watch out everybody uh thanks you don't usually make it the kotadi mentioned the faces in the dark before but i always thought it was metaphorical bug lady is absolutely bonkers of course i'm angry i'm what wandering around a cave that's falling apart looking for flork knows can what get us through here gamora working i'm going in no you mustn't you don't want me to cut the thing wait no not you something bad is about to happen [Music] time to start trusting our instincts quilt bug lady said the face is keeping us from helping drax so we gotta destroy it little fuzzy don't do whatever it is you're about to do no no no i'm done with all the riddles let's just hear mantis out on this okay give [Music] little fuzzies in a mood we're probably gonna die rocket dogs yep close one you can say that again oh i will uh mantis where is the matriarch this is the one where i failed [Music] it's okay the one where i fail is the one where you don't stay with me hey guys check it out i'm totally not dead ugh what you almost killed all of us no more blowing things up rocket ever you're gonna regret saying that are you spar toy where did i know that maybe you aren't always or i forgot what those guns do something again he saved drafts after you almost killed us all how'd a gun do that show him that's how it's done the exploding stuff is still better it's really not next time we're in a huge fight you're gonna beg me to blow stuff up beg me next time we're in a huge fight i'll make sure to remember [Music] more of that weird fog be glad you ain't this close to the ground oh little fuzzy never dies from gas in here just falling crushing towering wait hang on did you see shitari oh i did didn't i such a funny sounding word [Music] this is impossible i thought [Music] warned us is [Music] sorry to boost your bubble [Music] this is opening up fun i never get likable with our luck hellbender on the other side just waiting to jump us payback from hellbender is literally the last thing we need right now [Music] hey anyone notice that this happens to be the monster i said i suppose you want credit [Music] [Music] forget the jelly [Music] watch it fight [Music] sure we could be dealing with those churchified noble weirdos dude that would be worse oh [Music] let's try that again [Music] now [Music] i would rather not find out [Music] oh hmm [Music] [Music] fog of fear faced fully forthright are you okay mantis oh hey gamora you look less depressed wait we went over that already didn't we yeah we did that thing of yours is still bothering you though right what thing i'm fine let's just focus on helping drax he's gonna be upset he didn't get to fight all those things i don't think that any of those were real not really real anyway they're attacks felt real enough maybe they were real there's just how far down does this is cave heads up more than rock monsters maybe we just got off on the wrong foot the rock people i don't think they're looking to make a man's quilt [Music] [Music] be careful you ain't so quick don't suppose you guys know how to heal our bodies [Music] [Music] did everything in this cave want to kill us [Music] [Music] but you guys wanna see some fireworks it is [Music] look out [Music] if they didn't listen before to death well that went about as well as expected i was sure oh maybe i just haven't learned it yet i think i picked up the word for kill or the grunt anyway the fog doesn't seem to bother whatever these giant things are maybe they're just smart enough to not wander around in it unlike some people i know why we're doing it and don't think drax won't hear all about it either oh is this the one where little fuzzy does something heroic hard to say i think it's pretty easy to say he won't you most of all should be willing to give someone another chance gamora [Music] if we do cure drax we should make up a story about how we battled some epic one of a kind monster um guys i know little fuzzy and it is the only way forward what's happening he sees what lies ahead uh-uh no way no flark and way it doesn't seem that wet like medium weight i ain't walking through a in monsoon maybe there's a way to use those plants to divert the water we're a team we'll figure it out are we seriously gonna let this keep us from saving tracks sure you save them while i drown [Music] yes it's just a plant plant not a youthful we ain't got much [Music] what would you guys do without me yeah where oh where will we get another gun we must have missed one more let's climb up there get eyes on the problem the problem is that rocky needs to suck it up yeah good luck with that in little fuzzy's defense he has died drowning in far less water than this exactly wait what this doesn't seem absurd to you he's got a thing with water what do you want me to do you're supposed to be his leader have you met rocket star-lord you say something nope remember last time you blew something up [Music] please don't give him an even bigger head that he's already got [Music] mantis any of those realities where we just keep dropping here oh yeah too bad you don't have these sweet guns rocket keep it up and i'll swipe them in your sleep nice shot peter oh uh thanks [Music] i think we're making progress all right i'm on it stupid plant still stock you know sorry keep at it what do you think rocket doesn't seem that bad translation rocket don't rock it don't like wet we get it it's a scary dark cave we're all probably going to encounter things we don't like true but nothing as much as little fuzzy doesn't like getting wet never underestimate someone's deeply rooted fear stir fry especially when you do not understand the root [Music] easy green me they'll figure it out [Music] hey gru can you get me up there that's why they call me star star-lord [Music] anyone else suddenly missing drax's anecdotes about cadet oh you know he has some catastrophic fairy tale related to our current situation like the catastrophe equivalent of jack and the giant beanstalk hey if i jump you can catch me right guess we'll find out that's not very reassuring just don't screw up the job [Music] why don't we just leave him behind focus on saving drax he'll still be here on the way back and if he isn't groot would never go for that what are you guys talking about nothing buddy you're a valued member of the team [Music] let's see about crossing says no way not without me glad someone's got my back actually kind of refreshing like a quick shower what do you say rocky moses are we supposed to know who that [Music] guy oh with the tentacles right what no anyway thanks quilt really i was pretty sure he had tentacles [Music] what do you say groot now that we got the whole team together absolutely a dry rocket is a happy rock this is you happy oh yes you should see some of the dark versions of little fuzzy or maybe you shouldn't you really really shouldn't this cramped corridor ring any bells mantis pretty sure this is the wet part what now i thought we just did the wet part oh it gets worse much worse guys [Music] everyone okay i'd be seeing stars if i could see anything at all yeah this ain't good so about all them futures where we die [Music] has he always been able to do that he says he don't like showing off thanks buddy [Music] no i don't gotta tell him oh right the thing that you tell us in the dark it's really important no it ain't shut up what did i just say oh little fuzzy you'll feel better if you let it all go you're among friends rocket it's nothing okay just the lab i was in the tests on me in tubes of water and it sucked it really really sucked sensory deprivation experiments on half world i heard of those sensory deprivation was like a vacation compared to the other things that's why you hate getting wet i have no idea don't make a big deal out of it just prefer to keep dry is all so how long do we gotta wander around smashing our fins on rocks rock it's so wrong with my visor i can't see anything huh must be groot's bioluminescence it ain't on the defined light spectrum uh right are you sure that's the right way peter i'm sure that it's not but let's not tell star guy we need to learn from something i can hear you [Music] oh boy this place is so creepy remember the deal quill you find anything shiny we split it this part okay anyone else getting really fed up with little miss cryptic pretty give me a break at least it seems less dark through here and less wet works for me mantis anything in particular we should be looking out for i'm trying to remember i think this is where it gets loopy now it gets loopy [Music] oh there's that creepy fog again it's always here always until it is what's that supposed to i don't we're hell raisers wait yeah but it ain't those larkin arts it's them creepy eyeball things from the qc i'm definitely hearing hellraisers and you ain't hearing like it's eyeball can't tell it's not clear well it's clear to me these ears don't lie lady i think i can tell the difference between lady hellbender's minions and some giant bugs got to be right we already know hellbender's goons tracked us here [Music] weird it's like this place has a mind of its own not mine force anyone else getting deja vu [Music] it all looks the same with this fog well it don't sound the same it's them jelly things from secondary that explains stumpy's no it's no before i hear voices how can you not tell the difference between monsters and people it's not that we're clearly hearing different things all i hear is noise too much noise yeah the more is right i hear voices just like when i put on that helmet in the nova base you're both crazy [Music] is [Music] yeah that pretty much sums it up at least there's a way out now i guess [Music] okay now that's them bouncing eyeballs from the qc no question i'm not doing this something is clearly messing with us satari okay well that's just wrong you're worse than her those overgrown lizards make clicky sounds you got moss in your ears something isn't right there's something we're supposed to do i'm with groot satari i'll never forget those things as long as i lived [Music] the fog calls and we answer [Music] can we go back i'm not even sure we're back we go down this isn't right it can't be real it sure felt real when we were fighting them it's the fog they're just sounds and it's just a coincidence they sound like all the scut bags [Music] so it was nothing i think it depends it's got something to do with the freaky fog every time you name an enemy it has the power to make that enemy appear so the key all along was to keep quiet yeah like that was ever gonna happen i saw so many versions of us fighting so many different things but the source it's not done with us yet guardians yeah well let's just keep our eyes open and our mouths shut from now on the fog entity has retreated for now there's no immediate risk yeah no offense bug lady but nothing you say means anything anymore so the fog is an entity now yes sort of oh don't be frustrated little fuzzy we're all still alive that's super rare obviously if some fog monster is trying to kill us it means we're getting closer to whatever it is we're looking for that kind of makes sense and if this fog monster can make bad things appear maybe the opposite is true like if we all say cure drax maybe that's what we've been looking for the whole time i wish star guy but no the one time she gives a definite answer [Music] so [Music] you finally figure out what we're here for no way but i do know it won't be very easy especially not for you in one possible timeline we all get smooshed great mind helping us across oh you hear that let me guess further down only if you want to save drax and the whole galaxy [Music] i don't remember this part okay okay look guys um i appreciate what you all did for me back there with the water thing um but following the bug lady any deeper is officially stupid rocket no fog monsters cave pigs wet waterfalls technically all water no no quill she doesn't know where we are she doesn't know where we're going she doesn't know what we're looking for mantis are we hot or cold room temperature okay okay this is crazy she is probably crazy it's not about her about us i am super proud of us because we've never gone this far for anything before oh this is the one where you inspire them just think about who we were when we started um well you were a two-bit broke pirate who couldn't even run a tree exactly and you were a two-bit bounty hunter just as broke as me just depraved self-centered mindlessly chasing every unit bark contract thank the rob i still like many of those things so do i but none of those things are why we're here now right you're down here kicking ass for drax not draxler destroyer not drax a rampaging criminal tracks man my friend and gamora you've gone to the ends of the galaxy to hunt people to hurt people to get revenge in what frequently assume are some excruciatingly painful ways but doesn't this feel kind of good going this far to help someone you care about oh yeah group he says you don't have no no i do because we all need to learn something from you man you never complain but or if you do i don't catch it but i i'm pretty sure you probably definitely don't you're always there for us and that's what this is about us growing together as a team following a crazy lady into a death cave because one of us needs help because we are a team help we're a family we're the guardians of the galaxy really great speech will [Music] why didn't anyone stop me you're on such a role [Music] sorry about that we gotta do something [Music] [Music] yeah yeah yeah [Music] that face is in need of some deconstructive surgery good thing we've got dr rocket in his bag [Music] from the inside [Music] i'm ready just find me an opening [Music] okay so let's blow this thing to hello [Music] then why are we still fighting them deep enough uh keep shooting money statue [Music] will never end little fuzzy they will keep fighting until the source is completely destroyed i know [Music] listen to me there is no other way seriously rocket you need to fly [Music] [Music] [Music] i know what i gotta do and i'm just gonna really i'm gonna suck it up and do it [Music] please [Music] [Music] rock it check it out still not dead i can't believe you did that for us hey a friend needed help a bunch of them rocket man can we please just save drax already warm very very warm i think she wants us to jump in the hole i may not know what we're looking for but i know it's down there okay let's finish this because i sure as flock didn't get all wet for nothing hmm [Music] [Music] oh yes this is the place i was pretty sure we'd find it somewhere down here now you know what we're looking for something sad and sulking licking lingering wounds if it's here he's totally gonna feed us to something awful down here i know it should we expect to fight probably you guys are very good at the whole de-escalation thing you're kidding even with our prized negotiator over here in a very small fractured universe star guy ends up being as charming as he thinks he is mantis has been right so far about what finding swamp water in the stinking cave of doom yeah bug lady got that part right thanks the priest of pama settled lamentis for a reason this is a place of healing spiritual healing drax would have taken us right back to sacrosanct if mantis hadn't seen it coming exactly we can trust her that's not always true but this time yes i think i'm one of the good ones [Music] mantis are you sure you can't just tell us what to expect oh no every time i do this goes very very badly trust me i think i know what i'm doing and what are you doing navigating the sea of possibilities oh i like how that sounds i should write that down anyone have paper no we're here home of the healing light source of the cure origin of raker's power it's a cocoon told you she was gonna feed us to some giant bug or maybe she's the bug and that's some kind of external digestion sack or something you realize this is weird right oh it gets weirder oh gross please tell me drax is the only one who's got to go in that creepy egg sack so the shepherds found fresh flock foolish followers think fast beard butt [Music] you know not the gravity of your treacherous trespass [Music] you cannot quell a god prepare for oblivion interloper oh what's this one okay you're up found you what way wayward wickedness is this nasty uglies from that busted noggin of yours it's okay guys it's him aaron witchcraft no wait in warsaw ashley warsaw adam warlock that's it the golden god guy hold on this guy's raker's old divine whatever looks pretty good for a dead guy were you not sent by the sanctimonious shepherd us with raker not a chance we're trying to shut his ass down see friends okay big guy and we go come on all the ones where we die already happened [Music] you
