gonna lead the first wave pick your squads start prepping I want Owen what are you and Danny getting back who talked Nora no secrets between the Salt Lake crew is the one okay I know the my Eaton sent a search party after he shot Danny apparently to protect some scars [ __ ] excuse me that's not Owen you got it wrong you're saying Danny used his last breath to lie to me sir people here dad's story Oh instead anyone who finds him they'll got him down for support and I suggest you all stop gossiping about it let me go after him I'll walk him back him get to the Nuttall you said yourself the storms have you know we've only got one shot at this and this is bigger than any of us definitely bigger than Owen if he turns up then fine I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and we'll get to the bottom of it I need you Abby yeah yeah again good look over the plans and go through your roster grab some food talk later no way a wing killed Danny over some scarf right what no Abby don't I'll be

my rescue no came to make sure he's drowned I found something pretty awesome what I think you're gonna have to follow me to see it [Music] oh and we have to go back we will once you see that Owen what are they gonna do kick out a bunch of displaced fireflies who have nowhere else to go maybe I don't want to find out just come see this thing [Music] you know keep going [Music] [Music] this place is crazy I think it's like one of those zoos but for fish shut up check this water puff out I saw the seal the other day it's covered in spots they don't have spots they're brown those are sea lions no no you don't know I know what I saw with my eyes hey give me a hand with this yep what is this place well clearly this is some sort of theater but for fish a sure rooster what whoa that's my wolf howl you're an idiot yeah but you love this idiot so I mean what's that say about you you think this sailboat was part of the show No looks like somebody turn this into a makeshift dock or something go check it out there's some kids close but a family came through look at these drawings I wonder what happened to him maybe they joined the wolves now or it got killed by scars such an optimist hmm [Music] all right nothing this boat you wanna go see the rest of the fish do you think there's more to see of course let's go you can get through that give me up there yeah 185,000 esterday yeah right so we take a quick look around and then we're head right back oh my god you don't see that every day [Music] it's a tank in the floor you imagine this place filled with people kids laughing and running around different world right [Music] I'm claiming this place it's mine you can visit are you sure not really actually see how nice you are to me first your dick not a great start I think it's the same family from the boat I'd be my guess yeah hey Owen no spots like that well the one I saw wasn't bronze either so my dad would love this place yeah we have to come back here with the others that's good yeah get them to break the rules too you don't think it's worth it let's see how much trouble were in when we get back ha you love it so Craig you like Owen you were right thanks for dragging me into this amazing place I'll think about it Oh God [Music] [Music] his kids are enough to join the scars jeez hmm well on the bright side I found these keys Oh what's wrong with you he's a skeleton he doesn't need them I just don't understand how anybody willingly joins the scars why not because they're an insane cult that's why I mean accuse these people would refer to the fireflies of terrorists fanatics it's not the same I'm just saying we shouldn't dismiss them as great don't say [ __ ] like that of the stadium okay okay all right I'm gonna try those keys oh yeah this one nope compound got it Pam painting this must have taken forever don't tell me you want to go down there come on oh and last thing apprentice last thing just don't look down let's go I love to meet this kid
