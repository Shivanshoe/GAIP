of hands to end up where it did one of the men in the chain gabriel piez wants to come in papayas is a mid-level drug runner and a new kid on the block and gun running sounds like he bit off more than he could chew and now he wants out he claims he didn't know the bomb's target blah blah blah i don't care pius is a loose thread time to pull a sensor picks up hostiles and pipe the intel back to your hud just throw it out where you think the bad guys are hiding you'll get a lock on my positions walls vehicles doesn't matter what they're hiding behind if this goes to plan you won't have to do much

the man you brought in piez coughed up about a hundred names most of them are small to mid-time players in south america but we did dig out one unusual connection gentlemen we're heading to africa paella's gear was only part of a larger shipment another part went into zambia to a man named deity macaba macaba is an angolan warlord and war criminal he fled angola and crossed the border into zambia where he set up shop right in the middle of a refugee camp he's got a fresh shipment on route acaba is just a means to an end your priority is intel on the source of that shipment a window's tight on this so it's gonna have to be a daylight raid a local contact will get you into the camp find macaba find his shipment and find a source we don't have the processor power yet to let the adaptive combo function while you're moving fast when you're holding position or taking it slow it's the next best thing to being invisible magnetic view makes any metal in the vicinity pop out in your field of view that includes mines guns being held by hostiles in cover hidden caches you name it the terrain you're going into is almost desert long sight lines not much cover take an assault rifle with a tax scope attachment it'll give you good range for distance work and full auto if you have to rock and roll no no shorties say the word captain quietly justice ain't blind it's right behind you i'm sure this is overlord what's your status overlord hunt is in position ready to move on your goal copy that primary objective is to locate and secure makaba's latest weapon shipment secondary his suppliers are our main interest got me hunter out looks like a grunt where you see him at the well eyes on two more up ahead of us there's another one 12 o'clock fourth target on your shot there's another one what are you seeing see what we're dealing with on me camo is up now down do not engage they tear us up out here [Applause] keep your heads down prune and crawl hostile ahead

through possession they control by fear there we go that's our man once you're inside track him down and he should lead you to the shipment makava controls everything one way or another everything begins and ends with macaba he's your top priority in there roger overlord what's the eta on our ride your contact's already on site he'll have to keep a low profile just try not to draw any attention to him he's putting a lot on the line to get us in copy that hunter's moving to rally sir yeah i see him we're gonna take him out yeah we'll have to do it clean line them up hold fire until we're all on target two marked marking the let's go we must go quickly i want to make sure we're clear on rules of engagement in here once we hit the camp we're clearly engaged hostels as long as we don't raise any alarms get in close make your first shot count if you've got multiple targets mark them and drop them at the same time camo should be enough to let us slip in unnoticed we need to keep it that way if macabre spooks we're going to lose our chance we all need to be on point understood got it no sweat cap those are roger a heads up looks like you've got a storm blowing your way don't dawdle copy that we never do do it quiet if they sound the alarm mission's over understood hostile grunt up on the roof what are they doing it's a patrol i think [Music] i spotted two more over in that building

been and maybe where it's headed good call kozak overlord hunters changing targets we're gonna try to recover the data recorder off the plane itself understood hunter i copy you'll have to get moving that storm's closing in my bet is the crew's gonna try to get airborne before it hits copy that and no disrespect captain but this doesn't seem like the kind of thing we want to hurry come on pep live a little i'd like to live a lot dirty that's why i don't want to rush it i don't like it any more than you do pepper but we're not setting our own timetable understood here we go aggressive gentlemen not reckless let's go ghosts got visual on the airstrip looks like the plane's prepping for takeoff well let's go make sure she doesn't secure the airfield moving position two targets marked 12 o'clock how many one ready to fire on your word fire fire i spotted two more ahead of us for your shot mark two that's three there's one more in the building target eliminated not reloading keep

hunter be advised hostels have moved in on the crash site watch your step copy we'll take care of it enemy isn't here in force yet it's going to be a lot harder to secure the side once they are take them we've got four hospitals 12 o'clock there's one more left second target and he's number three reloading closing fast you'll have to hold a position understood rogers around the moon oh overlord where's that backup oh qrf will take over and secure the aircraft's black box let's get you back out of there yeah [Music] there she is home away from home i love the neighbors i do except for all the damn sailors no problem because we're not staying major just pinged me langley's got trouble [Music] we already got a job details are coming in on your mrt now [Music] the black box you recovered in zambia was well traveled dia managed to pull the nav data from it and came back with hits in nigeria there's been a lot of activity in the niger delta recently turns out cia already had an asset in country to monitor a pmc operating in the region watchgate says they're providing security for oil companies but it looks like that's not all they're up to these guys are muscling in on refineries running offs into local villages they're destabilizing an already shaky area we want to know why cia's agent officer dan sykes delivered an intel package on the situation and then went dark langley's tried to re-establish contact so far no luck they're assuming the worst we're going in to locate secure and extract officer sykes whatever his condition in base mode this is a low ir signature uav use it to identify enemy positions from on high or to pinpoint on lock-in targets it's your eyes in the sky you want to improve your aim this will give you a stable firing platform you're giving up mobility but you're trading it for accuracy you're going up against pros but the pmc boys have gotten sloppy pushing some civilians around it might get pretty heavy because that refinery is easy to defend i'd go with an lmg with a scope and back it up with a silenced carbine cia's asset is the priority locate secure and extract i'm glad we came in the sneaky way lock it up dirty get your ar online camo activated this is sykes last known position four hospitals inside we're gonna have to ask the new resident some questions set up for the grab i'll ask you once where's the american i can see the refinery in a shipping container they've got them locked up in the camp overlord this is hunter they've got the package in the refinery we're in route understood hunter we'll scramble support be advised you've got large numbers of civilians in your area watch your targets on you get out of here now camel's active that got their attention keep going hug it down let's finish this get out of here [Applause] we're stealing time from an nsa satellite they're gonna reposition for us stand by here we go i'll run you through it it'll take a minute to get full granularity from the feed but we're picking up some activity you should know about we know watchgate runs the bulk of their ops out of the facility here [Music] it's a sprawling complex with multiple structures our boys have been analyzing patterns of movement and cell phone traffic all the data suggests officer sykes is being held somewhere in this area sykes has been with special activities for a while if anyone could handle capture and interrogation it's him still we don't know his condition so be prepared to carry him out if you have to part of the camp is covered looks like some sort of hanger we can't get an exact fix on a container we should be able to use a drone of magnetics to track him down from outside we'll find him copy that it looks like the mercs aren't expecting any trouble tell you what man some cold-hearted bastards just be playing around while their friends are out there butchering civilians they'll get there soon enough don't take them too lightly they might look sloppy but they're well equipped and quick on the trigger be advised we did pick up a pair of radar contacts several clicks out from your location looks like a couple of gunships those choppers tell you everything you need to know about watchgate's connections these guys are serious business choppers aren't moving fast but they are pointed your direction keep your eyes up just in case what do we have for air assets nothing for close support but our carrier group sitting off the coast they've agreed to loan us a couple of aircraft we've scrambled two fast movers they'll hold south for you at angels 2 2 and wait for your call they're your panic button if more merc show but we don't want to use them if we don't have to understood that's what we've got for now good luck in there copy that around use the drone mark those targets two hostels armed with assault rifles ahead of us martin set up your shots on you at one hostel they're straight ahead kozak on you open fire activating camo light contact 12

like it has some sort of substructure rally there for extraction roger i i gotta go back i gotta get back into town sir with all you've been through i think you could take a day off no you don't understand these guys these mercs are caught up in something big i don't even think they realize how big you got hard intel on that yeah of course i've been watching them for months but somebody tipped them off i had to ditch my files before they picked me up where are they now in the trunk of a car parked at a gas station in north part of town overlord hunting vip has got some critical intel we need to recover north section of town and the vehicle at an abandoned gas station copy hunter stand by we'll do another sweep let me have your sight on i'll take you to it that's the negative sir you're going home we'll get your gig yeah i'm a ranger i can handle it i'm sure you could so today hunter we're still seeing a lot of activity on the ground what do you want to do hunter will recover

even here we're good area's clear overlord can you get a fix on the vehicle's location negative hunter we see a couple of structures but we can't see what's under them you'll have to do the legwork

reloading we're not clear that way [Music] i don't like being on the ground i know that scene in nigeria was tough but don't let it get in your head those people were in trouble long before we got there hey there's a line here guess the army's not real big on manners huh maybe you want to teach me something kid whoa whoa whoa whoa excuse us we're a little off this morning we haven't slept in 72 hours just got back from a village full of dead kids our mistake uh hey yeah you guys go ahead come on [ __ ] her don't sweat him stay calm i'll save you a seat jarhead officer sykes is on his way to ramstein air base after they check him out he'll be going home thanks to you in return he gave us some critical intel the pieces are coming together gentlemen all three supply chains lead us back to the same source a gun runner out of pakistan with an international client list we're going to peshwar a convenient hub for illicit trade to and from southeast asia the middle east and africa this isn't a small time operation whoever he is the guy is running serious hardware mil-spec technology maybe even radioactive material we have to cut them off we're cooperating with pakistani forces on this one their operation will cover ours they keep the local we get a supplier everybody wins your team will identify secure and extract the supplier get this guy and we're a major step closer to the big picture when deployed this drone turns into a low ir signature uav capable of tagging hostiles if there's too much air traffic ground it and it performs as a ugv it also packs a sonic pulse weapon in crawler mode just don't rely on it too much [Music] flashbangs are basic field gear be sure to warn your team before you deploy them they'll blind anyone in range who's looking at them and knock out hearing as well just for a few seconds that's long enough you're better off on the rooftops in peshawar than on the streets i'd recommend a sniper rifle maybe the msr with a good optic match that with an smg for close quarters and you should be set [Music] be advised you've got a lot of civilians in your vicinity keep it low profile out there understood should we pick up the fire while we're here negative we're leaving him for the pakistanis alive secure the seller only he's our priority extract the seller don't shoot the buyer copy that [Music] target house is marked keep your eyes open we don't want any surprises holding for your shot on your goal ready to fire damn i see four now straight ahead marking 30. on your shot target down copy camel active holding for your shot fire we

negative we've got some complications traffic's got the vehicle boxed in on all sides you'll have to go to him tough to keep it low profile if we're out in the street sir stakes just went up pakistani forces are closing in on the area they've already locked down two of the major routes looks like they're making a play for both parties that wasn't the deal guess they're making a new one this just got real messy gentlemen i think we can trade the buyer for the seller not an option hunter dealer's the big catch if they get him the pakistanis won't let us near him and if he gets away we may never track him down again we'll get him sir what do we do about the pakistani forces we'll bring you in from the opposite direction that'll let the pakistanis push the target your way and avoid any accidental engagements let me make that clear you are not to engage the pakistani forces they gonna show us the same courtesy sir as long as they don't see you what's the eta on the bird she's tracking in now it's pretty much worst case down there you're gonna have a lot of civilians in harm's way and multiple hostels moving through traffic watch your targets and watch what's behind them

criminal elements these people are very good at making things disappear weapons money people if she goes to ground we're gonna have a hell of a time digging her back up again dia's involved and our boys at nsa have a file but nothing's as good as a face to face we need her alive gentlemen better tell that to the neighbors it's a hornet's nest down there looks like everybody with a gun's coming

russian intelligence she's connected all over the place so it'll take some time to unravel who she's really working for but none of the options look good russia's the last place any of us wanted to be but we go where we're sent and this is where the trail leads from what we've got out of her pragova's people have been using a derelict weather station near the norwegian border as a staging area the station's in two distinct sections that's all we know anything else your team finds is gonna help us so gather intel on the facility then bring it down hard in base terms the warhound's self-propelled mobile artillery tough enough to take cover behind and packing enough firepower to take out most enemy positions careful with these in the field we're still not sure your gears was 100 emp hardened one of these grenades will temporarily fry any electronics in its pulse radius use them at the right time and the enemies blind the weather sucks but at least out there you can make all the noise you want if it were me i'd sling a light machine gun and for backup a pdrc that'll be faster on the draw invisibility is almost zero better for us than it is for them now switch to magnetic camo's active dead ahead one rifleman his history repositioning eyes on two more up ahead of us deploying sensor one transport truck there's another one right in front of us on you standing by target three target

is awfully active for a derelict station yeah and that was just the forward base this is a recon part of the job gentlemen eyes in the sky can't see everything just seems like this much activity would have caught somebody's attention before now we've got our own chair secrets how surprised you think the russians would be if they drove out to dolce fair enough i hope that's not what we're heading into now though roger that best to expect the worst and let the warhound lead we can replace him he's a handy little guy not much little about him all right boys time to get your shoes on we're

this op is a bad idea you know it i know it and we'll do it anyway we'll be deep inside russian territory with zero margin for error ops don't get any higher risk than this but the risk this gear poses if it slips through is even greater so let's make damn sure we do it the right way you've got to see the battlefields own it your nvgs give you a clear look under low light or obscure conditions just don't stare in the sun with them on the fewer russian regulars you engage at close range and the more your teammates know about your target selection the better sniper rifle with an otr sensor is

what's the real story sir that's too much left standing for nuke it was a nuke until our missile shield took the warhead out couldn't do anything about the delivery system missile defense thought that program was a joke that would be called disinformation kozak and the politicians get to worry about what it all means you're going after the launch site let me guess russians are claiming it ain't theirs what just in time wait a show the first intel we had on the launch came from moscow they're as surprised as we are looks like a rogue spear instead maybe even the same one you were hunting a few months back but for right now london's bleeding and we've got unfinished business we're on the brink here gentlemen that missile might not have been launched by the russian government but it came out of russia whether raven's rock is responsible for the launch or not we believe they're behind the internal pressure calling for veloden's replacement momentum is building and it's not looking good we're not in position to do much about russian politics we'll have to go where we can do some good instead trajectory analysis puts the launch site in dagestan just east of the georgian border the georgian spec ops unit was deployed to investigate but they dropped contact and disappeared near the target zone we've agreed to help the georgians recover their team with luck we'll find some answers

good job the russian resistance is putting up a hell of a fight and the resources you sent will go a long way unfortunately the movement is still scattered and disorganized diaz identified a leader who could bring them together general alexi duka he's a career soldier an impressive tactician and a badass and he might be the hero the loyalists need raven's rock forces must know it because they've pinned him in we don't know the exact situation on the ground but we know he needs a hand get in there and take the pressure off if he can take it from there i'd say he's the man for the job if you need visual cover for a maneuver a smoke grenade will do the trick nvgs can still see through it but eyeballs won't you're going up against russian regulars out there stick to the basics with an m110 sniper rifle and darpa auto guided rounds engage at range when you can you get in close without thinning them out first they'll chew you up clear clear all right gentlemen let's go to work if duke is

overlord convoy's out of commission copy hunter you're clear to proceed to the hq the crowd has been making progress towards the presidential palace incredibly they've been met with no resistance or force we have heard sporadic gunfire and what may have been explosions or distant artillery fire we're not sure but so far the march has proceeded right through the heart of moscow without a single incidence of violence at this point my best guess is that military support for the coup has all but dissolved the gunfire we've heard may well have been from fighting amongst two supporters we have had some reports of a few soldiers having been killed but well ahead of this procession those are still unconfirmed but it may show that those responsible for the coup are turning on one another even now uh we're not far from the palace i can actually just see the top of it from here now in just a few more minutes we should have a very good idea of how this situation is going to be resolved if at all 12 o'clock left side watch it hustle 12 o'clock 12 o'clock roger copy that the president my cover active so foreign me magnetic should give us a peek at what's going on inside they got to know it
