believe you how'd you find me did you really think it would be enough to leave the city takamura mentioned he had placed a tracker on you yet even had he not when arasaka wishes to find someone it finds them porcelain [ __ ] damn shame he didn't believe me earlier gore might have still been alive had you if you invoke his name remember he did everything for this conversation to happen that demands respect fine yorinobu planted a tanto in the corporation's very heart i must act while the wound is fresh and you will help me you are living proof of his crime and treason decided already is

you can turn to this is true so what are your terms i want to know everything you know about mikoshi mikoshi one of my father's flagship projects a dado fortress with servers situated on orbital stations all around earth think of it as an archive of personality constructs digitized psyches try a prison a matter of perspective in any case that is not where you will find salvation not without extensive knowledge of the relic and the construct creation procedure track down your run away hellman was hiding under kang tao's wing we chatted think sooner or later the engram will completely conceal me process can't be stopped a surprisingly deterministic conclusion for a man of science at the very least i got my hands on the relic schematics got detailed information about its inner workings project tech documentation all useful even more so given that hellman is still alive i will contact him and explain that one does not leave arasaka by the back door man i should make contact with alt cunningham the cunningham the very same who invented soul killer using her modified version now that should be more than useful that's about the extent of what we've got what now let us meet in person at embers in the city center it is discreet just remember one thing from now on we both must exercise extreme caution [Music] well that's my job done you know what what i think i'd rather
