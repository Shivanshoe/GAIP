oh chong king china this city is big brother's wet dream with more than 2.5 million cameras covering 15 million people privacy is a four-letter word in this place it's pretty ironic that a cloak and dagger organization like the ica keeps its most valuable secrets here you'll find hush conducting his fringe experiment in an abandoned apartment building while imogen royce the archivist runs a day-to-day business of the ica data facility i just hope you know what you're doing 47 but you must have seen the northern lights at least no no it was iceland and i missed them can you believe that i'm still kicking myself the one night i decided to stay in town i thought it wasn't gonna happen imagine pays that much and not even getting hey you up there you find it what i couldn't hear you i said did you find it yet not yet but it has to be up here somewhere we'll keep looking sir you've got the wrong place you don't qualify for the homeless shelter sorry sir got orders can't let you through sorry for the inconvenience yeah but it creeps me out how they're different when they leave yeah i'd say they're different when they enter come on you know what i mean like they're not quite there some of them in a really bad way i'd never accept participating in those experiments no matter how well they pay no one is asking you to you just need to keep track of the ones who do i'm gonna be hit get the hell out of here they don't want people they ask for that sort of thing no they only want people like us the flyer cecil that means it's too dangerous for rich people don't do it oh i'm going this is my chance i just need to find out where it is but the player has a symbol i need to find a building that's got hush written all over it using the desperate for personal gain maybe this is a way for you to get to the bastard i'm gonna get an umbrella with a [ __ ] i am bruce sit down get a house i'm never going on the rain again ah my knee is so sore why is that i fell over because a homeless woman suddenly jumped up right in front of him she was hiding in a hole with cardboard covering her i nearly stepped right through wow so i was laying there my knee hurting like hell and she started yelling something about me stealing her past what's that about i saw another one pounding a stone to the pave he just kept repeating how did i get here i don't understand is it just me or have they upped the crazy lately they must be held to live like that or at least someone is trying to help them out there's this building where i've seen them go i think they helped them out what's going on it's three in the morning and i swear i've seen at least hey mister what's going on in that noodle place it's three in the morning and i swear i've seen at least four chefs turning up for work i think you might underestimate the power of a late night noodle but you are for grabbing some it's gotta be good if what you're saying is true i never eat after midnight but i'm in such a noodle noodle if you're gonna talk like that you can go alone huh okay yeah me here checking out a strange sound over ah [Music] oh keeping us all safe you can see so much more than down the street remember no um come on think zero one definitely zero one something eighteen oh yes got it zero one one eight so mr pritchard i presume hi i'm chanting pleased to meet you i'll be your guide on the facility tour

to straighten everything out before i'm doing your tour yes so sorry about your flight just let me know when you're ready oh did you bring the p41 we left for you in the apartment no i wasn't informed

come and find me i'll be waiting by the stairs in the back of the restaurant kitchen the vip has access to the kitchen i'll be waiting for him good [Music] uh ah hello mr pritchard i've just learned that your plane will be delayed beyond the lifetime of the entry code you received for the facility for your convenience we've set up the new code to be 0118 to match the one for the apartment i hope you enjoy your stay hi chanting here mr pritchard i'm just calling to tell you to bring your p41 for the facility tour thank you mr pritchard i just read your report and share your concerns regarding this facility leadership behavior i fully back your decision to inspect and i would appreciate updates on your initial findings as they come in good job oh you got new menus i had no idea uh do you still have the uh sorry what right yeah uh just some sparkling water is fine so do you oh right here yeah so i'd like to get some soup dumplings right sorry yeah with the crab uh and how about some of

apartment he went straight to the restaurant i guess he was hungry after the nine hour flight delay i'll give him the tour of the facility when he's ready yeah i'll keep you updated sure thing how am i supposed to focus when the kitchen feels like a train station find your inner zen close your eyes and focus your mind on a discretion bonus on the paycheck that's what i do that is a calming bonus i don't know when he'll be ready for the tour but i'll wait for him no he's lost his luggage and wants to handle that first of course i will thank you oh god i don't feel so good huh just glad it's not me uh have a nice evening sir mom you can't call me when i am at work yes yes i know i am not home and that is in the middle of the night that was a bit of a hang up and i had to stay i am 24 years old i'm hanging up i'm ready to inspect the facility now good i hope you enjoyed the food did you bring the p-41 we left for you in the apartment yes i have everything i need good let's continue the tour continue you may say we haven't even started the tour yet but we have without you even noticing it mr prichard invisibility is the best security there is you see the restaurant is in fact a one that lets all ica personnel arrive unseen who notices a dumb plane cook on his way to work dressing the part takes you a long way ica guarantees absolute discretion to all clients we take that promise very seriously as you will see on all steps of the torque let's step inside doesn't look like much does it ms chen and visitor welcome please report to security desk for visitor sign in will do i love the facility ai it's really looking out for us and we're in the inside is a self-contained modular build that can be disassembled and removed in less than 12 hours if we are compromised no trace we will ever hear i agree leaving no trace behind is the only sensible ammo the outside shell is a building marked for demolition we put a hold on it with city planning a deliberate misplacement of the order but have people in place to rectify that at first shift city construction will move in our policy around ica personnel is that they are a resource but also a risk on top of contractual repercussions if breaches occur we perform detailed vetting on everyone the first blunt vetting is a frisk we have of course never had any employees trying to bring unauthorized weapons inside the facility but we do consider the step important i'll need to start the setup of your visitor security clearance here mr pichard hey it's me sorry to wake you up could i please have your people to watch the coffee machine when i left yeah sorry so feel free to have a look around i'll meet you on the other side of the frisk naturally you'll have to be frisked like everyone else no exceptions mr pritchard it makes me so nervous there's no way you're getting through that door 47. it only opens for people with an authentic security clearance the signal is encrypted without a dongle we can't hack it you can hack that panel with your camera for yourself frisking people i mean hey there oh i'm sorry i thought you were someone else to whatever they've got sir if you want to pass through i need to check that you're not carrying anything dangerous okay you're all fine off you go good you're here i've started the security clearance process it will take a little while since you're covered by the xero protocol all your data will be encrypted and inaccessible without your authorization only facility ai will use it for id analysis fully anonymized of course but we can go a few more steps on the tour while it's validating id analysis what the hell does that mean give me a minute i'll try to find out as i said personnel is the greatest asset but also the greatest risk of the ica the work we do here exists high level pressure on our employees and there is no room for mistakes we perform a daily multi-layered full body scan to guarantee that no employee will act erratically because of ptsd or other mental issues drug use physical health issues external pressure or moral hesitancy the scan only takes a few seconds come on it's this way inside i'm sorry but we can proceed beyond this room until your security clearance is finalized so why don't you have a little look around while we wait mr richard it should be here shortly [ __ ] we need to intercept that 47. or the facility ai will blow your cover get me into one of those computers and do it fast you've got 60 seconds before all hell breaks loose security protocol overruled good i'm in and you're safe that was a close one perfect timing your clearance just came through let's continue let's step inside i'm thinking about getting some of those glasses we are very serious about security what we protect is after all core to all ica operations we and we alone store all legal work contracts target profiles employee files contract documentation and validation we handle all current operations effectuate logistics of personnel and equipment our analysts do the client vetting target profiles and of course offer real-time contract support to handles and operatives storage and transmission of sensitive information like that takes constant vigilance to keep safe we have a team of engineers solely dedicated to that task and on top of that we have a dual human authentication process set up all access and alterations to the source are oh good there she is hi imogen royce i've been looking forward to meeting you likewise that's imogen royce quite the [ __ ] apparently nothing wrong with her look though edgy after you this is the blast and emp shielded core room the nervous system of the ica where we store the past and facilitate the present in general only a handful of people can access this room hush and myself plus bodyguards and a chosen few of the engineers i'm the most likely person to meet in here because i perform a regular physical check-in on the core console as a supplement to the remote authentication procedure we have a strict routine of daily core maintenance part of that procedure is a flash process evaporating all biological matter in the room you can see reed through that window it's her job to initiate the maintenance don't worry we're safe as long as the safety mechanism is engaged even if reed presses the button the procedure will not happen until we leave the core room the doors to the core room are all equipped with you know what screw this tour i know why you're really here cunning to the chase i see knowledge is power more importantly knowledge is opportunity let me demonstrate you have a sixth sense for irregularities and although hush's recent behavior has not been reported it has no doubt brought you here you do have authority to shut down unwanted efforts but at heart you are progressive and not the stickler everyone thinks you are you have sway with the board and as i see it your opinion is now what decides my future and the future of the ica so here we go imagine this having a time schedule on a target with minute details on locations durations and purpose a detailed layout of a target's actions within a defined time frame that would transform a contract into a surgical dance of precision no mess no fuss low cost just how i like it i've been working on a prediction algorithm based on a combination of big data analysis and micro targeted surveillance of defining target markers and my results are astounding all this state of the art is nothing but heavy old-fashioned machinery compared to what i offer analysts preparing detailed files dedicating days weeks to prepare our contracts gone handlers and analysts supporting our operatives during missions gone teams for cleanup and media manipulation in the rare case something unforeseen does happen all of it gone i asked you to imagine that scenario but what good is imagination when you can see it with your own eyes i've set up [Music] sup three employees unaware that i can accurately predict their behavior firing them will result in an already clearly defined reaction on the top left we have sharon reed who you saw downstairs she is a dutiful and trusted employee if she is to be fired my algorithm predicts with a certainty of 97.8 that she will finish up her most important tasks before she leaves the building specifically she will press the maintenance button within 11 seconds jeremy bolt the guard in the lower left is as tough as nails when on you see but in private he's a real mummy's boy if fired he will immediately call his mother and at her advice seek out who he considers his best friend for support my personal guard as it stands me really [Music] well that explains why he's always next to me at lunch at the top right you see alicia reynolds bright and very passionate about her job however also very possessive about her contribution my prediction is that she will try to disable the work she has done for the ica if she's not allowed to enjoy her results no one is specifically that means she will try to enter the courtroom and disable the safety mechanism i'll leave you to consider your choice of who you want me to use for the demonstration just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back i will have a closer look maybe your project could play a part in the future of the ica just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back oh and if you decide to leave the room a guard will escort you around safety protocol thought i'd just mention it she really takes the term god complex to a whole new level sitting in there pulling the strings like that i think you should take your setup and give it a spin 47 i see potential if you time it right alicia reynolds i regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status thank you for your service jeremy bolt i regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status thank you for your service what that can't be right code 41 is confirmed effective for your employment status oh god this is not good this is not good mom it's jerry i think i've just been fired i have no idea i thought it was going really well i like it here i can't believe it but who though friend sharon reid i regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status thank you for your service [Music] good that's imogen royce down take care of hush and we can get to the core [Music] you
