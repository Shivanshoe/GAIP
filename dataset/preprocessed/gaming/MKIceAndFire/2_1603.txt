[Music] geez how could those things possibly be I'm starting to think I should have had trunk show me a picture of them or something [Music] I never imagined we wouldn't be able to track their energy talk about a pain trailing how are things going with you not so good Goku no androids over here gotcha if you find one of them let us know okay me you're after then show your faces already anything piccolo nothing at all there's no trace of them anywhere all right be on your car [Music] maybe one of the other guys Tianshan hon sorry but I haven't found the androids same here there's got to be someplace we haven't thought to look well I just felt a huge drop in someone's energy its Yamcha [Music] yep yeah I'm Joe [Music] Krillin yawns are still alive I left some sense of beans behind get him out of here and give him one will ya right I'm on it [Music] so you're the Androids odd how did you figure out that we were androids and it would see you also knew that we'd be right here why is that you want us to talk then you're gonna have to try and make us very well wait not here let's move somewhere else somewhere with no people you're okay with that right somewhere with no people five we will allow you to choose the place of your death Goku how do you know Goku's name we know all of you you are pink I know and you are Tien yes we can talk about this later let's go [Music] you how did they know our names not surprised the androids know about Goku he's the one who took down the red ribbon army after all but they know about all the Fosters [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my site that's far enough Goku this ends now we will fight right here you have lost your right to choose the location [Music] so before we fight tell us how tell us how do you know who we are very well I will tell you Goku I have been observing you for quite some time now using an ultra small spy robot of mine during the world tournament during your fights with piccolo and Vegeta I continued my research long after you destroyed the red ribbon arm so that I could someday witness your defeat revenge against me huh yes because of you the red ribbon army could never realize its dream of world domination only dr. Shiro redmi2 talking almost as if you're dr. zero himself don't be ridiculous I am a creation of his I am Android 20 dr. Shiro is no longer among the living alright then did you happen to observe my fight on Planet Namek there was no need to waste the time we were able to effortlessly ascertain your power after your fight with Vegeta you're in for some real trouble because guess what [Music] what whether you know it or not you just dug your own grave you don't know about super sex I see impressive but no cause for concern Android 19 here should be more than enough to defeat you see what he's got [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] why would Goku be trying to rush the fight he's already nearing his full power he's in a lot of pain by the looks of him he [Applause] absorbed the attack Goku don't fire any energy attacks they can absorb them with their hands observe the attacks give me a break what what's going on Goku doesn't look so good wait it can't be it's the heart virus the kid from the future mentioned what you mean he hasn't taken the medicine yet I don't believe it you seem perfectly fine when he was training alongside me and Gohan damn all the time for Goku to get sick why did it have to be now [Music] if anyone's going to defeat Kakarot it's going to be me not some junk puppets like you [Music] Vegeta I felt an incredible energy over there earlier but it's pretty weak now maybe the fights over go on Grill it yeongja what's going on what are the androids did me in but Crillon here save me with the sense to be I've got more sense ooh beans here we need to meet up with the others and fast over there Goku the heart virus that the kid from the future mentioned that's likely what he's struggling with No somebody needs to get him out of here give him that heart medicine right away I'll take him hate to admit it and probably not gonna be much help here anymore [Music] looks like you've got to deal with me now Android 20 please allow me to exterminate the cheetah very well then I will take care of the remaining for you two don't look as tough as everyone it said you would be we already know the full extent of your fighting prowess oh you need more than calculations to understand a save so tell me are androids capable of experiencing fear Vegeta's a super sad [Music] and you're nothing more than greater powers and train the hardest I've ever trained eventually I came to realize the limitations of my power frustration I finally awakened and became a Super Saiyan that might be oppressive to some a paltry power increase does not make you a match for us Androids that cocky sneer will soon be turned into sheer terror [Music] now that I become a Super Saiyan no one can best me well let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] got a gun [Music] [Applause] prepare yourself [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] miscalculations [Music] [Music] [Applause] take this have a super machinist Big Bang attack [Music] you used up a lot of my power you want to take me down now's your chance come at me your power may have exceeded my initial calculations but it's still not enough to defeat us androids [Music] I'm going to I want to see the end of the androids with my own eyes yeah count me in too me too fine but don't get pulled into the fight he's more than you guys can handle he's trying to lose us among the rocks if you find him let everyone else know okay amplified Android Taylor [Music] that Android is a whole lot craftier than I thought he would be just been no word from Gohan and the others I'd better go ask them just in case [Music] since we can't sense his energy this will be tricky [Music] [Music] there's no sign of him having left this rocky area it's more than likely hiding somewhere [Music] Gohan you find him no he's not here I'm sorry mr. piccolo [Music] vegeta have you suppose faster than i thought damn him [Music] well now this could be partners [Music] I'll make quick words of you [Music] [Music] yograj [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's all Bachir got anything no I still haven't caught sight of him [Music] [Music] have you seen him Crillon nope he's pretty well hidden in these rocks [Music] damn hate to say it but we might have lost him no calling your comrades now your energy will be all mine get over here mr. piccolo you're as good as dead how did they find me thanks Gohan Gruen give piccolo astaizzu beam okay let me on him and what does a weakling like you hope to accomplish just as I calculated don't take this lightly [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this tank may pick a little awkward [Music] [Music] you made a terrible error and tried to fight me alone who hope to accomplish I will eliminate [Music] [Music] yeah I will not be done in by the likes of piccolo as a weakling like you hope to a cop [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this isn't receivable what's wrong another miscalculation weakling like you hope to a cop [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you should have nothing left we instantly increase our energy during a fight [Music] [Music] wait these aren't the androids I know what's going on if it's not them who is everyone fighting I refuse to believe that even piccolo could have increased his power this much I have made a grave miscalculation I have no choice but to return to my lab everybody's here so it looks like we all avoided getting wiped out which must mean we've changed the future now none of you have any hope of winning androids 17 and 18 will make short work of the lot of you [Applause] [Music] punks drunks did he just say drunks that's my son's name wait he's from the future that means are you alright hey it's you from before so you came back huh yeah I thought I would come and offer my support but who are you fighting so where is that wrinkly robot he use the smoke to make us get away damn it why didn't you try and save your wife and child just now foolishness I have no interest in things like that I saw what looked like a badly damaged Android on my way here it looks like the androids you fought are different from the ones I've been fighting in my time then what the hell are we fighting that's not that big of a deal right I mean so history's a little different now wait that creepy geezer wasn't Android huh yeah that might have been the actual doctor Jareau I've seen a photo of him in one of my books he probably modified himself to extend his life no way you mean my coming here years ago changed history this much he mentioned androids 17 and 18 those were the two you were talking about right tell us what do they look like right Android 17 is a young man with long black hair and scarf around his neck Android 18 is a young woman and their outfit is more or less similar to mine a female type oh come on FOMA do you know what doctor zeros laboratory is he's probably there right now if I had to guess it's likely in the mountains up north I heard that he built it in a cave around there to do his experiments to think he was a lackey for the red ribbon army that's crazy that settles the matter then we'll find the location of dr. zeros lab and destroy it well before he's able to activate Android 17 and 18 I'm above such cowardly tactics let him activate I'll turn them into scrap with my bare hands no we have to destroy his lab before he activates the other androids and if we can't then we have to avoid fighting until Goku is fully recovered we have no need for Kakarot you're forgetting that I'm a Super Saiyan now too and I'm no ordinary Saiyan I'm the Prince which means I'm leagues above Kakarot in terms of power don't stand in my way Vegeta may actually have what it takes to get rid of the androids as a Super Saiyan it might just work [Music] I can transform into a Super Saiyan 2 yet there was no match for them I'm going to he's difficult to deal with but I'm not about to watch my father die again Oh father did he say father what did he mean yes there's no point in keeping it a secret not anymore kid's name is trunks but jitta is his father you're his mother in other words he's your son trunks is the grownup version of the baby you're holding in your arms right now well that explains it that's why he was able to go super saiyan i think it's probably best we destroy the androids before they've been activated you guys come with me we're going to look for dr. Shiro's lab right yeah okay boom ah this is important could you let my dad know what's going on tell him to come help when he feels better well I would but how am I supposed to do that have you seen my plane go on head back take her with you understand for more than strong enough to destroy the androids okay be careful all right let's go we have to get there before Vegeta does right hurry we've got to find that lab before the androids are activated [Music] so if Android 17 and 18 are activated do you think Vegeta will be hard to say honestly I just hope he can scrap those two before they're activated if this dr. churro built a lab at such a remote location must not like people very much it wasn't exactly a well-respected scientist the surprise there I wonder if Fujita's already run into well we're close to where the lab is this dr. churro was working for the red ribbon army definitely not a good guy over there hmm looks like someone wants to die it's closed what just happened [Music] how dare you I created you you didn't create us we had lives before you ruined them listen to me you must eliminate Coco's allies they're coming that's an order do you hear that it's an order 17 we're not gonna follow a single one of your orders we're just gonna take care of ourselves now geezer there's another one what in the world is going on in there let's go I feel a lot better now hey what's that hey I don't think I've seen you before big guy what's your number 16 Android 16 huh interesting so you're an earlier model Android 16 I've never heard of an Android 16 wait so so those are the androids that dr0 was talking about Trump's can you confirm that these are the Android you originally warned us about yeah all right I've never seen that large when they called 16 before what at least I haven't seen him in my time so what's going on here hmm who cares just one more hunk of scrap to add to the pile I'm going to make weight where's dr. Shiro oh the old man I took care of them hmm all right let's go get going to where I'm not crazy about doing what dr. Shiro wants but as Androids I think we should do something so let's go kill this Goku guy hey sixteen you were created specifically to kill Goku right correct well I guess that settles it then but where are they going don't tell me they're actually gonna try to find Goku well that's what dr. gyro wanted right to kill Goku I couldn't give a damn about that Kakarot huh don't make me laugh they're going to pay for not recognizing my power [Music] [Music] it's a highway out [Music] well well I didn't expect to see you reject roaming around in here you're going to tell me where you're going right now whether you want to or not we're off to find Goku we're gonna kill him see that's what I thought too bad that's not going to happen because I'm going to blow every one of you to pieces Yusei and sure are full of yourselves aren't you that pride of yours it's just gonna get you killed faster you know you've got quite the mouth on you for a machine Zoe's up first the punk the woman or maybe I should just scrap all three of you trash cans at once wait that's right we still haven't seen what you can do sixteen why don't you fight him negative my prime directive is to eliminate only Goku wow what a letdown fine I'll do it then [Music] Vegeta are you all right so you came you're really starting to piss me off Vegeta and 18 are about to fight so back off what still just watching isn't much fun I guess I could play with you guys you know what that means you and I won't be having any interruptions hmm be warned I don't plan on going easy on you just because you're a woman [Music] [Music] [Music] god [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] idiots [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself longer than you no matter it's not like you're a big deal [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] prepare yourself prepare yourself [Music] [Music] maybe I shouldn't admit this but I'm actually kind of impressed you held out this long damn woman now you've done it oh I think it's time we end this little game you're about done right don't worry they're still alive you'd better hurry up though give them those Senzu beans of yours so should we get going but are we going to ask them the whereabouts of Goku nah it'll be more fun if we have to find him ourselves you can be such a child sometimes 17 you know that do you think so whatever I'm fine as long as we can make a stop in town my clothes are a mess I think I'm going to need a new outfit sure why not hey wait wait huh what do you want what is it that you guys are after I mean why are you doing this well first we're gonna take care of Goku I mean why are you going after Goku hey this is all just a game I mean you probably won't just stop because I asked you to write it negative we were created for the sole purpose of eliminating Goku you heard the big guy yeah but shouldn't you be helping your friends instead of talking to us they're gonna die see ya bye I've got to help the others so they knew all about the sense of beans and just let us go on our way they didn't even feel the need to kill us [Music] don't go after him just leave him be he'd finally become a Super Saiyan and regained his pride and confidence as a warrior getting beaten that badly was probably too much for him to take even trunks who defeated Frieza so easily couldn't lay a finger on them that's it isn't it no matter how strong Goku gets there's no way we can win okay here's the plan you guys go to Goku's house then move them to a different location immediately before we do anything else we need to make sure Goku gets better so right what are you gonna do piccolo what's gotten into piccolo all of a sudden he went that way okay I think I get it he's got one final trick up his sleeve one final trick what do you mean so you know what's in that direction right I'm not really sure what are you trying to say that's commies place and what does that have to do with anything when I was back on Planet Namek I spoke to guru he told me that if comi and piccolo hadn't separated they'd be as powerful as a Saiyan so I'm betting that Piccolo's gonna combine with commie and go back to being his true warrior self but wait if comi ceases to exist as he is now won't the Dragon Balls disappear too but if either of them die separately well then the same things gonna happen anyway so piccolo probably feels like this is our best shot at taking down an enemy this powerful but what about my [ __ ] I I mean what about Vegeta what do you think he's up to relax there's no need to hide it anymore I mean we already know that your bomas kid all grown up and from the future Vegeta the only one who doesn't know what oh I see I'm sorry for hiding it from you hey no need to apologize I'm going to meet up with chiaotzu if things get hairy again I'll be back gotcha we're gonna get Goku and take him to Master Roshi's place okay okay make sure you tell Goku not to overdo it right we'll tell him [Music] overdo it huh yeah of all the times not to overdo it now would actually be the time the androids in my timeline were in no way that powerful has history really been altered that much tell us what the future's like trunks up I mean if you want to no pressure or anything [Music] there it is that's Goku spouse [Music] hello oh I thought I heard someone Krillin is that you I was hoping Gohan had comeback trunks let me introduce Goku's wife this is chichi huh who are you I don't think I've seen you before hey chichi pleased to meet you Krillin you're alright oh I was worried sick about you guys Oh Yamcha house Goku are there any changes he's fine you took his medicine now he's sleeping so you're the guy from the pen no sorry but we'll fill you in later first we need to move Goku to Master Roshi's place and fast what's going on two actually three scary androids are on their way here and they're after Goku oh no that's not good [Music] all right it's all packed up now we just wait for Gohan here he is [Music] what's everyone doing here did something happen we'll tell you on the way just get in [Music] come on tell us have any leads just yet do you have any idea where Goku is didn't you hear me before it's more fun this way taking our time and hunting him down regardless we should still have some kind of game plan hey sixteen what about you you know something right Goku's house is located in the mountains in east district for three nine so you did know something you're just full of surprises did dr. Shiro tell you that affirmative if we fly we should arrive in a matter of minutes I know right see this guy gets it traveling on foot is a complete waste of time when you're capable of flying you're such a whiner it's gonna be more fun this way you know what you can be a real pain in the neck seventeen [Music] you we're just about in Master Roshi's place hey Krillin yeah we should probably let Boehm in on everything that's happening don't you think ah yeah you're right so what does that mean I have to call her man you know your mom isn't exactly easy to talk to sometimes she's the same in my time too boma it's a screwin my son my future son up there huh oh yeah why what's up whoa I heard from headquarters that we got a call a few days ago from someone out west in the countryside they said they found a strange vehicle in the mountains that had capsule corporation written on the side of it I got them to send me a photo which I then tried to match with a database of our products to see who it might belong to but it didn't match anything I could find I thought trunks might know something about it it's covered in moss and it looks really old what you were taking a look for me I'll send you a bit wait this is yeah it's definitely the time machine I came here in but how is that possible I've got my time machine right here with my other capsules I thought this might be a time machine but what's it doing at a place like that do you know the exact location of the time machine yes I'd like to see it for myself then I'm coming too we can meet up near the machines location I'd like to help you look for it - is that okay of course thank you go on don't worry mom we're not going anywhere dangerous we'll be safe [Music] trunks yeah I was wondering is is the future really all that bad it is humanity has been reduced to only tens of thousands of people [Music] you [Music] they look weak no cause for concern they love week no cause for concern they look weak no costs are concerned [Music] Orange City strange seem to place all normal safe I can feel power surging through me welcome thank you feel free to browse [Music] [Music] [Music] come back real soon [Music] [Music] you it's completely intact strange to see it like this [Music] it should be in this area let's start looking that's it over there isn't it that's the time machine all right hi vana hey you're both here [Music] so this is the time machine you were talking about yeah that's right here I'll take out my time machine check it out this is the time machine I came in as you can see it's identical to the other one but this one looks like it's been here for a really long time [Music] it looks like something made this whole by melting the dome from the inside a [Music] sickle look inside but what's this Oh what is it hi I'm not sure what's doing in the time machine [Music] this is some sort of egg isn't it laughs what's going on [Music] it's not just this egg that confuses me though huh I looked at the on board panel it happened to see win this time machine left what do you mean obviously it's from the same time as you right actually it's from even further in the future three years after I left three years and that's not all the panel showed that it arrived here four years ago so that means this thing arrived here one year before I did what's going on why did this thing come here I thought the reason the two androids Goku and the others fought were different and the reason history had changed so much was because of my coming here but this it's possible this thing might actually be the cause of all the changes wait what's that what's what oh it's just I was wondering what that is [Music] it's some sort of exoskeleton rose and exoskeleton is it from some sort of mutant bug or something I bet that's what was inside the egg we found in the time machine right it probably grew too big for its skin and then and then shed it but how did it end up in this time period either someone placed the egg in the time machine or they came here carrying it hey you guys got a bad feeling about this too right yeah then we better hurry up and get out of here you guys are gonna be a calm a house right I'll call you if something happens okay right thanks what's going on I'm so confused as a mysteries just keep piling up [Music] you
