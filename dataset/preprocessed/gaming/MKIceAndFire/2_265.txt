karel join the guardian she said don't be good for your mental health she said all right listen to flark up groot and i are getting off the stash rock anyone who'd like a ride can follow us everyone

carell took her [ __ ] back to zandar to report look are they praying what the hell have we wandered into check out that big guy don't look like no nova to me behold the magic floating to the altars no such thing as magic right come on let's get moving before these whack drops spot us it's like we stumbled on some creepy cult i told you it ain't our problem it will be if they've taken over novacore no nova no fine no problem we should probably tell someone yeah tell it to your diary come on down here how do you know i don't i'm just putting distance between us and those whack jobs this door's locked i said down here [Music] good of you to join us what's the harm in checking oh let's just pay our fine let's just look around let's just stumble onto a floor control mutiny who says i can't this is his fault in fact i'm done talking to him to who you too late groot tell mr one more room him and me are done [Music] fine quail the groot says you and me are done this is not productive to our egress from this station so you think yeah i'll deal with the door someone's got to get us out of here [Music] [Music] we should have trusted them [Music] magic show [Music] has been [Music] glasses [Music] enough already i agree the electric wheeling foreman must perish next [Music] i didn't want to be here [Music] these bombs are making things way too crowded [Music] don't be so super special [Music] don't blame me [Music] you sure you can get it open you're gonna second-guess me every step of the way i'm not there let's go i wasn't second-guessing i'm just sure these doors have been barricaded means someone at least tried to resist bad lot of good it did them we don't know that there could still be others on the station or maybe those were the survivors who fled on the house uh is that let's just pretend we didn't see that so let's flark and go already come on rocky you can't stay mad at me wanna bet not after the last one how about you just don't piss me off any further till we're off this flark and rock all right anger here we come what the flark was that docking number r7 3-4 p.o are you serious always you're my new favorite person muscles no not really there she is come to papa 4pl done all right base clear extending catwalks and flark what's up the clamps won't release those wack jobs must have triggered a lockdown can you override it it wouldn't be much of a lockdown if i could i can hold her in position and get the engines warmed up but you're gonna have to release those clamps manually all right release the clamps and don't die [Music] all faithful converge on the central hangar [Music] we'll try to keep non-tailgater off of you [Music] try to keep them doing [Music] music [Music] how's it going in there [Music] [Music] thank [ __ ] [Music] you wanna do it [Music] get ready [Music] three [Music] now what we should set course for contraxia they bear our issues i don't hate it but we should report what we saw first right because that's our biggest problem quill come on groot we got scott to do rocket what's with him the abomination is never happy rocket's got a point though our cons are flarked the tracker's still counting down corel could be anywhere in the universe it's not looking good we are in the place between hard rocks you mean a rock and a hard place that is what i said helen knows we could use a night off so atraxia we should go to nowhere instead ah another suitable location to partake in liberal libations to report what we saw me and cosmo go way back he's chief of security he'll make sure the right people know about the rock and the track aren't fine rockets got a guy in nowhere we kill two birds with one stone okay i'll set the coordinates maybe talk to rocket peter quill what does killing two birds with one stone signify it means solving two problems with a single solution ha i knew it there are no birds on nowhere depends if she our count saw a few of them last time uh i'm sorry drax i thought paying her fine would make things better but it just made things more complicated do not apologize peter quill our encounter with novacorp has given me clarity of purpose we must investigate and fight whoa there drax we ain't fighting novacore if we can help it we'll just let cosmo handle this the soldiers we encountered were not acting like novacorp officers and those robed priests it was all very disturbing maybe we should check other nova core stations to see if they're all right you want to check out nova core you do it after we get to nowhere quill really cared about this team he wouldn't get turned around as soon as an ex-girlfriend walks into the room i am not we almost got killed back there i almost got killed trying to get this [ __ ] back hey uh guys what's up nothing at all quill not a thing uh something wrong with groot nope he's just uh defoliating seasonal thing come on i know you're lying you guys are planning something what we do ain't none of your business can't we just talk about it talking ain't worth skutt if you don't put your money where your mouth is things are gonna get better i promise we'll fix it just like you promised before sec narf come on rocket what you're gonna tell me i'm a valued member of your crew again leave us alone coyle perhaps we should consume the rest of our food rations before we reach nowhere to make room for new ones i'll pass you were not hungry i already checked the cupboard all we've got left are number five ration packs ah yes the dehydrated eggs are foul well seriously just make it fast okay why do i even bother helping you quill done all done also flark you see you never quill get out of my room quill what are you doing here leave uh rocket block off quill oh groot why so those coordinates they're in your console got it [Music] assassin calm down i'm just going to the bathroom i am not agitated you just looked at me like you wanted to stab me my apologies i have been told i have an angry thinking face did rocket say that no it was hovat my late wife oh sorry she used to compliment my contemplative scowls she found them very arousing all right i'm out of here well that didn't last long gonna have to ask groot about this when he's free assassin you believe the events unfolding aboard the rock qualify as a mutiny correct looked pretty obvious to me even if the officers who rebelled were under the influence of a mysterious force it doesn't really change that they rejected novacore orders and started killing their shipmates i find it repulsive nowhere here we come and nowhere last spaceport on the edge of the known universe and home to the best black market deals you can find and surprisingly good noodles you ever wondered what kind of person found it was like oh look the severed head of a giant celestial being let's drill holes in and live inside they wanted the brain tissue very rare very valuable the marketplace came after along with new news [Music] you were certain this cosmo is trustworthy peter quill of course he's chief of security and nowhere and as such probably deals nova corps all the time trust me he's going to want to know about the rock are they doing back there shenanigans likely see you never flark bags [Music] a rocket and groot did they really leave yes it looks like it do we know where they went you're the last one who talked to them yeah rockets seem pissed off try to behave while we're gone okay maybe when we get back i'll ask groot to give you a bath guess you were right turns out we couldn't trust those guys i still have faith that the tree will bring the rodent to reason i hope nowhere's chief of security will intervene to assist nova corps the station will be visited it perturbs me still at least you're still here i wouldn't want to miss your meeting with cosmo you wouldn't know rockets tracker removing guy by any chance nope sorry all right whatever we'll talk and have a good time [Music] you think cosmo will actually believe us like i said we go way back plus he's probably already heard about what's happening all we do is confirm the rumor maybe he'll even give us a reward have you had dealings with this cosmo murderess we've circled back to that name have we a statement of fact or by trade an assassin and you're a convicted serial killer your hands aren't exactly clean what about rocky and groot what about them they left what am i supposed to do chase them down and beg them to come back you could apologize that's your advice the apology does not need to be sincere then what's the point demonstrate if rocket doesn't come back we'll need a contingency plan for getting rid of the nova tracker why we've not yet spent our ill-gotten gains we could still pay the fine but we'd have to go all the way to new zander to do it what if we get there and it's compromised too there's got to be someone shady enough in the market to help maybe but cosmo deals with nova corps all the time maybe we can pay the fine through him spaceport seems busier than normal war always moves the poor to the frontiers the galactic war was over 12 revolutions ago and we're still waiting for the fallout some wounds how many scars his tower on the far side of the market that's where he keeps an eye on things [Music] hey there i need to talk to cosmo he and his tower should be you know the way straight through the market you can't miss it something else i can help you with uh no i think we're good [Music] be good to see cosmo again i guess i kind of miss the old boy how exactly do you know him was he also a prisoner of the tower nope he met right here back when i was in the ravagers dishonorable killers and thieves the ravagers actually did some good during the war even the main gist of mutts will behave if he fits them well you're one to talk how many people did you kill on your crusade against thanos whatever bad stuff we all did is behind us we're the good guys now right heroes for hire [Music] keep an eye on your thanks these groups are fit hands-on [Music] i always imagine the aliens would be more alien [Music] do you mind you're making me uncomfortable i had my fortune told at the fair once she said my future would be a roller coaster ride looks like she was right yes so but at the time i just went and rode the roller coaster [Music] you must be mistaken i'm doing great [Music] uh okay [Music] [Music] you're monetizing deception you do what you have to when your family needs food [Music] i've got enough to worry about with the presence i'm kind of right in the middle of this whole avoiding the truth thing right now the soothsayers on catapt were unable to predict its demise no one could predict what thanos would do mad titan will pay for everything that he has destroyed he's gone drax his death helped end the war you're his adopted daughter you believe that i didn't not for a long time if thanos was still alive he'd have come after me by now [Music] these charlatans are incessant i cannot hear my own thoughts i think they're counting on that how does this cosmo permit them to peddle their lives maxis what are you do you still have those suicidal urges what no and you thought joining a team would be bad for you hi some more right is it rock star it's star wars hey that's right i forget which version of you i've met did you do that yet what is the thing she is referring to no idea hi i don't know if we've met yet i'm no no no no it's not oh no he's lying i mean [Music] you look less depressed thanks don't worry it's always weird the first time celestial madonna hi guys you should not be in this place actually i'm exactly where i need to be i think no yes this is where i need to be or needed to be am needed yes wait why are you here you cannot keep leaving the sanctuary it's not safe there are bombings but when aren't there rumblings in the galaxy yeah okay we're gonna keep making my face it was nice seeing you again gamora star guy green me okay bye so gamora you and mantis seem close we've met okay we're being evasive woman wait woman that's the nicest thing you've ever called me i told peter quill i would try that is not the point anyone ever tell you you're an open book hardcover or paperback i just meant man just mentioned a few things mantis says a lot of things they don't always make sense until they do that insect woman was odd i understand your reluctance to disgust her mantis is strange but she means well i think she does anyway should find this cosmo be right there [Music] where did you run off to you know just looking around looking for information about this cosmo i presume uh yeah sure looking for trouble more like it don't you start eyeballing me [Music] you seem to know the insect woman peter quill even if she could not remember your name last time i saw her we were sharing a prison cell except she said she was there on purpose sounds like mantis she's got some serious moves regular ninja did not strike me as very serious it's a wonder this head hasn't collapsed in on itself yet [Music] sometimes i think the sleaze is the only thing holding nowhere together ah better sleaze than custom nano resin i still got some of that stuck in my what was his boots [Music] hey dude [Music] hi groot rocky you can't just ignore me we gotta talk about this so you want us to bring them back here not necessary transport would be waiting once you've captured the target that'll work we'll be in touch let's go groove [Music] what's the big idea man i think you got me confused with somebody else pal come on rocket let's talk about this can you believe this you guy just quit we need you well uh i don't need you find some other sucker to keep your [ __ ] together you're more than just uh actually
