so this is it day one of training at the wwe performance center as you can see it looks like everyone heard i was coming and decided they'd be better off staying home this is cool but there's no way my journey ends here i'm going to wwe and then straight to the top where i make sure that what are you doing you're an hour and a half early for your orientation i was just checking out the facility there'll be plenty of time for that later how did you even get in here guy up front let me in oh big guy with the mustache kind of sweaty yup well that's todd's final strike hope he enjoys early retirement oh no need to get anyone in trouble he uh definitely checked my id and even did a pat down really thorough so todd's all right in my book i feel very safe in his big sweaty hands fine whatever anyway you're going to need to fill out your information on this and sign a bunch of waivers before you can begin training today and when you're done with all that there's actually a fun part you get to design your wrestling gear in case you become a wwe superstar you mean when i become a wwe superstar yeah sure wait have you been filming this entire time is that a problem filming's not allowed in here without prior consent which you should have been told by security freaking todd turn it off please okay me me [Music] you done with all that yet just finished it takes time to design a look like that huh i have seen worse so now what should i go wait at the front desk with you until it's time to start front desk what do you think i do here i'm corey klein head recruiter and occasional babysitter of people who don't follow instructions and show up way earlier than they're supposed to oh that cory i guess when we were emailing i just saw your name and assumed you know what it's nice to meet you in person finally go get changed then head over to the gym the other trainees who started last week should be showing up soon and to clear up any potential confusion on your end they are men got it thanks hey new guy right i'm hector flores welcome to the pc thanks i'm excited to get going especially since i heard you started last week i started here at least i've been training and wrestling for years before this it's part of growing up in mexico are you from one of those famous wrestling families no where i'm from you were either into wrestling or football sorry soccer i chose wrestling i played soccer when i was a kid but there wasn't enough punching so eventually i got into mma there was a lot more punching so why make the switch from mma to wrestling i love fighting but i got burned out with the long training camps and only getting to fight a couple times a year plus i wanted a new challenge so i started training for this a few months back and wwe took notice that's good but don't expect this to be easy you're going to have to work as hard or harder than you ever have before to make it to wwe i realize that and i respect everything that wwe superstars do inside and outside the ring and i know i can do the same thing if not better that's a high bar to set but good luck me um we so hey who are you it's my first day training here who are you seriously have you not been watching japanese wrestling for the past six years i'm paragon j pierce the biggest free agent wwe science since aj styles bigger actually i haven't had time to watch japanese wrestling i was busy training and finding an mma at the highest level in the world so you're an mma fighter huh man you guys are all the same you come in our sport thinking it's gonna be easy but you're in for a real wake-up call i don't plan on being here very long they actually should have never sent me here to begin with but i'm going to take this opportunity to send you running back to whatever mma promotion you were cut from you remind me of a lot of the guys i fought against all talk luckily for them they don't have to face me anymore unfortunately you do yeah in a wrestling ring which you have very little experience in you're in my arena now rookie and when i'm done with you you're gonna wish you stayed in your lane we'll see i heard you were starting today big fan thanks you a big mma fan no not really i just love that viral video of the fight where you got knocked out in like two seconds hilarious anyway i'm actually crossing over from another sport too i spent some time in minor league really who'd you play for well i wasn't a player i was actually a mascot named ribby but i was around a ton of good athletes oh okay well that counts for something i guess the best part of the job was they used to have indie wrestling shows at the stadium all the time where i got to rub elbows with legends like jerry the king lawler he found out i was training on the side as a wrestler and actually help me get a shot here not that i couldn't have made it on my own so that explains it your lawler's charity case it's not like that i deserve to be here you'll see sure if i need a mascot to cheer me on i'll let you know whatever i was gonna ask you to autograph something for me but now i'm not sure i want it probably not worth anything anyway relax i was just giving you a hard time i'll do it you might need to sell it after you get cut here seriously i'm messing with you again see you out there case messing with me again right what do you mean you called me case but my name's chase good one oh yeah totally messing with you that's me full of jokes i'd like to officially welcome our newest recruit to the start of his wwe journey the rest of you've heard this speech already so we'll try to make it quick on our first day he did the whole ladies and gentlemen boys and girls children of all ages thing it was awesome we'll do the talking chase i was just telling him about your cool dx intro you did chase what road dog was getting that is we are going to give you the foundation to succeed in wwe what you do with it is up to you keep in mind you will be judged at all times the big man in the sky is always watching not that big man there's a camera up there with a live feed that goes directly to triple h's office in stamford the coaches and pc staff certainly have input but ultimately he'll decide when the time's right to bring the gm's from nxt raw and smackdown here so you can showcase your talents i'm ready for that now yeah we know you think that but it's not your call big shot okay now that all that's out of the way we're gonna start with some one-on-one matches to see where everyone's at all right new guy since it's your first day we'll let you

you you fought hard there's no shame in losing i guess i just don't want to be seen as the weak link in our training class you know like the guy that no one really expects to succeed or the one you want to face whenever you need an easy win you've only been here a week right i don't think anyone thinks that not yet at least hey keep your head up you can do this i'll try thanks buddy oh [Music] me wow big win over the mascot really impressive i bet triple h is talking to all the gm's right now about the new guy at the pc who had the courage to face the weakest opponent here just because i wrestled chase today doesn't mean i'm scared to face hector you or anyone else i'll believe it when i see it and so far you haven't shown me anything yeah well i'm sure we'll have the chance to face each other real soon as long as you don't keep dodging real competition uh so ah oh [Applause] ah [Music] oh yes [Music] [Music] ah [Applause] oh [Applause] one one two one oh ah one one two one two one one two ah [Music] oh [Music] um one two three so the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke a key component to his transition from mma to wwe was cardiovascular conditioning mma fights have rounds and most bouts end quickly once the bell rings in wwe the combatants battle until the end of the match so it's a higher level of conditioning let's see how he handles it tonight there is only one the immortal and his opponent from venice beach california weighing in at 302 pounds so between wcw and wwe hogan has had double digit world title reigns not to mention he's a two-time wwe hall of famer and the biggest name in the business in the 80s and 90s wwe universe is going crazy i don't understand why all this hot dogging and grandstanding already the match hasn't even begun yet don't you know corey hogan feeds off the energy from the wwe universe it's gonna power him through this match and by the way what you gonna do when hulkamania runs wild on you that's pretty good right no terrible at least she would hogan have the same hairline you can feel it when hogan enters the ring there is no more powerful force in wwe than hulkamania oh the goosebumps are forming all over my skin michael i'll admit the hulkamania is running through my veins you can see the adrenaline fueling holster as we get underway but he'll be facing someone who's been looking for a challenging fight for quite some time now hopefully he'll get it tonight placing them right where they want them into the corner wow no mercy being shown hogan here the holster now with a daunting task ahead of him oh kick connects well-placed kick well-measured strike both wrists captured it that was nasty devastating kick big these two showing how well scouted they each are setting it up boom [Applause] he's starting to struggle here this is where endurance becomes so important in the late stick oh gosh cover four two three and that's all shiro here is your winner sub zero scorpion progressive perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this win this is what you get when you have complete confidence and control of the situation the following contest is a handicap match making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke this guy used to stick to one weight class back in mma but he's made a good adjustment into the world of wwe where his opponents come in all sizes his striking ability is ridiculous he has phenomenal submissions and is learning to use the entire ring listen this is pure electricity [Applause] and their opponents first from miami florida weighing in at 265 pounds well here's the man who's captured the imagination of the entire sports entertainment industry the brahma bowl one of the very best of all time without question the rock has been a champion at every level hey saxton your roll know it your mouth shut it that wasn't very nice it is just such an incredible moment every time the rock competes desire to be the best ever has been fulfilled the great one possesses amazing agility power and stamina looks set to run over the competition here tonight stone cold steve austin says what he wants does what he wants and he's not afraid of the repercussions and his partner from victoria texas weighing in at 252 pounds [Applause] what a mess the iconic texas rattlesnake a pivotal figure in the monday night wars if it isn't the definition of irony that wcw once fired this man who would go on to become one of the biggest names in the history of this industry stone cold steve austin has done it his way every step of the way [Applause] [Applause] what can a competitor do to figure out the option to buy the plan for this type of match-up whatever you do stay out of your opponent's corner that's a sure-fire way to feel that number and where you don't want to be if you can't stay out of the corner and away from the numbers game it is only a matter of time before the match is over wow [Applause] an one turned that one around yeah he's able to stop that surge dead in its tracks evades the attack oh superstar looking for legs are great by now the arms are trapped this won't end well oh big stop oh down the hard way oh gosh oh for the win [Applause] i understand the sentiment but now is not the time to bask in disbelief rock moves in the nick of time definitely not where you want to be right now just carried like a ragdoll here gets the tag yeah he just punched him in the chest and he's a step ahead of austin the rock tacked in grief punches he's turning the tables [Applause] i wish someone would put you out the pasture right and left elbows knees all of them lethal looks like he's got a little bit arms and feet oh this match is getting pushed beyond the normal limits and the rock is getting dismantled the millions are hoping the rock can come back here will it be [Applause] zero scorpion big effort tonight a well-earned victory here tonight with a win like that you have to stand back for a moment and realize all your hard work paid off so the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke points and his opponent from east london weighing in at 190 pounds danny birch [Applause] foreign oh [Applause] one two [Applause] god huh [Applause] oh one two three here is your winner sub zero scorpion smoke [Applause] so hey big news we got another member of dx coming to help out for a bit at the pc hornswoggle uh no one of the members of the best version of dx x-poc no offense but i actually think the original version of dx was the best wow offense taken it's funny shawn almost tells me the same thing you guys were cool but shawn and hunter were the ogs okay what if when xbox is here we had a match to settle this debate you and your og hero shawn michaels versus me and xbox i've got two words for you i'm in leave that to the pros yes yes wow one two ah [Applause] wow [Applause] oh ah one two three that's spanish for i got a big opportunity for you ignoring your terrible spanish for a second what's the opportunity wwe was contacted to send a pc student to el mago's retirement show in mexico they actually requested hector but for some reason he doesn't want to do it so if you're interested we'll have a triple threat between you paragon and chase to decide who will go to face el mago's son el mago junior at the event which means book my flight i only looked up that one sentence so i'll take your word for it [Music] [Music] aah ah ah oh uh [Applause] oh [Applause] one ah [Applause] one two three [Music] me me good luck against el mago junior in mexico i hope you beat him that's the plan i've been meaning to ask why didn't you want to go yeah um just wasn't feeling it it would have been a chance for you to compete in your home country and you're probably a fan of el mago right i was but he wasn't a fan of me that's all i can really say just go get the win over margo jr okay [Applause] [Music] [Applause] huh [Applause] one two [Applause] ah [Applause] so this hey we have some good news you're not going to have to deal with us much longer well maybe if everything works out what do you mean triple h feels like you've seen enough from you and the rest of the class so it's time for an official evaluation is this the pc showcase you mentioned back on my first day exactly all of the gm's will be here to see you guys in action if you impress any of them enough you might receive a contract offer thanks for helping me get to this point i won't let you down you put in the hard work and earn this opportunity now it's time to deliver and reap the benefits i'll be ready we should also mention that each gm is going to be accompanied by a superstar from their brand to help evaluate you guys by evaluate you mean you're going to face one of the visiting superstars we already know how you do against the other guys here so we wanted to give you a new challenge that all sounds good to me so who will i face well the options are oni lorcan from nxt shinsuke nakamura from smackdown or the toughest challenge out of the three drew mcintyre from raw keep in mind there's no wrong choice but being a tougher opponent would be more impressive to the gm's potentially open more doors but if you lost the risk might not be worth it so now that you've had 10 seconds to consider this life-altering decision what's it gonna be i want to really impress the gm's give me drew mcintyre all right we'll make it happen good luck kid wait we almost forgot the best part there's a little surprise waiting in your locker oh you mean his custom gear we made for him well now the cat's out of the bag remember your first day when you designed your wrestling attire well we figured it might help your chances if the gms could see how you'd really look in wwe unless you'd rather stick with your plain old boring training gear uh no i think i'm gonna go with my custom look thanks guys oh just a heads up i wouldn't get all worked up about this pc showcase since the gm's are really only coming to scout me that's not what i've heard who are you going to face anyway i'm taking on the mascot i'll dominate him and show the gm's what they've been missing out on wait so you're not even facing one of the visiting superstars sounds like someone is scared to lose in front of the gm's it's called being smart and putting myself in the best position to succeed maybe you should try it sometime but good luck getting a contract with whatever half-baked decision you made i am so jacked for this pc showcase i had a dream last night that i beat paragon and was signed by mandy rose to raw man the dream got crazy but we don't need to get into that you beating paragon and getting signed to raw wasn't the crazy part oh no way man i can do this i step up my game when the pressure's on and besides all i need is one shot well i admire your confidence and i hope it works out that way maybe we'll end up on the same show that'd be sweet could even ride together live together work out together eat together i know we could do a lot of things together all right well good luck in your match i'm gonna go buy a new suit to impress the gm's specifically mandy rose if our real-life connection is anything like it was in my dream there's gonna be fireworks when we meet not literally like pyro or anything i mean like the romantic kind yeah i get it chase good luck with all that [Music] ugh oh ah [Music] yep one two three i've heard a lot about you and you didn't disappoint with your win over drew mcintyre today with that being said i'd like to offer you the opportunity to sign with nxt this is a big decision and i need to think it over that's fine but you don't have a lot of time where your options and get back to me i wasn't planning on making any acquisitions today but after what you did against drew mcintyre i'm impressed so i want to offer you the best opportunity you're going to get a chance to sign with raw i've always wanted to compete on monday nights so i accept your offer that's it you're not even gonna ask about your pay i already did my negotiating in the ring fair enough we'll send you the paperwork don't make me regret this you're looking at the blue brand's newest superstar took longer than it should have but finally i'm gonna show the wwe universe what the rest of the world already knows when it comes to wrestling i am the paragon good for you i'm gonna do the same thing on raw but without the lame attitude and nickname wait you got signed to raw yeah uh did you not see me beat one of their top superstars no i did i just thought they would recognize it was a total fluke like i did but i guess every brand needs curtain jerkers i'm really gonna miss you hey i heard you're going to raw congrats thanks i saw you talking to regal he make you an offer yeah and i'm going to take it i think it's a great fit for my style and i'll be able to compete for the cruiserweight championship but maybe we'll cross paths again sometime in the future never say never around here that's right buenas verde heard you got signed congrats thanks what's the matter with you what's the matter you and hector and paragon all got signed but no one wanted me and now i'm stuck here while you guys are all moving on to bigger and better things comparing yourself to us isn't going to help your time will come trust me you just need to take a hard look in the mirror and see what you can change to capitalize on the next opportunity that comes along that's good advice but what if it wasn't anything that i did wrong what if someone in wwe doesn't want me to succeed what if i'm being held down i think you've been spending too much time on social media there are no conspiracy theories in play here all right but that is exactly what you would say if there was one chase keep your head up and continue to work hard i gotta go clean up my locker that's not code is it like you're not trying to tell me there's a conspiracy theory against me that i'm being locked down wink twice if i'm on to something chase congrats on getting signed to raw i think you're gonna do big things there thanks for saying that especially since we haven't always seen eye to eye it's hard for me to see eye to eye with anyone these days that's a joke but nonetheless this is always a proud day for us but just remember don't slip up and embarrass me or the other coaches okay so basically don't do anything you would have done when you were starting out in wwe exactly good luck kid i'll be watching it's the arrival of the newest edition of monday nights gm mandy rose and the wwe universe are lucky to have this superstar on monday night raw i know he's accomplished a lot in other places but let's see how he does here on the red brand then we'll talk i had a crazy dream i turned on a classic movie after raw ended and when i fell asleep my brain was a whirlwind of wicked witches scarecrows and tin men fighting all my favorite wwe superstars got me thinking about tornado tag team matches any chance you'd click your heels and make all my dreams come true [Applause] they are ready for a fight the following contest is a tornado tag team match and at a combined weight of 489 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke and our truth obviously this guy's in amazing condition and can handle a fight but will the no off-season 52-week fighting schedule of wwe play a factor he can hurt you so many ways but he has large boots to fill given the legacy of mma fighters in wwe [Applause] the entire wwe universe singing in unison what a beautiful chorus i think i'll join in don't stop please the wwe universe excited to see mr rood in action tonight [Applause] and their opponents first representing dirty dogs from toronto ontario canada weighing in at 235 pounds [Applause] guys this dude looks like a million bucks that's an understatement call i think the robe alone is worth that much [Applause] you think about rude guys he lives large in and out of the rink does ever stop bragging about how talented is that he you gotta back it up and roo does just that it is undeniable that robert rood is a polished competitor more polished than the top of saxton's skull [Applause] [Applause] [Music] ah the dirtiest of dogs the showoff and one of the toughest veterans on the entire wwe roster and representing dirty dogs from hollywood florida weighing in at 218 pounds don't ziegler ziggler made it his personal mission to eliminate the complacency that plagues the wwe locker room month after month the preaching is the same dolph ziggler truly believes no one can hang on his level [Applause] he's truly a top dog no doubt about that it's going to be hard to keep an eye on all the action as things begin to get hectic in the ring will these teams be able to adapt to the rules style points won't matter here the team coming in looking for a knock down drag out fight has the right attitude he got whipped into that corner fended off wow a perfectly placed punch oh not perfect it was glorious he's got it oh [Applause] tough position to be caught in here debilitating elbow drop [Applause] oh that'll break his arm vicious oh my goodness yeah that's an attitude behind it this has got to be it cover here oh i thought it was over but again can we please get some control saw that one coming oh he retaliates oh [Applause] he let it go [Applause] and this is [Applause] and it's our truth finishing this one off for the team this team was totally in sync attacking in perfect unison like they were reading each other's minds so the following contest is a fatal four-way match making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke so much of his training at the performance center revolved around developing a multi-dimensional offense for any type of situation sean michael's worked extensively to improve his catch his cash can skills oh this is gonna be first from huntington beach california weighing in at 282 pounds a man who lives his life wanting to prove to the world that he's the baddest man around yeah joe always promises a beating of the highest order you better be careful saxton if you're not joe might also take your seat at the commentary table that's what i call an upgrade [Applause] half man half amazing but all business he's the founder of the herd business [Applause] and representing the hurt business from miami florida weighing in at 259 pounds [Applause] who can forget that mvp once held the united states championship for 343 days which at the time was a record [Applause] after a tough upbringing nine years spent locked up mvp is living proof you don't let past failures define you because now all he does is win [Applause] alberto carrillo is here and from monterrey mexico weighing in at 109 pounds a lot of people have questioned just how far umberto carrillo can go but he assured me that he is as confident as he has ever been he's in perhaps the best physical condition of his life he knows what it takes to reach the top here in wwe [Applause] this fatal four-way match will determine who will challenge tommaso champa for his u.s championship of all four competitors champion must be hoping to get his hands on the superstar that's been pushing his buttons on social media first things first that big talking superstar will have to handle his business against three other superstars who are just as hungry to contend for champions time no he left him down curious decision there michael [Applause] oh targeting the leg there he's looking to completely render this leg useless stomp puller leg snap very up [Applause] really just laying it in [Applause] he's ejected from the ring and he's taking this to the outside now coming back in the ring well scouted by um finds the advantage after a streak directly to the chest and there's the breakup just in the nick what's gonna happen here nice breaker [Applause] oh [Applause] i can't believe it this is it and he breaks up the pinfall let's keep fighting [Applause] oh direct impact to the chest nice side analog apply this is ridiculous this is insulting this is entertaining final cut perfectly executed big punch finds its mark the snapmare springboard up [Applause] he had it scouted nice breakers [Applause] he's looking completely lost as he finds his footing okay he's re-entering the ring what's coming next what a counter from joe oh this is not going to end well drop down able to give him just in time [Applause] is still bringing the fight yeah here is your winner sub zero scorpion what an incredible we the following contest is an extreme rules match it is for the wwe united states championship one of the signature superstars in nxt history the self-proclaimed greatest sports entertainer in history no matter what you think about him you can't deny champ is as tough as they come yeah we've seen champa recover from not one but two career threatening injuries not only that but he recovered ahead of schedule and came back in the best shape of his life the worst place to be is across the ring from a motivated tommaso champa this is a man who decided a long time ago that there were no links he wouldn't go to for success because champa knows his career could end at any time and wants to make his mark and ensure his place in history doesn't wait for his moment he takes it for himself [Applause] introducing the challenger from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke and introducing the champion from milwaukee wisconsin weighing in at 201 pounds he is the wwe united states champion tomasso champa this is all for the highly decorated united states championship harley race the inaugural champion truly a tough man's title tommaso champa has overcome more physical setbacks than almost any other superstar in wwe and tonight he'll have to overcome his greatest challenge yet to defend his u.s championship the challenger has been targeting champions on social media and tonight they'll target them inside the wing and one of wwe's most grueling matches two fearless superstars willing to push their bodies to the limit for a title this is what monday night raw is all about ow jeez [Applause] the wwe universe pouring more fuel on his fire right now he's begging him to get up so he could put him back down okay already we get it stop looking for adulation for the crowd and get back into the fight re-entering the ring now [Applause] wards off that move by champa oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet a flurry of brutality [Applause] producing perfectly what do you have executed do to put this guy away oh my gosh [Applause] punches i can't believe it tommaso champa has been dethroned and now it's time for him to say goodbye to his precious stripey maybe he doesn't want to he doesn't seem too happy about it but apparently champa is ready to accept this loss obviously he wasn't ready to accept this loss oh my god what's he doing those steel steps i think we've seen this before in champa's epic battles with johnny gargano oh no fairy tale ending on the steel stairs the new united states champion could be severely injured yeah he came crashing down face and rib first on those unforgiving steps and would you look at that champa isn't going to part ways with stripey after all he's leaving with the united states championship just all around disgraceful actions that we've witnessed here tonight in any event stay tuned for updates on the new champions condition here's an update not good [Applause] i just saw your post you're stripping me of the title i just won yeah cause i just saw your x-rays and you're going to be out for over a month which is a month without the u.s championship being defended on raw i have no other choice you never wanted me to beat champa all you care about is keeping his record-breaking reign going for the brand and ratings that's my job to care about that stuff besides we wouldn't be having this conversation if you weren't soft that's what you called champa right he attacked me after the match you know the match where i beat him look you can go to the performance center rehab your injury then come back at full strength and you'll most likely have a rematch waiting for you most likely a lot can happen in six weeks the alternative is you face champa for the championship next week while gasping for air with a chest full of broken ribs most likely lose and then maybe never get a shot again but either way the title's returning to someone who can defend it immediately at 100 percent so what do you want to do i don't care what you champa or anyone else says about being soft i'm not going to risk my career for one match i'll be back for my us title when i'm 100 percent all right i'll let the pc know you're coming oh um [Applause] one two three uh ah yep oh one two wow one two three so you [Music] [Applause] now [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] uh [Applause] huh one ah oh one two three [Applause] foreign [Applause] the following contest is a ladder match and is for the wwe united states championship [Applause] it's been a long road to this rematch between tommaso champa and his opponent but here we are with the united states championship literally hanging in the balance after weeks of uncertainty stripey is only one ladder match away from finding a proper home injuries have been front and center in this robbery so far but both of these superstars are finally ready to prove whose full strength is stronger strong pull oh [Applause] damaged [Applause] getting dismantled here champa has to weather a storm here that's one way to use the ladder he's setting up the ladder now looks like to me he's got it in the right spot michael oh wow big uppercut [Applause] heads out and he has all the time he wants [Applause] quick return to the ring getting that ladder set up nicely right in the center of the ring michael striking while the iron is hot it is all or nothing at this point this is insane look at this he's taking it to him up there oh this is such a dangerous position he is fixing to take it off here i'd be shocked if this is it making the climb here maybe looking continuing yeah let's see how long that lasts nobody in this building thinks the match can end here i think so go home firm control we've already seen a few shots delivered up in that region [Applause] and now he's standing it right up in the middle of the ring right where it needs to be look at this snatch of victory here guys i think it's gonna happen looking unhooked looking for the win here we go come on just a few steps he better work quickly here and cola win here would be so incredibly huge they got it new champ what a moment here is your winner and the new wwe united states champion sub zero scorpion smoke [Applause] [Applause] the following contest is a six-man battle royal and his fourth the wwe united states championship introducing the champion from new york weighing in at 269 pounds he is the wwe united states champion [Applause] remember guys the title is on the line here in this one and i don't remember the last time the champ was in this much jeopardy cole tonight might just be the night the title changes hands as far as title defenses go this is about as big as it gets he needs to be on his game tonight prepare for the arrival of the most vicious most vile most violent competitor introducing the challenger from huntington beach california weighing in at 282 pounds a man who lives his life wanting to prove to the world that he's the baddest man around and joe always promises a beating of the highest order you better be careful saxton if you're not joe might also take your seat at the commentary table byron sacks and this man is a true testament to selfishness [Applause] manny rose wasn't lying when she said this would be a unique [Applause] has a nice ring to it doesn't it every one of these superstars wants to walk out of this ring tonight as the best let's find out who can actually pull it up [Applause] [Music] i think he's still got a chance here [Applause] fantastic awareness from [Applause] he's returning oh chicken wings oh nasty stuff to finish it off hits him with the counter [Applause] knee straight to the back and this might not have a pleasant ending [Applause] ridiculous standing shooting start oh did you hear that job [Applause] mvp has been eliminated has been eliminated [Applause] and the electricity of this moment is coursing through his veins so much for that guess that wasn't quite the opportune moment [Applause] flipping the script down in there ricochet got set up here ricocheting eliminated the united states champion persevered through an extremely difficult challenge tonight to walk away victorious yeah after surviving that match you have to wonder if there's any obstacle he can't overcome it's dope singler zig-zag what the heck what was that all about just when it looked like the united states champion had no more obstacles to clear now he has the show-off standing in his way dolph ziggler is a former united states champion himself this is only speculation but maybe he was upset he was left out of the match tonight that could be but nonetheless the champion now appears to have a significant problem on his hands let's hear what our united states champion has to say before his title defense you all saw what happened last week when dolph ziggler attacked me after the u.s champions battle royal i guess he was a little upset he wasn't included in feeling overlooked in general so i promised dolph that i come out here tonight and recognize some of the amazing moments from his career so let's start at the beginning where dolph proved he was special from day one debuting in wwe as a preppy looking golf caddy how could anyone ever overlook that not wanting to become too big of a star too fast dolph then decided to become a male cheerleader he truly was a show-off of both versatility and spirit after those two scents were so overwhelmingly successful dolph again didn't want to outshine his fellow superstars so he decided to go back to developmental to come up with another amazing persona and give back to future superstars after this hiatus dolph would return and continue to annoy i mean entertain the wwe universe for the past decade and a half even trying his hand at stand-up comedy in front of as many as 20 to 30 people speaking of jokes i think that's about enough of that now i'm gonna tell you the truth about dolph ziggler he's not given the credit he thinks he deserves because he has no identity a caddy a cheerleader a stand-up comedian how can he be recognized if he can't even recognize himself but here's the thing i know who i am and that's the united states champion who will kick anyone's ass who gets in my way so dolph after i'm through with my match tonight she won't be overlooked you'll just be next strong words from the united states champion he'll defend his title coming up next [Applause] this is all for the right to call yourself the united states champion to put yourself in the echelon of john cena ricky steamboat steve austin some of the greats of all time over 40 plus years of history for the united states championship and a new chapter is written tonight he is delivering elbow after elbow and it's reverse pain for that mistake oh foot just stomping down oh check out this power this is ridiculous dominance powers for him here we go you run down ziggler like the u.s champion did and you're gonna pay where is he though or you pay in the form of mind games either way it's effective [Applause] climbing up to the top now oh my god great awareness from ricochet sequence of reversals there avoiding contact absolutely spiked ddt measured kick to the vertebrae oh solid contact there he avoids the damage hoisted driver the challenger not

advice to our united states champion [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] just one step ahead he switches it back around [Applause] the challenger eating up some damage samoan dropped byron [Applause] connects to the back of the neck [Applause] it's not over yet plenty left to go in this one ziggler now lacking any signs of resistance dolph's having trouble assessing the situation you

performance center the news got fans of mma and wwe talking now we see what all the talk was about gentlemen we are about to experience something phenomenal here's a man who can do it all and has done it all in short order here in wwe may be the greatest in-ring competitor of this generation and his opponent from gainesville georgia weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] styles entering the ring about to deliver a clinic [Applause] gentlemen you were looking at a man who was sick of the doubters sick of being questioned about his potential and i can't disagree with him i expect tonight to be a night where he can silence the skeptics and prove to be the future of this company it will there are nasty intentions that still need to be delivered big kick what a double axe handle strong kick my goodness samoan drop byron i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last and that would force a stop to styles for the moment he had to be prepared to take some damage tonight incredible and stiles is taking a lot of offense now but aj can't let his flourish derailing stomping away that'll send a shock down your spine finds it styles a step ahead great job refocusing the reverse though a well-timed dodge reversal on top of reversal that's gotta be it there's two shoulder of after two how in the world did he kick out two count [Applause] zero me so this superstar looks determined tonight whoa from behind they're gonna settle this right now bell rings and we are off in this no disqualification match the rules are out the window we're about to see how badly these combatants dislike each other anything and everything is legal this is where all the aggression finally comes out blue thunderbolt this has got to be it first one missed second one didn't effective oh man oh my gosh oh with authority truth gets out of the way big time spinebuster good lead to a big-time win he skirts around it ah the reversal by r truth a counter answered by another counter able to avoid any harm there off the crate hit the mark with that one [Music] he fends off the attack spiked oh my gosh what impact dodged right on cue oh man look at this it's like

hoisted up boom fish it's no secret that i have a soft spot for the more mean-spirited competitors on the roster it's actually my birthday next week as a special treat wondering if you could take out one of raw's more honorable superstars in a no dq match i swear i won't tell anyone it's for me when it's no disqualification that means the competitor can be attacked and will and it's all this is when you see just how sadistic a competitor can truly be and that makes for a frightening scene it's anything goes you have to do whatever it takes to survive this situation there's no limit to what someone will do if they are unleashed without restriction he's locked him up powerful [Applause] he's heading back to the ring boom kick gets caught he's rummaging for some sort of equalizer underneath the ring [Applause] just thrown away comes back into the ring fishing for something beneath the ring settling on the kendo stick no good can come from this how's that for a counter great reversal right to the chest he's feeling the effects of that last hit he planned for this it could still rally oh my down with authority sharp elbows to the body looking to fight his way out [Applause] boom it's okay they weren't that pretty anyway heads out of the ring what's next oh boy come on not the chair placing them into the corner [Applause] dawkins attack gets reversed implanted by the ddt it's a recipe these are dangerous attacks on their own but now the damage is exponentially multiplied so many dangerous attacks one after the other making it difficult to regain any composure dawkins was ready there and dawkins is really being knocked around here yeah dawkins needs to find a way to right the ship here of lethal strikes duck is with the reversal stops the kick he thinks he has it fights and now he's controlling the pace of this one yeah he is being steadfast in his approach oh [Music] what a gutsy performance oh that got turned around on dawkins the victory tonight [Applause] that was an impressive match all around and here is our winner this is the product of hard work and in-ring adaptability he's got all the tools and he put them to use tonight me um so [Music] hey did you get my texts i did and the voicemails and the dms i was almost expecting a handwritten letter to show up in the mail if that would help greenlight the wcw reunion show then i'd do it look i heard you already have rey mysterio on board and obviously he can still go but what about the other former wcw guys who aren't really active anymore okay so what if i bring in another former wcw star and have a match against them on raw to prove to you this can work okay fine i'll be watching but if i'm not impressed then then it's off no more texts dms or letters deal i promise you won't be disappointed and here he comes the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 [Applause] his lightning fast striking ability and his strength are what sets him apart from his competitors those skills are going to be put to the test like never before wwe is its own animal he's a two-time hall of famer ready to make a little noise ladies and gentlemen we've got a two-sweet treat for you one of your favorite wwe superstars faces off against a two-time hall of famer from dx the nwo i couldn't believe it when i heard xbox was back tonight well the man looks like he's in the best shape of his life i wouldn't want to face x-pock back in his wcw days and i sure as hell wouldn't want a piece of him out on x-puck can he take advantage oh god that's devastating those mounted little punches oh a nasty stomp to finish it off kicks to the lower back clutching the wrist [Applause] just absolutely punishing their opponent here [Applause] and finds a counter expected that one sidewalk slam almost drove him through the ring he couldn't make much of that pin attempt oh god [Applause] getting him into the corner and he's able to counter samoan dropped byron [Applause] strike elusiveness just mounted with punches oh a nasty stop to finish it off down with the samoan drop x-puck had it scouted he's stalking his opponent from the top turnbuckle here we go catches nothing but him that this is getting intense someone check on saxton xbox looks powerless to every attack the xbox has to find a way to right the ship here [Applause] what an emphatic victory guys no contest never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about oh oh this should be very interesting all week long you've heard about a huge announcement i'd be making tonight and now the time has finally come you might be able to guess what it is based on the men who are gathered in this ring and those giant steel letters but let's make it official in the very near future there's going to be a special one night tribute show to the men and women of world championship wrestling and it's going to be called wcw one night nitro that's right raw is now where the big boys play i just want to say it's truly an honor to be a part of helping put all this together and i can't wait to pay tribute to the legends in this ring and many more who influenced my career now with that being said i'd like to huge news of the announcement of wcw one night nitro but apparently aj styles has something to say about it whatever it is it must be urgent sorry to crash the big party but i just wanted to say i'd love to be a part of this reunion show too apparently you forgot i spent a few months in wcw before it went out of business no slide intended i was actually planning on reaching out to you just wanted to make sure we saved room on the car for some of the more well-known wcw stars well known huh i i mean well known in wcw not in general like you said you were only there for a few months but i'm sure we can work this out let's talk more later all right yeah sounds good i'll let you get back to it as you can see this show is so big that everyone wants to be a part of it now stay tuned to the wcw hotline just kidding stay tuned to social media for more information on wcw one night nitro we never thought we'd see this moment wcw will return for one night only [Applause] aj styles with the chair shot he's not waiting to talk about this later aj styles clearly felt disrespected tonight and now he's taking it out on all the wcw legends and down goes booker t kevin nash can't stop aj either mysterio off the top and styles dumps ray to the outside okay maybe this will be a fair fight guess not aj setting up for the styles clash [Applause] this was supposed to be a moment to celebrate the legends of wcw but aj styles did everything in his power to ruin that just pathetic in my opinion this seems to be about more than just being excluded from the event there's something else going on here [Applause] and one more disgraceful act to close out an all-around shameful night for aj styles [Applause] all week long i've been getting messages on social media why aj why did you take out the wcw legends why'd you ruin one night nitro well here's the answer at first i was slightly offended i wasn't considered for the show after all like i said i was an actual wrestler there unlike the super fan wannabe putting it all together who never stepped foot in a wcw ring more on him in a second but then the more i thought about it i didn't want to be a part of bringing back and honoring the egotistical greedy dinosaurs who slept walked through their matches just to collect a fat paycheck putting the company out of business and nearly killing my career before it ever got started in fact it was so bad down there when they first offered me a contract i turned it down and took a job delivering water because it paid more because all these so-called legends were flying around in private jets with their guaranteed contracts wrestling four times a year and there was no money left to pay guys who actually wanted to be there ultimately i ended up going to wcw for three months and it was way worse than i thought it would be every decision from the top guys was made to hold back the younger more talented wrestlers like me finally it all caught up to them and the company folded i had to go back to the indies and work my butt off to make it to where i am today but i'm the exception most of the younger wcw guys from that era like my old tag team partner they never made it so that's how i remember wcw not as this company that beat wwe for a short time or part of this over glorified golden era of wrestling but a sinking ship that almost took down aj styles with it so that's why i did what i did i shut down the embarrassing tribute show before it ever happened and i do it again 500 times so let's circle back to the guy who started all this you were just a fan when all that with wcw went down you had no idea what really happened but in my eyes that almost makes you worse than the so-called legends you put on a pedestal you're supposedly a wwe superstar now so act like it this isn't your time to play fantasy wcw it's embarrassing so you want to talk about destroying me for what i did remember wcw already tried that and they failed so i'm gonna do a favor for every man and woman in that locker room who has any actual respect for what we do and destroy you challenge accepted [Applause] i've been looking forward to this one the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke this superstar had some success in mma but never reached the top of the mountain he said it was due to politics wwe's the land of opportunity so there'll be no excuses here sink or swim pal the man who attempted to bring you one night nitro gets his chance for a pitch against aj styles who crashed his party last week what a disgraceful display from the phenomenal one but that's what we've come to expect from aj styles see i think aj styles must have learned something from his old job delivering h2o because he poured a bucket of cold water on the wcw reunion show and every legend who thinks they can waltz back into the ring whenever they want there's repercussions for that like this match tonight each competitor showing they've done their homework the damage he's taken is starting to pile off it's nothing he hasn't been through before [Applause] oh that got turned around on styles [Applause] oh hard impact in the corner this is what you call high risk high reward to the sky the oh is he attempting a styles clash it's finn balor what's he doing here it seems balor's attempting to help out his former club partner he's certainly got everyone's attention aj styles has a chair and the referee has no idea neither does his opponent it's kevin nash we haven't seen nation styles took out the wcw legends a few weeks back this is his chance for payback kevin nash just turned on his friend i can't believe this is happening and now aj taking advantage he's gonna do it he hits this and it's done [Applause] one two and he's all over thanks to the interference from finn balor and the shocking actions of kevin nash this is unbelievable [Applause] what exactly is the relationship between these three i'm not sure if fowler and stiles even know [Applause] there's your answer it looks like we've just witnessed the birth of some kind of new nwo slash club type alliance this is bad news for wwe oh i agree nothing good can come from this this [Music] you
