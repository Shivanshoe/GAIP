a battle raged at the end of the first tournament the forces of earth realm were facing the greatest challenge [Music] huh [Music] look at y'all [Applause] wow [Applause] come here [Music] academy [Music] ah you won your first mortal kombat tournament earth has been spared but shang tsung is a poor loser this is goro's lair it is one of shang tsung's traps you must find your way off the island before it crumbles into the sea make your way to the wushi academy [Music] behind you yes up here [Music] this is the way off the island it is another of shang tsung's servants [Music] [Music] next [Music] um [Music] [Music] oh long ago in the magic realm of outworld shao khan hungered for power for strength for all things dark and arcane the blood he spilled in his brutal conquest of outworld is impossible to measure or imagine as was his hunger once all he could see was under his control shao khan turned his attention to earth but the elder gods had created a mystical tournament to protect earth known as mortal combat xiao khan could only lay claim to earth if his champions were victorious in the tournament thus far earth's warriors have triumphed saving earth but some fights only require a lone victory and all can be lost with a single defeat you have ensured peace for earth once again this day but there is no power in these metals apart from the knowledge you must carry into every battle that no one is a champion alone if one of us is in chains none of us are free if even one succeeds the victory is ours lou kang you have defeated the sorcerer shangsung you have saved this realm as your forefathers did from his evil you are earthrealms champion and hero thank you master aidan when next the tournament is fought it will be my ancestors that are honored sonja blade you were a warrior before the tournament began but here you have been tested and triumphed against enemies beyond earth's measure thank you master raiden i know you have your chief officers to report to but know that you will always have friends here and warriors willing to help you in your future missions sir johnny cage lay it on me raiden bow you idiot despite your natural shortcomings you have proven yourself a valuable ally against shang tsung you have the respect of myself and the shaolin order [Music] master family honor is not won in a single day it is one all the days of a life it is one in fidelity and faithfulness it is achieved through perseverance there is not a warrior here that would have survived if you had not warned them of the traps in goro's lair your family has been honored your friends honor you as well for the moment you have earned rest enjoy the peace you will find walking these grounds [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] these outworld abominations are poison to our world even their blood and rotting bones are like an ass into this realm you must send them back to where they came from defend the academy [Music] us no not again this isn't right we defeated you [Music] uh keep them off me while i close the front gate [Music] [Music] keep moving needs your help you defy the elder gods you are violating the rules of mortal combat you traitor [Music] well done [Music] they took sonya and killed i don't know how many monks should my family feel honored now [Music] huh do you trust me listen to my words as you continue your exercises for you will need to remember them later zhang tsung is not as defeated as we had hoped i faced him while you fought the attacking mutants more i believe he now defies the elder gods themselves baraka could not have come with a legion of mutant scum had shang not been aiding him with his defeat in the mortal kombat tournament he will be anxious to prove himself superior to you and take his vengeance this will make him reckless and more dangerous than ever [Applause] i had hoped you would have time to heal your wounds in the tournament but i was gravely mistaken you must go to outworld we must take the battle there if we are to save earth i am weary after the tournament but rest is a luxury afforded only to the dead of course i will go to outworld and what of you kung lao what do you say of course take the portal to outworld the portal to outworld there may be a warning warning all magic carries warnings koblau we must be cautious but isn't this shang tsung's magic how can we trust his warnings i know how shang thinks i will not have as much power in outworld but here i have the power to make the way safe if i had let you enter before you would have been pulled inside out this is what i can offer you in the conflict to come [Music] listen if i am to die here then it will be for the honor of my family very well i believe that i will be of great assistance to liu kane after all your magics are too limited in our world that is correct kung lao but i can still give you my knowledge of this place i will try to hide my presence from shang tsung i dare not attract his attention and therefore endanger you and should you encounter sonja blade in this realm be cautious this place changes even the most honorable of warriors come mortals come face the princess of outworld and die i believe your presence here is still a mystery to shang tsung but you cannot defeat him alone there is an ally here who may be of aid to you her name is katana kitana she is a native of outworld and a powerful ally against those who threaten earth can we trust anyone who comes from this place you said that if we this realm was not always as you see it now it was once a place of indescribable beauty and purity this world was corrupted by secret evil alliances be careful that the same does not happen to you you must guard your heart sometimes even from your allies yes follow little one follow me to damnation try to keep up mortal do not be late to your own funeral you're beautiful who are you i am kitana the loyal daughter of xiao khan the eternal emperor of outworld and you are enemies of this realm and therefore my enemies isn't she supposed to be helping us [Music] this is not over mortal she is under a holding spell she is being controlled you must release her from the spell and set her free wow [Music] [Music] uh huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] finally i am free but quickly the others will not let me go without a fight oh here let me help you thank you who are you i am lou kang i come from earth realm this is kung lao we are here to stop shang tsung from attacking earth shang it is not shang tsung that wants earth not shang tsung uh you better take a look at this one of them is dead the other is only stunned jake you killed her she was my best friend and you killed her don't touch me i should destroy you for killing jade she tried to kill us i'm sorry you were under a spell of some sort you were trying to kill us where am i how did i get here maybe this one can explain and do not look under the veil let me go explain yourself jade was my kitana's best friend until jade was forced by shao khan to hunt her down and bring her back to him we were given a spell to control her shao khan isn't that your father i do not blame you for this jade i blame the man that forces me to call him father the one who killed my true father and stole his throne i blame shao khan for what he did to my mother what is it i am remembering a lot now where's reptile who reptile if molina is here so is reptile they are inseparable i am certain that they have both been charged with hunting me down [Music] i cannot let her escape wait there is more to this than we know raiden would tell us if there was you need to think more about what is happening and less about this girl you just rescued master raiden raiden kung lao liu kang i have discovered that shang tsung has somehow used the elder gods magic boundaries to make outworld vulnerable i do not understand you can weaken him by winning victories against shang tsung's assassins it means that your every battle here affects shang tsung's power directly you must fight until one of you is victorious it is the only way to save earth we will be in competition with each other then shang tsung's power will be divided between you that will make him vulnerable and incapable of attacking earth raiden who is shao khan where's katana he is not to be concerned with kitana is still regaining her memory and trying to understand the effects of the magic she was cursed with you two must concern yourselves with saving earth realm through the portals you will find more battles more ways to weaken shang tsung yes [Music] it is reptile we find him maybe we find your girlfriend katana is not my girlfriend she may help us remember so what do we do this is what raiden was talking about if we defeat reptile shanks soon will be that much weaker i will defeat reptile you can watch that is what raiden was talking about this place is enormous i'm still trying to make sense out of what katana told us do you see reptile no you check over there [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Applause] wow [Music] you killed reptile this is very good master why do you say that you are feeding the soul tombs this is all we hoped for how is this going to save earth realm i thought we were here to stop shang tsung i yes master raiden something is wrong yes but i am certain raiden will let us know when it is time master raiden i fear lukang that kung lao no matter how much he desires to serve his ancestors is becoming a liability to the tournament master rated it is this place evil spirits swim in the air searching for souls to nest in you are the mortal combat champion you will need to remember who you are if you are going to defeat shang tsung the soul tombs are a source of shang tsung's power you must destroy them i can trust only you you are the champion of mortal combat you alone are strong enough to resist the corruption of this realm yes master raiden [Music] um something is wrong i knew it trust your instincts kung lao trust what you know your ancestors will guide you the soul tombs are the source of shang tsung's power [Music] [Music] people of earth realm often ask what purpose does suffering serve here it serves a terrible and awful purpose when someone perishes here their soul and essence are collected and trapped in a place known as the soul tombs these tombs are a source of shang tsung's power the black dragon mercenaries came to rescue their leader kano but were swept up in shang tsung's manipulations just like we were master raiden shang tsung did not have the power to defeat you in earth realm but here here he hopes to reverse your victory in mortal combat and take earth realm after your defeat so shang tsung gets stronger every time we enter combat and even more powerful every time we win how do we fight that do we stop fighting stop killing no your journey must move forward but there is a repository of souls that adds to shang tsung's strength go and destroy this soul tomb and shang tsung will begin to lose his power shang tsung [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you waste my time your souls aren't even worthy additions to my power kill them hurry we have to destroy the soul tombs [Music] wow [Music] [Music] are you okay oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] i wish raiden would warn us if it is not helpies it is baraka we have done just as he suggested master raiden i see i think this place is getting to raiden look who is that me you have failed to win the mortal kombat tournament take your place as my servant i should have won you are a fool to defy honor utter is the very thing that is not you remember what raiden said they are our ancestors raiden said triumphs and failures i wonder what happened what was that all about i do not know but i get the feeling that this is something raiden wanted us to see i hope you are not telling me to trust in what i do not know again no we are part of an ancient mystery that is all i will not let you tell my father that he no longer controls me melina he is a monster everyone he touches becomes like you [Music] where is she going to the wasteland to seek help from goro the wasteland can help to do what to kill me you idiot and then to kill you why does she hate you so much she is my clone as long as i am alive it is as if she is not real a soulless husk if i die my soul and identity before the man that calls me daughter will become hers shao khan has spells that will allow her to claim my very existence then we have to stop molina before that can happen i knew you were going to say that what's up [Music] test your [Music] excellent go my thanks warriors we are here to stop shang tsung will you help us i'm sorry i can't my clan needs me and they must know that we have been betrayed by one of our own but know that i too am opposed to shang tsung and everything that is wrong in this place know that the enemy of your enemy is your friend thank you i love doing something for nothing do not be a fool kung lao nothing is done for no reason we are here to secure freedom for earth realm and for this realm as well you know what they say about a cold day in hell this is it whoever you are it matters little i have learned to call everyone [Music] why did you do that yes why did you do that sub-zero is dead he died after the mortal combat tournament raiden told us scorpion killed him so who are you the man you saw die was my brother and i am not even certain he is truly dead i came here to avenge him and believe that he may still yet live in one form or another i've been told that if i can find some vestige of his power i may find him why think everyone is an enemy everyone in this realm is an enemy even those that i once called friends and allies on earth now hunt me and want to kill me why have you come to the wasteland to rescue his girlfriend for the last time she is not my girlfriend we are here to stop shang tsung there's a warrior named kitana an ally she is in danger from her clone molina and a creature known as goro i know of goro they say he cannot be beaten in combat still he has not faced me your friend this ally does not stand a chance against him i see now that i may have been wrong about you you could have killed me and you did not i heard the red dragon clan speak about another prisoner they had do you think they might have been talking about katana if they have her you will need to go further into the wasteland and cross the sea of blood the souls of those who die here are put to other purposes the bodies are added to this lake of damnation how do we cross it there is an old boat near here i could repair it for you i will take you there and face goro [Music] [Music] our destination the exit must be up top we need to get there somehow [Music] [Music] scorpion he killed my brother i cannot go with you now if our paths cross again or i find goro i will keep my oath [Music] you cannot help me go scorpion has escaped to the nether realm [Music] god like he was never here at all [Music] i know that voice it is goro wasn't so soon i'm supposed to take care of this [Applause] [Music] [Music] you should have let me take down goro i am the mortal kombat champion i'm earth realms champion what what i think you had better start doing what i tell you do you have any idea what you are talking about only what raiden should have told you a long time ago you should not turn your back on me cool nice try shang tsung i am not so certain i want you anywhere near me that is exactly what shang tsung desires listen shang tsung is trying to turn us against each other back in the academy he was impersonating me he can morph into anyone he wants i didn't know was shang tsung at the time i tried to warn you and then i realized if someone could look like me he could look like either of you two as well so i followed you through the portal and waited and watched so how long was shang posing as lou kang i think it was when we were separated while fighting goro i suppose that means we still have to rescue katana a girl is she hot you will find katana elsewhere i have something else for johnny cage to do follow me [Music] shang tsung's defeat is close but there is one more defense you will need to stop him you will find this key to shang tsung's defeat in the nether realm the entry to that realm is at the [Music] portals [Music] how is it that we can enter and survive in another realm i thought only evil or tainted souls could enter this one what do you think has happened to your souls every time you have killed while on your quest your souls have become tainted you must be strong enough to not let that control you you know raiden should not be able to do that what i thought he could not use magic in this world who's that [Music] don't take another step or i'll stop you myself [Music] sub-zero what happened to scorpion i thought you were after him i was scorpion is still here but i will not allow you to face noobs saibot noob cybot for all we know this could be shang tsung he is trying to keep us from getting the key to save earth do not worry he does not serve shang tsung he is possessed by one of the elder gods there is more here than just shang tsung's attempt to invade earth realm the gods are involved how do you know noob saibot is not part of this because i i think he is my brother if you want to stop shang tsung defeat scorpion where is he the nether realm is infinite in size but scorpion will find you if you are here in this realm if your brother is possessed how can you help him he will most likely try to kill you again i will find a way to free him that could take a long time as long as it takes finding scorpion should not be as hard he wants to kill you [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] um [Music] ah uh oh you have all you will need to defeat shang tsung and save earth realm there is a portal there that will take you to a place where shang will be at his most vulnerable i am uncertain about kung lao he seems different strange johnny cage told me that shang tsung was impersonating him do you think he is now masquerading as kung lao i had not considered that possibility be on your guard that is all there is a door that would lead you to the foundry you must find it to defeat shang tsung your attacks are quick [Music] [Music] oh a gun that is not going to do you much good here or against me it's you kung lap raiden told me you'd be here soon raiden he's been guiding me through this place i've been sent to rescue agent sonia blade sonia blade is here that's what raiden says you know i'm better than me how long have you been here i don't know time is different in israel it feels like weeks and raiden has been with you the entire time pretty much he says he has little power here the best he can do is see pieces of the future and act as a guy i have to keep going i've been sent from earth to rescue sonia i am concerned about raiden liu kang i am not certain we can trust him raiden was right this is not kung lao this is shang this is my chance i will not be fooled again shang tsung what [Applause] listen to me you were not to fight each other shang tsung has deluded you he has been tricking you into feeding him soul after soul you have been empowering him he has been masqueraded raiden master you insult me flee i am shao khan i will be your death follow if you want to defeat shang tsung follow me if you want to diet my hands [Applause] damn now world tech haven't they ever heard of ball bearings [Music] sonia you're gonna be okay i'll get you out of here not so fast grunt she's my prize you're not going nowhere with it you just messed up big time buddy [Music] oh [Applause] man kano was tougher than he looked thanks guys yeah thanks although i nearly had everything under control it was my honor to be of help to you yes it was no problem for us but now we must go and face khan listen i wish we could stay and help but i've got to get her back to base for treatment you fight with honor and you care for your friends i could not ask for more than that go in peace hey look us up when you get back to earth realm come on girl let's get you home girl you're lucky i can't take you down right here if i can't stay to help maybe this will come in handy what happened to raiden silence [Music] your presence here is unwanted uninvited but like all who come to this realm you serve me whether you are aware of it or not no we do not where is our master raiden ah your master you know his voice so well yet know him almost not at all your master is here he wants to see you he has another lesson for you master aidan the [Applause] he is possessed shao khan is controlling him whatever hold shao khan has on you master fight it thank you thank you for serving me so well [Music] to be myself again it is only right that this victory be mine and mine alone we destroyed your soul tombs you should not be this strong is that what your master raiden told you to do [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] as i said all within this realm serve my will even those that seek to betray me i do not understand impersonated your master raiden and led you on a quest for power the more you killed the more powerful he became he meant to use this power against me to become the supreme ruler of outworld now what am i to do with you my people have spoken and a king must if only once every millennium or so listen to the will of his people [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] huh oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] there is something in you that makes me feel like a conqueror again our friends where are our friends you can earn their freedom defeat me and they will be freed [Applause] how can we defeat you [Music] the elder gods will help you we have saved our friends the ones you captured your plans [Applause] easily is cool it's about time [Applause] [Music]

luke hang over me what's wrong with this picture maybe i have time to find that clone of her somebody mentioned did i really free my ancestors this was the plan of the elder gods koblau this was the reason you were allowed to follow the enemy's plots what the enemy means for evil a greater force will always turn for good you have freed the past and future well done champion of mortal combat
