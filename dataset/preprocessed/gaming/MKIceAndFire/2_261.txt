you all right there drax i am pondering that question and that makes total sense after what happened with nikki and that twisted promise having to watch the people we love die all over again my family did not simply die they were murdered by thanos i think i do not wish to discuss it what are you looking at oh no you ain't chewing through any more of my ship my ship shoot flock off wow that panel must have looked really tasty what's it for anyways emergency door controls for the ship something a ship owner should know hey do i look like an engineer you don't hey rocket you got a minute do i get a raise for this just browsing huh all right let's go i really hope this isn't a bomb hey don't touch that turn it the wrong way and it could blow seriously you're so gullible quill it ain't gonna blow i mean its core is definitely volatile as scut and could melt a hole through the floor if an idiot decided to take it apart but it's practically harmless just need some extra repulsion coils to manage the flaw in the photonic phase capacitor but will it damage the ship probably not you really go bananas for this stuff don't you what the flark is a banana it's this yellow fruit on earth that looks like it never mind the point is you're clearly obsessed with this stuff hey i ain't obsessed tech just makes sense okay there's order to it makes me feel calm that and it doesn't rip you off like some filthy biologicals i've known how are you not obsessed with tech look at this place your room is wow i mean wow what's wrong with my room you don't even have a bed i got a bed it's buried under junk i prefer to call it a soft shelf i just don't know how any of this could make you feel calm i feel stressed just looking at it and that's coming from me if groot didn't do the laundry i'd probably never have clean clothes like i said tech makes sense why do you care so much i don't know because you're such a perfectionist i ain't a perfectionist the lead scientist on half world rakmar he oh he was a perfectionist a horrible free bag and scutthrin and flark flark and son of a cog what did he do to you oh what any self-disrespecting scientist does started a super soldier program except instead of using one of their precious blue skins they decided to experiment on us animals lesser life forms but it wasn't enough that he ripped us apart and jammed us full of cybernetic implants oh no he'd make us perform tasks over and over and over oh like lab rats and if we flocked up if it wasn't exactly right or up to his flark and standards he'd chalk us into unconsciousness holy crap rocket i it is what it is quill root says fixing stuff is my way to make the memory of that stressed feeling go away make me feel in control again when i get overwhelmed i don't know he's probably right you got grifted laugh it up star pants i mean that's terrible who was it a chick really i didn't even know you like girls she wasn't just any girl she was a chick one of them voldai bird people she uh she sounds super special her name was tella and she wasn't just special she made me feel special like i wasn't some freak show science experiment she bought me a drink she didn't even flinch at my implants i just escaped half world and i fell for her hard we've all been there buddy half the girls i've dated have tried to kill me you should see the scars except i didn't know no better i thought tella was my friend and then one day she convinces me to hack a ship for her you know kid stuff wasn't even nothing in it for me i just wanted to impress her yep definitely been there reminds me of this one time with avrel nexian we uh you mind anyways i hacked the ship all right i hacked it to scut the next thing i know i'm surrounded by a bunch of badoon thugs turns out they own the ship while they focused on me she took off in the ship that i hacked for her she left me there quill like i was trash that's the day i learned to think twice before trusting biologicals they're not all like root groot really is the first one to treat you right isn't he he's my family you're lucky to have found each other especially after everything and then some i hope you'll see us as family one day too peter we need to gamora hey is that galactic war commendation yeah i rescued it from her office i was planning to give it back to her until no one could have predicted that carell was dead or that nicki would be the matriarch or that she might be my kid that too she's gonna have questions and i don't even know where to begin how did your mom hook up why weren't you around did you even want me i've become my dad you want to practice on me answering her questions carell never told me about nikki she had a chance to tell me three years ago when she didn't what happened you have to promise not to judge me too harshly i can't promise that i love judging people fine carell maybe kind of caught me with a kidnapped 12 year old girl yeah i can see why carell wouldn't have mentioned nicki it's not like that i didn't kidnap the kid yondu did i told him it was wrong that we had to give her back and he disagreed so i stole the milano and i was trying to return her when corel just happened to intercept me look after the galactic war ended corel and i went our separate ways i rejoined the ravages and she joined the nova corps it's not like we had a future together when she caught me with the kid when i saw the disappointment in her face i knew i had to turn over a new leaf even if it meant turning in yondu you're the reason yondu is in the kiln no wonder there's a bounty on your earth name he must have been pissed yep but i do it all over again what gets me is that corel had plenty of chances to tell me about nikki and she didn't if i had known maybe the important things that you know now i already told nikki some of the story but not all of it what was i supposed to say hey kid i hooked up with your mom i might be your dad maybe not that i mean it was war i was with the ravagers hitting shitari supply chains you know pirate stuff none of us had any long-term plans beyond survival especially not kids hell i only met corel because i heard earth was in shattari's crosshairs mercury yeah remember richard ryder established an outpost on the planet's surface an undermanned undergunned and horribly outnumbered outpost that didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell when the chitauri launched a sneak attack obviously i had to do something nikki would understand that i think it was so close gamora by the time i convinced yondu to help the outpost had fallen we thought we were too late so when corell and her squad came out of those caves she was just so badass her forces had been through the ringer but she wasn't about to give up mercury without a fight that definitely sounds like the crowd i remember i tried to convince yondu to stay and help retake the outpost but he saw no profit in dying so i stayed instead we spent hours strategizing together often late into the night it took three days to come up with a attack and even then it was risky we thought we were gonna die but you didn't no we didn't and now now i have to figure out how to tell my estranged kid her mother's dead anyway until we get nikki back we've got bigger fish to fry this stuff can wait true but when you are ready to talk about it just be honest with her the rest will fall into place yeah you're probably right [Music] deadliest woman in the galaxy a misnomer an accurate misnomer i see you have discovered my criminal record uh yeah i guess i couldn't help myself i mean it's your rap sheet i suppose that it is impressive to criminals reformed criminals as in past tense were legit now remember i do not think we share the same definition of legitimate okay fair maybe not but still guy who kills thanos ends up in the most infamous prison in the galaxy it's gotta be one hell of a story which part would you like to hear peter quill how i allegedly killed the mad titan or are you enamored by my stay in the kiln thanos obviously i mean it's the mad titan he was supposed to be untouchable and bam player two is joined just how'd you do it how'd you take thanos down with sorcery come on really really after thanos murdered my family rage filled my heart in my search for revenge i found mentor you mean a mentor right no mentor is his name and his brother cronus sorceress they gave me a sleeping potion that would grant my greatest desire finding and killing thanos you're messing with me i am not when i awoke i was changed i could sense the mad titan's vile life force feel it pulsating from across the galaxy uh wow that's uh i know how it sounds peter quill and i believe that you believe this happened it's just it's pretty out there even for space stuff regardless i followed the pulse in my mind until it led me to a moon in the black quadrant and there i found thanos hiding like a coward our battle waged for days each of us trading blows across the moon's inhospitable surface equal and strength equal in our resolve to see the other dead once and for all and then you delivered the final blow i recall throwing a final swing before i collapsed from exhaustion when i awoke i was in a hospital on atlantis many rotations had passed and i was being hailed as a hero for killing thanos allegedly the very fibers of my being say otherwise i can still feel him out there i have no doubt in my heart that he survived just as i did what was it like in the kiln you would not have survived a cycle why i maybe know someone there then pray they died quickly yikes it's really that bad worse however after the chaos i wrought in my misguided quest for revenge it was a well-deserved punishment right the rampage that is one way to describe it after my battle with thanos i became convinced that he still drew breath i demanded proof but when none was provided i convinced myself that others were concealing his location i saw his hideous visage in every shadow and murdered anyone i thought was hiding him some of which were very bad dudes perhaps this is not my place to judge so how'd they stop you novacor i mean you're drax the destroyer there's not a bounty hunter alive who could have taken you down i surrendered what why i had succumbed to madness and become the very thing that i hope to vanquish once i realized that i could not live with the monster that i had become well the important thing is that you're here now with us man we're not going back to prison anytime soon that remains to be seen one whole arm that's what 10 percent of raker down and i say we leave the other 90 alone can't say i ain't glad i get to dissect this little marvel but that's as close as i'm getting to this flark and cult ever again what is wrong with you we have to go back sure we're heroes but there's a limit hey dude how are you feeling busy it's okay it's just the two of us in here we all saw a pretty messed up skutt in that promised thing i'm fine quill there ain't nothing some cree kid can promise that won't make my skin crawl okay but what did you see was it lila doesn't matter i knew it was fake soon as she got into my head oh so swirly is that even a plant i wonder where group picked up that one according to this the collector reported groot stolen 14 years ago can we help you oh hey rocket group sup what are you doing snooping through groot's skutt quill well maybe you should mine whoa whoa whoa whoa guys groot i didn't mean to invade your space seriously i would never do that i was just curious about this report thingy i found yeah the report thingy that just so happens to bring up a lot of painful memories for groot real smooth quill it's not fine the collector kept you in a freaking cage like some some kind of animal as if it weren't bad enough you lost your entire planet [Music] fine groot says i'll answer your stupid questions how did you end up with the collector in the first place how do you think he stole groot [Music] fine you tell it [Music] he says the collector found him at the start of the war in the wreckage of his planet holy crap but just a piece a splinter the rest got destroyed like everyone else just a splinter does this mean you can't die [Music] he can still die but he ain't gonna cause i ain't gonna let him i'll replant you a million times if i gotta so how'd the collector find you a drone found him dormant in space guess old pivon scours the galaxy for new specimens [Music] slavery ain't the same as saban he insists the collector saved him by planting him and also keeping him in a das cage until i stole him hence the stupid flarkin report is it still active the report will the collector come collecting you see any gold domes around lately fair enough what happened to your homeworld you never told me that what did he say he says the shitari blew it up with a an experimental doomsday device holy crap that's awful ain't the worst part quill groot says after planet x was blown up the other branch worlds mobilized but they weren't no match for the chatari and also got destroyed as far as he knows he's the last of his kind oh groot i'm sorry i don't know what i'd do if earth was destroyed if i was the last human he says it's not so bad he's got us i know we don't talk a lot group for you know obvious reasons [Music] but i can't imagine this team without you i can't change the past but i can't commit to making the future better he says he knows and he's grateful one day we'll find the right language package hey gamora go away peter come on just thought i'd check in that was some pretty heavy stuff you said earlier want to talk about it i don't need a pep talk okay all right no talking let's sing it out who's the hunter who's the game you feel the beat call your name come on i know you know this one i hold you close in victory i don't want to tame your animal style you won't be caged in the call of the wild come on sing it shooting at the walls of shooting at the walls of heartache bang bang i am [Music] see just singing all right i like that one gets me every time what did you want to talk about want to talk about the guy whose arm you just ripped off there's nothing to talk about you chopped his arm off and that's all i did he's still out there with nikki manipulating her with a slick lies and fluffed up promises making everybody think we can't bring them back who did you see in your promise got a feeling it wasn't thanos no one nothing it was just a lie which is why we need to stop it right i'm working on that just try not to slash the cargo bay in half could you move can't exactly complete a routine if you're walking about in case it wasn't clear you're in the way [Music] i need space could you just take a few steps back peter make room anything yet guardian of galaxies cosmo buddy where have you been we've been calling you sorry peter quill cosmo's buzz been tied universal church of truth arrive at nowhere are you okay he's fine for a moment cosmo receive warning in time but continuum cortex is of shutdown for safety it's been dead your little detective trip almost got us killed we'll fill you in when we get there this problem is bigger than cosmo guardian of galaxies must go to xandar and ask world mind for help instead cosmo unable to get through [Music] cosmo are you there what happened are we under attack so these are the cowards who defile lady hellbender's honor oh good who the flock are you normally i would not engage in conversation with inferior life forms but my contract with lady hellbender stipulates otherwise therefore abomination you may refer to me by my title i am captain glory leader of the legal legion a lethal legion uh more like loser legion he surrounded us listen i get that lady hellbender's super pissed but now's really not the best time did you think that she would ease her bounty simply because you somehow managed to elude the blood brothers in nowhere yes then you were as imbecillic as they are lady hellbender sends a regard so-called guardians of the galaxy prepare to be eliminated no you prepare to be eliminated smooth [Music] yeah we got this probably [Music] take them hard and give no quarter there is nothing got a piece of that guy these ships ain't dying fast enough fools facing the legion try i never back off finish them [Music] you don't even know how to fly here one is all we need that don't even make sense we just wasted a ton of you who's the inferior life form now huh still you peter i'm picking up something what it appears i'll have to finish this myself so you defeated my fighters my cruiser will crush that's it that's what you've been bragging about what do you mean i'm sure it's very comfortable then do something about it that did some real damage keep hitting his exhaust ports your strategy won't work thanks you just confirmed that it will this guy's starting to sound like rocket it's called language deficiency quote [Music] definitely felt it starting to feel like we pissed off the whole galaxy a good chunk of them anyway i really need to work on our pr keep up the barrage they will not survive stay still yeah i don't think the scrap sacks care if the galaxy's undersea you know contractors we're contractors points we just tried to dump them [Music] take that lady skull i doubt we've seen the last one we'll worry about lady hellbender later let's just focus on getting to zandar punch it yep old girl needs a tune-up we can do it once we reach the station i ain't letting no bucket head near my wow talk about cosmic gridlock i haven't seen this many ships around zandar since the start of the galactic war open channel group let's see what's going on these ships come from converted worlds they're refugees you need immediate talking permission please answer us groot that's enough i don't see any rescue shuttles coming out they're ignoring them no no no no no nova core might be a bunch of self-righteous dome heads but they're they're supposed to be helping folk that's their whole flark and deal relax rocket we'll just call the station and ask to speak to the world mind groot welcome to novacore headquarters please state your preferred language i know bud but now we can all follow along with star pants mistakes how may we assist you we should report what breaker is up to think the flark in world mind doesn't already know maybe not every just pick something peter how about future crime thank you for being proactive however the galaxy's impending doom makes all future crimes irrelevant i can't believe this option doesn't work this is the core they should be helping i suggest the officers directory certainly the world mine will be listed there we should tell them about the promise right as if none of these other ships ain't already blasting about it all over the comms due to the imminent determination of civilization we are unable to open designation or serial number richard ryder this strategy is futile ah come on muscle brain it might work or artificial installation of origin someplace earth i continue to doubt this strategy yeah maybe it won't work look at this it's hilarious nope no touching looks like the best ai in the world couldn't parse that it's a voice [Music] all right so that was fun but a complete waste of time any other ideas that ain't the okay of resources for direct communication with us has been denied we apologize for the inconvenience well it was worth a shot let's try something else hey wolberry got any ideas scroll down scroll down hey your cop girlfriend is still listed here gold's communication privileges are suspended while we investigate her involvement in unsanctioned culture activity you should force your spawn to answer us this menu again scroll back up i think i saw someone interesting centurion corel personal me too does that say nova prime any idea which one who even you seriously don't know who he is i have yet to meet a tarrant of any interest peter i think everyone here is too busy or dead to answer perhaps we should try another menu common day is heard of him he was in the resistance so much for near perfect algorithms helpline huh doesn't say which one why even list them then hey isn't this that buckethead we killed on the rock we definitely did not murder him and definitely did not admit it in front of an overcore console rocket if you pick prequel i'm gonna gnaw your ears off what are you doing star pants i agree with the rodent your language choice makes no strategic sense root says you should pick the top option says you should hurry up little help groot miss reddit uh ignore groot just pick things at random until it works quill only one application per cycle this is pointless and slow go back and change the language peter not letting you do that quill what do you mean the past crime button looks lonely do you think turning ourselves in would get their attention to banking services i can't believe that worked gardeners of the galaxy explain yourselves hey world mind long time no see it's me peter quill star-lord and uh it's guardians of the galaxy check the addendum we need your help to pay a fine no no of course not you need to save the galaxy cannot be saved peter quill what [Music] [Music] outposts [Music] of course she don't mention contraxia they actually the world mind is collected consciousness look we know who's behind the promise we've seen it happening up close and personal we're here to pass on information to you so you can stop it can we be more clear the universal church of truth cannot be stopped told you they're collected it is a machine yeah well so are parts of me and you better not call me in it at least abomination sounds scary look we just escaped the church's mothership we have a ton of intel you can use to bring them down there is nothing you can tell us we do not already know pretty sure i know a few things that even a supercomputer can't know such as well how to groom the feathers on a shia warbird for starters are you still alive because i know how to groom the feathers yeah well i know where you can buy hack nova core helmets at ridiculously discounted prices what they obviously don't know about it or they do something the point is we've lived things experienced things we've survived the promise and maybe our experience can be used to help you bring them down it is possible we have overlooked the value of individual and experiential memories stored within our files good so let's pull resources of such a query taking a search protocol at this you're running away what about the refugees you're just gonna leave them defenseless our primary directive is the preservation of zandarian culture all else is secondary have you seen what your planet looks like zendarian culture is a lost cause culture is more than a location and yet after the shotari attack you still build the news and are in the same system knowing it wasn't safe at the time were numerous practical reasons to remain within the trans system unfortunately but you're novacor's leader you have a duty to protect this galaxy that is incorrect you ain't the leader of the bucketheads we do not have a duty to protect this galaxy we merely police it to get involved knowledge of potential threats serve and protect only yourselves a logical byproduct of our primary directive we have officers all over the galaxy laying down their lives for you and you won't even risk fighting for their sake the risk is too great it would be a pointless sacrifice [Music] nonsensical so you're just gonna let the church win if the power source cannot be quantified it cannot be countered most sentient beings don't have the luxury of calculating their odds before getting into a fight drax he's as dumb as a stick and he ain't failed so far don't you control the nova force the magical energy that powers novacore it is not magical but yes then how do you explain that one because to an outsider doesn't seem logical at all thanos used to say it was generated by the living computers of xandar the living computers of zangdar oh it exists because we exist and we exist therefore it does sounds like you're able to harness your collective energy just like breaker with other people's faith maybe the way you do it can tell you how the church does perhaps you have given us new data to consider guardians of the galaxy without considering all available options a complete search of our data banks only unfortunately he perished in the last year of the galactic war great so no one we are pleased you reached the same conclusion we did it appears that our travel ain't helped us then you won't help us now what are you kidding me groot says the florkin helpline's still asking for fine money [Music] all right let's get this over with confirm payment oh what whole universe is about the end and you spend our cash from the nova corp fine look dude the church is about to come for all of us once that disabler goes off we'll be sitting ducks all right at least we got that sorted let's get out of here peter we've got movement they're taking off [Music] well well i see it son of a smack [Music] accepting the promise we got it jump quilt i know angel's promise is becoming real peter gotta get clear first come on and go [Music] scott whoa what the [ __ ] did you do i don't know why have we stopped the loser legion must have hit something when they ambushed guys it's only a matter of time before the galaxy accepts the promise sacrosanct is back there we can't just sit here and how are we gonna do that we're dead in the [ __ ] water all right freely accepted oh yeah and without an engine we're screwing these guys guys guys enough to stop already i can't hear myself think rock can fix the engines how am i supposed to do that i can't even run a diagon i don't care just fix it scoff and what are we supposed to do i don't know okay i can't just conjure up answers every two seconds fine don't i just can't do this right now i need some rest screw noble core shouldn't have counted on them in the first place [Music] tracks i uh i do not wish to talk fair enough we're all pretty spent just try to get some rest if you can look it's our great leader hey here to yell at me some more what no i really don't feel like small talk cute forgot your toast hey crew do you remember if i left the sensor notes on standby earlier because i told you about it i said screw remind me that something comes from the sensor notes yeah i remembered most of it but i'm missing the middle part ah i should have written it down i should probably learn a second language at some point like french hey groot what's that stuff you're drinking [Music] looks like herbal tea but not sure about the smell what kind of tea is that good one uh maybe you can show me oh god really i cannot tell if that's cannibalism know what i think i'll pass on the leaf juice but i'm glad to see you've got everything under control at least one of us does speak for yourself hey growt did you ever find the pack of slacking clamps i lost [Music] why would i check the leaf undersides i swear laura you all right in there look we're all frustrated we did what we could with the world mind but they weren't even listening it doesn't matter they had their minds made up they were being kind of scut mm-hmm i mean i did nothing wrong i was just asking them to do their job how about doing your job my job have you seen the size of that church ship what am i supposed to do guess you and the world might aren't so different what maybe it's because i had a tyrant for a dad but i'm used to people in charge not being afraid to get scut done the heck hey muscle head did you ever run that weapon system analysis you wanted to do drax you hear me not feeling well ain't no excuse to ignore me [Music] do look really [Music] i'm gonna get fleas come on girl shoot shoot [Music] what the f that's how you got in screw it and the bed smells great [Music] [Music] what is this how are you me come on the talking raccoon's waiting for you everybody

wanted to let you sleep can you believe it oh how long was i out long enough to fly us all the way to the quarantine zone wait how do we fly out here quill do you want to fix your ship or not my ship yes your ship come on the others are outside is everyone outside already yep waiting for us there let's go look who stumbled out of bed [Music] the rodents made decisions in your sleep yeah yeah i know took you long enough what nikki [Music] you're not supposed to be here you promised you would get me out of here i know but mickey [Music] won't have to tell me twice it's too [Music] get going drags [Music] we can't keep running away from we have to face our fears guys i'm sorry i know what to do yes you do you do we have to face our fears leave me alone why are you chasing me we can't keep running away from our problems [Music] wake you talked about this man you gotta stop your illegitimate child was correct peter quill hovak and cameron will be restored uh yeah okay we just need to have faith [Music] uh drax you're kind of freaking me out man i had to share the good news peter quill you have lost your family your mother the cree woman you understand the pain that comes from loss drax with faith with the matriarch's promise our families can be restored i i drax i don't [Music] you have accepted her promise have you not peter quill [Music] i totally accepted it i am super stoked to see my mom again and rejoin your daughter yes right right my my daughter [Music] i knew he would see the truth of her light pitique yep uh truth and light dead not dead my daughter it's all super great this pleases me [Music] however i am less certain of the others the wooden one may come around but i suspect the assassin and the rodent will resist this makes them a dangerous element to our cause i must eliminate them wait why [Music] because that's murder man if you kill them then they can't accept the promise the matriarch will bring them back along with everyone else that is our promise right right she'll she'll bring them back i just thought you were trying to turn a new leaf [Music] i do not have foliage i'm just saying think of the example you're setting for commeria [Music] the matriarch's promise requires uncompromising faith something you would understand if you had truly accepted it the track drax i swear choose well peter quill we've landed on the matrix planet when i return she will demand your answer wait tracks we can talk about this crap please let there be calms please let there be calms also please be okay oh god what if drax no stop you can't think like that they're probably fine i just need to make sure somehow hello anyone peter is there a reason why muscles locked me in my room yeah drax may have kind of joined the church seriously great i know it's it's super messed up drax jax is kind of messed up he also may have landed us on soccer sag to find the matriarch but don't worry i may have an idea the llama thing's been chewing through my wall cammy did it has a name point is maybe it's a way to get out if i can just squeeze through and get to the cockpit you can release the locks bingo okay i'm out are you inside of drugs not yet you know what i'm actually glad this happened why why because i flark and told you guys that thing would shoot everything but did you listen oh no can't listen to rocket he just fixes everything so wait are you happy can we chew to hold through the wall or not no but also maybe if it means we get out of this it's locked peter it was worth a try oh so guess who gets to fix the bulkheads when all this is done assuming we don't die first we owe you one done meet me in the rec room [ __ ] waiting for we gotta ditch this mud ball before green and crazy shows up with his new pal the cortacan matriarch rocket stop we can't just abandon drax is he even still drax i mean he's been converted i know he says we need to find him and pull him back from the dark side you're talking about kidnapping drax the destroyer emphasis on destroyer and we've come too far seen too much awful stuff to abandon one of our friends drax is still our friend that ain't our friend no more [Music]
