sir shield intercepted a somewhat bizarre exchange on an old aim frequency i have seen much that mortals would deem bizarre listen for yourself the prototype device is ready my lord you have done well loyal one that's that's my voice gather the woken and we will begin what trickery is this jarvis what can you tell us that the communication originated in scandinavia i have no records about any woken this cannot go unchallenged we leave immediately we need to find out who these woken are and what their prototype device does and let us not forget the one impersonating me poorly i thought they were rather accurate they were not so you're not flattered well i think there's a lot more going on here than identity theft the message originated from this forest records show there's a decommissioned aim base here and yet the buildings remain that's not aim protocol they usually strip it clean the mystery deepens i begin to suspect aim never left this place i'm not so sure this doesn't feel like their m.o either way let's get to where that call came from aim has arrived [Music] the call's origin point is not far destroy the false god i am the one truthful i don't think these woken can be reasoned with sir your defeat was yeah i wonder how many woken are present i suspect many likely bewitched the call's origin point is not far what is that twisted monument dedicated to me okay let's check it out carefully a trap looks like it jarvis i'll scan the monument and get answered why don't you guys take a break avengers charges it's which is why we read it as the source of the call indeed it's linked to a nearby structure that just started emitting strange energy readings then our mission is clear surely our imposter in this machine lie within let's check it out the structure is sealed but i should be able to bypass the main door controls can appear familiar to you as well yes either they're part of aim or some kind of radical offshoot there is a chest with gear close by the strange power readings are growing stronger which is probably a bad thing roger that now is the time yep look for a chest with gear nearby [Music] this cult was clearly part of aim before diverging from their core tenet of science above all else they do not stand a chance look for a chest containing special resources nearby [Music] [Music] this is it surprised oh there's the entrance another trap destroying the nearby transformers should bypass the security systems and allow us access [Music] oh all right come on that felt good farewell i made some trouble here hey guys not doing so good nice only two more to go [Music] yes [Music] battle in tears the last one i'm beaming with pride [Music] the door is open who dares force entry to our holy shrine skeleton it is i the true god of thunder face me then and let your lie be exposed welcome interlopers uh thor this is pretty weird and annoying face me in battle deceiver and we shall see who is worthy of the name thor oh my worshippers faith is not in question woken hear me the false god comes destroy him foreign fight me charlatan i would not sully mjolnir with your blood face instead my understudy we shall destroy your automaton farewell oh [Music] uh you got lucky but i've covered our track you'll never find us i'll take that bet i pity in league with an imposter [Music] you okay big guy this false thor vows his followers or join him in asgard should they truly seek to open a way a disaster can result this woman helen gable spoke of documents i must find them digital records are unlikely to exist i must try the name of thor has been used to show lies i will put an end to it you will die in the intent you're gonna want to hear this thor jarvis play the message certainly miss romanov where did this happen a remote forest region in eastern norway sir i asked shield to see what they could dig up about our least favorite asgard worshiping cult and the charlatan posing is me those agents are in trouble because they were following a lead our lead they shall be saved in odin's name i swear [Music] anything that can knock a quinjet out of the sky is wmd level which makes the woken a major threat perhaps their weapon is connected to the machine they were attempting to build when we last encountered them if i may sir the first clash with the woken somewhat disturbed you so keep your head on straight you truly think i would shirk my duty no but i think this hits close to home for you and a smart enemy will try to exploit that sir i've established contact with the stranded shield team avengers our luck just ran out there's a lot of movement in the forest the woken are here better get to them before it's too late they're alive let's do this wow clean that up uh all i do is win win win in yes [Music] nice work looks clear for now [Music] i'm finally into the flight recorder looks like the quinjet was hit by a massive burst of multi-spectrum energy originating from a site nearby i believe i know what the wokens seek to do if i am right the entire world is in terrible danger it's not a weapon at all is it our shield friends got too close to what a test of some kind i believe the woken wish to open a path to asgard but mortal machinery cannot control such forces we must destroy their device it sounds as if the woken are tampering with powers beyond their understanding reminds me a little of tony for all his fault something is not right woken forces inbound damn it's an ambush why don't you guys take a break this is it truck long enough you need only open the bridge to claim your place among the gods the imposter appears once more you poor fools don't listen to his lies you were right about the bridge damn it i believe master odinson is referring to the by frost without the power of hindu their device will tear apart the very fabric of reality and it's even worse than i thought we must move now the fate of the universe hangs in the balance there is a chest with gear close by what's in it uh uh foreign powering it attacked me secret weapons glory of oscars yes if you truly worship asgard then hear me i am thor odinson stop this madness i don't think they heard you the false god appears as was foretold do not be fooled curfew uh [Music] aah destroy him do not allow him to disrupt the bridge they're getting mad that's a good sign taking them on gotta get something off my chest thank you it is done sir their bridge is no more imposter show yourself if you claim to speak for me where are you now you have gone unchallenged too long know this i am thor god of thunder and your evil will darken midgard no more brother [Music] are still a threat just because they failed this time doesn't mean they won't try again i am to blame i thought i could lay down the hammer but in my absence this evil took root well we did save the universe so i'm glad you came back as am i brave natasha as am i [Music] you
