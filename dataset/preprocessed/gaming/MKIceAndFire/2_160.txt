guy who killed uncle ben is gone you'd think that would bring me some peace but i don't feel peaceful not even close so [Music] foreign police confirmed tonight that there is a serial killer on the loose one with the unique twist he hunts other killers his latest victim is dennis carradine a convicted murderer and arms dealer carradine has been identified as the perpetrator in last year's shooting of queen's resident benjamin parker some new yorkers we spoke to applaud the fact that violent criminals are being taken off the streets hey somebody wants to clean up the trash i say more power to them but police caution that the perpetrator is a threat to everyone this individual is a dangerous psychopath he commits acts of extreme carnage and brutality leaving the initials ck written in blood as a signature the crime scenes are so gruesome they shock even veteran officers due to the letters and the horrific nature of the crimes authorities are calling this man the carnage killer anyone with information should call the police immediately this is whitney chang for the daily bugle news network horrible but at least it's finally over the man who took ben from us won't ever hurt anyone again maybe now we can move on peter what's the matter aunt may the truth is i'm glad he's dead i know that's wrong you're relieved a bad man can't hurt anyone else that's different you're glad a murderer was brought to justice there's nothing wrong with that i know it's just i part of you wishes you're the one who did the bringing to justice that's not what ben would have wanted he wanted you to work hard graduate go to college all the things you did wherever he is he's very proud of you and so am i i wish for bad things to happen to this carroting guy a lot that's perfectly natural he killed your uncle yeah but peter parker it's bad enough you feel guilty about ben i won't let you beat yourself up over this why would it be your fault did you kill that man no he was a criminal he associated with awful people it's not as if you had any control over that well what could you have done so you feel better my husband's still gone i think that'll hurt forever you said you thought maybe we could move on yes uh now that there isn't that question hanging over us where is he why don't they catch him now we can look ahead but it's not like being happy we'll be happy again peter i promise you you heard whitney chang some people are grateful to the carnage killer i kind of know how they feel that's not the same as condoning it you're not glad this carnage person is out there murdering are you you want him taken off the streets don't you yes yeah i do and he will be aunt may can you turn that up we have breaking news of a hostage situation at oscorp armed men are holding

without a trace of irony i'll remember this during the fight just how bored i am don't hold your breath a shake for breakfast a shake for lunch and a sensible smack upside the head for dinner i you can't lock me up man the russians can get to me inside you might be able to make a deal with d.a harper for protective custody if you help stop this gang war innocent people are getting caught up in it i can't it's bigger than me now all the gangs in the city are at war everyone's scared of everyone else the russians got here at almost the same time you did i know one of my guys must have dropped a dime now that your future looks let's go with limited what'll they do keep arming up take out what's left of my men and everybody else in town they're ruthless i promise you by the time they're done you'll wish you had herman schultz back so you broke in here for a power up absolutely guns won't do it anymore everybody wants an ace that the others don't have the kind of fighter power that you can fight an army with and i bet they don't care who gets caught in a crossfire that's why they call them bad guys what are all you tough guys so afraid of the carnage killer he's murdering my people huh the the russians hammerhead's crew mr negatives men everyone thinks the other guys are paying him i'm starting to worry he's some kind of freak like that giant lizard a while back or that dude with all the the robots so as long as he's out there killing the gang war goes on and it gets worse unless you want to go for a butt whipping hat trick you'll tell the cops everything you know about the gang war okay but it won't do any good look the city's full of trigger-happy wise guys scared the carnage killer's gonna get him that's one fire that's just gonna keep on spreading huh you know as much as i made fun of these things they're pretty clever if i could get this kind of kinetic energy into my webbing now who's the thief huh [Music] you know ozcorp but you might not know me i'm harry osborne when my father died he didn't just leave me a business he left me a new york institution but too often lately both ozcorp and this city have been preyed on by criminals now today i'm announcing a joint venture with a man who like me recently returned to the city where he was born and wants to help wilson fisk [Applause] new york made me the man i am now i want to give something back it was my privilege to rebuild this great city after recent crisis but that was just the start allow me to introduce you to the enhanced now the police are doing a fine job with limited resources but when they face threats outside their normal scope they need more rather than increase the burden on taxpayers mr fisk and i are financing this hand-picked task force ourselves vigilantes like spider-man only make the problem worse this is our city and we're taking it back together [Applause] still willing to take oscorp off your hands young man and my answer is still no well that's fine i'll just wait until you die of the disease that killed your father [Music] attention all task force personnel you are authorized to be in phase one of the suppression initiative repeat phase one of the suppression initiative [Music] now's a good time to take down some bad guys while the task force is putting heat on hmm that'll wake you up every second counts oh god don't let me die like this [Music] thank you i was broiling in there hey some sharp royals over here [Music] someone please help me anyone trapped in there doesn't have much time thank you i couldn't have lasted much longer [Music] the grateful survivors say no one but spider-man could have possibly reached them in time [Music] buckle up fasten your seat belts [Music] sometimes i fantasize about moving to hawaii but there'd be nothing to swing from i'm always awesome sometimes i'm extra awesome got drunk and pulled half the town [Music] business owner reports suspects disturbing the peace in this parking lot last chance cough it up or you're gonna pay in blood come on to you this one time i fought somebody who was a real loser and they were still better than you oh he snapped you're awake impressed i might just have a future at this i almost feel like a bullet [Music] business owners praised spider-man for improvement not just in crime rates but also in the local economy we have reports of fighting possibly gang related in central park southwest corner check it out dispatch said it was the southwest corner of the park i should be first on the scene just a few blocks that's the spider swings this is whitney chang with an editorial comment early polls on the oshawa fisk announcement show broad public support citizens are tired of the crime wave and have doubts about the mysterious figure known as spider-man despite all the good he's done so what else is new but i've obtained the records of the officers on the task force they show allegations of corruption and police brutality none of it proven but still are these the people we want to trust with this kind of power spider-man i'm out of here the spider kill him oh i know what's bothering you you think because i took down german schultz it means i like him more that's just not true he'll get the same up close and personal attention i promise now to find the one that got away [Music] hey wrapping up bad guys is my thing i can help you okay mr craven the hunter you got my attention we have shots fired at the bus station proceed with caution suspects heavily armed [Music] all units officers are under fire at the bus station need assistance immediately okay [Music] you're some daisy okay got it are you deliberately moving really slowly is this like some sort of mind thing spider-man i like impressive but you are still raw inexperienced i was experienced enough to beat your friends i am russian but i am no friend to those pigs my name is sergey kravenov men call me craven the hunter so you left me that note judging from the wet you're one of those crazy reality show guys who runs around naked in the woods eating bugs how can you help me i can make you a true hunter not just a boy pretending to be a man should you wish to accept you may find me here until we meet again why didn't you get me pictures from the fifth gods born press conference oh sorry mr jameson but i've got school you know life outside the job in my day your job was your life a press pass is waiting on you [Music] actually i just got an idea for using my press pass i've got to admit it would be nice not to feel like i'm fighting this battle on my own but it's craven's someone i can trust craven obviously doesn't know who i really am that would have come to my house i don't know i've always worked best alone but then again i've never tried it any other way if craven can teach me his hunting techniques i won't have to rely on police broadcasts to find okay don't be nervous you need information on craven and you've got a press pass to get it easy peasy never mind that if he finds out you're a photographer and not a reporter he'll have you stuffed and mounted [Music] uh mr cravenoff it's me peter parker from the daily bugle we spoke on the phone mr kravenoff [Laughter] i apologize for startling you i am craven please forgive my theatrics i merely wish to demonstrate my skills the videos online do that pretty well i saw you take down that siberian tiger with your bare hands without hurting it are endangered i simply relocated the beast for its own safety as well as that of the local villagers true hunters wish to conserve the natural world it is where we find peace you're a long way from the natural world i craved a new challenge i came here to hunt the monsters oscar created the cross species the deadliest combination of animal and human i ended their threat but i grew fond of your city and your city grew fond of me and i decided to stay except now you're hunting normal people no only criminals only those who prey on their fellow man have anything to fear from me this new task force is sending a pretty strong message no vigilantes ah i do not trust them they are paid for by fisk i am sure you've heard the rumors of his illegal activities sure everyone has but no one can prove it and the police seem okay with him because he has paid those who are corrupt the rest are desperate to avoid looking incompetent well the public is desperate for an end to the crime wave i have only one agenda to get results based on my experience the research the police aren't big fans of vigilantes the police had their chance to stop the crime wave they failed miserably i uh don't think they like being reminded of that i do not wish to insult them but it would be a far greater crime to have the power to help but refuse to act would you not agree yeah as a matter of fact i would is man really the most dangerous game in their own way yes but men are merely highly evolved animals the current crime wave provides fascinating opportunities to study them the patterns of the various factions and what are you finding out that criminals are not unlike beasts they have hunting grounds specific behaviors many traveling packs but there are differences such as animals spray on others for survival only human beings are willfully cruel so you're saying you feel a responsibility to use your power to help yes to have such power and not use it is to be unworthy of it uh well thanks i i think our readers will find this very interesting good good i must take this call but please look around take pictures of anything you wish yes no i said tranquilizer darts no i have no interest in automatic weapons they require no skill i am an artist pardon the interruption would you care to see my latest trophies cross species beautiful are they not i thought spider-man captured them an inadequate solution they escaped so you killed them to save the lives of their victims yes but also in self-defense they were deadly opponents i know i mean i can imagine when do you consider it okay to kill when there is no other choice i do not take life lightly but when it is necessary i do not hesitate if my failure to act cost the life of an innocent person i could not live with myself i know what you mean they all had superhuman powers how'd you beat them i have trained myself to the peak of human ability and learned many natural means of enhancement not drugs like the scum who pollute the streets but the secrets of native cultures herbs potions mysteries forgotten by so-called civilized man hunting criminals some people might wonder if you're the carnage killer he is no hunter but a brute a savage his very existence is offensive to men like myself so even though he's hunting criminals you'd like to take him down of course he dishonors what i do without honor peter the hunt means nothing last question is there anything you haven't accomplished yet ah yes i would like to leave a legacy when i am gone pass my training to a protege my only family his brother who and he chose a different path i never had a son but perhaps ah forgive me i am becoming melancholy as i get older so do you have what you need mr parker yeah i think i do [Music] whitney whitney should i be jealous who is this that's no way to talk to a lady or even me felicia this is the number i gave whitney chang how'd you get it the name's black cat as in cat burglar as in i get my hands on things i'm not supposed to how about you spider do you ever get your hands on things you're not supposed to i heard you were back in jail listen if you're calling to tease me about breaking out i'm insulted i can think of a lot more fun things to tease you about if you're smart you'll get out of town before i find the time to chase you funny that's what i was going to say to you things are getting dangerous around here spider why don't we chase each other out of town hmm i'm too busy to fool around with you i i mean play games with you bye felicia time to find out if craven can really teach me how to track these punks [Music] i knew you would come yeah well don't get any ideas about me being your sidekick but i'm on the trail of the carnage killer and tracking's a little out of my wheelhouse ah yes the killer i thought he might be you but i have watched you and i see that you are no mad man you spied on me only briefly there is much a hunter can learn from observation i see the way you carry yourself like a lost child but you lack someone to guide you to help you become a man i have no son of my own i do not want my legacy to die with me i can make you the ultimate hunter let us work together to to find this carnage killer and suppress the crime wave let us do together what we could not do alone i'm still gonna operate on my own of course as we lie but we will be there for each other when it is needed i sent you an address there is a back alley from which the russians move stolen oscar equipment to a safe house use the little fish to catch the big ones yeah i've heard that before it is tempting to catch the easiest play but in our case the most obvious criminals are the most inconsequential wait follow them see where they go i get that but i'm not gonna let anyone get hurt if i see these guys threatening someone's life they're going down [Music] [Music] prefer to keep a low profile but just as animals must visit a watering hole they must collect their money and pay those above them i'll give them this the way these guys hustle all over the city they're getting one heck of a cardio workout often the higher level criminals will lead you to legitimate businesses that serve as a front to launder the illegal income it is [Music] the track will be here soon get the package ready [Music] gotta get a photo of that crate of oscorp tech so i can trace it [Music] this crate is heavier than your mother if you drop that i'm not taking the blade for you quick get the crate loaded before someone sees us just what i needed that escort deck will go to their superiors do not lose sight of it i'll stick to it like well me got you can't lose that truck it's my ticket to the russian secret clubhouse i'm losing them gotta catch ups i'm always awesome sometimes i'm extra awesome can't let that truck out of my sight craven's tips are paying off i get the feeling there are a lot of bad guys in there i better keep a low profile i'm guessing this isn't a restaurant guide the carnage killer these must be all the places where he killed these guys friends a lot more than the police know about i know what craven would say a clearer picture of the predators hunting grounds [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh so this is where all the cool gangsters hang out [Music] [Music] he wants to fight us eh fine let's see if he has the stomach for it have you seen him she has the stomach for anything [Music] hey what happened to you [Music] down [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] friday night [Applause] what i could do with equipment like this harry won't mind if i borrow this for a little while [Music] you'll be dead before you see me move [Music] better go see what that was [Music] [Applause] people work around here [Music] [Music] how can anyone be that she fast dodges when she's got both feet off her lady how much coffee did you drink i'm gonna guess this was not a meeting of the wilson fisk fan club craven i'm sending you pictures the first one looks like a map of places the carnage killer struck ah yes good good the more we can learn of his habits the better next up is a flyer for an anti-crime fundraiser hosted by wilson fisk i think they're going to try and kill him even if fisk is crooked i can't let them do that especially with all those innocent people around the fundraiser is tonight they will have put their plan into action already you must go to the location and stop them just one problem i don't have an invitation i'm guessing you don't either then we must improvise i am too well known to bypass security but under your mask spider-man nobody knows who you are here's a hint i'm not rich enough to go to this then you will find a way i believe in you wouldn't mind chatting with fisk see what he knows about all this but i kind of have a feeling he's not the most approachable guy in the world none of it matters if i can't get inside wait i think i've got it with that fundraiser's level of security i can't use my press pass to bluff my way in unless i'm really supposed to be there photographer needs a reporter and i bet i know one who's already planning to go [Music] excuse me [Music] i say [Music] oh whitney uh thanks again for using me on this hey i get it college is expensive you want to make easy money taking boring pictures of wrinkly rich people go nuts but you should probably stay away from me let me guess you've got some pointed questions about the task force among other things i give it 10 minutes before i get kicked out hey harry pete oh man i i know we haven't seen each other much since we were kids but this doesn't seem like you're kind of seen society pages i'm a part-time photographer for the bugle smile great got it thanks fisk is putting a pretty big target on his back why do you think he does it he grew up in hell's kitchen lots of crime gangs i think this is his way of taking control standing up to the guys who bullied him when he was a kid but knowing fisk he's also got a plan in place to profit from it whitney chang says the cops on the task force are crooked too i just supply the tech fisk can pick the men but the police chief cleared them all the chief's desperate to stop the crime wave he's not going to argue with the guy who's helping him do that well one thing's for sure the task force is getting results and no one likes to mess with success hey i gotta ask why fisk i hear some pretty shady rumors about him he's the only one rich enough who is willing to work with me i've got i've got a lot on my plate i can't waste time worrying about people attacking oscorp and our public image could use a boost i'll tell you this though the rumors are true fisk is definitely into some illegal stuff but good luck proving it hey i gotta ask why fisk i hear some pretty shady rumors about him drinks gentlemen tick tick tick tick tick whoops sorry [Music] you know don't worry about it i gotta go anyways i've got uh important things to do [Music] me too [Music] something fishy about that guy better follow him i'll take that i can check that one off my list time to get into my work clothes [Music] no doorbell i guess i better get creative [Music] [Music] please what do you want from you nothing we just need your way to uniforms so we can serve fisk a special recipe what are you gonna do with this depends how much you bother me doesn't play favorites neither does the seismic blast i will make you bleed thank you i was so scared smack [Music] open sesame okay that didn't work on the plan b that's what i'm talking about just what i want [Music] you won't get me so easily spider [Music] don't feel bad you're not you're not all right you're not good good let's see what you can do gets left out when i use the seismic blast this is what everyone fears did your mom tell you you could be anything you want because she was wrong this is why they call me amazing [Music] well i saved fisk from the russians now to find out if i have to save anyone else from him everyone's got an angle that's what daddy always said so i know there's a catch but the offer the big guy made me it's too good to pass up a get out of jail free card money and best of all power real power the kind spider-man has i'll be playing in the majors at last that's the other thing daddy said in this world there are winners and losers this is my chance to be a winner the price doesn't matter i'm going to do [Music] it these people are movers and shakers i can learn a lot just by listening in so uh this is gonna sound like a bad pickup line but you seem really familiar have we met judging from your bargain basement suit i doubt we move in the same circles oh i get it born with a silver spoon in your mouth hardly for me silver's an taste well uh i'm here for the daily bugle so uh you know anything interesting about fisk i know he hangs out with rich older men and you're scaring him off so i'll have to say goodbye look me up when you move out of your mom's basement i don't live with my mom i live with my aunt well nice meeting you um my name's peter if you care i'm felicia but what [Music] well he knows how to make an entrance we're blotting out the sun time to talk to the big man himself [Music] hey back off uh should i tell whitney chang he has no comment on the russian mobsters tied up downstairs it's all right i like this young man's boldness he mustn't reveal that to anyone it would play into the criminals hands they want to make people afraid to support my anti-crime efforts but if no one knows what they did they'll get away with it and try again oh i assure you they will not get away with them meaning what exactly well the task force will get them of course we've been gathering intelligence on this organization for some time but no one's been able to stop them yet not the police not spider-man don't say that name to me spider-man he fancies himself a hero but he's let crime run rampant the police are bound by the laws of probable cause spider-man is not if he hasn't stopped this scum by now he's either incompetent or he simply doesn't care what's your beef with spider-man seems like you're after the same thing if spider-man is going to operate outside the law one would think he can accomplish things more expediently but he contends himself with apprehending purse snatchers he's a dilettante a thrill-seeker worse than useless still he does seem popular with children in fact i recently secured his likeness right you what how about this carnage killer is the task force chasing him we are interested in catching anyone who commits a crime but it's a lot harder to find one man than an entire gang of them and i bet the fact he's killing guys you don't like doesn't exactly bother you i do not condone murder of course but am i shedding tears for his victims no i am not intelligence huh find out anything interesting the russians are clever they operate in cells each knowing very little about the others when one group is taken down it rarely leads to further arrests but someone's got to be calling the shots well they do have a central base of operations but very few know where it is finding it will be another matter entirely it's this very ward that will be the end of the gangs the more they escalate the harder it becomes for them to hide wait are you saying the russians are still smuggling guns into the city don't put words in my mouth young man i'm just a backer i leave the crime fighting to train professionals not excuse me i have funds to raise yeah i've got uh important things to do too [Music] that map i found showed a lot of russian mob activity around a trucking company seems like the perfect cover for bringing weapons into the city i could stop that truck right now but i'd rather see where it's headed [Music] quick before those task force idiots see us relax we set the car on fire ten blocks away we're distracted by that so i haven't done this kind of heavy lifting in years me neither but there's a reason we've lasted this long not many of our soldiers even know about this place yeah here i guess everyone is a big shot is it true what they say about the killer is he one of the cross pieces i heard he is just a man if that's true [Music] i am telling you there is something demonic about anyone who could do that to a human being [Music] um [Music] [Applause] and boom goes the dynamite so [Music] uh who can resist that i lost three men to that carnage killer if someone doesn't get him soon patience misha i hear we are making progress [Music] sit back relax and enjoy being unconscious that's what i'm talking about [Music] clear everyone to me [Music] can we put forth this week spider slam i'm still experimenting with catchphrases what do you think okay this wasn't a fair fight but hey we started it and of course the daily bugle never gets pictures of me winning like this kelly dangerous weapons lying around do what i do best break things two down two to go they say bad guys don't think of themselves as bad guys but come on you must know [Music] i webbed your nostrils open so you won't snore no need to thank me [Music] you always look so surprised [Music] it's true we have the carnage killer the boys are making welcome right now they should kill him right away before he can escape stop worrying like an old woman i saw him he looks so tough now that he's been cut he's begging for his life say what you want but i won't stop worrying until he's dead it's escalating gotta make my move now [Music] this is whatever that was fun let's do it again [Music] now take some time to think about what you did wrong [Applause] [Applause] i knocked out your tooth but don't worry i left it under your pillows [Music] it's not that you're bad at your job okay it is just what i want [Music] look kill him i learned a valuable lesson kicking bad guys in the face is fun if you were awake sometimes i even impress myself see this is where bad guys shouldn't have nice weapons i'm telling you he's right where he left him your men are panicking like children i believe you just show me so i can tell them i saw it with my own eyes better yet take a picture with your phone you can show them yourself we've bitten him senseless i bet they're wishing they'd paid for that sprinkler system about now they're so cute when they're asleep [Music] [Music] oh did that hurt oh wait i just remembered i don't care [Music] the spot don't feel bad you're not you're not all right you're not good too many goons better find a different way inside [Music] please i keep telling you i'm not who you think i sell advertising then why did someone break in here to save you huh i don't know what you're talking about since now eh a weakling like you could never kill our men alone tell us who you're working with talk oh nobody oh please please nobody that guy's no killer 99 [Music] who can resist [Music] i could that that one off my list [Music] no don't please someone help me i'm just getting started punk [Music] i can't let those goons kill him [Music] it's not that you're bad at your job okay it is sit back relax and enjoy being unconscious [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this one [Music] if i was working with the carnage killer you'd be dead right now be glad you were wrong [Music] just what i want [Music] [Applause] these guys seem to think you killed a bunch of their friends it's not true it's not true i was going to my car and i saw someone attack one of these russian guys he's the killer not me how did you end up here i yelled then the killer ran i went to see if i could help the victim then his friends showed up my hands were bloody but they wouldn't believe that i didn't do it this man you say was the real killer what does he look like white uh red hair skinny wild eyes the strength of a madman not the kind of madman i work with your license says you live in jersey if you can prove you weren't in the city when the carnage killer struck i'll let you go no problem i was in san diego all last week at a convention that's the ambulance i called you'll be okay now [Music] craven i've got a description of the carnage you think he'll be out killer my friend meet me at the location i'm sending you [Music] that'll wake you up [Music] buckle up fasten your seat belts foreign i'm always awesome sometimes i'm extra awesome [Music] that's him wait you can only truly know your prey by watching him stalk his own oh please dude i didn't have anything to do with that drive by i was just a wheelbarrow real man who saw all those people die oh you admit it good now you're going to tell me all about it then you're going to give me answers the spider i'm a big fan of the look but your execution boring you know real spiders liquefy their prey from the inside you should think about it and you're the carnage killer why'd you do it i get having a grudge against criminals but not criminals killers no one knows death better what do they see when they feel her cold arms wrap around them what special insights do they have there's so much to learn you're crazy and you're welcome for what doing what you want to but can't i i don't know what you're talking about i'll show you i could teach you how to be a real predator the spider you're just pretending to be deliberately moving really slowly take off your mask spider-man i need to see your eyes when you die [Music] i know the truth in your darkest moments you wish you were strong enough to be like me admit it give into it [Music] that's it go ahead kill me you know you want to no i don't kill i told him you'd never be like me [Music] thanks for the help you chose to disregard my advice so i assumed you prefer to handle matters yourself what was that anyway you expected me to just stand there and watch him kill that guy or stop him permanently i am trying to unleash the killer instinct in you boy the one you try so hard to deny that's not who i am and it's not who i want to be ever then there will always be a greater predator than you i guess we'll find out [Music] thanks for the smooth ride i sincerely hope i can return the courtesy by slaughtering you quickly and with minimal agony good day mr cassidy my name is donald menken i want to assure you that you are a most valued guest here at ravencroft we're going to learn a lot from you and i'll learn a lot from you answers you don't even know you have [Music] eager i like that well then let's get started shall we [Music] [Music] calling all task force personnel due to increased violence involving the gang war in the suspect known as spider-man you are now free to employ extraordinary measures interface two of the suppression immediately [Music] it's whitney chang just a heads up my sources tell me the task force is actively targeting you be careful so what else is new [Music] all units remain on high alert they've got multiple gang wars breaking out over the russians old territories everybody wants a piece it's like the old west out there so be careful dispatch my informants keep telling me about a new figure called the kingpin who's moving in to fill the power vacuum no one seems to know his real name could you get some information on that for me kingpin great that's all i need i mean they want to be trying to build an empire keep your eyes peeled let it go without a fight i heard we're moving stuff that belonged to the hood that a cult crap totally creeps me out makes me feel better you're helping us thanks my pleasure the last thing any of us need is more dangerous stuff on the streets they're not being very subtle are they seems kind of sketchy [Music] is that stuff worth your life and of course the daily bugle never gets pictures of me jump on have a feeling where that came from spiderman do me a favor and look up ahead cars wired to explode gotta try to neutralize him [Music] better up there than down here [Music] friendly neighborhood fireworks [Music] i'll take that if i was planning an attack this is where i do [Music] the it and get out last chance move it guys get it unloaded now [Music] hey spidey can you move that good work spidey come on we're moving out [Music] these guys aren't messing around [Music] give them this they're persistent why car bombs they go off here it'll be a disaster just in time [Music] yeah he's right here sometimes i even impress myself so dispatch car 228 we checked out the game museum nothing happened we talked to the lady who called she still swear she saw spiderman breaking in but that place is locked up tight no alarms have been tripped copy that 228 she probably read one too many of jameson's editorials kane museums that's not far might as well check it out my reputation's bad enough without getting blamed for pilfering picassos where am i how did i get back into the city that transformer must have overloaded i got out escaped into the power lines that came out here but why can't i remember mankind was there made me breathe gas made it dark again no it doesn't matter i'm free they'll never lock me up again spider-man the police the doctors i'll die before i let them hurt me again or they'll die i like that better that'll wake you up hey yo i bet that's worth some bank hands off stick to the plan we're waiting for the spider you set off an alarm and bring the cops no amount of money's gonna save you from the kingpin you dig they're setting a trap for me with idiots like this not gonna happen better take out the cameras the cops will blame this all on me let's see what i can do before they figure out i'm here [Music] you always look so surprised might have to be a museum museums are lame i feel like i'm back in school they had field trips in reform school yeah shut your mouth and do your job the lady said if you see him we go to the new scene lots to steal in museums great i think i know who's about to cross my path bam there he is huh are you deliberately moving really slowly is this like some sort of mime thing have you been working out felicia why am i not surprised i expected better from you felicia could have hooked up with me i mean yeah uh i meant workers with me or take down bad guys instead of being one it's my nature to bring it sometimes you're better than that i learned a valuable lesson today kicking bad guys in the face is fun we're all tricks no more this ain't right we weren't supposed to fight the spider alone you were supposed to help us lady let that be a lesson to you fellas i'll a woman just because you like the way she fills out a cat suit you'll be disappointed every time i want to uh should i serve my time like a good little girl get out when i'm old and wrinkly i don't think so you're saying the kingpin got you out of jail how much power does this guy have that's what it's all about isn't it power his yours and mine you expect me to stand there they say bad guys don't think of themselves as bad guys but come on does that hurt let me kiss and make it better have i mentioned i like to watch webbs do your stuff don't feel bad you're not you're not all right you're not good now you know how the other guy feels when you hot it's going to all this trouble for little over me you must really care to get predictable hey pay attention going to do this again for your benefit just a little closer i like watching you come into a room but i your heart wasn't in this felicia tell me what he did to you i was transferred to ravencroft the kingpin came to see me just to be clear we're talking about wilson fitz yes he said he knew i was after power and and he could give it to me that's how it always works isn't it the doctors did experiments they called it dna crafting or crisscrossing cross-species genetics you've seen what can happen why would you do that to yourself boy you are thick i did it for you so i'd be like you so we could be together but then the kingpin ordered me to kill you or die myself i couldn't i can't felicia i i don't know what to say don't say anything i'm not interested in your face just your lips i can get you help witness protection a new life safe from the kingpin and maybe maybe someday we can get to know each other like normal people i don't want to be normal people run away with me we'll go somewhere exotic with our power we can live like royalty adventure excitement romance and that sounds terrible to you no but i've got responsibilities well i'm not one of them don't worry about me i've always done fine with a target on my back i can't just let you go fisk owns too many cops if i'm in custody i'm as good as dead you can't do that to me any more than i can do it to you you ever decide you want some fun in your life look me up wait it all makes sense fisk becomes the kingpin by eliminating all his rivals with his anti-crime task force and the public thanks him for it he writes a few big checks and everyone looks the other way it's not just the task force i've been taking his enemies down too and the one who's been pointing me towards his craven i can't let him get away with this i need to know more inside information on fist and i've got an old friend who can get it every day a new crisis a new distraction armed lunatics take hostages in our building some low-level employee gets himself electrocuted on the job i don't need this i can't have it and the whole city's a mess if the police can't keep order i will the battle armor we're developing for the military could help i don't have the connections in local government to make it work but i know a potential investor who does better make myself present wow everyone knows fisk is crooked but you're saying he's actually setting himself up as the top crime boss in new york that's what i've been hearing i'm uh working with whitney chang on a story and she needs proof you're closer to fisk than anyone i know not really he keeps his business private but as an investor i do have access to the task force's financial records okay one of the addresses you gave me came up large payments to a security consultant fisk handles all the personnel decisions he's the one who hired this kraven off guy but he cooked the books so technically ozcorp's paying him he's trying to throw me under the bus join the club [Music] you okay yeah it's just i trusted someone i shouldn't have and i probably should have seen it but after losing my dad and uncle ben i guess i wanted to believe you wanted a father figure i know what that's like my dad shut me out of his life to focus on saving his own and all he ended up leaving me was the disease that killed him huh harry i'm sorry what is it it's genetic very rare degenerative my father extended his life by spending a fortune while he looked for a cure don't have that kind of time there's got to be some hope gene therapy that's what all my dad's research was about is that why norman started the cross species experiments yeah he thought he could give himself the resistance some animals have to conditions like this but the closest he ever got with the work he did on spiders with your father but dad disappeared and his work went with him your task force their body armor has medical applications can it help it all it's not a cure but it can give mobility to people who can't get around on their own the task force has helped me improve on it and protect my research from criminals who'd steal it but it was a mistake to work with fisk he uh he knows you're sick he figured it out and now he's waiting for me to die so he can take ozcorp for himself listen pete take it from a guy who knows when the people you trust turn their back on you it's just proof you have to handle your problems yourself but sometimes you still need help harry i'll do whatever i can for you just tell me what spider-man no one knows for sure how he got his powers but he looks to me like the only successful healthy example of cross-species genetics out there you take pictures of him you must have some way of reaching him well peter i need spider-man's blood oh yeah [Music] as if i didn't have enough problems now i have to worry about oscorp being stolen out from under me donald menken's supposed to work for me and for now he's doing what i say but it's obvious he'd like to run the place then there's wilson fisk he keeps offering to buy the company i might even sell it if i didn't need oscorp's research division to find a cure for my disease i've got to watch them they'd both stab me in the back without thinking twice [Music] i caught up with peter parker we used to be pretty good friends when we were kids and our dads were partners i was hoping he might be able to tell me more about his father's research but he doesn't know any more than i do less actually based on dad's papers i get the impression richard parker went on the run because dad wanted to weaponize his research typical norman osborne he either ran off or killed the one guy who might have been able to save his life [Music] this just in webs needs something to stick to ah [Music] [Music] this is a disaster time for me to end it and of course the daily bugle never gets pictures of me winning like this people work around here [Music] did that hurt oh wait i just remembered i don't care my blood could cure harry i'd give it to and lots of him to find out always feels good to take out the trash [Music] area residents credit spider-man with stopping a gun battle that threatened their lives [Music] maybe jonah james and i could be friends if we just understood each other better man if i give harry my blood without testing at first he could kill him or turn him into a monster like with dr connors and then who knows how many people he might hurt or even kill i've put this off long enough gotta catch up to harry and talk to him you came thank you i'll pay whatever you want mr osborne wait i've checked with scientists familiar with gene therapy and i can't give you my blood it's too dangerous dangerous uh i'll die without it not right away there's still time for more research every other cross-species subject has turned into a monster i don't know why it's different for me i'm i'm looking into it i've paid the top minds in the field to look into it a fortune they don't have the answers i'm willing to take the chance it's not just about you the lizard the other cross species they hurt people get out kill people just get out i can't give you my blood until i know it's safe i can't trust anyone find out i'm on my own mr osborne i no no just just go [Music] really at the end of his rope i should have noticed a long time ago but i was busy being played for a fool by craven i can't believe i fell for his act but why would he teach me his hunting techniques if he was going to betray me yes that's one of the things i'll have to ask him craven time for a little mentor mentee chat no discuss our mutual goals map out a five year plan explain why you're working for a human jello mold looks empty maybe i can still find some answers it's all for me he was gonna kill me and stuff me like a trophy all this time he's been studying me testing me figuring out my strengths how beat them [Music] and how best cetera you're a fake a coward this is your idea of a fair hunt oh no it's only the prelude [Music] the antidote i gave you should remove all effects of the tranquilizer i want you at the peak of your abilities stop acting like you're king art all that talk about honor you lied to me betrayed me for the kingpin and his money that was incidental i did not betray you i truly taught you all i knew not just so you eliminate the kingpin's rivals but to make you the worthiest possible opponent the foe i knew you would be my greatest hunt now you are ready and now we will see who is the hunter and who is the prey so you used me to take out the kingpin's riots what about cassidy i noticed you jumped in to stop him talking to me cassidy was useful from the trees right before he springs a trap i can smell your fear you wanted me to watch cassidy kill that kid why so i'd kill him so i'd feel guilty just because you're a sick freak was strong you could be to it if you could stomach this i admit you disappointed me i'm still waiting for an explanation for your mustache impossible i studied you you are not capable of this kind of fury fool me once you grasp that shadows true i get as angry as you do i want to hurt my enemies just as much the difference is i know it's wrong i learned a valuable lesson today kicking bad guys in the face always one step behind ambush me from the trees you've been up for sport no that's your way on my watch no one dies [Music] i beg you kill me give me death over defeat you're saying death isn't defeat you planning on coming back as a craven zombie or something anyway i won that means i call the shots what are your terms you're a few episodes short of a season craven but you've always had your own loony coat of honor so you're gonna tell me how to get to the kingpin the truth everything you know very well you have won that right ask and i shall answer i ran into someone who says kingpin gets test subjects at ravencroft how the institution has lost all government funding it now relies upon private donors of which fisk is the largest now that norman osborne is dead and they just let him experiment on inmates like some kind of dr chubbenstein they encourage it they view the inmates as hopelessly damaged useful only as test subjects i know you you're always checking out your surroundings you notice everything yes it's true i met with fisk in his building where i took note of the locations of his cameras weapons and accessible points of entry he has a telek 4566 security system and i know the passwords well you get a gold star draw me a map and don't leave anything out the information i have given you will get you inside the building but you must still face fisk himself i'll distract him with cupcakes this is why you will lose you underestimate him he has fought for his life since he was a boy if you show even a moment's weakness he will see it and kill you the old killer instinct huh a lot of good it did you i'm not sure if the cops can pin anything on you but if not take my advice and go back to russia fisk doesn't seem as forgiving as i am ugh [Music] are you kidding me with everything going on in the city they're sending task force guys out of town i heard it's about that stolen ass club tech some kind of armor they're trying to get back so we need backup now but they don't care if working like us get killed only fisk has that kind of influence i should hitch a ride on one of the trucks see what he's up to [Music] that's when you think i can't get any better i'm not used to driving that kind of truck why can't tony come because we're going to see the boss and only his top guys get to know where he goes when he's not here so shut up and do your job i had a feeling listening in on those guys might pay off now to stick to their truck and let them take me right to the fat man himself tell him we've got the delivery i'll watch the truck you got it boss one thing will work on this door ionic webbing i have eyes on spiderman [Music] could be worse i could be mucus man hey pay attention all the armor in the world can't fix stupid spread out secure the area you got it i want a perimeter set up all points of entry watched i'm on it i catch anyone slacking off they'll end up padding my arrest stats understood sir maintain radio contact check in every five minutes i'll spread the word boss wants everyone working double shift i'll tell the boys task force cops working with crooks no who could have possibly predicted that except everybody eight ball that you i see him are you deliberately moving really slowly is this like some sort of mime thing that's what i'm talking about [Music] i don't care what beef man armor might look cool but it doesn't make them any faster you've been busy spider-man task force i don't like work now take some time to think about what you did wrong it's my lucky day i see him my best shot here to me like the elite task force wasn't all that elite it's come to my attention that a low-level worker at oscorp has been killed after falling into a tank containing genetically altered electric eels his name is something nauseatingly common oh yes max dylan osborne's people are trying to keep the matter quiet i wish to see this man's body for myself given the fascinating properties of oscorp's cross-species genetics and maybe a great deal to learn from his corpse if he is in fact dead i'm hearing interesting things from our friends at the coroner's office [Applause] oh yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] screw up their lines of communication by taking out the guys who give the orders the armor is only as good as the guy inside and those guys yeah not good footage little light you can't help it click the small victory [Music] dream of don't feel bad you're not you're not all right you're not good this is my chance to disable their armor ionic webbing is just what the whatever those guys get paid is too much sometimes i even impress myself nighty night your mom tell you you could be anything you give me robots any day these robots i'll take that uh what no elevator music this guy's cheaper than jameson smells like sweaty fat guys and burritos in here no offense to burritos [Music] well if it isn't the kingpin catchy name but i have to say you look more like a bowling ball than a pin or maybe a beach ball i have no idea what you're talking about i mean i'm impressed you take control of crime in new york right under everybody's nose the whole city knows you're crooked and everyone still kisses your tookus you must take what like a week a lot of ground to cover is what i'm saying the only criminal i see is the masked man guilty of breaking and entering into my private building the violent vigilante the daily bugle has branded a menace fine play it like that but one way or another you're going down and now you've threatened me i dare say jonah jameson will praise me as a hero after i kill you in self-defense of course you set cletus cassidy loose on a city just to wipe out your rivals but to scare people to make things so bad when you took over if it looked like you fixed it and who else is gonna fix things you running around acting out some adolescent power fantasy i live in the real world spiderman come down here immediately you expect me to fight it myself people don't expect us to find freedom yeah they want a world that makes sense when you stay out of bad neighborhoods you don't get hurt they want order you're wrong people want justice they want to know that if they work hard what an amazing world you're so bad when you go camping the bears what do i pay you for get down here i'm gonna shut you down nothing about my life you have no idea what i've done to survive so talk to me let's hear it you hired crazy please cassidy i'm so [Music] i'm not a fool spider-man i've admitted no wrong doing broken no laws there's no evidence against me i have proof you paid craven no my task force did as a security consultant i am shocked and horrified to hear he's done anything improper if indeed he has he was hired for his legendary skills and and a strong code of conduct that would never allow him to betray a client craven might not give you up but cassidy will oh lunatic like that oh come now his word can hardly be believed and besides a man would have to be a fool to deal with someone of his ilk directly i assure you i have no fool i'm afraid spider-man that you are the only criminal here yeah we'll see about that this is not an action film boy just because you're young does not mean you can hack my security and gain access to my personal how are you doing that huh now who's underestimated who stop that i demand you stop all units max dylan has escaped custody and is at large in sector 4. what did you do i have no idea what you mean thank you for showing me my areas of vulnerability i assure you they will be gone when you return so he's using those generators to make an energy shield gotta take him out looks like times square is getting worse no one cares well i'll make them [Music] everyone in here you're on the other side just what i always wanted i can't get through that energy let's go ahead uh i don't have time yes [Music] shields are down times square here i come i recognize that guy what happened to him i want you to stay away now it's too late [Music] there's something familiar about you max dylan [Music] you said i was your eyes and ears said we were partners i remember now i did say that and i meant it liar you abandoned me left me in that place let them hurt me all alone in the dark max i don't know what happened i can see you're in pain but i can't help you unless you let me okay i lived my whole life there's bad people

you think it's hard for you there are people sick dying all over the world some with the same disease who don't have your money resources even if you don't want to keep fighting for yourself you owe it to them you're gonna answer for your mistakes and do whatever you can to make up for them [Music] the greatest man i ever knew [Music] all units we're getting alarms from the ravencroft institute i better get over there now ah there's a riot at ravencroft we don't have the manpower to handle it all we could do is close the bridge seal it off what about the people who worked there we sent us some task force guys to evacuate but they're having a bad time any chance you can lend a hand on my way this is a nightmare how'd it get so bad so fast it's like someone deliberately freed all the most dangerous inmates this is worse than i ever imagined [Applause] both the staff and the non-violent inmates are in a bad spot i gotta get those people out it's like a disaster movie but just for you [Music] no more stick around on what you've got to evacuate anyone who's not involved in the ride spiderman get me out of here thank you it got so bad so fast glad to help let's get as far away from here as you can seismic blast has a way of bringing people together on the floor please thank you oh he's so scared head for the bridge the police will get you out i rubbed your nostrils open so you won't snore no need to thank me weapons i call this the seismic blast you can call it lights out thanks brother i mean that don't thank me yet you need to get a seat we should break dance fight instead you should see me do the worm oh no i did oh yes spiderman help me this time pal they say everyone's the hero of his own story but come on i'm the european menkin right you work for oscorp i'll try not to hold that against you what happened here it was in cassady we tried treating him with an experiment don't i know what you and fisk were up to using these people as guinea pigs okay fine fine but the danger's real cassidy changed into something horrible deadly and he wants to make more like him how do i stop cassidy [Music] uh i'm not sure you can you'd have to overwhelm the symbiote we injected him with stop it from functioning inflict too much damage for it to handle perhaps with fire or intense vibrations it's all theoretical we planned further studies but what did this nutball cocktail of yours do to it i don't fully understand it but like everything else the goal was to cure the osborne's in this case by creating organic intelligent life forms nanites that rely on the body's survival for their own now listen to me any disease any damage they can recognize and heal as well as protect and defend the host symbiotic relationship more cassidy's a loony psycho killer when did he turn into a social butterfly he had an abusive father absent mother he was always jealous of other kids with loving stable families so he's trying to create one yes out of the most dangerous inmates at ravencroft he wants to build a family in his image i'll get you outside which is more than you deserve but then i have to go after cassidy i agree he's headed for the sub basements where the most damaged inmates are kept now if he makes them into beings like him no place will be safe [Music] okay i'm fine from here my car's outside get to a hospital tell the police everything or after i'm done with cassidy i'll come looking for you heavy duty security i wonder what they had here feeling something seriously wrong was going on here [Music] that water's got a live current in it gotta stay on high ground i always look so surprised they're so cute when you're asleep quit fighting like that i'm supposed to be the funny one sometimes i even impress myself electrical equipment burn marks i bet this is where they held max dylan i get the feeling there's something behind that wreckage uh gotta stay out of that water or i'm gonna get one heck of a jolt [Music] the venom project great why is it never the puppy project or the chocolate project gotta stop cassidy before he makes things even worse now you're trapped in my web little spider don't fear the darkness let it in then you'll be like me i've become my true self spiderman [Music] i know what it's like to be part of something bigger you'll find out soon [Music] those who are like me and those who are dead which one are you uh cassidy that's as far as you go one of you is already too many not cletus cassidy not anymore i'm my true self now i'm carnage poor little spider you're just not ready to see the truth are you i didn't web up your mouth because i don't want you to suffocate but you're starting to talk me out of it see you think you're joking but i know what you won't admit to yourself when i killed those criminals you were happy you were grateful to me weren't you no i it's not too late to understand i'll tell you whatever you want to know you say you're searching for answers in death but what were you trying to do when i stopped you make others like you a family so we can spread the message the truth that chaos and death are the own wrong you're trying to create a family because you never had one you weren't looking for death cletus you wanted the life you never had now who's not seeing the truth you said you killed to understand death what are you trying to understand the meaning the truth the secrets it reveals about all of us that we're afraid to see i can tell you that death is a part of life it happens sometimes for a reason sometimes for no reason you're wasting your time looking for some cosmic answer in death life is where you find meaning and buddy you've wasted yours what makes you think i'm anything like you you wanted to do what i did end those criminals forever that's true i didn't want to admit it but i'd be lying if i said i didn't feel that way i knew it but that's human anger wanting revenge it's not wrong to feel emotions like that it's wrong to act on them here's the real difference between us spider-man i'm at peace with who i am you shouldn't be and you should then why aren't you sorry cletus i just figured out talking to a psycho killer isn't gonna give me the answers i'm after i know what will death you know what you should do differently seriously i don't think there's much spiders what i was always meant to be it's like a disaster movie but just for you i still get butterflies when i fight the bad guys it's gonna get a lot muddier than that is i wish on the floor we should break dance fighters dead motion is is this isn't personal i just think you're a jerk hey maybe uh don't want to be alone again please just let me die that's not the answer cletus none of us are gonna find any answers here what's the matter peter you look like you lost your last friend hey but i know for a fact you've still got at least one it's uncle ben i miss him so much i just feel lost without him he raised me i loved him and he died because he was looking for me i'm not sure how to live with that let me ask you something pilgrim your uncle ben he was one of the best people i ever knew everyone loved him he had an amazing life right so why do you want to make it all about how it ended what counts isn't how he died peter what matters is really the way he lived i i want you to make his life mean something i want you to be the man he raised you to be the man that he was so proud of when he saw what you were growing into he told you that all the time your uncle knew what a tough place the world could be he knew that it needs heroes and hey take it from me you are one of those heroes so what do you say are you gonna go out there and prove it i want you to do it for uncle ben and for me yeah yes stan i will i miss uncle ben i'll always miss him but i don't have to replace him because he already gave me everything i needed now it's up to me to honor his memory by using what he gave me in a way that'll make him proud nuff said enough said [Music] oh you can rely on me mr mayor i consider it my honor to provide any help i can then what happened to young osborne is tragic but never fear i'll continue to finance the task force myself and at the risk of seeming overconfident i promise you with the criminal organizations that plagued our city crushed the crime rate will go down to a manageable level yeah goodbye [Music] there you are they're coming my friend come in i couldn't have done this without you chameleon what happens now now the real work begins [Music] so you
