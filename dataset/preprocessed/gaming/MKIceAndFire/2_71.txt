mexican hood a couple million bucks because i wrecked his girlfriend's house i don't need to go crazy here which mexican martina thrazzo he's not supposed to be very nice oh when i met him he was charming [Laughter] so what do you think oh um let's see either we hit a bank in the sticks or we do a store which do you like well this door's usually easier but i got to make a big take well gems it is then let's go to vangelico buy ourselves an engagement ring oh we're going to need a crew i can round up some of the old guys there are no old guys moses ironically he found jesus all those irish crazies they mostly just disappeared that crew from the south they all went down there was a an eastern european guy making moves in liberty city but yeah he went quiet all right well we're gonna need a crew you got any contacts in ls or not i've been working with someone but they're too unpredictable i'll have to reach out to some other guys we're going to little portola [Music] your fib buddies they uh know you're back in business fib buddies what are you talking about i checked out the wpp thing doesn't look like any whitsect program i'm aware of but for starters yeah they don't put witnesses up in multi-million dollar mansions in rockford hills now maybe they thought this would be the best cover and most witnesses don't transfer five-figure sums into a particular fib agent's bank account every month of course the money gets moved around and washed through a number of fronts but the trail is there deposits and withdrawals the same sum every month agent dave norton white middle-aged divorcee unremarkable career except for one incident the shooting of a notorious stick-up man michael townsend yeah yeah yeah yeah all right lester i'm very impressed look we can talk about this another time but take these glasses my eyesight's fine they're fitted with a camera and a radio relay i'm gonna run the operation from the car while you're in the store getting what we need uh okay let's get this done [Music] get in there sir thank you the alarm keypad is on the left when you come in on the wall by the side door [Music] glasses are live shoot away ah okay that's their alarm can you get me an air vent in one of the cameras hey beautiful i need to pick up a little something for the woman in my life but one of them sir i'm sure we can help you tell me about her what's her taste cheap thank god and say my wife we're talking about i don't know i don't want to spend too much i'm thinking maybe 10 grand our rings start at eight our pendants start at twelve all right so these things built to last or am i just paying for the evangelical logo here no no no we use perfect clarity jewels 18 karat gold 950 platinum nothing but the best all right i think he just made a sale i'm gonna take a look around think about it come back to you baby don't go anywhere i understand okay thank you sir you got it fine that was what it was but you're not done taking photographs my checklist reads ventilation system and cctv [Music] great you got the security camera and the ventilation in that shot come back to me [Music] so we good i need to get eyes on the roof of the building see where the ventilation comes out [Music] drive us around the block we gotta find a way up to the roof look there some construction yeah if they're gutting the place i might be able to get to the roof i totally need that car so you keep up with the old crew i saw a ladder climb up and see if you can get to the roof well after your death slash disappearance there wasn't much holding us together yeah you see him at all after the incident i kept tabs on him for a while needed to uh know that he didn't blame me yeah where'd he go north south east west wherever there were liquor stores to turn over and hitchhikers to disappear where did they bury him they buried him not as far as i know he's probably a john doe then right i'm on the roof i need to know where the air coming out of those vents angelico originates there should be a unit above the store what do you think od shootout maybe just a car crash right anonymous charred remains on the highway they only knew what a sick puppy they had on their hands [Music] it looks like the highest point is on the northwest side hey i see the vents yeah i'm looking at the relay can you get any higher you've got a good advantage now use it and get an image of the air system okay capture an image of the system and we're done we've got our shot of evangelical units looks good okay that'll do come back to me before someone spots you up there will do here take your glasses back let's go back to the garment factory i called ahead and told him to start setting up the information [Music] so what did you see nothing that'll cause undue complications yeah it looked like a simple setup cameras broadcasting to a remote server who might be able to wipe the security guard on the door he won't want to die from rich [ __ ] to rub his nose in it good alarm systems link to the door lock and we'll get a good window someone talented hacks it anything else well the uh more valuable merchandise is in the cabinets in the center of the store by the register so i'd start there glass in the cabinets wasn't bulletproof means you can smash them easy enough but the stones will be in the safe at night so we go in when it's open then right once we melt down the gold re-cut the rocks that's an okay score yeah shame we can't go in after hours man those vents look promising i might be able to flip that another way i'm listening wait till we get back about the crew yeah there's this kid who's been helping me maybe we could cut him in i don't work with amateurs he ain't an amateur or if he is he's a gifted amateur about to turn pro he's a good kid lester you know what they say it's your funeral one of them at least here are the photos my workers have their uses okay let me set this up nice to see the methods ever changed well we got to figure out what we're doing somehow all the crews the rolls prep work don't leave evidence behind on a hard drive so yeah the uh methods don't change right not for a pro well mapping out the options i'm showing you all the angles that's my area of professional expertise making decisions that is your domain my friend here there's two ways i see of doing this we go in smart or we go in loud and dumb remember the vents if we're gonna be smart we pump a little knockout gas through the air system then hit the cabinets while everyone's out you'll have to source the gas of course but crowd control won't slow you down and that might improve the take the cover is pest control so no one will look twice when you're wearing gas masks that means getting a pest control van though you go in dumb and you'll need your uh famous way with people and four carbine rifles we can't buy them and risk them getting traced no no we've got to find some in circulation it's awkward it's uh real awkward but this is the gun favored by lspd tactical teams so one of their vans is probably a good place to look a hacker can disable the cameras the length of time depends on their ability the alarm will be operating on the same window the exit strategy is more or less the same for both options the driver you pick will of course source some bikes you come out of the store and make your way through the new subway tunnel they're digging off the del pero freeway you lose the cops in there and meet a truck in the ls river all right i want my guy franklin on the getaway he can handle a bike all right if you vouch for him i'll take the risk so how do you want to do this run into the front door or try to play it smart ah you've grown wise and cautious in your old age okay select personnel with that in mind as ever the better they are the bigger the cut now the driver they'll source the bikes lead you out through the tunnels ah okay this one's new blood i've seen him drive but i haven't seen him under pressure guns now we're hoping to keep quiet so this guy shouldn't make much difference ah norm came across as a bit of an idiot but could be useful hacker back office but this is the person who will determine how long you get inside this guy ricky i met him at the life invader office he may not be that good but he's enthusiastic let's take a chance on him that look good to you are you sure great i'll do some research on the pest control van and the knockout gas and i'll be in touch oh yes i'll call you when everything's ready you'll need to pitch it to the guys whoa what my rep don't count for nothing no more you're a dead man michael i'll call you [Music] you
