conquest of Outworld is impossible to measure or imagine as was his hunger once all he could see was under his control Shao Kahn turned his attention to earth but the Elder Gods had created a mystical tournament to protect earth known as Mortal Kombat Shao Kahn could only lay claim to earth if his champions were victorious in the tournament thus far Earth's Warriors have triumphed saving earth but some fights only require a lone victory and all can be lost with a single defeat you have ensured peace for Earth once again this day but there is no power in these metals apart from the knowledge you must carry into every battle that no one is a champion alone if one of us is in Chains none of us are free if even one succeeds the victory is ours Liu Kang you have defeated the sorcerer Shang Tsung you have saved this realm as your forefathers did from his evil you are Earth realms champion and hero thank you master Ayden when next the tournament is fought it will be my ancestors that have

he now defies the elder gods themselves Bharata could not have come with a legion of mutants come had Shang Tsung not been aiding him with his defeat in the Mortal Kombat tournament he will be anxious to prove himself superior to you and take his vengeance this will make him reckless and more dangerous than ever [Applause] I had hoped you would have time to heal your wounds in the tournament but I was gravely mistaken you must go to Outworld we must take the battle there if we are to save earth I am weary after the tournament but rest is a luxury afforded only to the dead of course I will go to our world and what have you come Lao what do you say of course take the portal to Outworld yawn [Music] [Music] [Music] the portal to Outworld there may be a warning warning all magic carries warnings called Lao we must be cautious but isn't this Shang Tsung's magic how can we trust his warnings I know how Shang Tsung thinks I will not have as much power in Outworld but here I have the power to make the way safe if I had let you enter before you would have been pulled inside out this is what I can offer you in the conflict to come [Music] mr. Aydin if I am to die here then it will be for the honor of my family very well I believe that I will be of great assistance to Liu Kang after all your magics are too limited enough that is correct come Lao but I can still give you my knowledge of this place I will try to hide my presence from Chang soon I dare not attract his attention and therefore Indians mr. Aydin and should you encounter sonya blade in this realm be cautious this place changes even the most honorable of warriors she made a friend [Applause] [Music] sweet [Music] [Music] I believe your

against those who threaten earth can we trust anyone who comes from this place you said that if we this realm was not always as you see it now it was once a place of indescribable beauty and purity

cool ow we are here to stop Shang Tsung from attacking earth Shang Tsung it is not Shang Tsung that once birth not Shang Tsung [Music] but you better take a look at this one of them is dead the other is only stunned Jade you killed her she was my best friend and you killed her don't touch me I should destroy you for killing Jade she tried to kill us I am sorry you were under a spell of some sort you were trying to kill us where am I how did I get here maybe this one can explain and do not look under the van let me go explain yourself Jade was my katanas best friend until jade was forced by Shao Khan to hunt her down and bring her back to him we were given a spell to control her Shogun isn't that your father I do not blame you for this Jade I blame the man that forces me to call him father the one who killed my true father and stole his throne I blamed Shao Khan for what he did to my mother what is it I am remembering a lot now where's a reptile who reptile if Malina is here so is reptile they are inseparable I am certain that they have both been charged with hunting me down [Music] I cannot let her escape wait there's more to this than we know Raiden would tell us if there was you need to think more about what is happening and less about this girl you just rescued [Music] you have obtained the fist of ruin powerful attacks will help bring some objects [Music] you [Music] master raiden raiden Kung Lao Liu Kang I have discovered that Shang Tsung has somehow used the Elder Gods magic boundaries to make out world vulnerable I do not understand you can weaken him by winning victories against Shang Tsung's assassins it means that your every battle here affects Shang Tsung's power directly you must fight until one of you is victorious it is the only way to save earth we will be in competition with each other then Shang Tsung's power will be divided between you that will make him vulnerable and incapable of attacking earth Raiden who is Shao Kahn wears katana he is not to be concerned with katana is still regaining her memory and trying to understand the effects of the magic she was cursed with you two must concern yourselves with saving earth realm through the portals you will find more battles more ways to weaken Shang Tsung [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this we find him maybe we find your girlfriend katana is not my girlfriend she may help us remember so what do we do this is what Raiden was talking about if we defeat reptile Shang soon we'll be that much no I will defeat reptile you can watch this is what Raiden was talking about [Music] [Music] this place is enormous I'm still trying to make sense out of what katana told us do you see reptile no you check over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] you killed reptile this is very good master why do you say that you are feeding the soul Toombs this is all we hoped for how is this going to save earth realm I thought we were here to stop shang tsung i yes Master Raiden something is wrong yes but I am certain trade and will let us know when it is time [Music] [Music] Master Raiden I fear Liu Kang that Kung Lao no matter how much he desires to serve his ancestors is becoming a liability to the tournament master Raiden it is this place evil spirits swim in the air searching for souls to nest in you are the Mortal Kombat champion you will need to remember who you are if you are going to defeat Shang Tsung the soul tombs are a source of Shang Tsung's power you must destroy them I can trust only you you are the champion of MORTAL KOMBAT you alone are strong enough to resist the corruption of this realm yes master Raiden [Music] something is wrong I knew it trust your instincts Kung Lao trust what you learn your ancestors will guide you the same tombs are the source of Shang Tsung's power [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] people at earth realm often ask what purpose does suffering serve here it serves a terrible and awful purpose when someone perishes here their soul and essence are collected and trapped in a place known as the soul tools these tools are a source of Shang Tsung's power the black dragon mercenaries came to rescue their leader Kano but were swept up in Shang sooners manipulations just like we were master Raiden Shang Tsung did not have the power to defeat you in earth realm but here here he hopes to reverse your victory in Mortal Kombat and take earth realm after your defeat so Shang Tsung gets stronger every time you enter combat and even more powerful every time we win how do we fight that do we stop fighting stop killing know your journey must move forward but there is a repository of souls that adds to Shang Tsung's strength go and destroy this soul too and Shang Tsung will be to lose his power [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] just your might [Music] just your might [Music] [Music] just your mind [Music] [Music] just your might [Music] [Music] [Music] just your mind we are [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]

you waste my time your souls aren't even worthy additions to my power kill them hurry we have to destroy the Soul tubes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] are you okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] again [Music] cytology [Music] I wish Raiden would warn us if it is not help ease it is Baraka we have done just as he suggested Master Raiden I see I think this place is getting to Raiden look who is that me kombat tournament take your place as my servants I should've won that is not you remember what raided assent they are our ancestors Raiden said triumphs and failures I wonder what happened what was that all about I do not know but I get the feeling that this is something rated wanted us to see I hope you are not telling me to trust in what I do not know again no we are part of an ancient mystery that is all [Music] [Music] [Music] wall run ability has been gained [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music] walljump ability has been gained [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I will not let you tell my father that he no longer controls Nina Nina he is a monster everyone he touches becomes like you [Music] [Music] ah where's she going to the wasteland to seek help from Goro the wasteland get help to do what to kill me you idiot and then to kill you why does she hate you so much she is my clone as long as I am Alive it is as if she is not real a soulless husk if I die my soul and identity before the man that calls me daughter will become herbs Shao Kahn has spells that will allow her to claim my very existence then we have to stop Melina before that can happen I knew you were going to say that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so many bodies [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just your money [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my thanks warriors we are here to stop Shang Tsung's will you help us I'm sorry I can't my clan needs me and they must know that we have been betrayed by one of our own but know that I too am opposed to Shang Tsung and everything that is wrong in this place know that the enemy of your enemy is your friend thank you [Music] I love doing something for nothing do not be a fool Kung Lao nothing is done for no reason we are here to secure freedom for Earth realm and for this realm as well [Music] [Music] [Music] you know what they say about a cold day in hell this is it [Music] [Music] whoever you are it matters little I have learned to call everyone enemy [Music] [Music] did you do that yes why did you do that sub-zero is dead he died after the Mortal Kombat tournament Raiden told us scorpion killed him so who are you the man you saw die was my brother and I am not even certain he is truly dead I came here to avenge him and believe that he may still yet live in one form or another I've been told that if I can find some vestige of his power I may find him why think everyone is an enemy everyone in this realm is an enemy even those that I once called friends and allies on earth now hunt me and want to kill me why have you come to the wasteland to rescue his girlfriend for the last time she's not my girlfriend we are here to stop Shang Tsung there's a warrior named katana an ally she is in danger from her clone Malina and a creature known as Goro I know of Goro they say he cannot be beaten in combat still he has not faced me your friend this ally does not stand a chance against him I see now that I may have been wrong about you you could have killed me and you did not I heard the red dragon clan speak about another prisoner they had do you think they might have been talking about katana if they have her you will need to go further into the wasteland and cross the sea of blood the souls of those who died here are put to other purposes the bodies are added to this lake of damnation how do we cross it there is an old boat near here I could repair it for you I will take you there and face Goro [Music] [Music] [Music] our destination [Music] [Music] use your powers against the weakened door the exit must be up top we need to get there somehow [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] goro must be just ahead [Music] [Music] scorpion he killed my brother I cannot go with you now if our paths cross again or I find Goro I will keep my oath you cannot help me go scorpion has escaped to the nether realm like he was never here at all [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for YouTube tired of my work I know that voice it is Goro [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you should have let me take down Goro I am the Mortal Kombat champion I'm Earth realms champion what what I think you'd better start doing what I tell you do you have any idea what you are talking about only what Raiden should have told you a long time ago you should not turn your back on me cool ow nice try shang tsung I am not so certain I want you anywhere near me that is exactly what shanks some desires listen Shang Tsung is trying to turn us against each other back in the Academy he was impersonating me he can morph into anyone he wants I didn't know what Shang Tsung at the time I tried to warn you and then I realized if someone could look like me he could look like either of you two as well so I followed you through the portal and waited and watched so how long was Shang Tsung posing as Luke eh I think it was when we were separated while fighting Goro I suppose that means we still have to rescue katana a girl is she hot you will find katana elsewhere I have something else for Johnny Cage to do follow me [Music] you have acquired the double-jump ability [Music] [Music] Shang Tsung's defeat is close but there is one more defense you will need to stop him you will find this key to Shang Tsung's defeat in the nether realm the entry to that realm is at the portals [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] swinging ability has been gained jump up and swing on any horizontal pole [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] read it how is it that we can enter and survive in another realm I thought only evil or tainted Souls could enter this one what do you think has happened to your souls every time you have killed while on your quest your souls have become tainted you must be strong enough to not let that control you you know Raiden should not be able to do that what I thought he could not be magic in this world [Music] who's that don't take another step or I'll stop you myself [Music] sub-zero what happened to scorpion I thought you were after him I was scorpion is still here but I will not allow you to face noob saibot noob saibot for all we know this could be Shang Tsung he is trying to keep us from getting the key to save earth do not worry he does not serve Shang Tsung he is possessed by one of the Elder Gods there is more here than just Shang Tsung's attempt to invade Earth realm the gods are involved how do you know noob saibot is not part of this because I I think he is my brother if you want to stop Shang Tsung defeat scorpion where is he the nether realm is infinite in size but scorpion will find you if you are here in this realm if your brother is possessed how can you help him he'll most likely try to kill you again I will find a way to free him that could take a long time as long as it takes finding scorpion should not be as hard he wants to kill you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ecology [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you have all you will need to defeat Shang Tsung and save Earth realm there is a portal there that will take you to a place where Shang Tsung will be at his most vulnerable I am uncertain about Kung Lao he seems different strange Johnny Cage told me that Shang Tsung was impersonating him do you think he is now masquerading as kalau I had not considered that possibility be on your guard that is all there is a door that would lead you to the foundry you must find it to defeat Shang soon [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] more secrets are available the hell done a lie [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] OOP you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]
