work that'll get you all tuckered out bounce house check boing banana boeing boy boing boing boing hey we don't take fall damage so go nuts oh an unsuspecting bad guy let's stealth kill him my game you get points for killing baddies i like that yeah and you spend those points to get cool upgrades to make us more badass that is impossible yeah but it's called progression in games a must-have hey player open up the upgrade menu and see what we can buy the more bad guys we kill the more upgrades we can unlock and purchase with our points i like to expect my deadpool for defense and healing yeah i like to spec my deadpool for nougat and cream filling but i don't think that's an option [Music] okay class tap jump while jumping towards a wall to perform a wall jump if it were me i'd chain wall jumps together to get higher the jump button in midair to do a double jump it's awesome laws of physics beat damn oh and hold the jump button to mantle up ledges i think i need to make an entrance

chat with sinister hey there captain douche you know i don't appreciate you killing my target before i could now i need to collect from your sorry ass should i be impressed what the hell why is this happening come blockbuster jenosha awaits psylocke domino boner engaged what are you ex babes doing here we'd probably know if we'd read the original script deadpool you need to listen to me mr sinister has taken over chance right to believe [Music] [Music] hey you're here too by reading the script like the girl said we gotta go to jenosha if we're gonna stop mr sinister from wait jenosha the island hey we'll have to fly there are we taking the blackbird oh i always wanted to fly the blackbird no goddamn [Music] fooling way see montage works every time we crashed yeah but we crashed on genocide it seems our flight was a little more than the x-chumps could handle oh are they dead let's gently poke the furry one and find out wolverine my healing factor came from his dna somewhere like twins except he's short and furry and he smells funny he loves it when people ask him if they can fly the blackbird he's got these awesome adamantium claws that cut through anything including my body when i piss him off time to wake up rise and shine stubby wake up up and adam fine then that's for all the checks that's for never calling just to say hi that's because i get aroused when i slap people that's for all the furry midgets in the world that's because i feel like why won't you wake up wake up that's because the player keeps smashing the button that's because i like slapping fleshy things with this hand that's for being in more comics that's for making me love you that's for making me hate that's for never taking us to the prom that's for always working late that's for being short that's for stabbing me in the heart literally that's for never letting me fly the blackbird except when i crash it that's for being the worst wingman in bromance history that's because i want to see if the player keeps doing this that's for all the hot gamer girls out there hey call me that's for being a total douche that's for never washing the dishes that's for last year's white elephant gift who wants a white elephant and finally that's because the whole setup just added five minutes of bonus play to the most awesome game ever devised by mutant or man i guess he's not waking up curious looks like we're flying solo boys it's as if the next section was designed screw the x-men wow is that a sentinel sure is impressive right you can see how they could destroy this entire island populated with powerful mutants here comes sinister's lackeys i guess they saw our blackbirds uh landing wasn't exactly what the hell was that how many bullets are in your head so far seriously what does that shake that's heavy it's getting closer have you got a healing package oh man zoom in on tumbo up there stop dropping my camera player thing was expensive now get up holy [ __ ] that guy is big dude is your primary means of transportation belly flops that can't be a vision you picked the wrong time to get tough tons of fun this will not end well where are we anyway the island of genocide i'm pretty sure it's some kind of a time share for mutants or the sight of one of the worst mutant massacres in history yeah no i'm sticking with timeshare wow this is really really freaky look more people that want us dead oh in games that means we're headed in the right direction oh that sounded like bone i hate oh your brains are running away from you gross i can't teleport yet nope no more bullets [Music] if that hits you in the chest i'm sorry standing for you we want it i can't teleport yet but is it big enough oh that was he sticks us with a grenade [Music] best video game ever

traveled from the future to bring you a dire warning about oh god here he goes again he's not here 10 seconds before he starts boring us with his dire warning from the future crap sinister has knocked out the x-men by broadcasting we may want to pay attention this could explain a critical plot point the survival of earth entirely depends on which all hinges on you wade now here's the critical part it's so boring it's [Music] damn it wade oh man did that hurt so we give cable the slip looks like he left a note what does it say idiot meet me at the north end of the city what what the hell is cable to give us orders in our game ps if you don't arrive within one hour you'll miss the incredibly large breasted naked woman who claims to be your biggest fan and don't fall for that one what if cable means at this time we can't take that chance large breasted naked fan lady we're on our way [Music] that's i'm heavy in your glue damaged [Music] hey you guys see a cute girl walk by here who

marksmanship yeah crazy guys i know i can't believe you're about to fight me either look at me when i'm talking to you uh for my first date with a fan girl should we do italian or mexican mexican duh good call come on let's talk about this that is probably gonna bruise true [Music] holy flying dudes that duke can fly this guy is fast try using lock-on whoops anger issues did something just hit me this looks important [Music] hey aren't you gonna make a joke about us putting our thing in that thing that's too easy what's the sound of one robotic arm clapping dubstep that hole is prime jumping material i think they call that a glory hole ugh [Music] you must be getting closer to fangirl you smell the perfume too i thought she would smell better to be honest think we're dressed well enough to meet our number one fan girl skin tight bodysuit [Music] is that her low behold number one fangirl is [Music] [Music] i'd ask what that was about but i don't want to know time is short we need to get you to magneto's old citadel across the island stupid fantasy don't worry we'll land a real girl someday this is our game after wade are you listening don't even bother with that security tower

magnetic apocalypse that can't be good [Music] that game was a total bust whatever won't keep us from that douche nozzle sinister nobody takes our contract [Music] these platforms don't feel very stable your mod doesn't feel very stable all right time to make my own luck billion dollars here we come what a cow nice try wheel there are no cows on genosha what the hell almost there time to make sinister pay for pay for what following the script the script says we go kill him so let's get to it so all right billion dollars enough is enough cliffhanger how profound [ __ ] this storm is really
