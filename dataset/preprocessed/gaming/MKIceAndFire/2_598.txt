right okay um see oh i look dead am i dead you're not dead what's going on oh no what's the matter with us all i know is that rose sat down there with her dolls and then you two came alive just like that you didn't see anything else well there was one unusual thing why what happened she was crying oh i know quite unusual for rose but i am a hundred percent sure because i could see her tears falling onto the dolls tears were falling onto the dolls oh wait a minute i know what happened it's a spell ridiculous cody we've got to apply logic okay we are having a conversation with a pair of binoculars there is no logic in that goodness sake i don't even believe in spells okay well did you believe that you could be turned into a wooden doll huh exactly it had to be the tears it was a spell i am telling you so if it is a spell how do we break it okay i got this yeah me and rose we read all about the spell stuff i'm a virtual wizard right now okay just give me some space i need to think okay so if the spell was cast through her tears then in order to break it oh in order to break it we have to reverse it through her tears boom right okay we basically have to find her and make her cry on us again really okay fine okay do you know where to find her miss binoculars she's in her room go on okay thanks uh come on me how do we get to a room from here easy we just climbed the tree ah this way what you're never gonna make that jump yeah watch me oh god damn it coming through lovebirds come on over well throw us the rope it's too far cody where there is love no distance is
