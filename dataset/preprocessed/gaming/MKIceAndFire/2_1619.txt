legendary same warrior the strongest fighter in the universe you're finished Frieza you're finally going did I not make myself clear before I've grown tired of your pathetic jokes stop don't you see he can't fight back anymore he's done just let him go Kakarot just a thought is always perhaps you're not a Super Saiyan after all is it stop letting your emotions hold you back stop being so soft and you can finally do it you to become a Super Saiyan God listen their home planet planet Vegeta wasn't destroyed by a media it was Frieza we we Saiyans we Saiyans where is in forces we followed every order your parents my father's beti date they were all murdered by that monster I bet you Jacqueline please please defeat Frieza please I beg of you he must die by sane hands I was wondering when he'd finally die Vegeta he must have been really difficult for a proud guy like you des begged me for help I hated you at first but I began to understand over time you were a proud sand warrior just know this I'll do what I can to carry on that pride of yours hey I'm a Saiyan raised on Earth and to avenge those you've brutally murdered the sands and the namekians I'm going to defeat you utter nonsense

[Music] [Music] [Music] this has been fun it's been quite some time since I've exerted myself this much my hand I'm in trouble if he's serious about the half power thing then even the kaio-ken times 10 isn't going to be enough I should be able to hold my own if I push it 2 times 20 though my body might not be able to handle it [Music] [Music] what what's going on it barely it barely did a thing my dad's energy it's a lot weaker than it was before I can't believe someone's actually that strong guess King Kai was right can't believe I'm saying this but we shouldn't have picked this fight with freezer cus you sayin well now that actually hurt where is all your energy gone what have you exhausted yourself already I can't watch anymore I'm gonna help him wait seems like Coco's got something in the works [Music] Goku the legendary super safe the spirit bomb all things living on Nemec and all planets that can hear me lend me as much energy as you can give me the strength I need what are you doing don't tell is this another one of your pathetic attacks what can you possibly accomplish by just standing there well he's made a spirit Bob that huge Frieza doesn't appear to know what's going on right now I don't understand what Goku doesn't just attack him he's probably thinking that he needs more energy so that he can take freeze it down for good this time man I wish this thing didn't take so long to get ready I have to make sure he doesn't figure out what I'm doing come on this is getting ridiculous how much longer do you intend to keep that up not sure as long as I have to I guess say you're not in a hurry are you you get mockney I do not understand you sales your kind has been a thorn in my side for as long as I can remember once I destroyed that Saiyan child and this entire planet the Saiyans will finally be no more The Legend of the Super Saiyan will remain just that a legend that's not the Sun what not no we saw it stay here no matter what happens do not leave this spot what is that is that some sort of ball of energy you it's no use if I wants the spirit bomb at him right now he's just gonna dodge it site it doesn't even have enough power to take freeze it down what planning a sneak attack this whole time how pathetic but all of your idiotic planning and effort has gone to waste piccolo hurry up and finish that spirit bomb already thanks piccolo you

and find my friends and get out of here me impossible me no choice it's time to shoot Freeza you know the only reason I'm letting you reach full power because I want to beat you at your best as a warriors I wouldn't have it any other way you want to test out your full power - don't my apologies for the weight as requested this is my full power Goku struggling at this rate he might not be able

already had mr. Popo gather all the Dragon Balls we were planning to use them to revive those currently in your care right because Earth Dragon Balls can revive many people at once but can they revive those who died naturally I'm afraid those who died of natural causes cannot be brought back I suppose such people could be revived if only for the brief time that was taken from them alright yeah here's the wish ask your man to bring back all those that were killed my freezer and his neck what I'll explain you don't have much time so I'll make this quick first we'll use the earth Dragon Balls to revive all those killed by Frieza that you mean on the meccans including grand elder guru should be revived [Music] we've only had two of the three wishes granted with the namekian dragonballs very strange with grand elder guru back we should still be able to make one last wish right with that last wish we'll transport everyone on namet other than freezer to earth oh I get it you've really thought this through King Kai anyway that's the gist of it now hurry planning ham it won't be around much longer oh oh I see I'll summon Shenron right away state your wish I shall grant you any wish that you desire [Music] I'm alive but Alice I was this possible [Music] for what is this place have I returned to the world of the living this is King ty of the North quadrant of the galaxy please listen closely why would you just die this is it I'm going to blow you to a million pieces just like that earthling what are you talking about [Music] are you talking about Krillin [Music] don't you dare talk about drilling and now Planet Namek is about to explode there should be one wish left with the Dragon Balls there I need you to summon Shenron for the last wish ask him to send everyone there except three-judge world I understand King Kai I appreciate your concern but wishes must be made directly I'm afraid I will contact whomever is closest to the Dragon Balls and tell them your wish wait don't make that wish listen to me asked him to lead both Frieza only behind come on asked him you heard as Doku hey I understand what you're trying to do but listen King Kai if you don't let me finish things with Freesat I'm never going to forgive you fine fine I understand that's really where you want [Music] [Music] there my child this is cool [Music] please save your questions I would like you've asked for une got to drag one final wish generally were you asked him to transport all those holonomic except for freesia and was saying local to earth [Music] centenarian is our final wish what that's the dragonballs [Music] [Applause] [Music] this will be sent [Music] my this is a planet called Earth my time is once again at hand I'm afraid but before I leave this world once more I wish to explain what has just happened the battle against that fiend freezer still continues back on our home planet would you look at that you need to speak the local language in order to make a wish it's just us now Freeza me and you fine I've been waiting for this a very curious it would seem you're willing to pay the ultimate price to settle our contract very well [Music] [Music] when I draw the destruction of this planet [Music] you cannot hope to date [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm done you're done this fight is over there's no point anymore I can tell you're afraid I don't need to defeat you anymore you dare mock me I will [Music] you brought this upon yourself Frieza though I have to admit I didn't see it ending quite like this yes you say it I'm going to make my way back to earth you could stay here and suffer the same fate as this planet how can you beg for mercy how many people begged you for mercy before you slaughtered them how many [Music] I've given you just a little bit of my energy that's all you get you're on your own that is why [Music] you
