[Music] um all right we're here you're stealing sirs personnel dossiers the organization is strictly compartmentalized so they aren't stored in one central location cool so we're sparred on spies it wait so how are we going to do that sirs uses a super computer called filament to process information drawn from the ctos network it's like noodle if you could use it to search every document on every civilian government or commercial device everywhere in the united kingdom instantly [ __ ] me sideways you could be horrified if you want but it saved thousands of so this is filament impressive i can help you break in but we're going to leave a trail unless of course malik has an idea there i persuaded filament security to log that spiderbot's activity as system maintenance thanks how's especially helpful of you it's not like the movies spies aren't the police i believe in working with the lesser evils like dedsec to protect society from the greater ones so why did zero day kill all my friends there are differing schools of thought do [Music] spy [ __ ] acquired no no no no no no good work here i've got the list of nasty spies for you right so we do a simple ctos contact analysis and work out who's in charge of zero day i'll have it done before you can say guantanamo i'll handle the classified data thank you very much it would be so much faster if i worked with you in order to do this the people in these dossiers are connected but not necessarily complicit it will take intelligence expertise to separate the wheat from the chaff and when i discover something actionable i will contact you he's disconnected pleasant fella i have malik for you come on we have to meet there's been a complication i can't access the files you stole wait what the files are locked and a moment after we got them i received this hello richard we see you're trying to find us by looking into our associates that's a good idea hope you don't mind if we borrow it who is your masked savior we wonder i've sent bagley the coordinates for a meeting i hope i don't need to explain why this is a priority yourself is you're [ __ ] pathetic no don't get up i need a high ranking sirs officers biometrics eyes and fingers you serious we don't have time for this [ __ ] keep your voice down the data was encrypted so what oh hey i can bypass it not faster than i could and i've tried it's hopeless in the time we have look if you don't help me zero day wins which means we all die [ __ ] me guess i'm cutting off fingers again no high-res photos will do the problem is it has to be the acting home office liaison and sirs will burn their credentials if they're attacked it's protocol so you'll have to get them the old-fashioned way so torture no develop a relationship get someone close and uh take the photos covertly all right no problem this part of the craft can be ugly send someone who can handle it bagley could use some help i suggest you begin your relationship with the sirs home office liaison the way you would with anyone by meticulously pouring over every detail of their life and hunting them down go on the sirs home office liaison is the bridge between the government and its intelligence service their office at dowling street would be a good place to start your relationship that's our play then are you ready for a new operation sure my tails cleared out you require support no point now let's go the sirs home office liaison works here but i'm not seeing them on any unsecured surveillance ah but their assistants here start by hacking them message received be careful open your eyes keep it up is a crime target has escaped searching that's her this could get messy [Music] too what is this much download complete now scarf or they'll kill you for sure got it 16 email threads indicate the home office liaison is a right lush she spends most of her time down at the three hawker boys if you want to seduce sorry start a relationship with her that's as good a place as any drop location on my map wait what was that stand down protocol [Music] clear moving on resume patrol oh my that is this will be prosecuted oh ugh [Music] um did it hurt when you hit every branch falling down that way i'm mixing them up i think oh if that's how you treat a one-liner i shudder to think of what you do with two goodbye sorry it just seemed like you could use some cheering up oh i'm in a great mood actually it's just that i'm wasting my scant leisure time fending off the advantages of a haggard swamp creature [ __ ] you not even in your wildest dreams sweetie i'm still learning the nuances of human interaction but my analysis indicates that you aren't our type great insight bagley quit your whining there's plenty of fish in the sea we've got the biggest saltwater aquarium in town at least one of our fish is bound to be [ __ ] go on just try someone else maybe a woman this time hello hello someone else slapped off work and now it's your turn all right all right this might sound silly but did we match on invite you look so familiar if we didn't i'm going to have their ceo killed oh no i'm sorry i was lying i'm so sorry ah careful who you fibbed to someone almost died we wouldn't want that i should say shall we move this conversation somewhere a bit more private oh my didn't know you could do that what other secrets are you hiding oh i got a draw full of secrets so after all that did you acquire the biometric data did i i'm starting to think that maybe i need to get um biometric data more often brilliant now what it seems you'll have to maintain the ruse a bit longer the upload is still going and i have an incoming connection from the liaison put her through enough crap who the hell are you you working for the russians china [ __ ] america you think i'm a spy oh my gosh that's so flattering thank you oh do shut up upload complete malik is on the line i'm sure he'll be very grateful and polite this will have to do we can meet at westminster abbey to discuss the results and i wanted to say you performed somewhat better than anticipated was that supposed to be a compliment he's disconnected seriously [Music] i've marked the meeting location on your map don't hurry thanks bags okay back office is none of your business sure [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] you've arrived at westminster abbey final resting place of noted cousin [ __ ] king edward the first doesn't sound relevant bagley it is if you're his cousin anyway have a seat i'll notify malik you've arrived oh i have to walk away i haven't slept in 76 hours i can't do this you're just tired no i'm afraid i know who runs zero day and i don't think i can beat her you don't have to give me a name i'm not asking all right i'm trusting you with this my analysis indicates that zero day is led by the current director of sirs counter-terrorism emma child legend has it she's the reason that gorbachev survived the coup in 91 but more than that she's my friend she mentored me through my first field assignment years ago well i hope you said your goodbyes wait wait there's always a margin of error if you go after emma and i'm wrong you'll have her and zero day to contend with confirm it's her before you do anything we'll be careful be right or we'll both be dead i hate to agree with a career snoop but malik is right we need to tread carefully here this is the head of size [ __ ] counter terrorism we're moving against but we're not moving on anyone right not until we have more information emma child is just a lead for now okay i can live with that so how do we find her bagley please filter those says dossiers we stole from charles direct reports and hack their comms that should lead us right to her done oh aren't you clever but we can't just wait around for them to slip up and blab them a child's location we have to make them slip up and call a meeting with her so we do something big something old school dead sec really scare the [ __ ] out of them emma child is the head of sirs counter terror which coordinates operations with albion out of the old mi6 building so if we were to break in and leave a message that we know will get back to her that's a great plan let's do that that is the old mi6 building one of the most prominent intelligence organizations in the world but now thanks to sirs taking over the dark part of every secret scheme and bloody coup in the whole of europe so no huge difference really what am i getting myself into bagley don't scare her you just have to find the central server room and connect us we'll do the rest you've got this uh what was that oh answer me [Music] oh [Music] ah serious huh a clever trick oh that's the case file server there connect badly and we'll take care of it read you loud and clear quick mission update but you have to promise not to be mad ugly come on what is it well since you didn't promise i can't give you the details but suffice to say there's absolute piss bon soon of albion goons heading your way i'd rather not have to kill you today done holy [ __ ] i'm just glad we're on the same side brilliant now get out of there we'll call on you when we've got something oh [Music] oh [Music] won't work on me right there look at that your plan worked there's more buzz coming from emma charts organization than a nest of ready wasps that was really quick well i may have sent everyone in child's inner circle security footage of your little mi6 operations just to speed things up a bit is that safe for us no not really but then you're a violent insurgent who runs around in a colorful mask punching mercenaries stealing top secret intelligence and driving through street cafes define safe i suppose you're right so what next a small group is meeting with emma child in a parking garage they've switched off the cctv cameras but if you connect me to the building ctos hub i can switch them back on because i'm very clever guess that's where we start huh here's something fun i was doing one of my routine head counts and it turns out one of you is completely unaccounted for probably kidnapped oh crap yes i'd say that's an astute summary moments before they disappeared they were in close proximity to a man you victimized a while back finding him is the best chance we have of finding our operative okay i'm on it i'll make myself comfortable standard quadrant search go okay here i'm ready to fire [Music] reminder this is the parking garage where emma child is meeting with her inner circle malik has asked that you confirm she really is in charge of zero day before we do anything so try and hack the camera system to see if we can get a look at that meeting protest valleys ah [ __ ] is next this [Applause] uh [Music] oh bloody hell don't see anyone hey lock it so it's too much of a coincidence he slips away and our case server gets hit richard malik is behind this i've got wetwork assets on standby mrs child malik is dead the moment he services what do you mean the moment he surfaces are you telling me we have nothing yes ma'am for lack of a better word he's vanished hasn't been at work hasn't been at home hasn't bought anything with a card of course he hasn't he's not a [ __ ] he knows our tools we can't rely on filament we have to use our [ __ ] eyes and ears he may have left london perhaps he's hiding out in the country this is why all these excuses smell like oh [ __ ] we do have a supporting theory mum we think malik's been in contact with dedsec it could be there hiding him he's treating london like enemy territory he's made contact with the local insurgency and got them working with him so here's what we're gonna do re-allocate all resources to the dead sec fire we shake that tree long enough malik's bound to fall out do your [ __ ] jobs get out there and kill some terrorists is this area is he's not answering oh crap okay i'm going in [ __ ] you're right go this might be our only chance oh [ __ ] yeah opened a secure optic link to the home secretary if you really want to clear your names for the bombings this may be your chance to gather the evidence get close to the car and i can hack in plugging you into emmachild.com hold on mr secretary i seem to have a communications anomaly probably nothing but let's switch channels to be safe well that's annoying stay close and i'll see if i can get them back we're reallocating resources to the dead sec file mr secretary i wanted to bring this up directly because of the recent incident with your liaison to the service oh oh god you think that was dedsec i thought we'd chop that up to your problem child better malik was it yes auto driver disabled mr secretary there's no evidence that suggests malik may be working with dead sec auto driver this is a disaster it's under control [ __ ] sorry tom but we have to switch channels one moment oh it seems this conspiracy goes all the way to the top or close to it anyway stay nearby we've almost got it please which i had a book to read and just how exactly is any of this under control emma because one of them is currently hacking into my car's com that's where those anomalies are coming from you sound suspiciously calm about that this isn't my first day tom i'm not in the car it's a decoy but it does have an active beacon that's calling albion down right on top of them as we speak i'll have one of them in custody within an hour that was me disconnecting this time you could better run i have manic for you i'm going underground i can't risk direct contact anymore wait a minute did you not hear her she's trying to kill you she's leading zero day i did hear her she knows i'm working with you which means she's closer than i thought i'm sorry but we're out of time goodbye wow you're welcome or whatever [ __ ] we know who's behind zero day now we don't need him we just have to find her as it happens when i was getting intimate with the mi6 server i came across a list of sirs safe houses scattered throughout the city there are quite a few though bagley can you please cross-reference gps signals of child supporters there could be a match somewhere right brilliant prioritize them by likelihood let's get this [ __ ] you
