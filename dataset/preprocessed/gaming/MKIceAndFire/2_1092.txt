huh [Music] spy [ __ ] acquired nicely done ah ugh here i've got the list of nasty spice for you right so we do a simple ctos contact analysis and work out who's in charge of zero day i'll have it done before you can say guantanamo i'll handle the classified data thank you very much it would be so much faster if i worked with you in order to do this the people in these dossiers are connected but not necessarily complicit it will take intelligence expertise to separate the wheat from the chaff and when i discover something actionable i will contact you he's disconnected pleasant seller one odd thing i hate putting mary kelly on the back burner while she continues to destroy lives with those microchips but for now we've no choice then perhaps it's time to have a closer look at the elephant in the room nigel cass billionaire warmonger and current ceo of our local board of thugs albion bmc from the bombings we can inspire london to resist from now till forever but it still won't break albion's grip on the city not with cass at the top okay so we're going to confront the ceo of a private military company in charge of securing london that sounds [ __ ] stupid i hope you've got more of a plan than just knocking on his front door bagley's come across a possible gap in casa's armor an ex-insider ex-friend with an axe to grind he'd be an asset if we could find and convince him to work with us come to the safe house right let's talk about albion pmc the only british organization to successfully oppress more of the developing world than the british government led by nigel cass a man the partizan media calls a charismatic visionary an amnesty international calls a war criminal albion was given the key to the city to re-establish order following the bombings which is suspicious timing if you ask me it is so that's two reasons why we need to find an angle on cass we've found one his name hamish balaji born in london bellagi was a recipient of the cass foundation technical scholarship of 14 which included a mentorship with cass himself at 16 balaji designed cassie's first drone fleet fun fact caster laid the launch by a week so it would land on balaji's birthday cast sounds like balaji's second dad why would he help us they had a falling out after an incident in the night at delta three years ago a buried human rights investigation accuses cass of ordering a drone fleet to wipe out a village protesting the construction of a pipeline but the drones malfunctioned before they could but largely his name is the likely saboteur he's been on the run ever since but now tracking data shows he's reappeared in london [ __ ] he's looking for redemption like with the protesters this guy designed casa's drone fleet i think he's trying to disarm albion he covers his tracks well but that's a good guess unfortunately according to this albion intelligence report intercepted by our friend caitlin lao cass knows baladi's in london as well so that's the op make contact with balaji before albion finds him then convince him we have a mutual enemy in cass so this guy's our best chance to stop albion and clear our names and the largest private army on earth wants him dead no pressure it took some doing but i've narrowed down the area where we're most likely to find hamish balagi i've pushed the coordinates to your optic you've been activated do you need a minute nope this won't solve any of your problems for them justices oh [Music] oh received we are trailing the target negative no vision of the suspect [Music] control i can't see the suspect please advise control we're heading back [Music] look at yourself i never thought [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] affairs quietly of course but i've been able to determine that most of his activity stems from this area let's say hi then not so fast hey miss isn't in according to his home security before you get ideas he's rigged his front door to a series of traps designed to delete all of his data and then your life not necessarily in that order paranoid can't blame him to be fair you are an armed insurgent trying to break into his flat anyway you should be able to connect to the local grid and use security cameras to disarm his traps grand okay stop where you are you're leaving in cups i believe the main interface is on the rooftop i'm seeing windows any thoughts ugly sure if you can get there three options here one use the window washing platform two find a cargo drone three give up go home and resolve to be a better person my money huh this hamish doesn't strike me as overly welcome but he is cool with traps you could force the traps to unlock by rewiring the power [Music] on the back of your money disturb you in time you'll barely feel it we have to wake up people if there was a playbook for setting up a totalitarian police state alvia will be most of the way through it and working on the ending will only get tighter uh the traps are disarmed now if you go through the front door of the flat it's much less likely you'll be killed is ah stupid [ __ ] gadgets rubbish i hate this thing interesting ah hell yes [Music] move one more muscle chief and i'll blow the whole place with you in it all right now need to get excited who the [ __ ] are you and what are you doing in my flat you with albion no in fact we're more like the opposite what did sick yeah right nam che guevara you're done [Music] wait wait i'll be announced you're in london kill me if you've got but you've gotta run now [ __ ] me you're telling the truth aren't you [ __ ] hell thought i was careful [ __ ] idiot amish look cuss is worse than you know believe me we know who else would i be risking my eyes here maybe because nigel cass is paying you that's a [ __ ] merk's work listen we want your help cars is now a friend of ours he tried to kill us and had a hand in the bombings mate you don't know [ __ ] you have no idea what class is and what oh [ __ ] you know i'll be in squad's closing in on you because you weren't lying about that [ __ ] thinking [ __ ] fine i'll buy you some time just go stop [ __ ] don't just stand there albion won't be fussy about who they shoot send emergency vehicles which one any other patrols have eyes on the suspect over control let's put out an apw we're getting nowhere here i think all that excitement convinced our new friend hamish that we need to work together to tackle cass he's willing to cooperate you
