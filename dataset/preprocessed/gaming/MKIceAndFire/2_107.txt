machine's resistant to fire [Music] wow let's see what i can do with this [Music] not [Music] [Music] huh [Music] okay [Music] [Music] it's distracted there's the tallneck that signaled my focus full but my stash has moved no talks something seems to have knocked the tallneck down maybe the current better take a look at the damage uh might be able to find the parts [Music] must be up there somewhere i just have to get to them [Music] huh i can't talk nests i wonder if this is where those sunken tallneck parts ended up i should get back to the nest pick up the machine part i saw i guess i'm picking this up that's the end of that and i got a hold of one of those tallneck parts down one to go [Music] oh shine's on onto me huh i guess we're on here now i can pick up that part i saw back at the nest the second tallneck part i'll be taking that you're on card for now [Music] [Music] what's up [Music] lightning coursing through us whoa ugh picked up the last of the parts i need i should get these back [Music] this will be my stash when i pressure to return these i think [Music] [Music] that's how this works there we go one more to go i should do it welcome back i just need to find a way to climb aboard if i can get on land i might be able to jump onto that tonic [Music] i should be able to jump onto the tunnel [Music] made it now to climb up to its head there we go time to override the big guy it's all right [Music] good [Music] [Music] i can get it from my stash later [Music] uh [Music] hmm hmm another drone keeping watch on the biosphere i should grab its data but how am i going to get it down it must be the entrance to landfall about [Music] hey hey is that her the living ancestor this is landfall right i'm looking for alva oversee your bohai ordered us to invite you before him should you approach please come with me go let him know we're coming it's her the diviner was right overseer bohi a stranger just walked through the gate i knew alva would not dare lie you do look like sobek is over here i need to talk to her i will consider your request once it is determined what you are a living ancestor as alva believes or a threat lurking in such a guise i am no threat okay back on the mainland your soldiers fired on me without warning so you say infidel none of those you engaged survived to bear witness i held off on your squad when may i present our honored co so here she is our great mystery well bow high what have you defined what is she a mystery indeed my myceo how can she appear as sobek and yet know nothing of our ways are we to believe that a living ancestor was born to this wretched land an ocean apart from the realm of the chosen and if so to what end i cannot answer only she can but i warn you no falsehood will satisfy us now speak why are you here what is your purpose i'm looking for a place called thebes and what do you seek there alva told me a little bit about what you're after i guess you could say i want what you want a way to heal the world as i suspected tell her we found thieves the final resting place of ted pharaoh's secrets it isn't far but the way is closed to us machine attacks have cut us off from the site diviner alva is there along with a compliment of diggers and soldiers is she all right our scouts tell us that the machine has our people pinned behind their defenses but they're holding out machines huh i can help with that alva told us that you are indeed formidable but i have a few questions first we will answer what we can so you found thieves how the ancestors revealed it to us not long after we made landfall almost a year ago through a scrap of ancient data discovered by alva and verified by myself it contained details about the construction of a great underground palace where exactly close beneath the great pyramid in the ruins beyond figures ted loves his pyramids have you been inside no that has been a problem one of many and we will solve them all in time getting back to the site is the one at hand i hope you're as effective against machines as diviner alva suggested what exactly are you looking for inside thieps i thought alva brought back the data you needed we risked much to cross the ocean therefore we must unearth every possible link to the legacy while we are here especially one as important as thieves we will not sail back until i have plundered its secrets so alva reports to you i was chosen by my colleagues on the board of overseers to supervise data retrieval on this expedition yes and you're in charge of the expedition he is far more than that you are addressing the cousin of the emperor of the quinn heir to the vast holdings of the great delta the first co in five generations all she needs to understand is that i am the authority here and my will is to attain the secrets of thebes mine too we're in luck you crossed the ocean on these ships couldn't have been easy greatness is never easy indeed it took seven years just to build the flotilla this expedition is the most important undertaking of our generation a quest for knowledge across the gaping sea with nothing less than the fate of our tribe at stake and none of it would have been possible without the will of the co the voyage was difficult the wilds here even more so our sailors and soldiers have suffered much i know that but all for the glory of the queen good to know what kind of machine has your people pinned down near thieves a thunderjaw we've dealt with them before but this one is tougher stronger than it has black armor yes how did you know it doesn't matter won't be easy but i can take it down then destiny shines upon us as i knew it would a living ancestor now walks among us and she will help me attain the secrets of thieves resupply here if you must then on the thieves at the base of the pyramid in the ruins we will follow when our scouts confirm you've cleared the way it's true keep an eye on her a living ancestor walks among us i didn't believe but now i see you truly are an ancestor reborn a good omen if i ever someone let me scout for the expedition whatever i learn of this strange land i will share with you as is my duty to the ancestors i should tell my you scouts found ancient ruins west of here they claimed to have seen a relic of the ancestors inside but couldn't find a way to retrieve it perhaps a living ancestor could discover a way where others could not maybe if i find myself in the area the muscles strengthened so [Music] my work say hey you're back okay off to the big pyramid to fight the thunderjaw i am open to trump brace myself against this windows having a good day out a barbarian run stranger there's a killer machine about there you are i guess we're doing this [Music] huh oh nice but i can use that i need to get my standard back so thank no i can keep going [Music] oh guys [Music] get this from my stash when i need it stranger over here you killed that machine your ceo sent me i need to speak to alva by all means then open the gates come on over you hey a word over here i'm glad you're okay oh you got rid of that machine but what are you doing here there's something inside thieves that i need i went to landfall i met your c.o we came to an agreement kind of and you're going to help us get in i guess so the whole thing was a little tense there's something off about that guy and i don't understand what he wants from thieves i thought we found the data that your people needed back on the mainland that data will take us years to sift through the ceo wants faster results eloy you have to be careful he's there they are the legacy tells us that elizabeth sobeck helped the ancestors cast aside all obstacles and so it has been today you have been true to your word i'm pleased thieves awaits us below shall we quite an excavation much of this was flooded we had to pump a great deal of water out behold the door to thieves a door like no other well you're right about that it's designed to open for only one man ted pharaoh but the legacy tells us that he worked closely with sobek he trusted her surely she could open the door and so surely can you not gonna happen at least not from this side you said she was a living ancestor with sobek's eternal essence uh if i may pharaoh great as he was did not build his palace alone we know this from scraps of data we found the ones that pointed to this location and we found evidence of passages below maybe they were built to aid construction or for servants we can't reach them the way is flooded and they're too far underwater but yeah i can reach them there might be another way in down there you see with sobek there is always a way then do what you must to get us inside it's huge [Music] there's a rupture up there maybe a way in yeah this could get me inside okay looks like this tunnel leads deeper into the structure [Music] to get past it there's gotta be a way to stop that turbine around here somewhere stop the turbine good [Applause] looks like an exercise room here i am again hiding in the gym writing to stay sane in this crazy place i can't believe gregory's dead our so-called spiritual leader was fine yesterday and then suddenly passed away in his sleep and no one will talk to me about it they treat me like a child whispering behind my back as if i can't cope with death even after the end of the world the living area it's pretty big too there's nothing normal about a scientist his daughter a guru and well let's face it a harem living through the end times in the trillionaires underground survival bunker but now that gregory's gone i'm worried things will get even weirder he helped keep ted stable for a couple of years sort of without him who knows and we don't even understand what happened to him let's hope this is the way to the main door so i can let the queen what uh [Music] i know everyone's reeling after grigori's uh untimely demise he was a deeply spiritual man who wasn't afraid to rip back the curtain and gaze where few men dare i've asked dr sometime to you know check on what happened to him i'm sure he had some kind of condition or something the main point is that while we certainly miss him we will go on everything is going to be okay look at this place it's pretty fancy for a survival bunker there the door let's hope i can open it from the inside [Music] the door is open destiny is upon us i knew you could do it what's going on the co is preparing to enter thieves [Music] oh why are you dressed like ted farrow i am pharaoh renewed my essence is the same as his across the years across the generations his soul is my soul his will is my will we are sundered in only one way i need his final testament his deepest secrets and now that the door is open those secrets are within my grasp when i have them i will be complete as he was i will have everything i need to save our homeland and as pharaoh did the world [Music] okay i think there's some confusion here about who pharaoh really was no one knows better than i who he was who he is me the renewer greatest of the ancestors the man who saved the world and you you understand sobek you are her pharaoh's harbinger his assistant come we will descend into thieves together as it should be bring her the raymond raymond as he is pharaoh you are sobek for an occasion this momentous shouldn't you wear proper business attire no no no no i am not wearing that no way you will wear the proper attire to mark this moment or what it is said sobek valued life above all else is this true fine i'll wear your raiment [Music] [Music] excellent shall we proceed [Music] look at this place the grandeur pharaoh's domain simply breathtaking excellent somewhere in here pharaoh left his secrets let's go find them you're magnificent perhaps we should leave guards behind to cover our exits indeed let it be done most of ted's women repulse me okay they're like contestants on a housewife sim preening for the hubby's attention but brianna the hollow singer she's different she's always been nice to me and i love her voice which has been conspicuously silent since gregory died she doesn't speculate or gossip like the others she knows something i can tell and i'm gonna find out what it is as destiny intended for me pharaoh's visage a monument to greatness truly marcia it's a monument to something i'll give you that the emperor will keep rewards upon you for this my ceo great risks bring great bounties overseer i think this way might lead down excellent remember every detail it will be its no less than he deserves of course wonder if pharaoh there will be no further discussion of your feet bow hi brianna told me that gregory hacked into restricted files and found out something awful that ted murdered important people who worked on zero dawn did ted punish gregory [Music] kill him for discovering what he did how could that be dad said there wasn't a mark on kakori's body his heart just gave out [Music] [Music] so hey this is weird yeah i tried to warn you yeah sort of i'll explain everything if we survive long enough those certainly look threatening ah statues the guardians of pharaoh's domain those aren't statues look out get the co out of here i guess it's just us then don't oh it's not a bad oh [Music] you're defeating the machines the surface a wise choice we can't afford to lose any more diviners than necessary so no more delays we must proceed ah rihanna didn't wake up this morning she's gone just like grigori and looking up at the giant hidden statue of ted in the great hall at his eyes and i know now that he's watching me he's watching us all he's always had power over us i just never knew how much yes when i built this place when its special systems were designed i knew what i wanted protection of course an unlimited power source that was a given but also control over every possible eventuality after all you never know what will happen especially when the human element is involved [Music] ever deeper we go what is that a reclining throne attached to some kind of apparatus i wonder what it does an impressive setup what is it for i'm sorry co i don't know my focus can't read the data here what about the living ancestor is the data lost to her scan the device if you will you did this for him you put like off switches in everyone's heads can you you mustn't judge me i had no choice if i said no what would he do to us what would he do to you you're my little girl i was trying to keep you alive for what dad seriously why so we can be trapped in this underground nightmare you know what we have to do please [Music] please scan the device tell me what your focus reveals about the device made a minor adjustment to the gene therapy regimen and added a new cocktail to treat the symptoms caused by the mutations hopefully there will be some stabilization after the next treatment god knows what ted will do to us if there isn't the early results were so promising no signs of aging no cellular degeneration but now oh if only i had access to my old lab in bangkok or my old colleagues or my old liquor cabinet stop it got to stay positive for kenya you saw something i could tell did the data explain what pharaoh used this device for i think he was undergoing treatments to live longer a lot longer really could he still be alive don't be foolish if he were alive you would have kept his essence it would not have been passed down to me remember he was the renewer of course he would have stopped at nothing to grasp the secrets of life and death but not for himself everything he did was for a new beginning for us for the queen and for his true heir me you know i'm starting to think you're right you do have a lot in common with ted farrow i knew you would see in time let us continue his secrets await hmm is that a small office for a minor functionary perhaps [Music] look at all this equipment an automated geothermal energy plant right under the city of san francisco a marvel even i can run it and let's face it i was always more of a visionary than an engineer which is why i had the foresight to insist on the inclusion of a very unique feature just in case anyone ever tries to steal my cheese so to speak we are getting closer to the heart of this place i can feel it break the door down i'm going to look for another way in good idea it's worked before very well get to it it's not hacking to that hurry break it open she's gone did she make it to the other side our maybe i can access ted's files from here there omega clearance what do you have to say for yourself ted sometimes dead along with his kid found him on the floor of his office this morning holding hands must have poisoned themselves i never would have put them to sleep she was just a girl for christ's sake i offered him life and this is how they repaid me by leaving me all alone but i guess i've been alone since this whole thing began alone in bearing the burden for the past for the future same old ted no matter who dies he's the one feeling sorry for himself bless his future bless his children someday they'll come and i'll be here to greet them if anything my cells are replenishing faster than normal i just need some time for the mutations to calm down time and energy sometimes if they react you can give me what i need to grow strong again to get my back together so i can greet the kids [Music] they're gonna need me my advice [Music] are they here uh not the ones you're looking for then they must be in there trust me you don't want to go in there are you mad i haven't come all this way to stop now [Music] at last pharaoh's legacy is mine [Music] is that it's him burn it to ash wait no pharaoh has it rigged to melt down [Music] kill them too no witnesses [Music] i needed that hang in there ugh oh pharaoh rigged the reactor to overflow if he dies we have to run we have no choice [Music] oh very pleased i've got eyes on this already get moving call me sire come on out of my way oh [Music] back up we're closer ah are you okay we uh we found something that will help not just your homeland but everywhere but where's the co oh he's gone i guess you could say he gave his life to help us attain the secrets of thebes i see you must think i'm eminently stupid what no no the co was an entitled egotist who twisted our beliefs into a sickening self-serving fantasy and you expect me to believe he sacrificed himself for scraps of data it's time for the truth and it better be convincing otherwise i'll simply order these soldiers to open fire hold on you're right to be honest the co screwed everything up he brought thebes down around our ears and died like a gutless coward but we really did find something down there that will help your homeland if i can take it and use it now if i have to i will fight my way out of here but it doesn't have to be that way you can just let me go and then take credit when things start to improve success certainly does sound better than failure it seems then that our destinies are intertwined landfall is open to you if it will help your cause you may come and go as you please but alva must join you and report back on your efforts fair enough thieves is of no further value to us obviously we're going back to the flotilla alva i expect your reports to be thorough oh i thought he was going to have us killed ah and instead i get to join you glad to have you but you're going to need a little help to reach our base varl i made a new friend i need you to meet her at the queen fairy and escort her back on it can't wait to meet her trust me you'll love it there var will give you a better focus and all the data you could ever want head to the ferry i'll join you back east as soon as i can a diviner must follow the truth wherever it leads i'll see you there now that i have omega clearance we should have what we need to capture asbestos but before i head to the ferry maybe i should stop by landfall with the co gone maybe more quinn will be willing to talk might be worth looking around the island too i gotta change out of these clothes i can't believe the co made me play dress-up [Music] [Music] oh cold enough for a snow [Music] i just don't get this last part maybe we can look at it together later have a conversation about it i'd like that from the look on your face i'd say the mission was a success i got omega clearance is everyone ready to head out to cauldron gemini as soon as you give the word did olva make it here all right our new queen friend the moment she laid eyes on the archives she jumped on them like a long leg sounds about right once gaia is back up and running i expect you to put all your training to good use the seeds have been planted all they need is a chance to bloom what i thought that was pretty good zoe liked it i'm glad you and zoe found each other don't forget you're to blame for that now that i have omega clearance we can grab hephaestus and finally have the advantage over the zenith can't wait to see their faces as they stare down a bunch of charging thunderjaws better them than us for once i should go get this to gaia of course let us know when we're needed welcome back good to be back have you met our new quinn guest yet i could barely keep up as she gave herself a tour of the base vara gave her a new focus though when he told her she was free to access all the data we had here she turned so pale i i thought she'd faint on the spot we showed her to the archive room so she could see for herself she hasn't left the place since sounds like alba read anything interesting lately i found out the old ones used leaf infusions like the uttaru do tea they call it apparently it helped soothe them that and some sort of scented wax they used to cleanse their aura plus something called bubble baths me i think i'll stick to singing to calm the nerves how are things with everyone slightly quieter aaron's been busy scouring data on his newest obsession apparently the old ones wrestled machines as some kind of performance called it metal versus meat a must-see battle between steel and flesh as aaron likes to put it you'd think we have enough of that going around as it is i need to get going right you've retrieved the omega clearance that means we'll be going after hephaestus soon i'll make sure my gear is ready there she is i hear you found thebes how was it maniacs lava what's not to like i remember that next time i go traveling at least i got what we needed to trap hephaestus good thing i got my gear ready then you look tired huh you'll never want to hold back are you i've just been making sure that i got everything down for this mission of yours i don't want to be the usual screw-up out there he'll do fine aaron have you spoken with alva yet yeah when she's not reading the archives like a giddy kid drinking her first ale she took to that new focus quick that's for sure i gotta say i'm a little jealous but i can see why you two hit it off i should get going as soon as you want us heading out to those cauldrons i'll give you the heads up aloy right to work i see there's just so much i mean we knew of artificial beings that served the ancestors but gaia oh she's amazing and you a true reincarnation of an ancestor genetically speaking of course not like the um late co and there's more ancestors out there returned from beyond the stars of course they're trying to kill us which is not great and eric visser is with them which is disturbing and then there's hephaestus and okay okay how about we take it one step at a time you're right i also owe you an explanation for everything that happened at landfall i see you've been using your new focus it's been fascinating so much better than the version the queen have what would have taken me years to sort through like the database you helped me recover with this i've been able to establish search parameters to speed up the process this could revolutionize how diviners analyze the legacy that is whatever part of it the overseers would actually let us study you wanted data you'll find lots of it here a diviner has never had this sort of unsupervised access to archives such as this and knowing you i suspect there is much that would normally be forbidden held within them but i was sent here to help you i would be remiss to ignore any truth laid before me maybe it'll help the queen find their way back to the path of truth you mentioned eric visser how do you know about him the zenith who tried to kill you he is known to the queen as the protector combing through data related to his work led us to breakthroughs related to weapons and military tactics knowledge our rulers use to conquer and expand to become the empire we are today that's why he's one of our most revered ancestors but based on your encounter with him it appears he's even more ruthless than we ever imagined yet another distorted interpretation in the legacy well at least you're piecing together the truth if only the overseers back home would do the same beta mentioned other zenith tilda verbena and gerard i'm afraid i don't know anything about them whatever legacy they left behind the diviners haven't recovered i imagine you don't know anyone here that well yet but they're a good group it's funny because one of your friends is well another you not that you are the same person at all i mean you are as in you're both genetically elizabeth sobeck but even so you're different yeah we are i hope everyone's been treating you okay oh yeah of course they've all been extremely welcoming and they share the knowledge they learn on their focuses with each other freely it's refreshing back home diviners can only share data with the permission from the overseers sounds restrictive i'm stifling yeah you are not wrong you said you owed me an explanation for what happened in thebes i'm listening right i'll start at the beginning with the co he was an imperial the emperor's nephew in fact as such he sponsored many diviners to search the legacy for anything that might help the tribe and himself he took a special interest in anything related to ted farrow whom we consider the greatest of the ancestors ted farrow revered ancestor that's tough to take i know better now of course anyway the diviners discovered that pharaoh spent a great deal of time in san francisco in fact many of the most important ancestors did so the emperor's nephew convinced him that an expedition across the ocean might solve our most pressing problems if only we could find the right data in this fabled city perhaps we could roll back the floods and storms that threatened our people the emperor declared that all the tribe's resources be poured into this endeavor dozens of ships were built scouting missions were dispatched and the emperor's nephew was named ceo one who wields the legacy for the good of the empire the living embodiment of ted pharaoh a renewer it may seem strange now but for a time he carried all of our hopes we really believed he would save us we had no idea just how perilous the journey would be you said the expedition across the sea was more dangerous than you thought it would be what happened we lost most of our ships to hurricanes and scores of soldiers perished to hunger and disease and that was before we even hit the coast once we landed machines ripped our patrols apart and we struggled to replenish our rations there were bright spots to be sure we found thieves and the greenhouse but nothing improved the seo's mood as his dreams of saving the tribe were slowly dashed he became more and more obsessed with thebes and what lay behind its door and more and more convinced that the title of ceo was no mere honorific you heard him spouting nonsense about pharaoh's essence and some kind of becoming we knew these weren't the words of a sane man but he was quick to put any who spoke out in front of a firing squad what a great guy the quen are wrong about many things when it comes to the legacy i can see that now but what the ceo became was a complete perversion of what principal diviners stand for the pursuit of truth uh i'm sorry you had to endure his madness i'm just glad it's over for everyone [Music] so bow high your overseer will he run things better than ceo he won't execute people on a whim if that's what you mean but he's hardly a paragon of integrity i can't tell you how many times he took credit for data in the legacy that i uncovered the best thing i can say about him is that he can be trusted to always do what's best for him yep sounds about right back at the greenhouse you spoke of knowledge forbidden to your people diviners are meant to seek out the truth in the legacy and many imperials sponsor them in the hopes they'll find something the empire can put to use thus gaining favor with the emperor but the board of overseers claims certain truths are detrimental to the stability of the empire like discovering one of our revered ancestors ended the world that is why diviners are only allowed to access segments of the legacy only overseers can view it all it ensures that any heretical data can be contained and retrieved before it can spread what happens to diviners who break the rules i never had the courage to ask the ancestors is that what your people call the old ones yes and no the ancestors are the greatest of the old ones those whose legacy taught us agriculture medicine warfare leadership and patronage of the science and arts the ceo called elizabeth sobek an assistant what's that about right well any old one who has made minor contributions or worked extensively under one of the ancestors is called an assistant that's how we thought of sobek until we met you our limited access to data past the late 2040s has obviously misinformed our view of the past you mentioned the reason you came here was to help your family your sister her name is alika our parents are commoners peasants really when i passed the divination exams they were so proud it brought honor to our family and increased rations only alika begged me not to leave for the research academy why what happens there alika knew that once you enter you're not allowed to leave or see anyone not even your family unless you can get special permission and an escort by an overseer sounds harsh like the focuses we keep diviners are few in number and the empire is well fearful that outsiders will try to steal our knowledge last time i was allowed to see my family was just before our voyage here because of my position i was able to get them refuge from the floods within the capital but if our crops don't recover soon they'll starve to death along with everyone else i promise i'll do my best to make sure it doesn't come to that i need to get going but if you need anything all i need is to help you succeed in your mission the plan gaia told me about to capture hephaestus it will help set things right i hope so then i will do whatever i can i promise [Music] [Music] is it me or did the old ones just look funny funny how they're close they're weird they're so tight for once i'd have to agree i'd rip those things to shreds in a fight guess they didn't move around as much hey well matt we've been briefed on our mission and are ready whenever you wish to head to cauldron gemini were you able to finish the new arm guy i was helping you with indeed i was hoping we could discuss it if you have a moment you wanted to talk about your arm indeed it's time to test it and i want you to be there okay how are we doing this not how where will you meet me where we felt regala's tremor tusk right where the river burns sure if you want but i'm not sure i understand you'll see when we get there i promise then i'll let you know when i get close you have my thanks eloy [Music] how are your studies going i wanted to learn more about the world of the old ones and i looked up this pharaoh gaia said you went looking for and learned about the plague of machines he unleashed to think that the ancient world was wiped out by a mistake a single miscalculation there is no glory or honor and such a fate only hubris and pointless death that about sums it up have you spoken with alva the queen is peculiar nothing like a tanakh her mind is sharp that much is certain but it's hard to imagine her surviving in the wild trust me she's tougher than she looks i will take your word for it [Music] i have to go now then do not let me keep you like i said i'll call you when i'm close to regala's old outpost near the bulwark may the 10 guide your way welcome back [Music] there we go more data for the dome i like this one aylor i know your experience in thieves was unsettling but we have a new problem did something go wrong with beta and the rig will we be able to transport you to gemini the rig is complete the problem is hephaestus itself it has accelerated its proliferation throughout the cauldron network increasing its power but with your sub functions restored we can still succeed right correct but the net effect is that absorbing hephaestus will take longer than previously calculated how long even with omega clearance my current estimate is that the merge will take 35 hours and each hour increases the risk of detection by the zeniths two course two overrides what if the merge were carried out by two clones of elizabeth sobek both armed with omega clearance how long then half the time hephaestus would be unprepared for the simultaneous labor of two operators in addition to obvious synergetic efficiencies calculating it would reduce the merge time to approximately 4.5 hours okay farl it looks like we're gonna need beta gemini do you think you can convince her uh i don't know but i'll try what about our diversion are the pulse generators ready only a final test remains i am confident that if fired in proximity to other cauldrons the pulses will mask our activities at gemini from the zeniths good as long as aaron can operate one without shooting himself in the face hey you better get down here beta's in bad shape okay aloy i tried but it's impossible i don't think anything will convince her to go we don't have a choice good luck beta you have to come with us it's the only way it's one mission the most important one we need you [Music] tell me why you won't go what if they what if they take me back alone in a cell again their slave forever [Music] laurel and i will be at gemiini too i'll protect you as soon as we get a festus we'll come straight back here the zeniths aren't going to find us you don't have to be afraid [Music] no you can't protect me nothing can protect me from them [Music] i told you from the beginning we'll never beat them it's hopeless leave me alone you don't understand [Music] you're right i don't understand we have the same genes the same mind the same heart so why can't you find the strength to do what has to be done like elizabeth would don't you think i thought about that i don't know what piece of elizabeth i'm missing i don't know what you have that i don't i look through all the data from your focus you were raised as an outcast shunned and isolated just like me so what's the difference what's my defect [Music] peter [Music] you don't have a defect [Music] beta look it's not a piece of elizabeth [Music] the difference is i had him crossed he raised you trained you but he was never warm or loving the day he died the day he gave you that charm he was going to abandon you he wanted me to embrace the tribe but then he gave his life for mine he loved me in his own way and that was enough what if you feel like [Music] it was like having the strength that was always there it's still there even now i hear him in my head when things get bad but it looks impossible look deeper and then fight like you can win [Music] you don't have to go on a mission we'll find another way [Music] i'll go you said you'd try to protect me [Music] i believe you [Music] but you have to promise me one thing yes of course if it goes bad [Music] if the zeniths find us i don't want to be their slave again do you understand [Music] okay promise i promise [Music] i could use as much time as you can give me to study up on the merge to make it as efficient as possible [Music] i'll be ready when you are i swear [Music] whenever you are ready come speak to me and i'll ask the others to make final preparations for the mission the old ones fed off livestock a little too much for my liking some of them ate more like the utaru called themselves vegetarians from what i'm reading all the old ones wanted to eat was this stuff called chocolate hey everything okay with you and beta it sounded like you guys had a uh lively conversation we just had a lot to talk about does this mean she's coming with us to gemini it does i hope you're ready to reign in the most stubborn ai of all time that's what all this was for wasn't it hephaestus won't go down quietly hephaestus is just a program that's lost its way we are fighting for our survival i can always call upon the goddess if you're nervous funny [Music] i hope firing off those pulse generators will be enough to distract the zeniths it'll work it has to always optimistic huh nah just stubborn it's a good quality to have when dealing with you yeah right any last findings you want to share before leaving not really though i've reached a decision oh when we put gaia together i want to return to the nora spread what i've learned you think they'll listen to you in time i believe so if anyone can make it happen it's you fall what will you and zoe do if you go back to the embrace i hope she'll come with me at least for a while and i'll go with her to plain song too she'll probably want to talk to her people about all this as well we'll figure it out i know you will how does everyone seem to you anxious but ready i heard kotalo ask for alva's help with his pulse generator and i know he's been helping her with a few fighting techniques just in case i hope they aren't needed like i said just in case you were right you know about keeping rost's memories buried i guess part of me thought he was holding me back because he wanted me to be a nora but the truth is he gave me a lot and i took him for granted he was a good man he raised you well [Music] i'm glad you're coming with me viral sure there's no urge to run off alone in there somewhere no more running hey i thought i'd check in before leaving for gemiini are you sure we shouldn't be checking up on you whatever went on between you and beta sounded intense not that i'm judging forge knows all the screws flew loose every time ursa and i fought i think we'll be fine from now on i'm glad to hear it after we get hephaestus we'll be taking the fight to the zeniths so no more reading i wasn't that bad not really besides going through all that data helped me realize something you know the soldiers the the ones that fought the pharaoh machines so gaia could be built they were fighting a battle that couldn't be won not with all the weapons in the world i think most of them realized that whether anyone said it or not they still did it though they bought time for all the eggheads working to save the future our future as long as i can do that for you i'll consider myself a success thank you aaron i'm glad you're with me okay enough i'm gonna get emotional anybody take you up on that ale you brought yet zoe can't stand the smell of it i tried alva but i don't think she knows what taking a break means and i'm not putting verl anywhere near that stuff after that victory party in meridian what about catalo anna there's a man that can hold his liquor pretty sure we downed half a keg we had a good chat i think i should go that's same here i got a date with a cauldron to prepare for hey we'll be going after hephaestus soon you good with the plan i've already got the location of my assigned cauldron good i heard you and beta had it talk news travels fast it wasn't exactly a quiet conversation there were just things that needed to be said a healthy crop to those who clear the weeds between them as the utaru say you look like you have something on your mind we're going to war soon and war is something i promised myself i'd left behind in the red raids but the more of your data i go through every voice i hear every word i read from her ancient past it makes me realize just how much life was given so that ours could flourish fighting for that gift it's our responsibility if we fail it was all for naught helps to know you're not alone for a moment there you sounded like farl i don't know what you're talking about i should go as soon as you intend to leave for gemiini you'll hear about it i hope i'm not interrupting not at all i was just studying the pulse generator schematics the ones gaia and beta built but craftsmanship is remarkable is everything all right it sounded like there was an uh issue with beta and the mission not anymore we just needed to talk some things through to understand one another is to embrace truth oh and uh if you have a moment there's something i could use your help with any more data catch your eye all of it i have so much to study up on years actually i'm particularly interested in the odyssey we knew the ancestors had made it to the moon in fact we theorized some of them had settled on it but sirius is way farther than that and we thought journeying across the ocean would be the feat of a lifetime the sheer calculations needed for space travel it's overwhelming to think about even so the queen are way ahead of other tribes when it comes to understanding this stuff where i grew up everyone thought that stars were sparks that rose from a fire lit by the goddess to guide us through the night have you spoken with zoedle a little bit but uh i did hear her singing with farl not too long ago i don't think they noticed so seemed so uh free when she did it like every emotion she had was taking flight in song and she looked happier because of it uh i felt so dull and nervous in comparison you should ask so to teach you sometime about utaru music maybe if you need anything before heading out to the cauldrons you have nothing to worry about gaia's explained your plan in detail as expected from such an efficient ai i've even received some very um uh succinct combat advice from kotalo you know uh in case the zenith show up what kind of advice he um told me to run for now we'll even the odds soon enough must be strange to think that some of the ancestors your tribe reveres are still alive and here on earth right now yeah it is part of me is curious to know who else besides eric visser might be among them maybe nikita orond we call her the spark the legacy tells us she brought unlimited energy to the old ones or sung zhao whom we call the healer it is said she found new ways to extend the ancestors lifespans but my curiosity fades when i think of how different our view of visser was compared to the reality that you experienced perhaps it is better not to know you mentioned there was something you needed help with yes uh so as i was sifting through data from the greenhouse i found references to an old world system back in the great delta it's called leviathan my people discovered it decades ago a sprawling network of river gates and a labyrinth of underground tunnels the legacy revealed that the old ones used it to control flooding but we've never gotten it to work the whole thing is shut down but the data from the greenhouse mentions the research facility where leviathan was created it's in san francisco another pharaoh facility no leviathan was a project by aileen sasaki another ancestor so the legacy tells us anyway if we can acquire that data we might be able to fix the system back in the great delta every year my sister gets terrified when the long rains begin with leviathan maybe she won't have to be okay so where in san francisco is this facility that's the thing the data doesn't say where exactly but one of our diviners has been exploring the ruins he might know would you come with me i have a feeling that wherever this facility is well you're much better at fighting machines than i am of course i'll let you know when i'm in landfall thank you hey i should go make sure you talk to gaia if you have any questions about the pulse generators may your path lead to truth [Music] and like i said i'll let you know when i'm in landfill we'll find the data you're after i appreciate it [Music] we just need to find the right strategy hey loy are you well had a bit of an issue with beta it's better now though ah i'm not surprised really why not i once knew a warrior who discovered he had a brother late in life it was deeply uncomfortable for him did he ever get over it in time but not before the two siblings nearly killed each other in a single combat challenge ah well at least i avoided that think you're ready to put all your training to the test i am to knocked i am always ready you nervous about the mission ahead if i live it will be in victory if i die it will be in battle what matters most is that you achieve your objective i'll do my best i should go get ready i await your orders [Music] hello again eloy hello eli hey gaia so uh me and beta i guess you heard what happened yes i am continuously impressed by the complexity of human relationships despite the unpleasant circumstances that led to your quarrel i am pleased to see you have both found an agreeable resolution well two heads are better than one right yes i believe so are you ready to depart for cauldron gemini or we can continue our conversation if you like the missing subordinate functions what can you tell me about them artemis rewilded the earth with a variety of animal species elutio was responsible for gestating nurturing and culturing a new generation of human beings apollo was tasked with preserving organizing and disseminating vast archives of human knowledge and cultural achievements unfortunately all archived apollo data was purged on the 2nd of february 2066 by order of ted pharaoh ted i guess he got what he deserved in the end yes an igneous conclusion to his pathological narcissism impulsive tendencies and instability all three of the missing functions have already served their purpose or were prevented from doing so do you still need them restoring their remaining elements would increase my heuristic processing density empowering my overall function unfortunately as we now know they are in the possession of far zenith attaining them in the short term is very likely impossible i guess our best shot at recovering them is by taking over the zenith base but we'll need hephaestus and a bunch of combat machines to do that correct [Music] so about beta i never really saw the difference between us until now she's been through so much completely alone you have both endured many hardships different in almost every respect yet equally remarkable i like to think of you as two miracles born of elizabeth sobek three then let's not forget about you gaia [Music] how was all of us settling in as soon as she arrived alva was eager to study the data in the archive a particular file soon caught her attention information about a machine assistant devoted to keeping living spaces neat and orderly i informed her that once i am empowered with the abilities of hephaestus i may be able to design such a machine i'm sure she'll like that [Music] when i set out to find a way to bring you back i never thought we'd be here like this among friends they have all come a long way with their improvised educations varl has suggested that one day we might extend this model to more tribal inhabitants once the biosphere has been stabilized yeah that's not such a bad idea as long as you're the one running the lessons so our plan to capture festus let's go over it again as you wish thanks to beta's test we now know that hephaestus will not respond to your alpha clearance which is why i got ted farrow's a mega clearance correct while you were gone beta constructed the transport rig and pulse generators when we get to gemini i will need to be installed on one of the facilities cores the second core is for hephaestus using omega clearance will allow you to trap it and then you'll be able to absorb it not quite you will need to manually remove the festus's malicious code before the merge how long will that take because the work will be split between you and beta it will take approximately 4.5 hours and during that time the others will create a distraction for us using the pulse generators right correct they will each take position at a cauldron door and fire off their device the energy surge should mask our activities until the emerge is complete and then we'll have everything we need to defeat the zenith sounds like a plan so i uh found thieves what do you think ted would have done if his life extension treatments had worked it seems he convinced himself it was his duty to guide future humans given the tribal nature of new humans and his ability to use omega clearance on the terraforming system i imagine he would have convinced one or more tribes to worship him as their patriarchal deity okay yep glad that didn't happen [Music] aside from gaia prime and thebes there was one other underground facility that was sealed before the pharaoh plague reached it elysium the place where zero dawn staff and their families went to live out their lives do you know what happened to it elysium was designed to provide life support for 100 years my data indicates the facility went offline well before then did the pharaoh plague find them unknown my connection to the facility was abruptly severed so what will happen to this place while we're at gemiini all systems within this facility will continue to operate as minerva will no longer be masking this location the facility will be exposed to detection though without my presence it is unlikely to attract attention let's hope so gaia what was elizabeth like her presence is interwoven with my memories we it was a listen your friend yes though i am glad she thanks kaya [Music] okay people it's time to head out i'll get everyone together [Music] is [Music] he tells me [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right connections in place booting up i am fully installed on this core and ready to connect to the cauldron network it's good to hear your voice aaron everyone fire your pulses and sound off i'm at my car this thingy it's blinking did i do it right in position at my cauldron my pulse generator is blinking also that means they're working i'm in position and mine is too mine as well okay radio silence until i give the all clear signing off gaia let's cage the beast connecting to the cauldron network now elizabeth sobek alpha prime activating omega clearance elizabeth sobek alpha prime activating omega clearance [Music] clearance confirmed initiating containment sequence critical threat to taking an embarrassing escape containment of one country it's working it's got nowhere to go wait what's that malware detected attempting to compensate that means machines are on their way get ready here they come [Music] you
