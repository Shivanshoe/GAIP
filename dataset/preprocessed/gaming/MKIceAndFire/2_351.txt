good let's do it well that's a steep drop to nowhere got rope hey look there's an airflow i say we climb so when did you start smoking excuse me a lighter it's nothing just something i picked up back at base are you ready are you this place doesn't look much like a weapon silo to me you'd love that wouldn't you what's that supposed to mean [Music] nothing doesn't mean anything i guess we could classify this as quality time you and i always did have a different view on quality time doesn't this remind you of old times rage you mean the sense of feeling lost [Music] [Music] [Music] floor seems stable yeah it looks fine [Music] [Music] you've got a certain cool under pressure after you left i learned to deal with pressure [Music] what do you think this place is hard to say these carvings look religious i think we might be in a temple that's pazuzu do you know watch horror movies you should know the answer to that it's a sumerian demon something to do with plagues i think plagues and demons huh great unbelievable i was not expecting this at all great that's all we need think we can move it looks jammed pretty tight what is it didn't hear that i didn't hear anything i thought i heard something down there [Music] that's gunfire where's it coming from we should move can you make anything else that's it's deep that looks safe to you it's our only option hit the road we're going down [Music] [Music] huh oh unbelievable we're not the first ones here damn it all this crap must be what kayla's detecting how could you have gotten it so wrong you look around you you went through all this for what like a few barrels and crates i've messed up should have triple checked the data exhausted every but i'm possibility sure this was it i understand what it meant to you eric i'm so sorry there's no use in dwelling on it we need to focus on the task ahead and find a way out of this place the hell is that subsidence from the aftershocks [Music] this looks like archaeological gear somebody was studying this ruin hey we could use those lamps the light could guide the marines to us do you think that still works it'll work just needs gas we need to find some you regretting not calling for additional air support yet oh there you go reading my mind again eric check this out what the happened here i hope we can get this thing started what do you think the rest of the squad are doing they're tough each and every one of them they'll muscle through they block this root off to restrict the points of entry leave their enemy no choice but to enter that way pass the mounted gun unbelievable all call signs this is king does anyone copy over maybe climbing out of the cavern back there would have been the smarter move you need to get these lights running asap i can't see wherever you are nick i hope you're safe sorry did you say something no nothing i'm gonna hold on to this [Music] this is king to all call signs are you receiving over [Music] i'm beginning to think that even the iraqis don't know about this place [Music] i don't understand how it could've been so wrong this thing has a label but where's the catalog how can something this vast have remained hidden for so long these are set to blow they were planning to bring down the whole temple rachel give me a hand with these cans will ya they're full how's the leg holding up leg oh you mean the prosthesis i lost my leg back on the highway don't i still feel guilty i didn't make it easy on you rage i know that you weren't to blame for that crap mom let's get to work [Music] shine a light on the tank oh what's wrong fuel tubes worn loose the damn valve is leaking can it be fixed we have to secure the tube before starting the generator there's got to be something here to fix it [Music] you got it i've got it we need to stay focused whatever issues are between us we can't let them plan our judgment gee thanks for the advice i'll try not to let our failed marriage get in the way of our mission just keep your eyes on the job don't worry i know exactly what i'm doing hold the fuel pipe it's done hey give me a hand with this panel look at the state of these they're shot feels like so long since we worked on something together same time feels like yesterday rachel we both allowed each other space and this break i mean look what it's done for our careers you a field officer for the cia and i mean kayla's could change the face of the entire war if it ever decides to work sure i don't think either of us expected to be out of each other's lives for so long past year or so my husband buried and chaos and i was blind to anything else sounds less like an apology and more like an excuse it's not either it's the truth you had no idea that chaos would even work rach say what's on your mind after the accident i was at the lowest i'd ever been i couldn't cope couldn't function and when i needed you most rachel when i needed you by my side left me kayla's pulled me out of that pit [Music] you're really gonna lay this on me that's not what i meant then what did you mean i did everything to get you back on your feet but you just wallowed in self-pity you let it consume you you let it beat you it was you eric you pushed me away [Music] [Music] we have power there was a way in for these people there's a way out for us let's take a look around [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we gotta go through it the other way move [Music] ah [Music] look let's go [Music] from a point of defense this place has some good choke points but overall it's a weak setup could have been done under pressure i don't know the constraints they were working under [Music] please demonic possession [Music] take a look at this that thing still work my tape is all tangled up [Music] it's fine i can fix that so when did you stop wearing your wedding ring when did you stop wearing yours [Applause] it didn't always close to my heart stop wearing it the day or left i've moved on eric i haven't forgotten what this ring means to me [Applause] but maybe you're right maybe it's too late [Applause] we need to look at it blasphemy that comes in indescribable shapes and forms the eons we lived as children in this world unaware of the horrors that strummed but i must do what i must we will seal this place for eternity for all mankind i'm sorry hello the hell is going on i don't know man it was not supposed to play out like this is king contact contact taking fire does anyone call me over that's rachel we're close keep moving something simple this goddamn place you're not serious that looks decades old that's all we have can you see him yeah he's coming kill your light huh rachel got you rich i've got you you gotta stop struggling rachel grab on to something i can't see it's too dark [Music] come on damn it right till you hold still [Music] sorry rachel so sorry [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
