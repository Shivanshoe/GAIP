[Music] hey there new york friendly neighborhood spider-man here wanted to give a bit of a life update since i'm sure you're wondering where i've been the past couple of weeks [Music] come on guys i'm talking to my fans right now sorry about that yeah i've been a little busy and i've sort of not really kind of been working with the avengers it's like a side hustle it's hard taking down a multinational corporation especially when your team has been deemed outlaws in the public eye but we still find time to enjoy ourselves outside of work i've actually been able to do a lot more recreational stuff since i joined them here's a secret from yours truly the avengers surprisingly normal outside of bad guy butt kicking kind of like this big family of heroes all working together and helping out but still finding the time to have fun not that i've been goofing off it's still serious work fighting alongside the avengers but you know how it is saving the city all the time all by yourself it gets kind of lonely i've met so many cool people now i've been to so many wonderful places and you know i'd never leave new york you guys are always my number one but the avengers are like no other friends i've ever had it's been kind of great sorry i'm totally getting ahead of myself let me back up a little bit start from the beginning this is safe right yeah totally safe what could possibly go wrong okay i did not think this one through hill should be in contact soon to fill us in hey guys we have a visitor hey you know you guys should really consider getting a doorbell or a front door can i come in now [Music] okay spider-man let's talk you two know each other spider-man's been fighting baddies in new york for like ever sorry i spent the last five years frozen and in space i was living in a trailer with internet well i'd say i'm insulted but 50 recognition ain't bad aim had a pretty extensive file on him no id though you cover your tracks well wow coming from you you can't see it behind the mask but i'm totally blushing right now still doesn't explain why you were hanging off our helicarrier mid-flight yeah i need tiny dancer she helped my friend slip some aim intel to the resistance a while ago i was hoping i'm listening right so i think ames working on something big like chemical weapons big i'm having trouble getting specifics because every file i've pulled off their servers is super redacted the number of black bars on these things put some modern art to shame and and i'm trying to track down their supplier but i i need tiny dancer to break aim's encryption so i can get into one of their facilities i can handle the rest myself let us take a look first if you're right about what ames got planned we'll help you get into that facility hang out until we're ready to go tony not it's really not a big deal it's just to get in you're still walking okay don't worry i'm an expert in hanging out get it hanging well i thought it was funny you know you guys don't have to come with me right we know and still gotta help though it's what we do and uh you don't have to wear that mask around us if you don't want to it's not really about me there are people back home that i need to protect and the mask helps me do that hey i get it no one back home knows i'm miss marvel either except my abu of course but um mask or no mask we all need people who have our backs and really get us even the weird parts especially the weird parts in any case you should check out the place thor and the hulk are competing in the home room but i'm sure you could kick them out the harm room is that name literal or ironic you'll see welcome to the chimera spider-man thanks let's hope this was the right call pete hey liz you there okay you're either underground without service or you hate me hoping for the former can you call me can we meet up no okay fair let me at least apologize i don't know what aim told you in your exit interview but i told them you had nothing to do with it they didn't believe me liz i am so sorry i know how much that internship meant to you no you don't otherwise you wouldn't have skimmed information from ames servers what were you thinking liz i wasn't just goofing off this time i don't want to get you into any more trouble but i was poking around for a good reason i swear i don't think ayman's being honest about a lot of things i'm not sure if it's safe to put in a text meet me for coffee just leave me alone peter please excellently done here we go [Music] i would say that is worthy of the avenger name wouldn't you training begins now [Music] oh [Music] hello that will do i think well done [Music] stay now [Music] i was splendid let's begin [Music] [Music] should we stall [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music]

another agent down [Music] [Music] [Music] uh get me to the location on your hud bypassing that security will take some time keep the area clear but stay in range of the control point yes [Music] the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow [Music] you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back i need more time keep the area lose hope free [Music] oh i'm working as quickly as possible the corrupted vibranium has exploded you must leave the area to avoid harmful contamination nice work [Music] look out we've got company hello if you can gain control of aims network temporarily i can infiltrate their security system [Music] head for the terminal so i can get you inside the lab good i prefer a challenge aims network is equipped with a multi-point authentication system i need access to multiple terminals the more the better aim will attempt to initiate a shutdown protocol if they gain access to the terminal aim is [Music] beginning infiltration that helps thank you [Music] three three [Music] wow [Applause] [Music] aim has initiated their helps shutdown you [Music] that helps thank
