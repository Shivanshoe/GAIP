who gave you the sticky eyes when he walked in an ex-con promoted all the way up to warden try not to rub him the wrong way he's an engine man through and through every bit as violent as his guards oh

prisoners around here are lon chabetta and seth seth shabet is mafia and he's still running his business from the inside i imagine he gets along well with the warden what i hear they're always trading favors the other guy seth he controls the drug trade around here might be worth a visit if you need a boost you'll find him in the gym he never leaves apparently he's sick with something got it you have a plan for getting out of here i can't protect you while i'm looking for a donna don't worry about me maybe it's got it all figured out good now lead me to the shebeta i'll start with him i'm not

i just wish we would have had more time to study her hmm indeed her cellular structure was fascinating wasn't it what a pity well it's not a total loss we've still got the other one she's old and has already gone through her first change but still better than nothing they have no limits happening it shouldn't be you the security level be on the lookout great so uh so hmm so uh yes foreign i picked up your scent from down the corridor you're like me aren't you who are you my name is am the pack leader of the red talons and who are you oh noah i've read intron's reports about you my name is kahal i've heard of your tribe wild ancestral solitary art to believe engine could get their hands on the leader of such a renowned tribe and they set up their factory and their pipelines in the territory of our can we pushed them back for months but that [ __ ] with the mechanical arm she showed up out of nowhere and managed to drive us into a corner we had little choice i gave myself up in exchange for the lives of my people and an end to the slaughter tank girl tried to destroy my cairn as well i killed her good i hope you made her suffer i take it they captured you after you were finished with her no they took adana my daughter they brought her here i came to get her back adona's your daughter is she i met her they had her locked up in the cell next door i was their first subject but i didn't give them the results they were hoping for whatever they are doing i think it is linked to our first change but donna hasn't gone through her first change their tests on her came back positive they took her off to endren's headquarters to do what i do not know take me with you all that awaits me here is death good work now follow me this door leads into an underground parking garage steal a truck we'll need one to get to my can there are guards for maury i can feel it and i am in no state to help you you've got to do it alone [Music] huh so oh [Music] huh oh noah it's time to move [Music] foreign finally tell me [Music] is that so what are those outsiders doing in my territory it's not just entrance spreading across my territory we have been invaded ava and her lamb to mankind i know them the red talons do not like humans and there is only room for one pack here the humans are with us they're fighting for gaia humans are the reason we need to fight for gaia we should have snuffed them out at the dawn of their existence these humans are on our side and we have no intention of settling here we'll leave as soon as we've managed to rescue my daughter from engine hq so you intend to fight andren we could use your help no way we have already lost too many we will not join you however i will clear your path my wolves tell me they have already attacked your people those attacks will end you may operate on our land with impunity at least until you finish your business here stay longer and there will be war go now and pay your respects to our guardian spirit parture tells me that he is waiting for you so you are the one who freed obama you reek of human warrior of gaia for what purpose do you enter my territory i'm fighting for gaia to drive engine in the worm from this territory is that so or are you pursuing an aim that is more personal are you truly worthy of my confidence can you even still call yourself warrior of gaia and now you fight beside humans beside the enemy not all humans are servants of the world but all are blind they will never understand the wild or the worm they try to apply the order of the weaver to everything gaia included they will never admit that gaia is a wild uncontrollable entity and that she demands sacrifice the gaia you speak of is a stranger to me neither my people nor the spirits we protect see her as such you dare to question me have you any idea to whom you speak i have served gaia and the wild since time immemorial long before your pack or your pathetic spirits they are all weak easily swayed by the call of the world i do not yield as the worm encroaches on my territory but face it head-on yet it still spreads everywhere around only your cairn seems to remain untouched our care is all that matters and we are ready to make what sacrifices we must to maintain it ohnawa has taken that role upon herself but she may not be the last now go pursue your quest i shall judge your worth oh noah i can feel the hate that flows through her and her guardian spirit ava can you hear me there you are head to our base the red talons once protected us from the worm but they have abandoned us we are in danger the spirits are suffering how can onawa stand by and do nothing you are not of the red talon tribe their guardian spirit no longer offers us his protection help us you must drive the worm from these lands warrior it has given us one by one she's no ordinary pack leader [Music] where's ava she's inside it's good to see you again call thanks an old abandoned mine ava just told me about it donna i'm so sorry alcohol we'll get her back how did you manage to get out of prison pretty simple ava sent viridian state a transfer order for me complete with an entrance seal of approval during the transfer lambda mankind attacked my convoy and the rest is history i'm sorry i really tried but i'm just busting your balls man you were there to save your daughter i get it besides at the end of the day i'm out of prison thank you for your help in the prison you took big risks for me you can thank me when we've got your daughter back but just remember my favorite way to be thanked is cold hard cash lest i forget i'll catch you later we're on the same side with red talent still ava said they're a different pack than the wolves at turker's mill we're gonna have to be careful kahal but you're alone i'm sorry ava they'd already moved to donna out of the prison by the time i got there ah [ __ ] do you know where they've taken her entrance nevada hq that's what the leader of the red talon says anyway the red talons those [ __ ] have been attacking my people since we got here rest assured they won't attack you again i freed their leader from hindrance grip they captured another garu they were experimenting on her before they captured a donna apparently my daughter makes a better test subject those [ __ ] bastards will save her i promise you the leader of the red talons agrees to hold back her wolves until we get 80 back but she's not going to help i think she's using us we take the risks she reaps the benefits at least to leave us alone i'll take it but have you seen the wall that protects those injured outposts it's surrounded by a minefield nobody here can get to their defenses only you only me need i remind you that you're a garu too sure but i'm not a fighter my strengths lie in data weaver stuff anyway listen i've been working on it for a couple of days but i think i figured out how to deactivate their land mines and get you into an evac duct it'd be too small for a human of course but a wolf could get through get to the other side and take care of their outposts deal with the men guarding the terminals in each outpost and connect me once i'm on their network i'll be able to clear you a path through the maintenance zone it's the quickest way into engine hq go see declan he'll tell you how to get past the minefield engine has been looking for tarker's milk cairn for five years hey you're here follow me i heard they took your daughter to their hq i can't even imagine we just have to get her back tell me about the outposts there are four entrance sites inside the perimeter to reach them use the evacuation duct and the minefield go around the perimeter wall but keep your distance you'll see a red mark on a rock from that mark go straight towards the wall once you've reached it stay close follow the wall until you find the entrance to the duct from there it's all up to you good luck why do you ask just curious makes you wonder where android finds the money to buy in these laps that's not much of a mystery you know pentax right engine's one of their subsidiaries they've got more money than they could ever need ugh put should have picked another job [Music] huh ah the first time i saw her she was with orlov she just had surgery huh [Music] hey uh so so [Music] [Music] ava i've cleared out the outpost and connected you to the network good i'll try to take control of indian hq surveillance system i've learned more about the earth blood protocol the stuff they're injecting into their soldiers acts directly on their immune system it seems like the experiment they've been conducting had to do the protocol too huh hq will be sending us reinforcements soon good as soon as they arrive we launch our attack on those activists they've [ __ ] with us for long enough [Music] um this was sent when we were attacking the fracking site uh [Music] ah uh what i've got eyes on oh so hey [Music] so uh well done i'm almost through their defenses keep going endurance headquarters has been pretty active lately seems like our attacks on their outposts haven't gone unnoticed they're gonna bulk up their defenses this outpost is ours let's see what we can bring back i want to report every hour huh the first time i saw her she was with orolov she just had surgery oh we have a security breach this won't be oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] with that i
