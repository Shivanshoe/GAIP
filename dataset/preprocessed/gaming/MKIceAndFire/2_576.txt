[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] initiating artillery thrusters and we are 20 seconds atmosphere breach initiative primary ignition set to 30 rotating we are engine first altitude 20 000 feet and falling hold on we're getting interference switch to high gain antenna command confirm signal strength you're looking great for the one go for landing engines off one has landed [Music] almost looks like home that's what worries me well boss you're ready got my truck i want snipers at three and six multiple defense lines and an operating base established within the hour move goodman a word you know the stakes of this mission flores is already half dismantled our engines on its way down to power city of half a million now if these outrider bozos had paid it you report to me first sir i'm only here to answer a proper procedure we're not on earth shira there is no proper procedure listen up outriders i know what you're all thinking there's no going home and no one has a clue what's waiting for us out there but the eca pencil heads can't greenlight this land until we find their missing probes so let's do our job negative hq our systems are all functioning we'll set up further instructions i'm gonna scout ahead on foot need to stretch my damn legs i'll take point don't need to see it get eaten on day one relax outrider you don't know me anything i wouldn't be here without you i'd be buried in the ashes back home all right let's move out stay sharp watch our sixes ah will you smell that air i can't even process breathing air that doesn't smell like a burnt carburetor that didn't mind the air back on earth i'm used to it trust me you'll get used to fresh air too truth is none of us should have even gotten off earth survivor's guilt you think any one of us isn't feeling it it's not just that if the caramel's engine hadn't exploded back on earth and killed most of the real outriders with it there wouldn't be a bunch of mercenaries down here in their place i hired you because you don't let anything get in your way we'll make camp here outrider said a beacon flag let hq know the air is secure all right people we got jobs to do cuthbert skarstead set up a perimeter i want fortifications going up within the hour jacob you're field testing the munitions gootman get your scanner up and running so we can find those damn probes outrider a word hey no matter what happens out here i need my best gun on this in case things go south can i depend on you just tell me what to do get my weapons haven't been fired in nearly a century why don't you head over to yakov and get your gear checked and then be prepared to move out as soon as those probes are located any questions no word from earth i assume it's really gone she went dark 15 years into our journey more or less as predicted aca has confirmed no communication since [ __ ] you know i grew up a slum dog fighting for scraps lost everyone really long before the end doomsday just wasn't a thing i worried about hell i was never going to live past 20 anyway somehow i was one of the ones who made it don't even know what i'm supposed to be doing here these things go right time's coming you're gonna have to leave all that behind this is a new beginning you could have a family here build a cabin roll and get fat that's not me chad know my way around bullets not kids there's gonna be no need for someone like me here maybe the old you outrider but you're one of the chosen few you get to build the future don't waste it [Music] did any more of your people make it off earth cap my brother almost but no they got him in cryo as we evacuated l.a hoping we could stop the bleeding ah he was too far gone ah [ __ ] sorry to hear that i haven't had the time to think about it what about sarah she's good right yeah my sarah's up there they don't wake her group for another six months but i can wait i'm uh i didn't have a chance to tell you this and all the madness but my little girl's pregnant that's how i got her the seat two for one special huh so that's why i've been such a good mood since they unfroze your ass don't push it out right yes sir granddad sir i'll go find jack of shooting range good we're on standby for those probes so stay staying alert hey there little guy almost touched on you how many feet you got there what's on your mind boss i know that look you get what do you make of this place jacob it's perfect beautiful how long you want to bet before we bury it all under concrete and plastic oh come on you can't still be that cynical just look at this valley maybe we all just got too much riding on this we already have one dead planet in the rear view if we screw this one up do it maybe we won't sure maybe this is really it maybe we can finally stop sleeping with our guns under our pillow stop worrying about food every goddamn day i want this to work you have no idea people don't change still got your money on black the house always wins that last day got really hairy i wasn't sure if any of us were gonna make it we cut it pretty close you can't stop thinking about it either i know it's insane that was 80 years ago yeah it feels like days my knuckles are still sore my ears still ringing from all the gunfire i mean there was thousands of them all climbing over each other slaughtering everyone in their way tried to pull down the launch tower to bash in the doors of her shuttles i've been in a lot of war zones but that was [ __ ] anarchy look it was either us getting off the planet with them we just did what we had to do we do what we have to do we look out for each other well we better other than the cap and cut bird you're the only person left alive i know i'm the only person left alive worth knowing i'm glad you made it on board your basket time to test my gear up for some target practice bush let's get started fancy stuff yeah a new toy you're the first one to test it out boss think you could take on a tank all right you can stop showing off now give that sidearm a try did i ever mention how glad i am to be on your side damn somehow 18 years has improved your aim feels pretty good doesn't it just like riding a bike fresh haven't lost your touch yep still got it outrider check on our eca rep see if shears hey chill out man what's eating oh my gosh this is stunning i don't wish you could have seen this that hey yoshiro right i'm sorry can you believe this landscape it's so beautiful now if only we had an internet to post those two scientific record besides we'll have the internet up and running in the first six months the entire thing was backed up i'm just pulling your leg shira any luck with the probe the scan's still running i don't know what else i can do it's just how can the probe signals have simply vanished yeah they said it was some kind of interference or something not from space maybe but not from down here still seems initial readings are right we're breathing yes but before the eca can authorize half a million more people coming here we need the probes data to know we can support them and if we can't what's the easiest plan b do you have any questions i get answers to how's this colonization gonna work you're in the planning rooms right yes we've already started disassembling the engine we need to bring that down first the nuclear core should give us enough power to get the colony up and running and when do the civilian pods start coming down within a few weeks if all goes well first just enough people and resources to get our infrastructure running you know water food and shelter then we'll keep working folks from cryo a few thousand at a time no more than we can feed until before you know it you'll be standing in the middle of a city meanwhile the florist stays up there the ship was built in orbit it was never meant to land we'll have to keep it in our skies until we're capable of space flight again one day maybe all right tell me the truth you think the eca's thought this whole plant through well my father was part of the team that designed a plan my entire life he held prepare for this day the greatest undertaking of human history oh so that's how you got on the ship huh daddy smoothed your way no i studied engineering spent years in orbit designed structure drilling rivets into the hole i helped build that shape so you earned your rayon good for you it was my father does not like the way you thought he gave up his place for me he stayed behind [ __ ] i'm uh i'm sorry you would have been in all this place but in the end it's just me it's strange not knowing anyone here when this is over come hang out with us we're not such a bad punch i might take you up on that hey is that supposed to blink that way oh oh oh that's a probe tanner i think you've got a signal it's close excellent workout rider now go locate the damn thing so we can land this beauty copy that hey it's an historic moment we should document it for the scientific record heads up i got movement nine o'clock something big oh you're the steeler perimeter hold your fire until we know what we're dealing with oh i got eyes on some kind of hyena cow things yeah i'm seeing them over here too a whole heart of them are we sure all the wildlife around here are vegetarians whatever they look for the ugly you ask me astonishing i bet they can be domesticated performing i bet they make some fat juicy steaks uh one of those cow things is sonic itself right on my path hey maybe he can get close enough to get a dna sample not exactly our priority but if i can get close without spooking it i'll try ah scared it off but i've secured the objective fantastic got some kind of storm brewing yeah found the probe looks like it landed pretty hard but the data seems intact copy that transmitting to hq now good work outrider hold on tanner i'm picking up the second signal but something's weird about this one weird the [ __ ] is rising and falling it's hq hold up on calling in that green light we got another probe out here to analyze negative alpha your job is done damn it maxwell listen to me we can't afford to make mistakes give us time any more time and we lose our orbital window we have the data i'm calling it in you want to keep searching don't blame me if you find trouble over and out all right now riders rendezvous back with a convoy let's go find that straight hey guthner any updates the probe signal is mostly noise but i've tracked its source there hope you all brought your galoshes jacob same [ __ ] different planet [Music] [Music] piece of [ __ ] electronics are freezing up trucks are down we continue on foot soldier your primary focus is here understand we keep moving eyes up [Music] choke on your own spit dude it's nothing i'm good [Music] jesus share back to the [ __ ] alert the medics stay back tanner got eyes on the probe i got movement heading in hq we've encountered a potential biological hazard requesting quarantine procedure at base damn it tanner i told you posers not to go mess up this operation it's my name on the line when it's landing and you have no authority over me maxwell hey boss we lost you i'm getting her straight probe no skarstead he looks like [ __ ] any idea what this black gunk is some kind of sacrifice but [Music] okay you want to play captain got attacked by one of those cow things something drove it crazy i had to put it down keep an eye out copy that out writer now move your ass and find that probe so [Music] tanner i found it good work get the drive to get the hell out wait hold on this thing's just in relay mode tanner the signal isn't coming from the probe it's coming from outside our search zone somewhere else on the planet that's impossible there is nobody else secure the hard drive we'll analyze that signal back at base copy oh damn it something's frying it tanner give us the frequency uh carrier frequency is nine seven point tanner do copy tanner tanner i'm seeing some really strange [ __ ] down here the [ __ ] what the hell was that oh this is the landing [Music] hmm come on [Music] okay [Music] oh [Music] john got heavy casualties possible contamination i mean quarantine set up a base to copy [ __ ] maxwell what the [ __ ] is all this what does it look like sergeant major sir we have to follow quarantine procedure and hold the landing whatever the original reports about this planet they were wrong there's some kind of anomaly if we land now everyone will die there's no holding the landing it's too late for that there's nowhere else to go we need medics see to them hurry no stop they're contaminated we contain them that's an order you always were an [ __ ] look around you we got men and women that needed medical attention now get your asses in gear and do the right thing i'm gonna have to no contain this now burn the [ __ ] bodies i got you all right sure right after you call off your goddamn goons pleasant major the entire colonization is threatened we need to warn the florist threat imperil this mission [ __ ] so maxwell set up a block he's gonna burn everything you need to get into the region attack kill the traitors don't let them near do the right thing pull it in postpone the [ __ ] landing it's too late [Music] hey you and you helped me with the wounded we have to get them to med lab over here come on move your asses they're almost there what are you doing i'm putting you back into cryo until med lab can save your [ __ ] life don't be ridiculous i'm done for pep talks aren't really my thing [Music] when is something truly over was it when your people left earth behind was it when you watched the first spaceship crash and burn was it when you saw your fellow outriders crumble at your feet was it watching yourself die but enoch isn't done with you yet outrider like i always say it ain't over till it's over [Music] huh you what year are you from here what year what is this your pot where were the uplink notes come on doc we need to go they're coming wait we can't just leave them here these are outright they're not why we're here i'm sorry [Music] thought your kind was all dead dead uncuff me and find out the anomaly is coming let's see how fast you can run romance land like the others [Music] hey soldier you're eca too right when we get to no man's land we gotta stick together if we want to survive survive what getting our asses fried by the big storm hey i told you to shut the hell up we're here come on come back go back what the hell is happening here they've got an altar to carry our guys apart you need to get out of here but where storm's coming you think the elders care about a storm [ __ ] take the back way through the frame we're not gonna make it here and while the captain on the show oh how long how long has it been what this this war how [ __ ] long who knows that before i was born that's [ __ ] impossible come on open the goddamn gate and move how tight almost there almost where where are you taking us i'm not supposed to the hell is the matter with you you just wake up or something oh i just well let me get you up real quick that paradise you outriders promised us guess what we got instead goddamn alien storms no shelter no food just kick to the curb like exiles while your eca pals got fat in their bunker [ __ ] it wasn't like that we lost electronics we could have left you all to rot in your cryopods but we can't we sent you ungrateful how many times did i tell you to shut up welcome to the valley of death [ __ ] you people are insane all of this is [ __ ] it's hell yeah it is [Music] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] i need to get out of here i just gotta get across this hellhole the [ __ ] happening i don't belong on this side wonder oh [ __ ] hmm did i do that oh [ __ ] this run who's your position are they running for me all right i should get used to this [Music] so this these flares this sword i've seen this before before when we landed this can't be real [Music] [Music] altered [Applause] i could smell the storm in your blood your stink of enoch your kinder abominations exile who the hell are you outrighter impossible such untapped power such confusion you want answers whatever you were before you're something new now a second life don't waste it who was that lord seth he's he's altered i think he's a little man a little man altered what the [ __ ] does that mean you you don't know what you are where'd you steal that uniform didn't it's mine yeah if he's really an outrider the new fight's in the wrong side altered what are you talking about yeah the grand marshal she'll explain come on where is she there what is that go go do whatever you have to do lieutenant shira i'm sorry to disappoint you you came from their side you got any intel for us are you [ __ ] kidding me look i got a war to win so either you help me or you get back into cryo hold on i'm just walking up to mud and [ __ ] i've been asleep for god knows how many years 31 years so for 31 years i've been seeing people fight and die while you were getting comfy in cryo so excuse me for not throwing you a little welcome party what happened to you the anomaly that's what happened you mean that storm we told them not to land anything more advanced than a grease engine got fried all our data wiped out we couldn't grow crops or make medicine so we ended up in the same place as when we left earth just killing each other over the little we have left why didn't you go somewhere else the outriders could have the outriders are dead what and the anomaly keeps us in this [ __ ] valley we can't go anywhere else you don't get it do you you think you're dreaming this is real believe me it's [ __ ] real so whether you like it or not you're stuck here in the mud and [ __ ] like the rest of us you should have never woken up i didn't miss out on all this marshall we were too late the hounds haven't he's been taken underground well get him back well it may be our side but that's not our turf ma'am i'm not losing people over yaku yakub he's still alive not too much longer it seems then i'll go find him never mind i've got it covered hey shira i'm geared up and tracking down yaka now who the hell are these [ __ ] there are thugs drug runners and child flavors they call themselves the hounds and believe me no one's gonna miss them if you put a few dozen body bags why the hell haven't you done something about them already honestly because their black market keeps our soldiers happy and at least they're not eating their own [ __ ] kids like the insurgents were fighting out there yeah i met a few of them not so friendly please it ain't fair move along nothing to see here so what did the old guy do [Music] i'm looking for jakob go away listen [ __ ] you got a gun pointed right at you what the hell is going on out there so so [Music] i'm gonna wear you around my neck i know [Music] now where's jacob [Music] nice eyes hey whoa oh sorry guys this is the bathroom you okay i had it under control been a while no i know you gorma then i thought you were dead you'll soon be dead if you don't get your ass to shears right now oh all right come meet me there when you're ready shira i got yak about in one piece he's on his way to you that old trunk just refuses to die well you should come join us we have some catching up to do seems like i find something no because he won't because he can do what the [ __ ] he wants hey never been so happy to see a familiar face you have an age today you got old my friend in the hallway that was seth what was he doing here ignoring our police for help i thought it was on your side says he's not on anyone's side the insurgents have altered their walking nightmares where lucky seth shows up to fight them back sometimes but only if it fits whatever the hell game he's playing hey damn it you have no idea how bad it is outrider we thought we escaped the apocalypse we thought we could start over again here but we were wrong i was wrong do you know why i'm in charge because i'm the only officer left alive the insurgents at our door they're feral sadistic they have us around it we're low on food and bullets and if those freaks don't kill us this planet will welcome back the black fungus in the forest we never found a cure the mountains are filled with abominations and the anomaly storms get bigger every year we don't have much time left if we don't find a way out of this valley if we don't find a miracle this last shred of humanity is over shira would you look at that i can do things now i don't understand but maybe there's a reason yes you are i guess i know why i saved your damn life all those years ago i'm sure this isn't exactly what you had in mind i'm not complaining still i don't get in the day we landed that storm and tore cuthbert apart but not me why why was i altered who the hell knows when those storms hit some get ripped inside out some turn pink polka dot and a few come back [ __ ] immortal nothing about the anomaly makes sense it disrupts the laws of nature it mutates whatever it touches early on the eca's best scientists tried to understand the storms to tame them none survived i guess you got lucky boss or maybe not all i care about is that you are on our side the supply line is blocked by an altar that our weapons cannot touch out by the old solar array seth had no interest in helping us but now you're here hell why not maybe i can buy humanity another day lieutenant what the hell was that the whole front line just collapsed like an earthquake all right i i think we lost our whole first line of defenses on my way go go go hey in case i don't get another chance i i tried to find you but it all went to [ __ ] we had to run for our lives i just forget it i'm alive we should have been dead ten times over if not for tanner if not for shira i'm the one with dudes to paint now yakum awesome i missed you it's good to have you back now go beat that altered ass for us so we can get back in this goddamn fight outrider be careful out there it's bad i'll see what i can do shira i still got about 30 years of questions to catch up on so if you make it back in one piece come and ask me but i don't promise i'll have all the [Music] answers some writing here move the whole goddamn front to hell if you can't open the supply line we're done for okay boss do you see a big tower that's where you need to get the old solar tower but it's a mess out there everything's upside down yeah i noticed don't worry i'm carving my way through it [Music] oh so so oh you're too late what happened here what does it [ __ ] look like we got mutilated we had the bastards cornered but they had a captain for the captain yeah you know the [ __ ] with powers you get put in charge not a real alter not like we could note the difference what's he look like this captain star down his face sadistic [ __ ] oh he forced half my squad to walk into an anomaly and he enjoyed it yeah i think i know the guy where is he inside the bunker of the hill i wish i could look him in the eyes when you make him pay for what he did i think i'll pay him a little visit for old time's sake okay give that captain what's coming to him so i settle up with this captain i hope so over here [Applause] i remember that voice not thought i'd have a harder time getting back through captain should be holed up somewhere in here [Applause] you think you can fight me give me all you got so so [Music] wait stop you're an altered you can do whatever the [ __ ] you want why the [ __ ] are you fighting for those those fascist [ __ ] weird ones fighting for our lives do you even know what they did to us i know what you did to me no outriders always pay what's owed that soldier will want to see his head for herself if anybody on this planet needed killing it was that sadist he paid not enough you're gonna be okay you need a medic or something you nuts a metaground hero kill me faster than the shrapnel will don't worry about me i'll live to fight another day hey you did a good thing in fact hey so [Music] uh [Music] deja vu in this place reminds me of that mission in damascus when we rescue those diplomats i had to save your ass from that machete wielding mob more like the time i had to save your sorry ass from that redneck mob storming dc those missions felt like we were fighting for a reason but this [ __ ] it's never been worth fighting for so what's it all about for you then just trying to live another day boss we're barely holding it was a good day to wake up then [Music] [Music] so sauteed [ __ ] be careful jacob i've reached the solar tower i'm going in what are you seeing in there some kind of weird electrical sparks flying everywhere means you're getting close this altered did i not mention he's a goddamn electro freak you mean he lights up light bulbs more like flash frying everything for a mile look i know you've always been able to handle yourself but this son of a [ __ ] is on a whole other level as of recently so am i [Music] hey [Music] man where are you so please [Music] and so outrider you've had your first kill we also do not die so easily do we sith come we must speak they asked you to help them to fight the altar down there why didn't you that pathetic monstrosity was a distraction people are dying because of him without the supply route open they all die these feeble creatures slaughtering each other over scraps you waste your gifts running errands for them trying to win their meaningless endless war you must realize you're not like them anymore also why i should play being a god like you i am not playing but you are something even more altered and outright the last outrigger do what you were set here for go beyond the frontier these people need their gods only one like you could lead them to a future why not you they call him moloch i fight another war far above this petty squalor my war is with the worst of our kind this one is too powerful he will destroy us all unless i hunt him down but this is not your fight you are to be the shepherd find a way for them out of this slaughter writer sure it's done your supply line's open i'm heading home i can't believe it outright or what you just did i've lost a hundred men trying don't thank me yet you still got a war to win not sure anyone's winning this goddamn war but there's something even more important you might be able to do come see me in my bunker ain't nobody i don't believe you they do peck yeah good sure the signal in the forest you remember it yeah like it was yesterday you still have its frequency don't you you mean this frequency good you got the winning lotto numbers tattooed on your ass cheek too still don't believe me i hate when you play that i told you so that signal is still playing like a distant echo it's digital which means it must be coming from a place where there is no anomaly the problem is we've never been able to locate its source because we've never had the right frequency until you showed up so now listen close you need to bring those precise numbers to dr abraham zahidi one of our last scientists [ __ ] he's been deep in the enemy territory for weeks now five rations says zahidi's dead we don't know that you i've seen you before it was in the med lab you woke me out of cryo guess life's real funny that way meet jane sniper first class she almost died trying to save his life she'll guide you wait shira when we landed that signal was already playing do you have any idea who or what is sending it do yourself a favor don't ask that question whatever's out there they don't want to be found and whoever goes looking for that [ __ ] signal ends up dead but it's the only chance we've got and if anyone can get there alive it's all of you cheera come on jacob that's in order sorry i left you to die in that med lab hey no worries didn't really have a choice i'd have done the same i'm not willing to write mccain off yet he's one tough son of a [ __ ] so yeah where do you think the signal is beats me just some fake whole [ __ ] for losers you can't accept the world has gone to [ __ ] but i guess our goddamn mission now show me this is my garage when you're ready i wouldn't know what to do with all that time give me the good stuff bad sign damn is hotting this [ __ ] up what happened to everyone else none of the other outriders survived well you had front row seats for the [ __ ] show that started it all you know most of us were dead that first day the few dozen that were left they did what we came here to do they [ __ ] explored who do you think died tried to figure out we couldn't leave this [ __ ] valley why are you the only outrider alive you think i was going to explore this damn planet after what we saw [ __ ] him let him have my badge i didn't need to be an outrider that bad anyway what happened and again dobroski has outdone himself whoa you've managed to keep my truck working after all these years [Music] well i had to strip the ai systems bypass the graphene cells cost me 20 bottles of vodka and parts but now our baby will run on anything these are turpentine even [ __ ] potatoes if we can grow potatoes [Music] you still got tunes dudes hey boss we got no electronics no tunes no nothing but somehow we make do okay i tracked the dock to that radio tower on the hill but the slums between here and there are infested with snaggletooth [ __ ] and enough patrolling insurgents that those mutated things are out hunting wait what kind of mutated things we talking about i'll stick to the roofs give you some eyes from above good luck that thing's the nuclear engine from the florist right that's the reason half the city is an irradiated ruin let me guess the anomaly that thing got battered by it until boom no more energy don't tell me you still had people in cryo yup the eca had a choice let them die or wake them up all at once to an unfinished city without food or water the slums you're looking at that's where they got exiled to starve and die your insurgents call themselves exiles you quick there's some notes here i still can't get used to seeing your face young it's like you're a walking memory so this was the first city looks like a ghost town what happened here some geniuses decided to wake up half a million people when we barely had enough food for ourselves and put them in a city built to house 50 000 people you can imagine how well that went people stuffed into boxes starving to death living in their own [ __ ] like some [ __ ] slum and no shelter from the [ __ ] anomaly those storms only had to kill a few thousand before the riots started so the rioters destroyed this place no what we did to stop the riots that destroyed this place he's good together from the dead [Music] so place is crawling with insurgents i need to clear them out [Music] [Music] [Music] but [Music] so this [ __ ] is gonna take some getting used to [Music] everyone hmm so ah um hey outrider is it from earth what was it like oh nothing like you imagine my generation we lived our whole lives knowing earth was over we killed to survive to earn our seed on the florist we got a few happy memories but they weren't much better than meals on death row so [Music] uh [Music] so do ah [Music] so [Music] so okay hmm the journal [Music] so [Music] ah dedicated so i see the radio tower sign of zahidi they're probably keeping him in one of the buildings close to the tower judging by the number of insurgents heading your way i'm guessing they know we're here [Music] awfully quiet here [Music] so so uh get back i'll kill him calm down step closer i swell rip him open get back this man's gonna bleed out who are you sure goodman sent me to find you i thought you might want to see this that's a frequency what the where did you get jane hurt it's nothing doc tell me the briefcase is safe no the truck is gone oh the [ __ ] wait no no no no no no hold on hold on hold on hey hey hey listen to me listen to me i might be able to stop the bleeding but you have to tell me where your people took my truck i will save your life promise yes go down pass river all right doc move back wait no no no i just gave this man my word we can't leave him alive he knows too much no he doesn't have to die we already have what we want james no okay get her up i'm taking her back to my truth you have to find the dog's truck it's more important than me you have no idea there's a briefcase under the oil tank bring it back safe [Music] hold on jay hold on stay with me okay jane stay with me damn it go outrider go the cable car will take you down to the slums it's the quickest route to the river the truck should be on the other side what the hey jacob i think i found some of those mutated snaggletooth [ __ ] yup and now you're really seeing this planet the war is the least of it looks like some old reports that tree this is where i woke up ah what do we have here some kind of writing outrider we're almost back to your camp coffee how's jane doing she's barely hanging on i'm doing what i can but she'll make it she has to up [Music] [Music] notes interesting some writing here zahidi i'm crossing the bridge where can i find the truck there there are old garages near the city gate they probably would keep it there to protect against the anomaly [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] so [Music] [Music] ah uh [Music] [Music] hey zahidi i'm in there's a lot of trucks in here they all look the same i hit the briefcase under the truck's driver's side door just just search them all welcome make me dig my own grave next this better be worth it oh my god it's still intact the satellite uplink the last satellite uplink so that's what you were looking for when you found me yeah and it still works wow the case it's new metal it insulates it it's never been opened so the electronics inside have been safe from the goddamn anomaly so what does it connect to the floor is i thought it was all disassembled for the colonization mostly but we lost contact towards the end half of the resources we were meant to have are still up there the trap and the supply pods seeds electronics hard drives full of data all out of reach we could rebuild civilization with those resources but they're useless to us unless we can find a place beyond the storms no it might sound like a dream but for those of us that believed it kept us going so this is it that's why shearer sent me to get you she wants what's inside those pots so what do we do now your frequency i can use it to locate the source of the signal i need to reach an antenna up high somewhere you got one in mind yeah eagle peaks but uh not yet i told you everyone who goes on the stupid mission ends up dead [Music] my turn to leave you behind maybe we'll meet again do uh cat have come all this way only to let those creatures stop me are you lost old man are we all what are you doing here this place isn't safe what do you see when you look at this shattered city i see my own story in every street i lived here through every crisis every revolt and riot until they tore it away from us afraid i missed all that we lost earth soon we'll lose this planet we lose everything in the end maybe that's how it has to be i left some things in my old hut valuable things i couldn't survive a minute on my own but i'd show you where they're hidden if you would open the way just like to go home once more stay here i'll handle what a it strange trip it's been to leave so much behind for so little gain why did we ever even come here please an old man's home my old home's near the radio tower overlooking the city hey old man what was this place like back in the beginning oh it was miracles daily industrial printers constructing anything we needed from enoch's raw materials in a flash we were building a city on an alien planet until the storms came you saw the first storm oh yes lights on the horizon machines coming from the entire city went black just bolts of lightning and screams i could see people lifted into the air trees shredded fires everywhere whatever hope for enoch we had it was gone in a breath what happened after the engine flew no electronics and the sleepers getting woke in thousands an hour and they tried to keep us calm but there was no food no medicine nowhere to hide from the storms eca closed the gates and left us all to rot and we would have too if not for the altered i never wanted to be an insurgent i just wanted what my family had been promised place is crawling with insurgents i need to clear them out so what's up [Music] [Music] ah ah so i've cleared the weight of your hut container 99 but thank you please wait for me there [Music] what happened here whose graves are those sarah hello g michelle it wasn't their fault i was picked as a community leader to distribute food i admit i kept some for ourselves or my girls was i supposed to watch them starve i traded for favors seemed harmless enough i only took food but they took everything from me oh but you told me you had nothing of value here for me but my memories take it all then go please i'll stay here a little longer so every single disaster we brought down on our heads condensed into one dead city zahidi's truck is in bad condition i've scavenged all the useful equipment doc will have to ride with us all rider what can i do for you i'm wondering is it possible there are other outriders still in cryo well it's entirely possible jane and i you weren't expecting to find your team and with insurgents closing in we didn't have time to look for anyone else i don't have to tell you how dangerous the first city is but i'd want to be the first to know what you find i'm curious too i'll go check it out just because you haven't found any other outriders yet that doesn't mean they're not still out there the cryopod i found you in was in an old medical lab near the river you should start searching there i still can't get used to seeing your face you're so dead it's good to get the best rolling again she's doing all right is that the tower yes it looks like the cable car is down you might ask those soldiers if there's a way to get them working what the hell was that noise how about they keep the engine warm this goddamn mission is a waste of time and the one-way ticket to nowhere's film the um anomaly can you explain it well short answer no they call it an anomaly because it can't be explained it defies all known physics it seems to be some fundamental force of this planet's nature electromagnetic and gravitational but it's also a kind of weather system that obeys rules and can even be forecast sometimes it shines sometimes it rains mostly rains have theories but the scientific method depends on observation hypothesis experimentation and finally peer review the problem is i have no peers left why didn't we know about the anomaly before we landed i mean surely must have shown up on the surveys i assure you this is not the world we were promised every report that came back to earth told the same story they had found the garden of eden not some world that would be trying to kill us in every conceivable way we would have stayed on earth for that so what the [ __ ] happened i don't know my dad he knew this planet backwards and forwards he was on the science council that chose this world obviously something happened during the 67 years we were asleep in hyperspace something changed this planet tell me dr zahidi careful that's the very last satellite uplink on enoch you don't know how long it took me to find it how did you even know to look for it my father i found reference to it in his notes after we landed he was out here looking for a signal long before we were he was the first one to send expeditions and back then i was just a kid you came to enoch as a child hmm not many kids were on board the floors my father being who he was had the luxury of bringing his family of course i don't know how these soldiers make it out here day after day holy [ __ ] did you see the volcano for a minute there i thought it was gonna erupt never know with this place it could be erupting could be some demon belching up its lunch i can see them prowling on that ridge let them be they wanted a fight they might be waiting us out what if there's more will you calm down i can feel them watching us can't wait for the next avalanche cable car to the radio tower does it work not since insurgents took control they have the car on their side you could try saying pretty please thanks i'll pass what about the other one i wouldn't risk it goes too close to the volcano nothing's active i mean it's spews lava from time to time but there's something far less natural lurking in there okay what's the story with your volcano whatever's in there even the insurgents keep their distance we learned the hard way the things stayed below the fog dragging them down the cliffs spraying flames i never saw it just heard the screams by the time we dragged the cable car back there was nothing but blood and ash so before i can use the cable car i got to go deal with that volcano what are you kidding you got some kind of a death wish just tell me how to get there alter it i'm captain denim there's a path that'll take you further up the mountains [Music] there's something out there to fear all right but we don't know what it is dumb things don't look so scary up close oh [ __ ] did he just move what did the soldier say only way to the radio tower is those cable cars how badly do you need that radio tower i'm afraid this is the only facility with enough range if i can't use your frequency to find the signal from that tower we might as well quit now we'll get cozy then we're going to be here a while seems i got a date with a volcano so [Applause] so so hmm come on how much bigger can they get every creature we've encountered on this planet has evolved rapidly since we landed in unnatural and lethal ways what remains unproven is whether they've been adapting to the anomalies hostile conditions or being changed by the anomaly though what the hell does it matter just don't let any of them close enough to eat you this place it's unnatural right what the hell did all this do oh ah [Music] so wonder what madame beauvoir would make of this uh so so uh [Music] [Music] let's do this so [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] captain dunham your volcano problem is taken care of he killed it i i can't believe it amazing i'll give the order to have the cable car ready right away [Music] holy [ __ ] foul goes in altered we're all wishing you'd been with us months ago now we might have a fighting chance at taking back this mountain just tell me how to work the cable car captain i need to get my scientist up to that tower right only one small problem the cable car we control doesn't go to the tower we go straight to the heart of the insurgent base the second you land you're gonna get swarmed but if you can wipe out enough of them and take back control of the radio tower car for us i'll send your scientist across sounds like a plan hey i'm sorry it doesn't feel right asking you to do this alone but after what you pulled off with that volcano look your men have it rough as it is i can handle it the two clocking your sixes i want eyes on all marked coordinates with reports on the hour diego says he might have seen the new guy when he was on patrol outside the gates but he was on his knees shaking he got close guy screamed ran off into the dark that's [ __ ] is this your whole company there used to be more of us but something happens to the men up in these hills we hear voices some leave and they'll come back same for anyone who goes looking for them but maybe an altered could have more luck in finding them could you lend a hand i'll look into it when we first heard the voices i was almost sure we were all going crazy but now i'm sure they're real which means it's true we are crazy make any progress yet i really can't lose another soldier all right let's play detectives if i was a missing soldier wandering off into the night hearing voices whole place is gonna fall apart without hear me my children and know the truth for thousands of years our people burrowed in darkness look into the skies forever longing for stars yet somehow [Music] and we can all finally relinquish ourselves into its embrace come on oh come on don't do this i just came looking for my friend he belongs here now we all do today the storm welcomes an apostate into its loving embrace how can you listen to this [ __ ] the anomaly is no god it's just some election magnetic planetary [ __ ] it's [ __ ] science man science cannot save your soul [Music] i've seen enough no more dunderheads are falling for your [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm [Music] uh too late pal me and the anomaly already embraced can't say [Music] [Music] so what's up [Music] so stayed up get the [ __ ] out of here go that's the end of that i should bring the good news to captain dunham guy's crazier than a soup sandwich back on earth guys like him and get locked in a padded cell back on earth back on earth that no one remembers that [ __ ] man it's over some of my men have begun returning what happened oh seems you had yourself a little cult brewing up here i don't know this place seems to make people flip their [ __ ] lids at least a few made it back alive thank you i don't care how much of your brain that called from you don't have a task you better ask for one or you're gonna wish you never got rescued i'm on my way across to secure the cable car to the tower good i'll gather my equipment hold on i still got the small matter of taking out an entire insurgent base first ah yes well uh not much i can help with there do try not to die kill that idiot [Music] [Music] so you're gonna see it [Applause] [Music] oh so so [Music] there's a haiti up here but monsters and insurgents right why even bother fighting over because of that you understand why we built it right it was our last hope for hail mary to find that signal but it never worked there was always too much anomaly interference and without the frequency it was impossible to track down the insurgents eventually captured the tower slaughtered everyone not even knowing what it was for this mountain could have been what finally brought us together instead it led to more disappointment after all that you're still trying why because we have to so cinema so some kind of writing visible so [Music] so woof [Music] hey gotta clear out this fort before i can reach ford looks clear for now better move out before they regroup so hey zahidi i've been wondering no one ever tried flying over the anomaly of course they tried i mean back in the day when we had things that could fly and they dropped like a rock when the electronics line there is no such thing as over the anomaly or under or around there's just dive for cover in the survive dunham i'm inside of the radio tower have your people ready to grab that cable car and send zahidi over waiting on your word altered so so so so there's some notes here [Music] captain i've freed the cable car it's yours outrider if your frequency really works if that radio tower leads us to the signal if we can contact the florist needless to say this can change everything one step at a time doc let's just get you over here in one piece yes that would be nice [Music] hold it the signal that's now we're too far away there's too much interference from the anomaly coordinates but i have a direction [Music] god damn it what is it it's either in the forest or somewhere beyond what aren't you telling me nobody's ever come back alive from the forest yeah i figured you're gonna say something like that listen you hear that something's under the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah i could prepare the truck we're heading towards the forest oh the forest of course driving into savage uncharted territory and breathing a fungus that liquefies your orchid was on my list of things to do today you know if i had a [ __ ] nickel for every time maybe switched the radio off a little [Music] while easy watch those flames this is as pleasant as it gets these powers what i can do none of it makes any [ __ ] sense has anyone ever studied an altar try to understand why how opportunities for study aren't exactly lining up you're the first to offer oh i'm not offering there is one who's known for delving into the secrets of your kind but not gently he's an altered notorious for the trail of experiments he's left behind they call him the alchemist both sides stay far away but he has a lab somewhere deep in these mountains if you go looking be careful but of course i'd be very curious to know what you find i'm in point the way the alchemist is hidden somewhere in these mountain peaks but i worry you might actually find him i suspect he's tampering with forces not easily contained [Music] can we go already what you see a lot of rumors about grand marshal goodman finding a new altar whoa no touching beastie boys on vinyl even on earth these were hard to come by how do you know about that a long story you collector someone gotta be everyone else is all too ready to forget how did uh all this get here well when we left earth all we all got was one box of our things now people got no interest all the junk we brought but not me this is our history while we was well we lost my little museum of earth always looking for donations oh my still has ink how like i said long story thank you without memories of the past the future means so little if you come across anything else from old earth there's a home for it here the apollo 11 i remember watching old footage of that man walking the moon they'd play it on repeat in the recruitment center when i was being evaluated for the flores supposed to inspire us or something well can't deny that victory though landing on a rock in space the first time no one can deny the victory of sailing through deep space to this rock either but i'm afraid if you live long enough every victory turns out a defeat well well a wrist watch sm flores limited edition this one was given to civilians to track their hibernations so they could know how old they really were you might think this watch has stopped working but it's exactly right all time has come to a standstill in this valley just a question of counting down to our extinction without memories of the past the future means so little if you come across anything else from old earth there's a home for it here you ever wonder if you're still come see what wonders i have for sale another time mister i'm having one shitty day ah little wind blows for us all come how about a little hot tea not much of an inventory ah don't mind all this crap on that one i keep all the good stuff should have paid old man you're altered i didn't know i think i care he was about to show me the good stuff he's just acting on orders whose orders parker uh he runs the hounds gang he's trying to take out all the vendors in rift town it won't work for him first [ __ ] day go home you're drunk hey shira i got some business in house territory what can you tell me about their leader this guy barker he fights dirty preys on the innocent his men are loyal because they're terrified of him did you let this guy run things inside your walls he's too well fortified at the bottom of the rift i'm fighting one damn war already i can't afford another it seems the hounds have outlived their usefulness to you good thing i came along i'm sure the hounds hideout barker will be down here somewhere ah come on so looks like the scumbag who killed chang was telling the truth about the hounds [Music] so is so [ __ ] off you can't take her back who the girl this isn't a rescue you barker do i know you mr chang sends his regard oh come on it's right in the middle of my line you are taking too long planning it all the way here thanks for the rescue anyway again really wasn't here for you did you say mr chang is you all right um [ __ ] like it's not bad enough having insurgents trying to drag us all to hell we got to have these low-life gangsters on our streets picking us off from the inside yeah i know the game really hasn't changed a whole lot hey you did a good thing got a bad guy off the street and i'm walking home without a scratch i'm eva by the way got a stall near chang's place you should all come see me there sometime grand marshals got us patrolling from damn town thanks again for getting the guy who killed mr chang they gotta be at each other well well i was hoping i'd see you around these parts again well you just made a lousy day 2.5 better besides with mr chan gone i still need a vendor well anything you see happy to give you a better discount they're saying the houndstop i know you have a million questions but i don't have time you let me sleep in a few too many [ __ ] years i think you can find some time you've been gone too long to understand how truly [ __ ] we are there can be more than 50 or 60 000 of us left more on the other side than ours soon there'll be none of us left to fight the insurgent's last assault was a distraction they were digging tunnels and planting charges right beneath us they blew our front line all to hell i noticed the reports of casualties are uncountable and one of my best men was out there lieutenant mccain but a message just got through and he's trapped under the rubble still alive i don't have any more men to spare i need you to get him out it's the least i can do i want to hear the moment our search parties turn up anything about mccain this mccain is still alive i need to find it thank you so shira i'm looking at the epicenter of the explosion this is where the collapse started i doubt mccain survived this i don't need your doubts i need him alive so so so so ah why did it just get so quiet [Music] hey shira what am i looking at some kind of walking giant out here keep your voice down ryder you don't want it to notice you believe me it can wipe out hundreds in a second even the altered respect them coast is clear keep digging we're almost hold out i got you wait wait don't shoot we're all in this together right now i got you pretend mccain you all right i'm alive thank you soldier it's okay now let's get the rest of my men out [Applause] [ __ ] seriously war is war what you think we just hug it why do i even bother good to see you again without memories of the past the future means so little hmm i remember these used to be we thought we was keeping these forms generations to come could look at one of these see our movies our stories how we lived and loved now it all may as well never have existed i'm pretty busy right now what do you need your lieutenant's dead tell me he died like a hero sure if that's what you want to hear he was a real [ __ ] hero whatever we did know that this is war outrider all must be forgiven until we win are you so sure it's even worth winning anymore god i'm gone who the [ __ ] is gonna hold this place together [Music] he was thought to be operating in a hidden bunker somewhere near the insurgent occupied radio tower i'll do sweep of the area looks like the hidden bunker zahidi mentioned the alchemist must be close no set me free just body do using pows as lab rats why am i not surprised hey zahidi what else can you tell me about this alchemist couple years ago i stumbled on some buried reports seemed like old president nyberg was funding the alchemists experiments they were hoping to make a weapon to use against the insurgents but whatever it was this alchemist produced it scared the eca the reports were buried the details classified [Music] where is it in their death this alchemist spent years experimenting with the anomaly he was capturing soldiers nailing them to crosses in the storm shoving the anomaly right up their asses trying to make them altered to weaponize them no in the end i think he was trying to figure out how to reverse it how to make himself human [Applause] again don't cry little girl don't cry there is tranquility in death now sleep sleep little girl god smells oh ah so [Music] uh did i ask you to wrench me from darkness to make my soul a puppet like you were my god you experimented on me like a rodent and now you'd shove me back into darkness no it is you who shall be known by darkness and all who claim falsely to be gods tahiti i found the alchemist he's dead stabbed with a rebar then burned all to hell or the other way around insurgents get to him no one of his test subjects subject six seems like he survived the alchemist's experiments and he wasn't too happy about it my god come on back outright the alchemist what did you find no answers i'm just another insane [ __ ] who paid the price for his questions this is unexpectedly are you kidding me not gonna make it worse no i got it i got it so we've got problem insurgents have taken the quarry and the only road headed east has been mine there's no way through unless we talk to corrigan he's the grand marshal up in trench town and he is now known for being generous to strangers fortunately i told that charming young lady out there that we were headed east now don't tell people where we're going right i wouldn't normally but it turns out she's corrigan's associate she'll give us an intro if we help her drive up a package what kind of package try anything girly and your shirt pathetic life is over ain't over till it's over sweetheart you who are you sean i go to the end of the [ __ ] world and you're still in my [ __ ] face go drown in your bottle [ __ ] why am i not surprised to see you in chains again that girl is she a friend of yours someone from a long time ago any reason she eats your gut so much many then look around what is this place anyway dead rock patch marshall collins turf the only stop between rift town and trench town all the lumber to build the trenches on the front line comes from here used to be trees as far as you can see now it's mostly just mud can someone get cully we got it anybody out there hello hey is anyone there i'm trapped down at the lumber yard there's uglies everywhere hello you people just gonna let me die out here hey i hear you i'm coming oh thank god thank you that sign not knowing where i'd rather be i can't afford another day with no lumber marshall cullen better do something quick or somebody's going to do something about you did you hear where flynn got [Music] you got this [Applause] [Music] oh oh thank [ __ ] god about time they sent an altered how do they expect us to hold this god forsaken not here for you oh [ __ ] man we could really use your help we've lost contact with our logging camp in the valley my workers could have all been shooting the bloody gristle by goddamn face heaters for all i know the hell are you snorting i can't be approved of around here approved you kidding they'll send us to the wreckage zone if we don't take this it's the only thing that helps us forget we're starving they say it causes cancer after a dozen years but nobody [ __ ] lives long enough to care tell me about the logging camps you sent anyone to check on them of course i send people i need that wood to fortify our trenches any delays cost goddamn lives but my scouts never came back look i know you're busy you're you're a [ __ ] altered but could you could you find out what happened to them i'll give you a cut of the action i'll help you this once but don't get used to it don't give them anything and they ain't got nothing that's how you hold it together call it where exactly is this logging camp dig the elevator down to the main operation hey altered you hear me you got to find out what the hell's going on out there we need to get back to work yeah i hear ya i'm a businessman you get me i've made certain guarantees guarantees i cannot fail to meet i need to get back in business you following me barely tell the grand marshall we've secured the camp he'll have his first shipment tomorrow this coming guy just lost his business and doesn't even know it yet corrigan will do a better job [Music] hmm ah so great so so [Music] messing with us so [Music] uh uh [Applause] so [Music] okay come on let's go we we getting you new masters again new masters what happened to the old ones i don't know uh some men came in uh corrigans i think and they killed them all but it doesn't matter because we just do as we're told cut wood carry water you think i care who holds the whip okay [ __ ] this i'm the only one here you're free to go no no no no no please let me stay they'll send me back to fight in the trenches here here i just work and they feed me good please believe me okay then i guess i should tell cullen about this little [ __ ] can't the man take a [ __ ] get out of here you ugly [ __ ] of course he's trapped in his shells the last of them hey buddy looks like it's safe to come come on get out of there you out of your mind i'm leaving this here [ __ ] until the sun's all the way up i'm not waiting around here for the sun to come out then please just turn on the camp generator it'll light up the area fine i'll get the damn generator oh that's i think it's gonna really loud over here okay okay pull your pants up already no one's gonna die but some monsters so so ah that better be the last of them see if that idiot comes out of his hole now it's all clear you can come on out and get chewed up by the next monster that finds me hell no i'm staying right here seriously suit yourself i'm leaving check your weapons before you head out oh i found the camp your uh workers are in one piece seems as corgin had taken over corrick [ __ ] we're supposed to be [ __ ] allies man and he steals from me what the [ __ ] oh [Music] and and you just killed all this men [ __ ] corrigan will crucify me now look if if you see him gotta tell him i have nothing to do with this yeah i'm not gonna do that just give me my reward i'm done oh this is bad real bad but it's not on me i ain't got nothing to do with anything i told him let's go buckle up we're moving out and so you gather your flock [Applause] this chick bailey as she said there's bandits on the road don't worry jakob i'll go first and clear the way stay behind me always happy to let you be the bullet sponge in front yes they're repelling down the cliff so clear keep going they won't be trying that stunt again those were only scouts if they haven't alerted others who are present all that noise you may have ah lady about this corrigan what can i expect he's the grand marshal of trench town and the quarry out east if we want to reach the forest we need to go through him about that forest you know my unit was in there half of them were vomiting up black sludge yes but don't worry i think i have a plan so [ __ ] tried so hard to never see this place again hey keep your trap shut where do i find this corrigan the big bunker i'll let him know you're coming though your kind's pretty hard to miss that woman who is she doesn't matter look we drop her off as soon as we can and we'll be on our way okay end of story i have a feeling it's not last time through here you know i thought this place already smelled about as bad as it could get but nothing be careful in the wreckage though out ryder who did this to you looks like a good bye letter the 80. i found an outrider he was hanged he left the goodbye letter it says something about a secret outrider enclave he had a key to it and he gave it to a girl named lucy lucy from trench town you know her well not exactly i mean no why do you i think i know where to begin searching shut up they're not even where else is how are you supposed to live like that those damn missiles here comes another one mind if i join no yeah i need you here guarding the trucks right because an old drunk is really going to scare a bunch of gun-toting truck thieves away why my little darling she was such a good girl she was so sweet they said you'd come i'm not staying long please it's my daughter she's far across the wreckage zone what happened to your daughter when the last war broke out she was caught on the insurgent side of the wreckage zone but there's a smuggler this brave woman who's been risking her life to bring me her letters and take my packages back to her food medicine whatever valuables i can scrounge it's the only thing keeping her alive but now after that last damnation rocket tore my leg to shreds if i don't reach the smuggler by nightfall should be gone i've offered all that i have as reward but no one's willing to risk the zone i don't have long left i need theresa to read my last word so she'll know that i fought as long as i could and that i sent her as much as i could all right give me the package i'll find the smugglers i should head to the wreckage zone if i'm gonna find these smugglers i realized i'm not even noticing bombs and missiles going off anymore you even start to miss them when they stop to reload so this is gootman's new altered she sent you to intimidate me aren't you both on the same side today i just need passage through your mind field i don't want to waste money you're prisoner what did you do my fortune teller predicted victory and my men walked into an ambush told you what you wanted to hear i can't force the [ __ ] visions i told you of your [ __ ] we fight tomorrow with no altered at our size you've got serious issues you have an altered right here you will fight with this men tomorrow yeah just let the girl go i don't have time for this who the hell is she to you she's like some kind of daughter to me oh hold on you had a daughter yeah maybe more like i was screwing her mom for a couple of years and maybe her aunt facts are blurry i like benjamin very much they want the passage east and the witch fine you would take seth's place in battle wait seth is here the great altered was last seen out in the wreckage zone hunting one of your kind then i'll go find them you do that the assaults tomorrow are dawn if i'm to give up my oracle i expect to see one of you back here or our deal is yeah yeah okay thank you leave the truck again and i'll welch you to the wheel my altered friend so you decided to follow seth into the ruins of the old industrial zone i used to be in charge of that place and you want it back or something back in the day it was the heart of our industry right up until the anomaly fried all our tech then that engine exploded in our faces and irradiated the area for good measure it was mayhem i dragged those people out of there i saved them i created this town i could use an accomplice think about it there's nothing to think about to know your enemy i didn't order anything only thing we serve you look like you need it if you're here to shop feel free to browse my goods hope he gave the other guy worse i did there was an old man gave me this impressive well there's plenty more devils like him on this god planet and i like decorating my walls i can make every head you bring back to me worth your while why'd you just point me to the closest creature that needs some killing you like the decor maybe some want to try the new blend call it the liver spinner hit let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night people here seem to give you lots of room what can i say they're happy to slaughter each other all day as soon as ujo makes a business of it their sensibilities are offended what exactly is your business certain mercenary services i hand out contracts for players on the opposite field no one else seems able to take down snipers captains the real bastards you seem like the type who could handle the more challenging mark might you be interested in filling your pocket with a small stipend those shells raining down seem to be a permanent fixture around here launch is quite inaccurate but when it and it always hits something there's a reason the missiles are called damnation the insurgents must have sent a suicide squad into the wreckage zone to get it so close to us suicide squad the zones in irradiated hellhole volunteers aren't exactly lining up but there is a sizable reward sounds crazy good thing i like crazy give me the good stuff if i sit here long enough those rocket trails must be coming from the missiles ugia mentioned i can follow them to their source altered satisfy my curiosity why are you taking orders from a human let alone shira gootman how about you give me information instead bailey said seth was hunting another altered who was he do you think seth discusses his godly affairs with us mortals seth offered to lead tomorrow's assault then walked off on some personal vendetta truth is i don't care long as one of you returns to give me my victory tomorrow we'll talk then outrider so ah so so so seems this zone hasn't been entirely abandoned the area is still heavily irradiated but that doesn't stop scavengers or insurgents from roaming around and digging up whatever scrap they can find those interesting well this should be interesting might as well put my skills to good use [Music] [Music] good contract gotcha so [Music] eugeo want to hear the end of your story my god let's go ah so ah god so so hey um look i know you don't care right now but uh i owe you one we're helping you with china what'd you do to her nothing never has to be any kind of dad last thing i wanted anyway jacob wait there's something else i've seen her before what where i uh i had a vision when i was in cryo you two with this [ __ ] give me a break you're welcome trench town anytime please dude you'll promise me a reward for this one so foreign thank you know what the hell happened here well [ __ ] me jakub seth's dead what he's never been defeated [Music] you see they call him molok jacob there's another altered out here someone more powerful than seth well that's just [ __ ] awesome corrigan seth is dead impossible you are lying i saw him he's charcoal we've already mobilized to the front time you made good on our deal [Applause] hey altered it's marshall bailey get to the front line the assault is about to begin it's too late why are you so interested in the little witch i could care less about her i'm just helping an old friend you're altered why would you do anything for peons the peons and i are in this together all that power wasted on an idiot like you you like the decor join us for a drink i believe we have business to discuss target neutralized pleasure doing business them you went into the zone and you're back in one piece seems like it very impressive in the future i'm sure there'll be more work for a person with your superior skills what are you gonna do [Music] when you get up there don't stop moving stay wide stay scattered i can't believe it is that an altar where'd this one come from freaks has grown out of the ground now jesus don't let them hear you say that but one of them's got to slip past at some point right i'm telling you today we shall see victory a great new altered fights on our side together we shall [ __ ] them so so so so so don't give them time to breathe so so come on oh that was easy you still kissing peasy piece of junk coming hey at least better than kissing the sergeant's ass give me that what is that anyway that's from the old world oh you wouldn't understand you can't even [ __ ] read sorry grandma it's not a [ __ ] life hey my grandma was a general [ __ ] a man do you see that oh a new altered you've come to finish what seth failed to do my fight's not with you oh it is now you fight with them that means you die with them [Music] so so you're done ah uh so all this persistence this world is crashing down [Music] and what will be left without us that's how you thank a girl for saving your life i knew my fortune teller was gold she saw exactly where you were buried i'm done you said my deal's a deal you're free to go your [ __ ] prophecies can be someone else's problem the assault tell me this pounding headache was worth it the news is good of course it was a bloodbath but while you were entertaining that abomination we took back the front are you sure i can't entice you to stay life is good around here for the altered glory of battle women men worshippers at your feet thanks i'm somewhere i gotta be east the quarry's overrun past that's the edge of the world what does gootman have you looking passage through the minefield that was our deal marshall bailey knows the way she'll see your convoy through what a [ __ ] way guide us over radio draw a map we are not taking her we i never said you were coming i'd say you always had a home here altered but i don't think you'll be coming back alive did you piss off i don't need anyone else to babysit i can take care of myself no where we're going hey just wait it ain't over until it's over did you just it's how i know i'm supposed to go with you the anomaly [ __ ] me up too but i only get the visions always horrible visions all my life except one one that's beautiful it's this planet but it's lush and it's green it's it's in the future there's always someone there with me i could never see the face but the voice it's you whatever it is you're doing i know it's gonna work because in the end we're in that meadow [Music] together keep an air to the sky the beast him [Music] anything i can do for you where did these visions come from the anomaly that killed my mom i ripped through a hot in the middle of the night decided to spare me i just [ __ ] with my head i'm sorry the bad violent awful [ __ ] that's all i ever see i was a kid when it happened i used to think i was going insane well what'd you figure out you weren't i'm still not so sure these visions how do you know they're real how do you know yours are real i don't see the future just shitty things that have already happened except once actually the first time it happened i i saw you well there you go so you see the future you can tell me when to dodge a bullet i wish ah that's not how it works i just get flashes i don't control it it just happens and half the time i read it wrong but corrigan was crazy about you i get it right just often enough yeah i know i took a lot of crap about shira but she does have one thing going for her she's not as crazy as cory oh hell no i'm not going anywhere with that [ __ ] china can't come with us that wasn't the deal in the truck both of you john what do you think you're doing listen to me for once where i am taking these two there's no coming back i didn't save your life again to watch you throw it all away that's what you're telling yourself now you're my savior it's pathetic fine next time you're in trouble i will think twice i'll let you die you stupid cow well you gotta die somewhere and if it's out there at least i get to watch you go first john this is where the minefield ends it's just up ahead behind that wrecked excavator so so ah ah look at the size of that thing that's one of the old excavators and i was here when it was being built took industrial printers two weeks to put the damn thing together that beast could move mountains now look at it what a tragedy so so so uh morgan mentioned the quarry we're heading toward was overrun they take it we're gonna need to tread carefully it's probably filled up with mutated freaks by this point we've been fighting over that goddamn hole in the ground since i can remember but last time the insurgency came back corrigan decided it wasn't worth any more of our time we blasted the place and filled the road with mines to protect our flank ah so [ __ ] [Music] hmm hey so so the road's clear what next that's our way to the quarry you need to find a way to open the gate will do hmm the journal so so so [Applause] so found the gates controls finally jacob the road's yours so long [ __ ] you're heading back across the minefield on foot better than where you're headed have fun getting yourselves killed that's it the quarry got a plan to get us through alive we have to make some modifications to the truck you're not touching the truck we have to seal the interior then with lithium perchlorate to generate oxygen and iron powder and lithium hydroxide to scrub co2 english please the truck will be like a bubble and we'll be safe inside so long as we have lithium to generate oxygen that'll give us time to find the source of the signal would you expect me to magically pour more lithium out of my ass when our supply runs out i can do without the snide remarks the only source of lithium on enoch comes from old batteries from earth and most of them were scavenged for parts long ago but the mining operations been inaccessible for years there's bound to still be some of them around here simply put we find the batteries we get to live oh better and better let's move i think this is gonna work just seal the vents seal the doors no air will get into the truck if we do this we can survive i hope so zahidi i'm heading in tell me exactly what i'm looking for you're looking for old batteries they could be in capacitors engines mining equipment old burns electronics three batteries should be enough i hope hey outrider tahiti mention you've known jakub since earth what was he like back then it was always rough if that's what you're asking look back on earth it was dark times it turned us all cold and now this place to survive all that only to end up somewhere worse it's made him even worse yeah well doesn't excuse the [ __ ] he's done sure but it maybe goes away to explain things this one looks attacked two more to go so ah good enough one more left hey boss do you really think the dog's flat is gonna work it doesn't sound good for reassurance no i am asking if you got a death wish and are dragging the rest of us down with you is this about shanna he's got reasons for a choice yeah i think he just got to live with it yeah i have a suspicion it won't be for long so so so [Music] so zahidi i've got all the lithium excellent bring them on back and i can finish building the purifier you real think so how long you've been here days weeks lost count [ __ ] insurgents flooded in and murdered all the miners he was supposed to be the neutral down here i managed to hide but these sons of [ __ ] lined up my men they slit their throats like [ __ ] cattle i had a plan i had a [ __ ] plan explosives in the elevator shaft you're gonna bury them alive down there yeah but it's not working lying ah the lion's got somewhere maybe you can repair i'll repair the line hang tight don't drag this out any more than you have to i want to give those insurgents what's coming to them well this should be interesting count me in what were you mining for down here anyway any mental resources we could find to support the colonization and after that the war effort was back breaking but we made it work we were mining to keep our people alive corrigan's people protected us it worked until these dams insurgents broke through foreign um ah [Music] oh so hmm [Music] it's awesome thank you [Music] so what were you mining for down here anyway any mental resources we could find to support the colonization and after that the war effort was back breaking but we made it work we were mining to keep alive corvin's people protected us until these damned insurgents broke through [Music] first hmm so hmm what exactly am i looking for here the spot where the line's been blasted apart you got to piece it back together again for it to work i found the break in the line can you fix it i want to blow this place sky high yeah i can fix it hold off the fireworks till i'm back so so hey the line looks good hey you still there [ __ ] i need to get back to him did you find where the line is broken you came back the line's replaced didn't want you to miss the fireworks thank god could you we'll do it together music to my should have seen that coming i don't think that uh he just got real lucky old man what if she comes with us if we make it through someone has to keep the briefcase and me safe when you're not around look old man i don't do charity work please we need you give me a break she's playing us this is her way of weaseling her way into our troops she's spying for corrigan you see that in your crystal ball admit it you psychopath you know i'm right you couldn't pay me enough of whatever prize you're after freak tracking a signal that's coming from beyond the anomaly when we find it we're going to reconnect to the florists and bring down those lost supply pods keep dr zahidi alive and keep your stupid mouth shut and you'll get your share of the loon deal [ __ ] believable i know i know she's a pain yes but uh why if you lay a hand on her ever again i'll run you over with this goddamn truck that bailey what a character eh crazy but jacob you came here under orders you don't have to go any further who's gonna keep this dupac truck running if not me don't worry i know a thing or two you you remember nothing i taught you what are you even going on the suicide mission for anyway because i believe there's a better world out there somewhere doesn't matter where we go we'll still be there to [ __ ] it up yeah well with that attitude we got one shot at this let's be honest anyone who follows me out there today is probably gonna die and we'll all be home for christmas how do i keep getting myself into the [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah oh we need to fix the purifier where's the point huh the truck is [ __ ] worry about that later let's reseal the door don't go out there just wait for me [Music] [Music] so you picked a great time to show up so [Music] uh so [Music] do [Music] do doesn't end this way you can't yeah is that what your magic [ __ ] fairy vision said because it sure as hell doesn't look like we're getting out of here and what no no no it's okay something happens who the hell are you hey where are you taking us who the hell are you people all your questions will be answered when we reach dr scurlock it's too late we're not making it any doctor stand down or your people will die you [ __ ] die with them i'm not threatening them [ __ ] i'm trying to save them the hell what exactly is in this please please uh do not fear my name is nathan skurlock xenobiologist dr abraham zahidi can you explain oh my what an unexpected honor i was a follower of your father's work um at least um as long as possible i haven't uh so much claim to fame as you can see there is one breakthrough of mine that served us rather well just tell us how it works yes yes of course i apologize the fungus wasn't always like this its dna was altered my formula merely tells the fungus against itself here all who are brave enough to reach us are free to live in peace my antidote must be injected daily none of us dare stray far away from camp without it with this small ceremony each month not just in time for one no alters i'm afraid i hope that the rest of your convoy will attend this evening we're not planning on staying long oh beyond here there's only death until the truck is repaired we're stuck here anyway good thank you jacob look what i found in the forest this was cuthbert we've been here before well [ __ ] i thought things looked familiar but i thought it was skirlux drugs but unless you can pull a spare oil pump from your ass we're not going very far we left the truck here before that day the first storm hit maybe i can find it find it that was 30 years ago not for me what the [ __ ] do you want i got a proposition for you might keep you all alive for another day i like to tinker and refurbish my gear exactly how i like it and i'm gonna have a lot of time on my hands while you're out there pretending you're saving the world anything i fix up i'm willing to sell for a fair price you want me to pay you to play around with guns hey it's skilled labor and it ain't free if you don't like it don't buy it but i intend to make the most out of this suicide run this has got to be the dumbest idea corgan's ever had what do you have to say this isn't gonna take the weight i've been seeing shadow you see my wife can i get you the calendar with the knife in it what's the story bad [ __ ] luck is what i'm in trouble this [ __ ] guy i'm in debt too he said i gotta pay by that date or play his game what kind of game if i win he wipes my deck clean i lose bang but no one ever [ __ ] wins this game what the [ __ ] am i gonna do i'm dead either way say maybe you could have a war with him i'll take your place in the game hey outrider just so you get it if you don't have a chat with that gambler someone's gonna come looking for me i'll look around for the guy mercero's a debt to curious to see what his game's about hey shut up just when you think this rotten planet can't get any worse the freaking creatures out there hey you remember my tunes i used to play like it was yesterday i can still remember some of them um please stop please i'm serious um oh ryder you wouldn't believe how much i've learned from dr scurlock here don't get distracted that's not what we're here for but part of the reason we're here in the first place is to find a way out of the trenches for everyone what if we brought the antidote back to shira we'd also bring the summary execution of everyone who makes the they're deserters remember oh yes i haven't considered that okay so hey you got a plan what we're gonna do about all these deserters we're not doing anything with them bailey are you kidding me these people abandoned the eca they're traitors we're sticking with the mission you can go back to corrigan empty-handed or you can fall in line so alright this is dr scurlock i must profess it it's been a delight to have met yourself and your companions we're grateful for the help doctor but i have to ask your antidote to the fungus why do you keep it to yourselves out here our people are trapped in the valley if they knew that yes if they knew think about it what's the first thing they would do they would be so afraid of the other side getting it they'd have to be locked up war is all they know how to think about those narrow-minded tribal idiots out here it's different we are all free we don't live in fear of our neighbors stood in our throats men and women allies and enemies here nature the elements are our only enemy sounds too good to be true well it's we do what we can do resources are scarce but you and your companions may stay as long as you need outrider the one this is your friend from the underworld i will be handling your induction induction as i told scurlock we're just passing through scurlock has no say in who stays or leaves i'm in command of the cab security sure but this camp wouldn't exist without scurlock in his vaccine wouldn't exist without my soldiers uh uh [Music] so uh [Applause] so so so so uh jacob i found the truck what's it look like exactly as we left it here's something in common get that oil pop will you okay i've got the pump for the truck good now hurry back this meat hasn't stopped giving me the side eye screw till they push back then loosen a little you forget everything i taught you taught me you think you taught me anything old man unbelievable feisty she definitely got her temper from you looks like we're taking a break i guess you've earned the right to hear the full story so uh a long time ago before this shitty planet before we even left earth i was flying workers to the caravel orbit station and the flames started to surround me and i tried to find an exit that's when i tripped and i saw this damn pregnant woman lying under the rubble [Music] i was able to save both of us well sri hold on you were there during the careful disaster all the survivors of the caraval were given a free ticket aboard the brand new flores and i met her again right here in trench town her child was born it was a girl and she named her chanda then that little brand was only six when she saw her mother killed right in front of her so you raised her go on the truck isn't going to fix itself hey yakum that was a sweet story back there but it still doesn't explain why channa hates your guts why do you think i didn't have to be a father in a [ __ ] hole like this you know what the survival rate is for kids but turned out i was wrong little girl managed to grow up after all who knows maybe you did her a favor if you hadn't been such a bastard she wouldn't have gotten tough enough to survive yeah you go and tell her that she'll love you for it so mercero's in debt to curious to see what his game's about janet jacob told me what happened between you did he tell you how my mother died i'm sorry no kid should have to see that even better i saw it twice the first time in a vision you know i tracked down jacob begged him to come back cause he wasn't there in the vision when she died i thought if he was there maybe it wouldn't come true but jacob doesn't listen to anything i say almost got eaten in the forest yesterday this morning that's almost [ __ ] funny outright if i may as an altered you are not allowed to join our ceremony due to scientific complexity but rest assured your presence in our humble camp is appreciated i personally oversaw preparation for your private hat there's a place to rest food even a bottle of something special you'll find it by the stairs to the ceremony tenth few make it out this far alive even less mean to keep going what is it you're looking for friend i'm not your friend you don't know what's out there there are things i could tell you things i could warn you about but you would not believe these things and what makes you so sure because the things i've seen even i do not believe them [Music] that was skirlock's little ceremony how was it it was weird a bunch of rambling speeches about brotherhood we all picked stones from a basket but hey there is music and free drugs so not all bad where's tahiti went off with scurlock talking some science mumbo jumbo well he'll be back no he won't your friend picked the black stone what are you talking about you're taking him to the facility get me out of here i'll lead you tahiti where are you tahiti do you copy [ __ ] you know i would scurlock makes his antidote here very few know what goes on inside and how do you i used to help him make it until he took a friend of mine prisoner skurlock has his laboratory here but it's kang and his soldiers who run this stronghold they will not welcome you kindly just tell me what they want with the heat nothing good you need to hurry before it's too late stop hey how you doing i'd like to see dr zahidi please this facility is off limits you will not get a second warning sound the alarm [Music] what's up cheers [Music] uh so peace how many of our people will interpret thiago where's scurlock's lab look for the stairs leading up to skurlocks hut he'll be holding your friend there people that's what they injected us with he needed bone marrow for the antidote to work all those people who escaped the war came here to die instead and i was next you think that was easy for me doctor it's random it has to be except for you safe from your own lottery i suppose how convenient i create the antidote i'll keep us alive how many exactly have you sacrificed for your little utopia i am not a monster i carry the burden a few must be sacrificed so many can live what are you going to choose who lives and dies i don't hide behind a basket of stones when i kill man he knows it was me take as much as you can carry you didn't have to kill him he was a man of science there's so few of us left he was a self-righteous murderer what does that make me then his antidote god help me we're still gonna use it you haven't yet seen anything oh august oh my god is that a native of enoch i found august out there lost and alone i tried to give shelter but scurlock only saw a specimen to experiment on this this changes everything no more it can talk august it's all right they're not like the others they're friends okay you're free now go home get dr zahidi back to my truck your alien friend just disappeared august does not disappear so much as moving ways we cannot perceive we need to get out of here i know a back exit through the caves i can lead us out to safety get zahidi out safe i'm going back out the front door to deal with king's new [Applause] arrivals i won't be making the same i won't have to worry about so uh we're gonna [Music] this crowd outrider we made it out to the convoy your new friend knows this area very well i think he can be trusted we are ready to go or should we see if anyone else out there wants to kidnap tahiti first funny i'm on my way outrider i take it you're here for a reason our camp's beginning to panic nobody will be mourning scurlock but without the antidote we're not going to be able to last long there's a large stash in the lab we only took what we needed i know it's there i assisted dr skurlock in his work what's there won't last long there may be something we can do that the doctor would have never been willing to risk for so long our only contact with those beyond the forest was deceit and death you understand that the antidote requires a steady supply of human flesh but there's one thing that they haven't said he's fly beyond the forest it's the dead you're proposing a trade bodies of dead soldiers we harvest their spinal fluid and in return we share the antidote there are those who will never forgive what you've been a part of i know but if we share what we make maybe we can start to make amends there is still one problem the sap of the toka tree it's the hardest ingredient to obtain thiago used to be the only one capable of it but now that he's part of your party well this should be interesting so how many exactly have attempted this little run at the forest before us seven seven expeditions some long ago before we even knew what we were dealing with the most recent about five years ago and they knew they knew exactly what was waiting for them out there and they still went you remember anything about earth i remember a road runner in this uh coyote i remember laughing so much i couldn't stop it's amazing to think they kept playing cartoons right to the end i mean my whole generation we went to school we played games online we hung out with our friends knowing we wouldn't grow up well you did yeah i grew up to see most people i know die grew up a refugee with bombs falling every night and yet i still feel guilty china's visions are they real her and her [ __ ] visions you know i have visions all the time too i have visions of [ __ ] sucking my long john silver but it never happens what the hell did you see in there a real alien my god we'll have to report this to gutman i can't believe we've been next to an alien civilization all these years in this case aren't we the aliens these ruins are ancient if beings like the ones we saw sent the signal it wasn't from here are you sure we're still heading in the right direction honestly outright or i don't know but if you can get a receiver above this tree line we should be close enough to pick up the trail again i know of a structure give me a radio i can guide you real charming place you brought us up there is a monument in these ruins that stands above the forest follow the trail you will see it through the canopy it was in these ruins i found august after skurlock found out kang had fighters stationed here hoping he'd catch more natives his people may still be lurking here right now i bet kang's more interested in finding us so so so [Applause] your alien friend august if this is where you found them maybe you'll turn up around here again if we can turn invisible may not be so easy to spot if marcus wants to be found august will find us it took a long time for august to trust me but after what skurlock did i could not say what august might be thinking anymore that name august where does it come from anyway it is closest to how the name sounds in other state of tongue something like well this should be interesting might as well put my skills to good use so so uh [Music] well this should be interesting count me in so uh so so so so what do you know about these ruins thiago i believe they were built by august's ancestors they've been abandoned for a long time i do not know what happened to them do you know what happened to august people are there more of them i have last august many times either my questions are not understood or august is avoiding them so there's the monument up ahead i need to get the receiver up there uh so outrider these ruins are incredible i wish i had the time to study them perhaps when we come back this way well if we come back [Music] got a direction there's a big storm brewing warn the others we need to find shelter in there ah august you came back [Music] what exactly is your friend doing bailey [ __ ] look at this [ __ ] thing it's making the [ __ ] storm no wait it's not what you think august can channel it control it look august is helping us no [ __ ] billy you need to stand down no i don't think so think maybe i've gone far enough on your little death march think i'm going back to corrigan and taking this freak with me come here uh so this is what it feels like bailey be careful you don't know what this energy could do to you oh no go go really you don't want to do this you could not be more wrong freak i don't know how you just went bailey you need to listen to me [ __ ] well not anymore i'm taking you down i deserve my chance to be a god i don't want to hurt you why i want to hurt you oh so no you don't win this why is it going away no no wait wait no no no she's breathing but her spinal cords most likely severed if she survives she'll never walk again good she can watch the monsters eat her liver let's go no reason to leave her to suffer no i i don't care what she's done we need to bring her i will take care of her personally i i would do the same for any of you really okay now the no [ __ ] version my vision of the meadow i've been seeing more of it bailey's in it how's it supposed to come true if she's not with us in your vision is everyone there how i don't know have you told him he doesn't listen to anything i say hey yakum we need to talk there's i don't know how to say this but this could turn ugly for some of us whenever you're rambling about forget it i need to get the truck ready yeah but just lit what we die here there what's the difference hell we should both be dead a hundred times over every minute we are still breathing is already a bonus so shut up about it yeah ready whenever you are interesting friend you made how'd that happen fate perhaps i stumbled upon august while exploring the forest lost and alone it were eyes that could see my soul august ran at first but got cornered by a beast i was there as a savior as if reordained august wasn't so afraid of me after that are there others august is the only one i've seen we taught each other the little we could of languish but scurlock didn't take long to find us i gotta know uh august is a he or a she i'm not sure myself amazing just amazing it wasn't magic and yet what else can you call it any theories on what august did in that temple uh still formulating but even if i had one there's no way i could replicate wait wait don't look at me i got nothing not true you're more like august than you are like any of us your powers they may manifest in more violent ways but there's no doubt you have a certain control over the anomaly you're thinking i can turn on that big obelisk thing like august well no but whatever bayley did seems to have damaged it but there must be more obelisks out there in the ruins perhaps you could find them i'll try with no promises outrider have you had any success locating another obelisk let me know as soon as you find another obelisk they seem to be the key to all of this want to try the new blend call it the liver spinner that'll do nicely that'll do nicely you know look it's okay if you're scared you don't want to face that target target neutralized pleasure doing business hmm pleasure doing business [Music] keep up good work like this hold up movement in the trees behind us that's king probably wants his revenge now you can get in line is it possible that gate is the end of the anomaly that somehow the structure keeps it contained and on the other side is the promised land we seek tang has followed us far enough time i finished this kang me talk a big game but don't count on him showing up he'd rather leave the dirty work to his fighters well that gives me something to look forward to i'll be back after i deal with these [ __ ] [Music] now [Music] [Music] so so [Music] so so so so [Music] you were right gang didn't show his face he won't until he can be sure the odds are in his favor well that's never gonna happen don't let your guard down i'll scout the road to that gate up ahead so [Music] so uh [Music] ah [Music] what do we have here [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] um so [Music] so ah [Music] how the hell do we open it are we sure we want to that thing looks like the gate to the next circle of hell that gate is all that stands between us and the source of the signal i am this close to changing my mind i can gate outrider let us know if you want us to join you at the gate okay time to figure out how to open this thing i'm waiting for you here everything we've been hoping for is right behind this gate but there's no obvious mechanism for opening it august you must know yes lost people you mean there's others like you maybe what do you mean you know what's out there oh come on that's our only hope it's the end of the goddamn world out there what happened to a place beyond the storms huh we are about to go farther than any man has ever gone before well let's go before i change my [ __ ] mind mr spock crazy look at the size of that storm it's coming fast we need shelter i'll take the lead stay on me well this just gets better and better bailey's barely lucid you need to keep her hydrated i'm trying but we barely have any water left as it is tahiti you sure she'll never walk again it'd be a miracle if she did there i go you're kind of [Music] [Music] so [Music] i don't understand we're getting closer to the signal the only way it could be transmitting is if the anomaly's effects were declining but instead the anomaly here is worse than anything we've seen could it be we're approaching something like the eye of the storm it's possible but such an abrupt change in climate from tropical to desert only the anomaly could cause something so dramatic what if it's actually getting worse this should be interesting might as well put my skills to good use so so [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so that cave looks promising i found a cave should be big enough to bring the trucks in on our way this storm is getting worse by the minute looks like we may be here a while you need to drink you stupid [ __ ] hey she's waking up hey how do you feel you've been out a few days i i can't i can't i can't feel my legs i'm sorry bailey [Music] why didn't you just kill me tada my masterpiece the baraski has outdone himself again what what did i do now oh i thought my daughter wanted you to live but god knows what reason kill me or get out of my face [Music] jonah is that a fire out there seems we're not alone more than the others i'll go check it out hey boss you're gonna be long i could use some help clearing the sands out of the truck's guts i can do it all man yeah what's the catch no catch with you there's always a catch then you storm off for no reason how about you stop acting like you know who the hell i am and stop trying to pretend you care oh chaneshka i know i was a goddamn bastard when you were too young mostly i still am but i'm not pretending well at least you said something so you're gonna let me help sure all right look what you do is i know clean the filters of the engine doesn't choke drain the oil and clear out the debris wow i could almost cry so so me thank you what the [ __ ] oh gratwick do you hear me uh [Music] what the hell jacob the light was an ambush some real uglies they were drawing me out i do copy jack up oh my god august us do nothing us hide now friends taken taken yes they took them yes alive yes far to eat them take this us cannot or else like them stay in the truck i'll find them you sure they're still alive so these brutes with guns you've seen them before what are they so [Music] so so whatever these creatures are i don't think this is their village they don't seem capable of building something like it wait your home and these brutes destroyed it took it over yes i don't understand what happened to your [Applause] people [Music] uh so ah [Music] so so so so so what the [ __ ] hey they took china to the fire pits get the [ __ ] back oh [ __ ] shut up [Music] [Applause] [Music] shut up [Music] never stop causing me trouble do you [Music] get the others out of here now let's dance [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] foreign [Applause] [Music] um outrider we made it back to the convoy we're waiting for you yeah i always thought the old cockroach could survive anything my mom always told me he was the only outrighter on enoch still alive he even escaped the wreck of the caraval back when the earth was dying she said classic but why him you know what was his magic charm i always thought i was just not giving a [ __ ] about any of it like it protected him [Music] well i guess he finally gave a [ __ ] about something [Music] well well [Music] can you believe it turns out the old man's chair on wheels is uh really practical it's only going to get worse the further we go if anybody wants to go back do it now but i got one mission i'm finding that signal you're gonna need a driver jenna just let me know when you're ready to go there's no rush hell i'm ready jakob he never believed in my vision what's this interesting i found some ancient carvings seems like it might be some kind of hieroglyphics from august people incredible can you make anything out not really my area of expertise well perhaps you can find more carvings around the village if there are any you could decipher we might learn something about their history yeah i'll look around i'm sure it wasn't easy growing up with jack of around trying to be a dad believe me he was the least of it being a kid in this [ __ ] war i've heard stories i can imagine [Music] no you can't you know you don't look much older than me but i heard you got to magically jump over the past couple of decades honestly you've got no idea what it was like growing up in this non-stop bloodbath you have any idea what it's like watching your whole [ __ ] planet die [ __ ] i'm sorry you must have lost people yeah yeah well then finally what the [ __ ] these are our trucks but none of our expeditions made it out of the forest alive how is this even possible if they came from the forest they're going the wrong way no look closer this isn't us the enemy then oh my god is that some kind of fuel cell never seen tekkus advanced before who the hell were they whoever they were they lost this was a massacre we can't stay here jenna we need to find shelter we head to those rocks is it just me or do you have a strange feeling that these storms are following us yeah something weird about it hang back until i clear the way i don't get it how did the insurgents get their hands on working fusion cells those weren't insurgents whoever drove those trucks their electronics must have worked in this desert a long time ago so who the hell were they could they have come from the floras like us maybe colonists sent to another part of the planet that would have meant an entirely secret mission siloed off from ours i don't know this seems insane can you think of an explanation currently no so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so thiago has august said anything helpful august has been more quiet than usual i've seen i didn't think we'd make it out of that storm that's no storm look there's someone out there wait isn't that the son of a [ __ ] that killed jakub [Music] man you're really good at pissing people off this [ __ ] not letting this go neither am i next time i see him he's dead up here i found something some kind of outpost looks human you see that antenna over there i can use it to trace a signal savages sure did a number on them i took a closer look at those vehicles never seen weaponry like that before didn't do these people any good yeah might do us some though what are you thinking maybe the main forest broke off when they were attacked you can salvage some of their tech i think i can cobble together something that'll pack a punch you can do that oh man might have taught me a thing or two that stuck yeah i could be proud i'll have a look around find me some of that tech i need something to work with so many of them trapped in their vehicles the haiti how badly do you need that antenna well to be honest i've been having some problems pinpointing the signal since we entered the desert i've just been guiding us on best guesses but with proper equipment i get it we need [Music] this is definitely a military outpost but i don't recognize the insignia at least it's obvious now where those feral aliens got their weapons from it has to make you wonder if we had enemies like these ferals on our side of the gate would we have been too busy to start fighting each other well wouldn't that have been sweet so [Music] [Music] so so so [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do hey there's a pile of reports here you're kidding from the people who were here what's in them it looks like they encountered the same hostile natives as we did they called them ferals they established this fort as a base to send out scouting parties trying to track the ferals down but eventually the ferals found them doesn't look like anyone survived the name munroy appears a lot i think he was their leader monroy okay zahidi the path is clear waiting for your arrival whoa that's really loud [Music] layla i got company [Music] so [Music] so [Music] here they come uh so so [Music] zahidi i think that was the last of them they attempted an ambush but the outpost is secure try and keep it that way this time please you hear that it's a digital relay device what the hell is it supposed to be relay [Applause] [Music] [Applause] power signal [Applause] [Music] our signal [Applause] but how was it playing when i landed how's that even possible it's not it's not possible [Applause] those coordinates we find them we've got the coordinates ready to go on your word boss foreign i wonder if some of the vehicles broke formation after the attack they could be somewhere off the road i should widen my search i should scavenge some of that tech chan asked for so so i bet shanna can do something with this hey tell me something what was yakub like back on earth was he always the bitter [ __ ] who emotionally traumatized my childhood was by far the bitterest [ __ ] i've ever met from day one yeah i figured he was also the most fiercely loyal friend i've ever had it's okay right that i hate him still as much as i miss him he was what he was i trusted him with my life but i knew better than to expect him to be something he wasn't or to get back any money i loaned him i'd pay you back for my inheritance but he left me [ __ ] off so [Music] hmm [Music] just the kind of thing chan is looking for hey i always wondered those glasses from earth jakob carried around were they real what do you mean is they our specs when i was a kid he never stopped talking about how he used to be able to do countless things with them i figured it was all lies nah they were real ones pretty much as pointless on earth as they were here [Music] so so [Music] so she [Music] so so so [Music] [Music] should be enough let's see what janet can make of them i've got some tech that seems to be intact still what's your preference i can shoot this thing into the air all day long but we won't really know how good it works until you got something that fights back i'm looking forward to a demonstration of what that nice new gun can do professional pride and all being here complaining that i'm pulling on so stay here i'm going to try and secure a safe path through these canyons let me know if you can reach that massive obelisk we saw i've never seen anything like it august also seems drawn to it i'm sensing great agitation august wants to follow you hold august until i'm through thiago it's not safe dude [Applause] so so it looks like we weren't the first humans here i'm seeing a number of dead bodies the same people whose vehicles we saw out in the sand possibly i'm guessing this party was sent out by monroy from that fort doesn't look like these guys had much more luck any more clues to who they were what they were doing here would be quite fascinating keep your eyes open [ __ ] please so so daddy zahidi i found some writing seems to be anthropological notes from a doctor indiro casio a scientist among monroy's people what did she find she was documenting what happened from the day they met the natives pax they called them description matches august she says they were welcomed with open arms hacks yes that would certainly fit august incredible [Music] i found some pages written by monroy these people's leader he led the raiding party into this canyon believing it was the pharaoh's base that he could root them out maybe they were trying to help august's people thiago does august know anything about this monroy i've tried asking but august won't speak about this place to me [Music] so so path to the obelisk is clear august and i are just right behind you outrider shouldn't you be waiting in the camp for my signal sorry august slipped out i couldn't you all have to see this august what happened here coming get out of there now [ __ ] hide in there go so so food [Music] so so hmm august can you help me here you giant cockroaches i'm right here [Applause] where are you going [Music] yes [Music] get over quick [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know me oh my god [Applause] [Applause] [Music] august august what the hell happened to august august's people weren't wiped out by savages they became savages why would they do that [Laughter] hmm outrider we're burying august's body do you want to join us i uh i'm not there yet i'm just i'm gonna stay a bit longer take another look through the cancer mates found something you should know about more of monroy's writing seems to discover the same thing we did about the pax transforming does he say why why they would do that to themselves no only that he and his men stayed here for some time studying and experimenting on the obelisk trying to understand his powers while repelling non-stop attacks but when we learned that his fort had fallen he finally retreated back to his colony his colony that means there could be more of them out there we should look for them after we find the signal whenever you're ready to head out we'll be waiting for you at camp so school we're so close the signal's coming from just beyond this ridge stay on the lookout you see any movement run sit tight people i'm gonna clear the way it's time for some answers what do we have here zahidi i found some more writing from monroy's people i think we must be approaching their colony it seems monroe didn't believe the packs were so peaceful when their tech started getting fried he suspected the pax were trying to sabotage him then just as the storm was brewing up they caught the packs during one of their obelisk rituals did monroy think the packs were causing the storm i uh thought the same thing when i first saw august in those ruins in the forest monroy ordered his soldiers to stop them it was on that day that dr indira recorded the first pax deaths please collect all the writing you can find for me perhaps we can learn their story [Music] so so shoot [Music] after the first big storms burn out most of their tech sounds like monroy got furious he demanded explanations from the packs and access to their powers but they didn't understand they offered everything they could they led monroy through the jungle to their sacred city probably this city the place we've discovered [Music] food so [Music] [Music] so [Music] pax took him to the grand temple tried to show him how they commute with the anomaly but monroy thought it was a ploy to assassinate him he ordered the executions of the pax leaders and locked down the temple until he could learn how to control it himself they're countless cages here they're filled with skeletons so so so after they'd executed the pack's leaders monroy's people started moving into the city this was their colony they took over the homes of the packs forcing them to work for them to serve them in other words they made them slaves they believed the loss of their machinery was the pax's fault doesn't matter what they believe there's no excuse for enslaving another race there's got to be hundreds of dead packs here executed piled up this whole city is a mass grave people they did this i think it's getting real clear who the packs were scared of who they changed themselves into ferals to protect themselves from so foreign hmm [Music] this place it was a slave market seems like they got hit by the worst storm yet hundreds died humans and packs some of the obelisks were damaged too so whatever the pax once were doing to control the storm they couldn't do it anymore he feared an uprising losing control as pax started to abandon the city uh nikolai galyatkin monroy made him general and put him in charge of weapons production no doubt the same weapons the ferals used against them later but roy this palace is covered with flags all with it's got to be his face he made himself king of the packs a king a tyrant [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] monroy was sending out raids to hunt down the fleeing packs and that's when the uprising he'd predicted finally found him but it wasn't the packs at least not as he expected he never saw them coming but monroy didn't retreat that [ __ ] dug in out there in the desert and tried to track them down where they were coming from that's when he found the canyon and the great obelisk he finally understood there who the pharaohs were but that's when he got word that the city was under attack and so it was the beginning of the end [Music] found dr dear's last journal because she wrote it just before getting executed by monroy she tried to broker a truce with the pax she could stop the ferals if she surrendered monroy to them i've made it to the top palace is clear what do you see you better come up here and see for yourself this monroy was a madman hey there's a ship what's that the caravel that's not possible caravel never left earth its engines exploded tens of thousands died then what the hell are we looking at the source of the [ __ ] signal monroy signal there's no place beyond the storm that's coming from in there protected from the anomaly just like the uplink in your goddamn briefcase i don't [ __ ] understand neither do i it doesn't make any sense everyone saw the caraval explode during its construction even if the people left on earth were able to rebuild the ship they left after us we were the first nevertheless what's certain is that monroy enslaved august's people he butchered them and they turned they mutated into savages willingly so they could fight back i'm done with all this whatever's waiting for you on that ship i want no part of it thiago you can't leave us now i thought you weren't a deserter what they did to august's people what our people did to august don't you see thank you for letting me walk aways with you we're going to finish this we're finding a way in with the caraval this is it now that ship the signal the garden i'm ready to make some sense of all this we'll leave on your word outrider there has to be a way inside the ship all radio would have secured a path there's no place beyond the anomaly why are we still heading to the stupid ship if the signal is shielded from the anomaly inside it means we can use the uplink in there to contact the flores all the supplies the resources the tech we're gonna bring them down today not done going through hell yet when the pack started to flee the city monroy rounded up every last one of them that stayed behind that were loyal and trusting and threw them into these labor camps but i know of the packs they could not have survived long in there it was all monroy when he understood the packs were turning into ferals he sent out an order to murder them all before they could transform all of them all but enough to run his camp so hmm so monroy returned to the city to find it under siege they battled for days a complete bloodbath and then another storm hit when roy's people were decimated that's when they spotted the florist in orbit and called for help they started broadcasting the signal but it could help never came and monroy ordered a retreat to their ship and locked it down so all this time all we've been through the battlefields the jungles the alien ruins the desert all we've lost i can't believe we're finally here the goddamn signal i heard the day we landed and still none of it makes any sense oh i think i'm starting to put it all together the way the packs controlled the anomaly with their obelisks they are what kept the planet's energy in check they were the balance but when monroy stopped the pax from using the obelisks out of pure fear of what he couldn't understand the anomaly spread like wildfire across the planet the storm surging out of control mutating everything all this time think we were going to reach a place beyond the anomaly only to find the place it all started where monroy started it [Music] who the hell were they my father told me about the hordes thousands climbing over each other trying to reach the floor as it launched they're the ones who got left behind and half of them probably slaughtered the rest for a last seat on the caraval tanner should have been down there with the rest hopeless drowning in chaos nothing but dictators and madmen set loose if the caravel's engine hadn't exploded and killed most of the outriders we would have been the ones left on earth two more soldiers in run roy's damn army fighting for any way off the earth coming here to slaughter the packs and screwing up the whole damn planet before you all ever set foot on it i'm inside the ship it's still operational whatever's playing the signal it's in here let's finish this together let's finish this the end of the road one way or another despite everything we've brought the uplink all this way i wish jane could see us 37.5673 degrees north 22.80116 degrees east this is look it's exactly as i saw it as we saw it china that's not real that's this planet all right but it's long gone no no it's get the [ __ ] off away i'm in the mood for this today you okay you're here i imagine this so many times never you who are you who am i monroy how how did you how did this ship get here before us how do you think you people left us to die as the earth crumbled but i don't die so easy do i now we built a new engine an engine that that chained all others before so while you were still crawling through deep space we were already here oh you should have seen it their primitive civilization the natives they treated us like guns yeah i've seen what you did to the natives oh i see now this isn't a rescue why didn't you come when we said has a distress call 30 years since the flores arrived in our skies 30 years surviving in this hell this hell was because of you my entire life trapped in that valley slaughtering each other for nothing you robbed our people of hope before we even got here don't flatter yourselves you were as capable of every wickedness the plaques weren't as docile as they looked they had powers so much power things i had to understand so you just rounded them up you tortured them you son of a [ __ ] are you ready to rave how long before those creatures tired of us before they turned against us they would have had us on our bloody knees all that i wanted was their powers for us for all of us so that we could survive so we can be strong don't you see we lost the earth because we were meant for something more there but for the grace of i got you my child do you think that you would be standing there the powers of a god if it hadn't been for me all that i've done for humanity i saved us you cursed us but i won it's done [ __ ] him no more wasting time i have to tap the uplink into the caravel's power so we can reach the flores before we [ __ ] he found us we gotta go no no leave me i have to do this do what you got to do doc that door won't hold long outrider if that beast cracks this ship's hull we lose electronics we lose the pods we lose everything i'll take care of it you just get those pods down [Music] hmm [Music] um [Music] um [Music] [Music] so stop [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] tahiti talk to me [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so so [Music] [Applause] ah sahini what's happening in there it's working i've contacted the flores transmitting the first launch codes now [Music] god dammit there almost there [Music] we have to leave [Music] the ponds are more important than me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] get in i'm not losing any more friends [Music] oh [ __ ] i guess it's over the signal the uplink it was all for nothing wait guys look over there [Music] the pods it works you did it my god [Music] i guess some of the commands went through after all wow like i always say it ain't over till it's over what the hell when roy's people no i don't think so who are you we're from the war zone are you the outriders we heard tales about an altered outriders opening the frontier finding a cure in the forest we've been following your trail since the war [Music] zone [Music] so what now we keep moving [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] [Music] to go in the first line for tomorrow the pods [Music] they did it the [ __ ] did it [Music] [Music] still don't understand how they went back in time to get here sooner they didn't go back in time stupid their ship was just faster than ours was i don't think that's true [Music] you
