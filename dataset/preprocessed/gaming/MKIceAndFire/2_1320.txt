that's fine the graveyards ripe at the head of the river but I heard they put a new gate in recently to replace the old broken one now that those creatures have moved in I'm sure it's locked down tight a key to the graveyard huh I know why don't we ask Coates about it [Music] so [Music] what you're not looking for the key to the graveyard gate are you well it's your lucky day our local heroes swiped it from some public security jerks she gave it to Marnie so I'm guessing he's selling it for metals now if you want the graveyard key talk to Marnie hey you don't happen to have a key to a graveyard do you of course the Emporium has everything to them [Music] you guys agree thanks to you I've got ton of middle school which means I can bring happiness to a ton of people but for you hey

Wak [Music] you're that Merc aren't you [Music] Ziya [Music] [Music] you wouldn't happen to be a certain merc that's become the talk of the town yep i'm damon a little more than a humble reporter with the daily buzz ah that rag the one that's always printing awful rumors about the slums on the contrary my dear we strive to raise awareness of the plight of our under city brethren we seek a better future for everyone rich and poor now that my friends I find myself in need of your exceptional services for a trifling matter are you familiar with the mysterious and notorious bandit known as the angel of the slums she delivers written declarations to her victims usually Shinra associates before divesting them of their valuables everyone knows her everything she steals she gives to the poor and needy yes she's got a knack for public relations very popular down here as a result nevertheless she is a criminal and a threat to the public order I've made it my mission to unmask the villain but the locals have been uncooperative and uncommunicative to put it mildly now that my identity as a reporter has been exposed my sources have all deserted me which brings me to you work of the hour and the man who will serve up my scoop [Music] it's a pleasure to speak with what is it the guardian angel of the slums such a mysterious figure always talked about but never seen by anyone the angel gets in and out without being noticed and always leaves a calling cards maybe a magician no no it's no magic trick it's genuine magic rumor has it that the angel is a witch if we're going by rumors then I've heard that it's actually a monster in disguise well I could talk all day about the dozens of stories I've heard [Music] what's that the guardian angel of the slums come to think of it a reporter came sniffing around asking about her you his man huh even if I knew something I wouldn't tell you to folks around here the angel is a hero I ain't selling her out to Shinra but I know the guardian angel of the slums well I don't know much but I do know she doesn't steal from the poor and she doesn't kill anyone either far as I'm concerned that's all I need to know if that's enough for ya the one you oughta talk to his Marais ask anyone they'll tell you she knows everything about everyone around here [Music] good to see you again sir a good to see you too Larry I'd heard you found yourself a funny little friend cloud meeting array she knows everything there is to know about the slums marae meet cloud he's a former soldier and super strong he looks useful enough the kids have been talking about you the defender of the secret hideout and now the hero of the leaf house is helping the daily buzz look for the angel of the slums I'm a lover of the whispered word not that it's any real secret considering how chatty the Shinra mutts been not looking into it for the reporter I'm doing it for myself I like curiosity or could it be fallen under the angel spell like so many others anyway it so happens that I have some information for you but I'll need a moment before I can give it to you why don't you wait with that reporter of yours [Music] deuce have you tried talking to an array it I won't let us you told us that she had some information to share Mira hey as in theme array the town gossip I chased her for days begging for info but she wouldn't give up a single scrap so how do you if you're her to talk this old bird had a change of heart that's all then quickly before you have another tell us what do you know about the notorious Angel of the slums has she struck again is that it I don't know anything about that but I do know where her hideout is her base of operations oh that's a scoop where is it tell me deep in the scrub at lookout point hardly anyone goes out there these days it's the perfect place for a criminal doll up look output got it I'll check it out right now but before you go I should warn you about this rumor I heard about a terrible theme that's claimed the angels hideout as its lair Oh quite large lots of teeth always hungry I don't know about you but I not go anywhere near that thing well well a good reporter knows never to take foolish risks and a plan first then act that's every respectable journalist model if it's a plan you're looking for I'd say you have one right here what dear so my good mercenary if I might impose upon you again it would be lovely if you investigated lookout point for me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I've got this don't you mean we popping that wasn't so bad [Music] now that's just leave it together so it's my turn [Music] you mean taking over [ __ ] off [Music] okay that'll do [Music] I'll take care of you go on you've got that martyred no way calling lightning I should probably hear lots best gotta go for it now you get ready [Music] go on yeah come on Malkin you've got this martyr yeah take the lead I'll take care of them for you [Music] let's do this just taking all your slave truly Oh tagging out do this [Music] the guardian angel of the slums will collect your offering on behalf of the poor this must be one of her calling cards I don't see anything else interesting let's head back and tell them what we found [Music] [Music] believe it you found one of her calling cards this is the genuine article I'm sure of it and Miley angel herself huh so this is one of her famous warnings it's an incredible fight oh what's that oh hold on looks like there's something else a message to the nosy Shinra reporter is sniffing around I was planning to teach you a lesson you would never forget however by the grace of your mercenary friend you were spared that lesson but next time he might not be around to save you you would be wise to watch your step not just a message from the angel warning if the murk here hadn't bailed you out that fiend in the scrap would have ripped you to shreds sorry about that friend here I was just trying to help you out but instead my kindness almost got you violently killed no no no harm no foul right in any case I hope this narrowly averted tragedy won't discourage you from sharing information with me in the future hey everybody the angel left another calling card she's gonna rip up dog corn I know it's about time Don Cornejo is no easy mark I can't wait to see how this goes down excuse me I'm a reporter for The Daily bazan so much for my reward here why don't you take this oh and no need to thank me let's just say it slipped out of that reporters bucket can't call it theft if you're just claiming what you're owed am i right well done mr. Burke you certainly lived up to your reputation [Music] we probably ought to call it a day getting late huh you've been working so hard you lost track of time a to the pace sucked because they didn't know if you were worth it yet but now they do come on let's go home [Music] [Music] allô Aerith what do you want haven't seen him before he your new boy toy he's my bodyguard if you must know wait a minute those eyes is he the one who beat up Reno and what if I am need to cross my T's dot my eyes that's all [Music] cloud we can be rude is not a bad person really no I'm not bad but like it or not I sometimes have to do bad things [Music] don't take it personal you Turks are all the same all bark no bite your want to talk you know what keep eyes [Music] yeah [Music] good morning guys if you're going gotta get a little yes you've got this come on [Music] deal with that so it's my turn it's your turn now justice okay so you had enough yet [Music] I don't believe that I have get ready okay it's my job and think about changing careers [Music] serious time how's that better than expected I'll go [Music] come on [Music] your highway you can do it [Music] are you okay keep eyes let's do this what you're holding back I'm waiting [Music] tagging out don't overdo it [Music] please just leave us alone you know I can't do that [Music] hey there partner sir Thank You Terry you're having the time of your life but we're needed on standby for a job something about sector seven so get your ass back here now understood got somewhere else to be go home and stay there you know I can't do that [Music] you
