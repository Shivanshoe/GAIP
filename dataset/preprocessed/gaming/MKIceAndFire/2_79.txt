[Music] this is the old workshop found anything worthy of your talents this will have to do soon you can put them to good use by email is that a salakar i never knew they actually existed i know all the circus of your people yet i've never heard i never said my people you mean the light elves there aren't many who remember the children of light or their stories i do when sutra invaded their lands they begged me for eight the war with the vani had only just ended and i was weary long after i learned how sutra devoured the elves immortal light by hugo maybe it's the same light that now allows him to renew himself after death during the conquest he must have uncovered knowledge of the salah cars but to what end what cougars does it hold those of two warlords one who spell the other yotan nothing more nothing more at least not of value he speaks the truth you deal with a fire nymph a fire nymph i am the finest fire nymph in all of spartalheim allow me to introduce acer treasonous daughter of sutra and my friend you grow dewy eyed in your dotage what have you unearthed only rumors my father is rebuilding something large and powerful though its exact nature i cannot fathom and the salah car is intended to be part of this there's something most likely either way its value to my father is so great he may indeed trade your son for its return return to your stepmother arrange a trade and one more thing don't feel better knowing you're protected sin mara travels far and wide but i will rejoin her as you wish whatever the salakar is i must steal it back once balder is safe why ragnarok comes i've made plans but they are not ideal perhaps the salakar offers another way one that will allow me to truly save those i care about even you hmm to unlock its secrets i will need help there are rumors of a shelter nearby its dwellers may be able to assist me try looking near the largest careers south of here tell them i sent you no dwarf would give up the chance to work with ivaldi langrin was once home to your rivals sindri and broker your name may not carry much weight here don't make me laugh no one cares about those two i'll follow you once i finish taking what i need this is the old workshop that evil he spoke of i should check if he's already here perhaps i should take another peek at the salah ah damn it better not i will need help if i am to study the salah go yeah more gemstones for your collection see how can there be an invasion with so many gems lying around i'll see what i can find for you are still alive we wouldn't be stuck down here ah this the shelter must be nearby woven markings if i follow them so this is where they are this must be the shelter even they spoke of i should head inside be gone from here please [Music] want to obtain some of my uh attractive where's everything is half the price of yesterday half the price that seems generous well i doubled the prices yesterday to make a profit but nobody bought anything so half the price today you haven't been doing this very long have you it's my second day isn't there someone more experienced to show you the ropes nope i saw a gap in the market and i went for it why aren't they doing a good job no no it's it's not that you think i'm awful you do don't you i [Music] is this a ploy to persuade me to buy something is it working go on goodbye for now i do not take kindly to being interrupted charming no we are their dearest allies [Music] greetings dwarf i am harvey of the asia you're not one to waste words friend i wish there were more like you that's killing me the toil never ends did anyone follow you what do you want [Music] here to help you you are always welcome how can so many starving dwarves produce so much [ __ ] hello there i bring word from ivaldi what do i care go talk to the ganker gengar yeah the chief names oakland you know how it works fix a problem get a reward only everyone was as motivated as you just spoke to that fellow look around you essie all the treasure a heart could want but on a scrap of food for the belly what good is a thing if it makes no one happy all that counts are people in the end huh you've recruited another soldier what was this place before it became your sanctuary a treasury when the invasion began they sent warriors to guard it our leaders would rather protect their wealth than our lives and we followed seeking protection and so we are here all the wealth we could wish for yet hungry and miserable still i would like to reorganize the crew keep well strange i just spoke to that fellow a word my friend evil d requests your aid ain't my concern go talk to ogler he's the master of this workshop master now boys chief when the masters aren't here [Music] what do you want evil descends me he requires the help of a skilled artisan a meeting of mines huh well it ain't up to me you'd best talk to brockgirl cindy they still breathe where are they no idea sindri went off adventuring he does that mind you it's been a while since he left how much of a while couple of weeks and his absence doesn't worry you not my business where he goes and brooke went to look for cindy bit of a worry guts that one ever since he mucked up the forging of mjolnir anyway look leave your name and i'll pass it to brocker when he shows up tell him harvey of asgard was here harvey of by emir really it is you i'll return tonight in the meantime fetch evilly he's at the old workshop ruins the high one will save us from the giants but who will save us from the high one how can so many starving dwarves produce some oh [ __ ] [Music] who you followed [Music] why are you here [Music] three times it stung me three on the hand then the neck oh lit on the eyeball a true master would ignore such trifles tribals that gadfly was the size of a squirrel a big one an ogre could hear me limb from limb and still my severed hands would finish the job that is focus that is passion that is horseshit must master broker i'm glad you have made it home and your brother did you find him yeah you never did say where he was i believe cinderelly went adventuring adventuring no no that's not it he went to find the special mead i had a hankering you said special meat yeah the special me so tunga's special meat what's that frosty oscar do with it we ain't in yachting home in case you hadn't noticed well there's this mead they made down at the brewery so sweet it can er it can well it's bloody sweet all right anyway century had an itch for him just a horn or two he said so off he goes that was half a moon ago i told him not to do it too many giants out there but he wouldn't listen uh him and his cravings where can i find this brewery i thought southeast of here other side of the marsh can't miss it you're going to rescue him i will find him yes and afterwards you and he will repay me by helping evil deal with the job and he'd done now hold on we didn't uh good good we have a deal that gadfly it was loki thor himself could not have withstood this thing so many starving dwarves do so much remind me why do i find myself athlete has abandoned victory no we and in all that time consider what i have learned and what you haven't but who will save us from what [Music] lose something uh uh go [Music] hey wow [Music] this place is heavily guarded the sweet scent found by the stench of misspells yuck not too the smell of meat grows strong this must be where everything is stored that guided him here uh guide me i don't believe you locked doors [Music] oh me [Music] have a look soon where are they holding him i wonder wow right i'm out of me bring me another barrel thank you much [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh something heavy was suspended from it i've carried enough dwarves recently to know they are not as light as they look is this cindy's special need given the puddles on the floor he must have taken a bath in it this hammer has the mark of century and here a bag of roasted acorns [Music] this guy is many days old one train leaves send the other out what do we have here the moose spells have a prison some days ago syndry was captured while sneaking outside he was dragged in here for interrogation his belongings were ceased even his roasted acorns one of the many dwarven delicacies i will never fathom he tried to loosen his tongue using the same sweet mead he himself sawed almost drowned him in it but the shelter has not been raided so cinderelly must have remained strong and refused to give them its location instead he was dragged away bloodied drunk as a fish but alive most likely to face further tortures at a makeshift prison named yarns whose that is where i should go next so uh hmm [Applause] this place reeks of misery more than i would even wish upon loki no matter his crimes it's likely century was brought here many days ago i'm not too late [Music] yes [Music] give up speaking the giants have no mercy when i face them hello i know this mark whoever he was he had his hoover cruelly stolen i can sense that the salah was satisfied on this occasion was i must return the body to broken [Music] [Music] be on your way please no even ones such as cinders are of lesser value still it can't be coincidence that calder stated the salah car with the hookers of so many races muswell jotun dwarf who knows what else hail to you friend if it's bird or beast you seek you come to the right place everything you see is for sale except for nara of course and who is nara your prize steed that knackered old nag she's nobody's prize but i owe her and that's why she'll always hold a place in my heart you're in debt to a horse i am but she saved my life the adult old thing broke out of a pen and wandered far from the village and i set out to find her took me a day and a night to bring her home when i did i found my village in flame and ruin no one got out alive none but you i and i have nara to thank for that together we made for the nearest shelter and well here we are please let this not be our missing master who is this you bring no it can't be master broker i share in your grief truly i do your brother was the worthiest of dwarves more so than you will ever know how sickly though no my dear century the funeral arrangements are being made outside i must use this chance to bend broker to my will i must the wolves have come up with a crafty way you lied to me you said you would save him i said i would find him that ain't my brother not anymore what happened tell me everything as i neared the village i i heard a great roar like that of a wounded bear soon after i witnessed the final act of a mighty battle cindy beset by giants on all sides it was he who made the godlike roars he he always did have a deep voice he wielded his hammer and chiseled with uncommon skill yes yes i've seen him do it many times in the workshop giants lay strewn about slain by cinder's hand but then one of cowardly aspects struck your brother treacherously in the back yet even a simply succumbed to the blow he locked his chisel and struck the coward dead right between the eyes so it will be written i'll cut down that oak tree now cinder is gone can't stand the sight of it without him here last time i saw the master he was sitting under his oak tree roasting his acorns oiling his favorite how can i tell blocker were missing the tools where could they be there's something wrong basil everything is wrong we're burying the greatest smith who ever lived and we don't have his tools to put with him i came across some of dalethorpe if you want i confess those are just the spares he never took his best ones from the shelter i see how is it that such valuable instruments have been misplaced misplaced don't be daft hidden more like by cindery to make sure no one else ever touched them particularly brooker except now we can't find them you have no idea where they might be well they're inside the shelter i can tell you that well they can't be too far i'd be surprised if they're somewhere up high i thought dwarves were afraid of heights not our cinder he was quite the climber now me well i prefer to keep my feet on the ground right where they should be not now i need time to grieve i'm very fond of the dwarves yet they're constant needs it's exhausting oh loki friend betrayer what i'd give for a moment of your guilty conversation even the lies [Music] if i was cinderelly where would i hide my beloved tools somewhere high up perhaps [Music] [Music] hmm if i had wings i could reach finally the tools of cinderella's trade i must reunite these tools with cinderelly's remains before the ceremony begins hear vessel can't find the master's tools it's too horrible to even think about the disaster has been averted oh now i see why some call you god you're making me blush still i have my moments heroes die but not their legacy such was cindy's courage but tonight he feasts in valhalla the first of his kind to ever do so [Music] perhaps he can be of use i'm here for the mead not the company you dwarves and your love of meat it's cost me enough trouble already it wasn't a dwarf who ransacked half of jottenheim in search of some mysterious mid i wouldn't know anything about that you know old friend now would be a good time for some grand gesture like what a respectful speech from you cindery's greatest rival would surely ah [ __ ] off we must all make compromises i can even give you the honeyed words time soothes the well of suffering brings hope that sees beyond chill death we cast the whirlpool of sorrow into the placid waters of the philosophic mind are those words for cindy or balder balder lives why would he need such words of course of course i didn't mean to well you know fine i'll do the speech but it will be one of my making not yours we dwarves don't care much for poetry still we can't set about making speeches until the torches are all lit up who knows how long it will take before the dwarves get around for lighting the torches it'll be faster if i do it the dwarves have saved the place for me this is [Music] my brother a true master he was uh i did not like sindri and he did not like me still he was good with the hammer and the chisel and the sword and he knew how to work the bellows some said better than anyone even me [Music] your brother was a very fine smithy i i admired him greatly master broker you've given cindy an excellent send off it's the least he deserves but is it really true he feasts in valhalla it is i saw it in a vision come let's take a stroll now tell me are you prepared to continue cindy's good work helping evaldi was not my brother's work but the fine sutra was it's what got him killed greed for me is what got him killed it took courage to go after that meat a direct challenge to sutras authority this is crooked thinking seems straight enough to me you know i don't reckon i owe you a bloody thing i risked my life to retrieve your brother's body now i'll prepare to risk it again for you and all of swat self-hate bollocks you ain't doing anything out of the goodness of your art i know what you're after i know all about your lad boulder i have ears you know even in my grief so don't pretend you're here for us because i know you have me abandon my own son and strive only for your salvation okay when you say it like that i i need time i'm still grieving you know let me think on it all right a little old think foreign [Music] i should check and broker see if he has come to his senses if he hasn't i must encourage him further how can so many starving dwarves produce so much [ __ ] you're back yes goodbye for now these are the finest tools you'll ever lie eyes on the finest i've forged better in my sleep yeah is that why you were snooping about in the ruins of the old workshop only because the moose spells stole everything i had dimwit good to see you getting along so broker do you accept your duty don't have much choice do i last thing i need is a godly smiting up me ass let this be the start of a beautiful new friendship to study the salah card i'll need the very best of tools too bad this workshop is lacking bagger off i got more stuff here than you can wag a finger at doubt it if you find something you don't know how to use just ask i'll be giving you lessons on how to use your own dwarves how unusual acer you return what you deal with a fire nymph not this again what news do you bring my stepmother is stubborn i cannot push too hard or she will grow suspicious she has no interest in the trait interest yes but not yet the will i don't understand the salakar is all but indestructible you on the other hand are not she assumes she'll catch me kill me and retrieve the salah time is on her side then i must strip her off this illusion if i were to make a nuisance of myself one that cannot be ignored mara prepares to lead my father's next major invasion but if i were to disrupt her plans it may force her to the bargaining table sounds risky to me i once plotted and carried out the murder of emir himself what do i care of risk well since you put it like that where must i strike at af albert milner my stepmother develops a strange army at yofosmida she breeds beasts of war and finally there's drekathorp her supplies hub i'll deal with all three in the meantime i shall return to etri i will send word once my stepmother has become more amenable i'll return when i'm done and i will expect answers regarding the seller car we best get on with it then yes you just follow my lead who put you in charge you were once your brother's apprentice now you are mine apprentice are you having a laugh this is my shelter and my rules [Music] never ends he worried when his sons turned against him dwarves believe it to be cursed i don't think they'll mind if i relieve them of this male addiction so [Music] um is so this some is you're mine [Music] split your skull uh help you out here thank you here hey come here a moment [Music] oh um ah give me a hand over here okay [Music] over here come help me with this so time you died uh [Music] this is just a small vengeance for what you did to freak [Music] uh [Music] ambition [Music] [Applause] well she even stars foreign have to repair that sometimes warriors will have grumbling bellies and only sticks with a [ __ ] to fight so me uh catch back to the ship [ __ ] [ __ ] guards here are vigilant unleash the beasts [Music] reavers to your posts oh come on uh we can oh so i must release them too leave no breathing space the pigs run wild have a look soon easy without these plans no further beasts can be bred no more piggies for use in mana he and i shall feast on the roasted flesh of these mighty pigs now sin mara will negotiate baltha for the salakar and then together he and i will steal it back hopefully the dwarves have gained an understanding of the salikar's true use my future may depend on it is inevitable to avoid it impossible but if there's one thing i know impossible is impossible is oh you're back cinemas plans line ruins i just hope you know what you're doing surely i should be asking that of you now tell me what does it do i got a clue these light elves and they're sneaky you've learned nothing whatever its use the power it contains it holds more than what you said such as well for a start there's a bloody dwarf in there anyone we know no and it's not important dwarf hoogers don't carry much weight not even mine so what does it contain all i know is that it's more than malviger calder and some dwarf no one cares about fine in the stories what was the actual point of the salah cars cougars were what vitalized them but it was the magic that gave them their purpose and that magic was different to each one magic you mean sata nah some elf [ __ ] no one knows anymore except sutra that fire nymph she sent word and your plan worked shin mao is ready to barter if it means getting you out of the way where at the bridge leading to feygarder light the beacon and she'll come out with your lad the power that the salah car holds it must not fall into surters grasp i'll reclaim it once boulder is safe oh my goodness who would have guessed those gold threats can it be the golden hair of sif wife of thor why loki cut it off only loki knows what thorn was less than pleased loki wisely chose to make amends a new head of hair for sif finer than the last and so he set off for smart tell fame at loki's request evil these sons made for him dresses of the purest gold which would fix the sith's scalp and grow his real hair would loki had what he needed but now that he'd seen what the master smiths of swaziland could do he wanted more so oh ugh two [Music] uh [Music] ugh so i don't care what anyone said is everything all right i wish i knew high one you recognize me of course but i have no quarrel with you even if i did i have more pressing matters i i must get into the dwarf shelter you have a death wish no but if that's what it takes to be reunited with my love it is a risk i must bear they hold a yoton captain no the one i love is a dwarf and as strange as it might sound i think he loves me with everything happening in this crazed world i know how important it is to hold on to things that are precious do you think you could help me all i want is to speak to him to know i'm not alone in feeling what i feel very well but i cannot take you inside looking like this can you shape-shift how's this had to be a wolf didn't it come again just stay by my side and don't eat anybody i'm not an animal you know so what's your plan i don't know and stop talking or you'll give us both away you know the way to the dwarf you seek i have a scent then lead the way but

friend i will not be able to stay any longer please pass on my regards to your wife and son you're leaving oh but i'm sure there'll only be a moment i must get back to my own son i'm sorry i understand of course i hope you find that which you need fined oh yes uh i was looking for something uh i'm sure it will turn up good luck to you i must announce my arrival [Music] you bring that with your stutters give me what is mine and i will hand over what is his come midway i got you uh [Music] no birthday stay with me uh i must get inside oh the fire is my strength died welder must be closed for the illusion to have worked aid me be my eyes uh come my kid let's hear this well there's behind one of these doors locked cells i must find the proper keys hang on not getting away from me [Music] [Music] one of the many prison keys so i think there's something hidden in the back prisoners weren't just lying around so so a hidden room behind this wall seems nothing can contain these tricky inventors i guess i shouldn't piece of paper i find lying around so much depth this blood trail whoever was tracked here was badly wounded yet he was strong it took at least four jailers to hold them no the high one brought low mistletoe symbol of hope renewal but not for boulder we forced so many drafts down his gullet his torment was quite beautiful blind fool you never saw what was in front of you here is your child his light gone before you even set foot here and the rest of him it now skulks in helheim [Music] allow me to reunite you with your boy no traitor you were never worth my efforts i've seen dwarves with better stature take care of it like your time oh is finally the hero of asgard but you are an imposter heart as black as tar savage monstrous you've locked that truth away built a code to act as its jailer but the darkness cannot be kept hidden it oozes out like puss from a wound poisoning everything it touches that is what it means to be odin the deceiver like an old hen by my command if going to fight watch my lead ugh [Music] [Music] ah here comes the thing that's right wow you never failed [Music] oh [Applause] come on scratch like an old hens [Music] uh uh [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] ah [Music] uh so ah what is it what did you see all my struggles mattered nothing in the end my son was lost before i began his premonition come to pass your son walder harvey son you know what i mean so bulger met his fate as was foretold ever you have sought to elude the looms of the norner but we are all caught in their weave no i will not believe it there's more to see yet why was i thrown for my dream perhaps it was not the vision that rejected you but you who rejected the vision perhaps you are afraid of it i fear nothing i think you do and until you recognize that fear give into it embrace it the vision will not return some walls cannot be overcome by potions alone tell me what i must do this soccer does not end here it cannot meet me in the forest when darkness lays upon the land there we shall see how fearless you truly are these new visions of vote and trouble me am i alone in seeing them or do the tales of swat self-fame hold some other meaning perhaps i should warm my bones by the fire gather my thoughts for a moment uh avor whatever is the matter have you been spending too much time drinking vulgar special sauces again i am troubled by visions of odin and of smart selfie they plot my mind without warning without invitation aha which is how thor flooded spartafain thor fast to act but not so fast to think would stomp and thump and fight and bump everywhere he and mjolnir should go one day he fought a giant in jotunheim with such ferocity that thor's killing blow was felt through all nine realms the ground shook mountains rose up hills tore apart creating canyons and north of smalladal the massive lake that housed the springs of indra seals split open flooding all of that fame the dwarf king craze acted swiftly he built three mighty dams preventing further damage to his realm working alongside his beloved subjects so surprised was one builder to see the great king working as an equal that he slept tumbling into the raging waters below without hesitation rather left once from his horse and again from the center of the dam's lip diving into the frightful torrent before the builder could even cry for help rademar was pulling him onto dry land and so two giant statues were built to honor the king one for each leap of unthinking bravery and stood until the end of the days until ragnarok aye so you see actions ripple outwards like a stone falling into a lake or like thor crushing a yoton skull with mjolnir affecting everything whether foretold or unknown i fear my tale has only worsened your concerns no a good story is a lock that feeds a mind's flame thank you friend it's over how have you been the fire made me think of the myths and legends then loved would you indulge me with the tail i would be glad to hear swatself i would not tell it half as well but his favorite was a fable to remind us to find meaning in our deeds and not in how others think of us svattel fame was not short of letting very dwarven blacksmiths everyone has heard of evil deal but this tale is of a stone mason he lived as far south as he could where gunamar meets van gaal his workshop sat upon the shoreline obsessed with glory his love of masonry had all but died he scoured the shore seeking precious stones washed up from other elves then he saw it something beautiful glittering shimmering across the water upon an island he had never dared to travel to he hastily built a boat working long into the night he set sail and found many rocks that sparkled and dazzled upon the island he cried out in joy to craft anything from such stones he would be remembered for all time then he felt a sudden sting on his foot then another and another his eyes adjusted to the dark so consumed was he by his desire for renown he failed to realize he had walked into a nest of snakes until it was already too late and so clutching the stone that sealed his feet there he died remembered yes but only for his folly a fine tail toby and well told this man would be proud [Music] in every great story there's truth to be found i wonder what could be found in svatel fame the place they spoke of yo this is the spot now i need only wait for volker to arrive i will tie your hands now what purpose will that serve you are too much the warrior ever you will not recognize your fear until you are helpless before it drink and you say this will bring the vision back is that all you mean to leave me here bunker this is why must not be tired ulka [Applause] uh [Music] untie me the wolf is coming and i i cannot reach my weapons vodka okay so many where did they come from i have to break these bones [Music] the more i struggle the tighter the bones become there must be a trick to this what did walker say give into it be still [Music] it's working the barn's loosening [Music] free what illusion is this accursed phantoms come then you will not let me laughing defeat no more will you stalk me uh the wolf is gone for now i'm ready valka it is time to servants of fame even after all these eternities away i still hate the place yet it offers me the hope of revenge sweetest of morsels the realm is changed but this is not sutras doing is something more i must find broker and evaldi they'd better still have my salaca nice and safe what as the shelter fallen these spells are a plague [Music] yes [Music] over here mike they came out of nowhere where is the salah have you lost it broker left the shelter yesterday before the raid even happened took the salad car with him where has he taken it since you went away he has become erratic it's all that matters to him now you should learn from his example now where is he where the other night he spoke of exploring the creator of atri to seek out more answers he takes the salaka to sutras front door wait where have you been these past few days days no matter it is where i go that matters and where is that atri wherever i can find vengeance calm yourself javi collect your wits an eye for an eye will leave us all blind what do i care about so many dead my friends my brothers all gone it was so sudden we had no time to defend ourselves ah [Music] so let's i must find broker matrices crater the brave fool means well but risks cheating me of my vengeance what is it with these two brothers who died sneaking after mead the other now risked death by taking his job to farm ah hmm i see you dwarf broken where is my salad car take it easy it's right here nice and safe i wanted to investigate something but then i tripped and can you walk no oh then i shall carry you oh gentle i hate to bleed sack of spuds you know what have you learned off the salad car my just know how to use it of course you're going after you'll most likely end up feasting in valhalla valhalla it is for the feeble and the blundering no i shall not die worlds may end but i harvey shall abide what about shindri you calling him fable what would he be doing and ah yes yes he is there in valhalla of course for one such as he is a great honor nothing this looks like a good place to put you down so tell me the salacos purpose having a clue can it kill sutra well that ain't its purpose but yeah i think it can how it harnesses the light a lot of light that was balder's gift to turn day to night and back is that why certainly stole his hooker yeah the others they're just for balance but see there is one more in there like boulders incomplete who's this this hooga an itsy bitsy snippet mind you i i don't understand i think i think if the salah card touches surtur the two will come together the souther car is already complete nothing gets in or out our torn hooga will always try to reunite itself his might just be strong enough to do it if that happens he will become the salah then nothing can stop him only if he can control all that light but i don't think he can his old carcass ain't made for it it'll be like trying to hold the ocean in a single hog's
