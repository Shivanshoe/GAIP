to ask if you gotta smoke for her every new day here means a hundred new arrivals but only half these gods will survive a year and that's if it's a good one and why do these peeps come to and see well to be street samurai like morgan blackhand and waylon boa boa the greater the risk the bigger the boutique kids or so they say but you can only be a major league player for so long the faster you live the faster you burn out if you don't get a bullet to the brain first [Music] nc's legends know where you'll find most of them the graveyard matters not where you're from matters not where you start what matters here is the walk you walk in night city the city of dreams chick we're looking for somewhere in this building probably crawling with the pineapples that kidnapped her eyes and ears open

know little warm up yeah i didn't think you'd find that too tough what do you say we crank it up a notch [Music] not bad but it's more realistic if the targets quit standing around and take cover you took a hit use a re-animator to pack yourself up head to the training area when you're good to go oh look brought some tunes with him this time you know what framework v stand on the platform and we'll move on packing's the next item on the menu might notice i tweaked the course material a bit this training module will teach you how to apply technological tools work a little hack magic on the

second guest is greenlee host of the chip in program which promotes the use of cybernetic implants i love treating air beautiful can't complain ziggy thanks for having me now i'd like us to talk about the most exclusive and highly sought after implant on the market today arisaka corpse relic but maybe we ought to make sure our fair audience is up to speed karina what is relic exactly in a word if you could in one word i'd say immortality immortality really that's right relic allows you to transfer the consciousness from a dying person finding a new home for their soul on a transferable chip this person they'll never leave your side a companion forever with you in your own consciousness just child child think for a moment about what you're saying this relic is an abomination that feeds on human misery it is an unnatural likeness a golden calf borne by false prophets speaks of preserving the soul but they can promise nothing more than a heartless mindless algorithm speaking with the voice of the departed what's more this technology is just another tool of coercion and corruption only the wealthy and powerful elites will have access and they will pay any price in exchange for a chance of this so-called immortality well that is true that arasaka corp has specifically limited access to the relic and or job promises a lie an evil lie motivated by greed and now that is rich hey excuse me false promises great a lust for power why sounds an awful lot like a church what how dare you do you not promise a life after death do you not charge funeral fees to a family in mourning maybe the reverend is just afraid of some healthy competition huh competition you believe everything in this world can be counted measured rationalized and wouldn't we be right we can construct artificial brains create new consciousness but i ask you why what does that give us are we as a people on this earth any happier for it you claim that this relic gives eternal life but all i see is an eternity of suffering rather than say goodbye we haunt ourselves with their voices their presence what do you folks think who knows the truth is it ms lee or maybe reverend kohler that is up to you said culver or glee to 7892 to cast your vote and enter your name for a chance to win tickets to this year's play-off until next time night city toodles [Music] oh stupid gates busted again third time paid to get it fixed the last two got to be some kind of scam i'm gonna have a word with this super oh yeah so is [Music] so ugh i think i might have caught something when i jagged into that corpus bile mud you know neurovirus sir need to see vic let him tell me what's got my head reeling my stomach churning okay let me take you i brought you a ride throw on some threads make me downstairs hey v regina jones here if you're looking for work in watson give me a call how'd you find me how'd you even know my name i know where to gather my intel could even call me a collector later because ah

i've seen you landing blows in the ring you've got sharp instinct good edge you can go far especially if you get chipped these fights let's just say they aren't legal but very loot yeah look at it for who you were me both of us i get a small percentage of the total win you know as your agent you get the rest oh i get it you want to get rich off my blood sweat and tears okay you got to make a buck somehow right at least i'm giving it to you straight fights happen in different parts of the city you choose where you want to go put down your eddies and start swinging you win you take home the pot

black jesus of the afterlife 300 pounds of partly gold-plated coop decks bounced out of the ring a few years ago mastered the nasty crew in pacifica things got ugly gang wars two years back somehow dex got caught up in the craziness a lot of bodies lying in the streets by the time the shooting stopped yeah dicks got lucky though managed to slip under the radar till tempers cooled took a while but he's made one hell of a comeback eyes up to his elbows of blood jack you want to shake his hand and work with him he's the biz b everyone's got blood on their hands you deal with it you move on how'd you manage to pull this trading your spleen or something or as i know we're not the type to get fingered by decks you know me but debug she's the one that hooked us up got us talking knew it was a done deal the moment he laid eyes on me come on ain't nobody who can resist this am i right sure jack whatever you say so what's the gate we meant to come out in one piece our lord and savior wants to tell you everything himself face to face no pressure but uh this whole deal he's riding on you now where do i gotta go you and t-bug draw straws without me debugging decks go way back and my face is yesterday's news deck says he needs to check you talk to you look v it's his job his rules i can't blame him for taking a personal approach and it ain't as bad as you think okay trust me i guess i got no choice then dexy's a real deal when it comes to fixtures don't get me wrong don't got nothing against the padre or wakako but don't get me started on fixers they catch a client find the

peek through them cameras are all around us even within us your joys your worries your life for them it is all mere spectacle if anyone was watching and giving a damn i'd have half the cities on the world and have its corpse on my [ __ ] and if you are their pawn unknowingly carrying out their secret agendas get next to him for revealing government secrets open your mind before it is too late hey v dr vector will see you now i'll sit tight over here me and misty got a little catching up to do like this is max nova idea because i am [Music] vicky surprise every old ripper it's good to see it

whole kitten caboodle all right kit we'll sort you out in a flash besides that how are things met a new fixer he gave me a job name's dexter deshawn known quantity from the afterlife no denying you're moving up but something you're not telling me vic keep your guard up that's all i've heard some things about dex he's not as chill as he makes himself out to be need some new kit but tools not toys vic time i bumped up my sights and got a grip really now finally vic shit's getting real got a job from dex to sean hitting the major leagues any tactic can perform the dexter design well that is something but let me guess hasn't paigey yet quit crying vic i'll bring you the eddies later with interest you know i will hmm last time you're here chair please sit down and relax karoshi optics best i've got and should be about right under the circumstances now check in whoa vic nothing tops out on the market hmm sounds like it could come in handy then you gave me my word i'd pay you back but this might be too rich for my blood we'll work something out right now i'm just out to make sure you get back in one piece eddie's in hand you peruse and choose while i scan see what's going on inside mark one like i said decent enough scanner displays data on your cornea cherry on the tops of built-in external lens disruptor in layman's terms any surveillance cam will capture your faces of blur and just remember your body will still show up as crystal clear hmm this should do the trick talks to karoshi tech too i'm ready carve away excellent let's do this lay that major league arm of yours right here so what's new in the life of victor vector yeah if i'm being honest not much and that's fine with me i used to live in a world where all that mattered was who's who what's what and how's why and what happened one day i just dropped it and never looked back i'll never be a legend in this town but been sleeping nights ever since just like that thanks now a bit of anesthetic and i can start cutting feel anything play by play though really doc makes you sound like a dentist always going on and on don't be mean now remember i'm old i got a shaky ganic hand good slip lights out for a minute all right okay let's test this see the magic in action linking you in you might feel a little discomfort at first word vision low contrast glitches well how's it look feel all right to you seen more dramatic improvements before patience kid give it a minute time for the scanner it might take you a few seconds to adjust but first time's rarely the charm with anything really scanner should eventually sync with your thought processes and read your intentions i also inject an ncpd file search for antenna dude wells you know exactly what they never did well it ought to work like a charm now draw your weapon you should see your ammo count on a brand new site how about the neuro virus from the last job can you check it done and gone while we were putting in your implant and a full sweep on your soft and circuits zap the critter you're certified bug free [ __ ] victor not bad i don't know what to say say you'll take this and remember the dosage two whiffs now and another two in an hour what am i looking at a mild stem should boost neurotransmission in the short term and muffle some of the side effects while the implant takes thanks again dick you're the best i owe you go on kid show them what you're made of and once you hit the big leagues don't forget where you came from who's winning hernandez you know in the old days that crippled malone would have been flat on the boards no every last fighter's got extra skull line absorb 75 percent of every blow got cash riding on this yeah just looking it's out of habit more than anything else miss it don't you uh how's biz going ah can't complain corporals learned to keep their distance and soccer's back hiring alone mercs they all got to have the newest shiniest implants good thing you got misty here to help handles your griping well yeah retin outer shots the best decision i ever made you know what seems like you're the only person in night city who's happy with this lot you get to a certain age you drop all your illusions life just gets easier from there your heart chakra looks a little out of whack babe i can release it for you but you'd have to watch out for negative energy fields and avoid mean reds v yo listen up i talked to dex while you were in with the dock he's waiting in his ride for you ain't gonna hop to where he's parked next to gramsci burgers okay do my best to talk us up v listen i've got this delicate matter that's why i called you the number of cyber psycho attacks in the city is on the rise now that's probably not news but this issue matters to me for a few reasons there are people who say cyberpsychosis can be treated right and i know exactly how that sounds but i believe even an unproven therapy is still better than a bullet to the brain if i get a tip about a possible attack i'll give you a call maybe you can investigate before maxtac hits the scene but remember you're not there to execute anybody try to incapacitate the attacker and i'll send someone to pick them up i hope that's all clear gonna be long [Music] you've been with misty a while huh yeah about a year why just asking i never thought you'd last that long in a stable healthy relationship hey come on manor you know i was raised right how's your mom [Music] worried about me been for a while something happened started climbing our way up got more and more knives out there waiting to stab us in the back higher stakes higher risk man so you can see that hey how well you know bug exactly la mamita got a soft spot for me no but seriously she ate the type you go out and grab a beer with don't actually think she got any soft spots for anywhere right [Music] later then is actually pandemonium yes and this is a secured area [Applause] yo mr v a pleasure dexter deshawn in the flesh ample indeed mind if i ask you something right off the bank would you rather live in pieces mr nobody die right old and smelling slightly of urine or go down for all times in a blaze of glory smelling near like posies without seeing your 30th you're either somebody where you fizzle out into nothing night city don't let you choose oh but it does see in my line of work i choose to chill but folk who try to take advantage they see the beast inside all right listen close scanning a serious job now playing gargantuan compared to smashing up a scav home hang on i got a question my own now why all this dex why me coulda had jackie or t-buck sitting here could have just done this on comms call me old-fashioned but i like to look anyone i do biz with in the eye had the pleasure of meeting the jackster in the past and sweet tea bug helped this brother out two years ago so here we are besides all that got a special little pre-mission just for you but we'll get to that let me hear it what's the job there's this prototype tag a biochip to be precise jobs to grab it simple yeah i'm guessing it belongs to a court mm-hmm arisaka surely that's no problem no no problem just a death sentence nc's arasaka's turf nobody [ __ ] with them here what can i say mr b high risk high reward first rule of the afterlife besides that i'm no lead head ain't gonna leave no trace for them to follow because we're gonna do this clean and on the hush hush we understand each other you work this out got a plan two things first a conundrum with the maelstrom boys needs active resolving that second to rendezvous simple klein who brought us the jobs anxious she wants to parlay with one of the team what's the issue needs resolving with maelstrom got a beef slide in the shark i got a classic tail for you psycho gang doing his thing two weeks back jumped a military convoy got away with the gear corp don't even know maelstrom's involved now see convoy was carrying the flathead a little combat bot a prototype and i need me that bit of high grade military because if we don't get that body we don't get no soccer chip and we sure as hell don't get no happily ever after but don't get excited it's a single-use toy now i slide out purchase the damn thing from maelstrom problem is i did so from a gentleman by the name of brick i say win because brick was the leader three days after we'd see ladies his friend and gang mate one simon randle aka royce playing dropped his ass royce is in charge now and i got no way of knowing if he aims to honor his predecessor's word to add to this shipstream one meredith style of militech has developed an interest in said convoy royce guy what's he like a straight psychopath chrome loving kind big club in this town i'll give you that except few of its other members no matter the stakes would put a friend and associate through an industrial microwave dryer apparently first thing to burst out the eyeballs get a nice clear pop then the rest goes goulash who's the prima donna corporal agent internal affairs been skidding around town asking after the convoy as if her life depended on finding it the one lead she's got zip tied in her trunk stick up her ass ain't growing any shorter so she must be getting desperate be wise to think how you can use that of course to do so you'll need that frazzled cat's info sending it now client what's her thing why she need to meet woman's name's evelyn parker vettinger wasn't easy put the word out i was looking for any kind of intel right and some brothers from pacifica got back to me told me to stop looking and the convo anyway our little client insisted on meeting someone with skin in the game you know who'll be there for it all yours truly will be remote t-bug ain't no people person and jackie's only good at some things i know you know what i mean pretty much leaves you i think i got everything time i got to work well that's just music to my ears i'll set up the meet with miss parker at lizzie's bar flat head though is gonna be all you one more thing mr b quiet life or blaze of glory hmm later now jagster talk to dex a big deal guy certainly knows how to protect his biz wants to put us on a few small kinks prep work i guess before lining us up a big job there's this combat bot military prototype maelstrom clept it then decks paid to take it off their hands just before the gang goons had to switch up in management all right right heard about that royce versus frick hostile takeover that sums it up dex wants us talking to royce gave the deets of some militech agent too but i don't know how much help she stands to be you don't sound thrilled royce what do you know about him he's [ __ ] wack something special chucky snort chunk royce sports chrome then there's the other thing gotta meet the client who put the job on the table evelyn parker you oh what's next gonna do right around in his limo chat chicks up on the hollow parker wants to meet someone on the crew dex gave me the knot he must know what he's doing so how you want to play this bell strummer parker was first parker i think i have to see her first see what she's like what she's after in that case i'll hit the all foods put my nose to the ground stick around castle [Music] safety [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] is [Music] we're closed right now looking a little put out there input interest you in a pre-mbd what do you got what don't we got women and men of your dreams synaptic acting a-listers no washed-up virtue porn boy toys or blow-up dolls here oh tour stuff it'll grip your heart and blow your nerves right out of your body pure bit based ecstasy that's why people come here clearly know how to sell it not a sales pitch it's a warning i'll give you one word bespoke not for everyone's synapses think you can handle it bespoke damn that sounds promising i get it i'm in a couple of things you need to know first severe penalties for any unauthorized recording no drugs no groping someone catch your eye you do not grab them you find them in the catalog ask for a bd and get yourself a box i really look that green to you like i don't know doors open have fun input welcome to lizzy's mine what a sweet little face you have right here [Music] there [Music] [Music] all right hey get you something so curious the name lizzie's is that the owner not for a long while no and it's none too sweet of story now i'm just flight interested real lizzy ran a strip joint out of this place back in the day lizzy's bar girls were paid right insured even had decent security good spot all in home ah stories of the golden days inevitable demise and the inevitable drink over sweet memories all what makes the tall tales easier to swallow so what went wrong tiger claws shot up lizzy tiger beat one of lizzie's girls real bad ones no hesitation lizzy blasted the guy's balls off gang came back the next day this was done tigers gave this place up to the mocks in the end though didn't they sort of the moxes had to make a deal with them luckily they kept their heads organized quick big boss now with susie q but the signs stayed up out of respect and biz booms to this day i'm looking for evelyn parker you know if she's here who's asking big tipper generous when i get the answers i'm looking for appreciate the gesture truly but afraid i don't get paid to talk opposite actually it's all right mateo i was waiting for this one evelyn parker i knew it was you as soon as you walked in senson only tequila i drank how do you know i like to know everything about the people i work with either that or it was just a lucky guess why we meeting here any particular reason actually it doesn't seem much like your thing this place i'll take that as a compliment come on no place we can talk where ears won't prick up to listen we'll be in the lounge if anyone asks we're not here so what can we do [Music] dex had a load to say about you called you professional effective and trustworthy i hope he wasn't overselling you don't give a rat's dick what dex thinks we both know that you have trouble accepting compliments no just think flattery's beneath you am i wrong maybe dex is beneath you have you known each other long you're writing dex's bio i hate to disappoint but i just don't know much in other words you hardly know each other yet he fingered you for this job huh curious [ __ ] buzz decks right now if you're getting cold feet i can wait i doubt he'd add anything i haven't already heard anything i'd really like to hear for that matter there's only one other bunch that's worse than fixers in that respect used car salesman i'll go with my gut for now let's cut to the chase what do you got for me your target i trust you know what it is relic secure your soul trinket key tech in the program actually we're tangling with arasaka making this heist one dangerous risky mother [ __ ] arasaka's poured billions into personality transfer technology but me i just want the data on this one the chip is tucked away inside kompecki plaza the hotel you ever been classy corp hotels yeah no out of my price range hmm other decors to die for as you'll see for yourself so where's this chip hiding exactly in a suite on the top floor the rooms occupied by yorinobu arasaka you're a noble arasaka he's in town don't you read the scream sheets the media couldn't get enough of yori coming to night city it was all over the headlines anyway he's heir apparent to the arasaka empire saburo arasaka's only surviving son what so arasaka juniors planning to grab the reigns while in night city only a handful of people in night city know what the odasaka's real plans are telling me you're one of them so we're not jumping the corp we're jumping yarn over arasaka himself yori nobu is a puppet he lost all his cards years ago when he failed to do daddy's bidding saburo's had yuri's balls in a vice for years he might just turn the screw and crush them outright if he learns his son's up to no good again top dog like yarn over's bound to have an army on call hotel's probably a goddamn fortress by now too yorinobu keeps exactly no hustle around not one guard got rid of them a long time ago huh why is that surely you know what they say about arasaka intel sneeze in night city and a blossom drops from a cherry tree in tokyo yorinobu was convinced his ottasaka security detail reported directly to his father look if you've got any spare aces up your sleeve now's the time to show them now this should make your prick perk up yori nobu recently swiped the chip from an arasaka laboratory he's made a deal with netwatch aims to sell it to them have you spotted my ace yet or do i need to spell things out so what's your nobu do to walk away with unimportant you focus on the biochip what could cyberspace's watchers and protectors offer intelligence on his enemies that doesn't matter in the least because you'll make sure the transaction never happens and i get the chip wait neutral netwatch is mixed up in this netwatch provides net security for all corporations and collects eddies in the millions for it but in this day and age everyone's in the game and no one can afford to be a saint to win one has to go all in fine so no arrow socket security on the device because yorinobu whisked it away in secret now where's he hiding it likely in a specialized container one that mimics an organic neural environment on the outside it looks like an ordinary briefcase and the case is you'll see for yourself soon enough provided we're done gossiping about the outer sockets what else you know about your nobu quite a bit actually he studied finance and biotech in tokyo probably didn't have a choice in the matter come to think of it saburo was grooming him to be his successor but then yorinobu vanished to chase his own dreams cut himself off from the corp for years long story short though the black sheep returned the bitter taste remained but that's only one side of him there's another an intelligent man who has always walked his own path and so has his own designs on the corp could be another power hungry corporal dick like so many others ever try to imagine what life might be like for an emperor's son you have everything yet you are no one nothing at least as long as you remain in saburo arasaka's shadow i sympathize it's a vulnerability i understand well and when you plan to exploit fully one more thing data that's on the chip what is it irrelevant entirely we're talking about data yarinobu snuck out of arasaka what's more he wants to pass it on to netwatch sounds pretty damn relevant to me listen b the relic that's my concern your concern earning a paycheck just get the job done i'll make sure your bank accounts are sated okay what's next now comes the best part follow me got something for you should help you plan brain dance from kompecki plaza how's the brain dance supposed to help need facts not thrills i think bds are only good for fondling virtual tits jacking off too in those boxes i said i'd come to you now like anything else can be a very useful tool good for analyzing details human perception even boosted doesn't grasp exactly what you need so what's on the tape yorinobu suite the glorious interior you'll need to locate the relic yourself hope i grabbed enough detail to make that possible hold up mean to say you recorded this btrec implant why you object [Music] supposed to be your nobu's pat on the tape means you were inside you know each other how else could i get all this intel i know him pretty well actually we have an arrangement strictly business suits us both i think let's see this brain dance judy will help she's a mox too besides we go back uh years v this is important judy's always been there for me always helped out i trust her but she's a mox not the latest member no no no no no try not to forget relax believe it or not i'm no stranger to tact in biz or life hey there you are this is v he's here for that bd roll and v this is judy best brain dance editor i know enough already sensory sig amps acoustic and emotive wave monitors it's top shelf hardware yeah most of it's customized only thing factory are the casings mod all this yourself what do you think expression translator fujitsuki right thought the matrices on that series were [ __ ] up they were but swapping out matrices is simple and this was the only model that would support additional scan work all right all right compiled your bdf what do you think will it do still pretty raw but yeah ought to do v needs to get deep inside that's most important so let's calibrate tune it to him believe me i've dealt with worse i should see the jig jig street porn we gotta contend with sometimes so we drop the inside let him look let him rummage around right how about a v raw brain dance ever taken a dip before what do you mean by raw how does this differ from the ready mates huh ready maids provided they're well made should feed you feelings and impressions you'd never have the chance to experience yourself in real space but it's mass market [ __ ] so it's pre-crafted hard-coded fenced-in and manageable a raw one well it's more like a virtue enviro get to move around look at things in detail editors use those layers to fish for juicier emotes and impulses then use them to pad the bds that go to market sit down settle in and we'll get you going got to create your sensory profile first a what profile now model of your perceptions and emotional responses need to adjust that so the raw bd won't overwhelm you if i don't best case scenario you'll get nauseous as soon as you're in probably barf like you would in a shoddy virtue environment and voice case your synapses sizzle like locusts in a deep fryer but we're not about to let that happen okay hit me just promise me it won't hurt it won't not this time now sit still look at me i'm gonna run the analysis soft [ __ ] feel a slight tingling okay now let's set the optics and other sensory sticks look smack into these two screens pretend it's an eye exam am i gonna have to do this calibration dance every time not necessarily but it's worth the wait give me two more minutes and you'll see exactly would be the analysis okay one more sec i need to get the pain receptor limiters in okay all set you need to test your profile first tossing in a sample pd you can use it to get to know the editor now let me see where can we can't he just use my recording why are we wasting time so we don't risk our necks besides won't take a sec got something here shouldn't be perfect what you choose corner store hold up in haywood real amateurs don't even know where i got it suits our needs perfectly though you ready boot it up let me give you the tailored version first as you get your bearings and we'll jump into editing mode be diving in three two one plant simple do nothing odd don't get creative you go in snatch the cash get out and we sell the bd to those psycho freaks from the studio got it got it and remember everything on full blast they'll spot us extra for a wicked adrenaline high okay on you go down everybody on the ground when i see you kissing the flooring money now where i will [ __ ] drop you i swear to god whoa yeah now before i blow your [ __ ] head off nothing happened you're alive and well that flash of intense shock i can still feel it i remember [ __ ] that last second could have warned me how much it hurts to die trust me real death hurts much much more not so sure about that you'll be fine got everything set up let's switch over to editing mode i'll sever the link to the bd rollers sensory array you'll be able to look around freely whole scene's yours full cam control and analysis mode so move around zoom in and out whatever else you come up with think of it as your own little sandbox so analysis mode you control playback can even pause when you feel the need then you use the editor console to unpause try it plan simple do nothing odd don't get creative you go in snatch the cash get out and we sell the bd to those psycho cranks from the studio got it got it dream as hell right well that's not all you can speed things up or rewind whatever you like give it a try rewind roll it back to the top all good neat now try fast forwarding plan simple do nothing odds okay you can also reset the recording that'll take you right back to the beginning try it now for some fun this here's why you came in the first place in analysis mode you get to view and even scan details of the enviro recorded by the bd roller focus on the heat the gun this gunk gets from his buddy at the beginning now scan it plant simple do nothing odd don't get green last they'll spot us extra for the night okay right here excellent let's move on now heads up in analysis mode you can ferret out background noise and conversations if the roller got close enough this tech records everything every little detail even the sights and sounds the roller was never aware of to see the sources of the recorded sensory signals switch to the audio layer in the editor go ahead and try that now okay good now you should see several sound signatures in the store choose one and hone in on it okay [ __ ] little [ __ ] go restock i'll take the register how about you suck a bag of dicks hey so any thoughts unbelievable seriously like what's happening right next to me yeah it's how bd recording implants work they pick up everything all the elements in the background then an editor tweaks them makes them pop keep playing with the sound explore it a bit we'll move on when you get bored sometimes you can analyze extra layers in the raw stuff the rollers cyberware picked up like what eb's got kiroshi optics that grab infrared meaning you should be able to grab heat signatures from her recording hella nice now let's wait till the guy punches out the gunk at the counter boring money scanning works on peeps too walk up to the wounded chick try scanning her all right next thing scroll forward to the part where our artist gets a lead injection now we're able to [ __ ] drop your shoulder now i thought i'd pull your [ __ ] out see that they shot him and he never saw it coming but you will here it comes my favorite part of the game see the blinking thing over the entrance surveillance cam must have caught our shooter you'll see in a sec cam feeds to the screen behind the clerk roll back to where the screens in the kids field of vision then scan it his own chumba shot him probably planned to all along must have got a nice slice of crap on the black market for a bd like this bd freaks are ready to pay a prem for a real flatline anyway if you've seen enough you can exit [Music] yeah it's impressive right it's too bad most of the bds we do here are only good for flogging the log anyway you ready to do this look at your wreck no way let's take a break still feel like that kid when oh yeah i think i'm done v there's no time get it together please okay okay go ahead just need t-bug to link in who running for my crew security specialist she'll tell me what to look for while we analyze no problem i hope actually it is a problem not what we agreed ev relax judy everything will be fine you don't quite grasp the risks i took by letting you in here well i'm risking poking around with this stuff we're all taking risks here that's the job so either t-bug patches in or i'm on my way out judy please fine collar let's get this over with hey v what's happening bug listen i got some useful footage from kenpecki plaza it's a brain dance kind of pecky oh thought as much someone there with you unimportant debug please focus need your help got no clue what i'm supposed to look for once i'm in all right see if i can walk you through it jacking it to your tech now you've got to give me access opening port 1779 secure protocol good i'm going in should be getting my requests now got it you ready a millisecond okay connection confirmed now some quick tip ice and we're clear ready to dance fire up judy all right v eyes open gotta find out where you're know who's keeping the relic [Music] i felt a fear sure got it under control quick too i said no they'll have my head for this then you shall perish for good cause but make yourself comfortable i need a minute listen in on that conversation v could be something important i need a minute to finish the program is still in the trial phase we cannot take it to market as is we shall see soon enough please speak with your father he's taken a particular interest in this project he can certainly explain the risks fathers are tired visual this old grey beard who thinks nothing will change and he'll live forever in his tiny frozen bubble i should not even be listening to such things you will listen to this sabroi is an adult despot utterly removed from reality stuck in some fossilized vision of a world that no longer exists of a world that may never have existed we have not seen eye to eye for the past 20 years i am quite sure we won't now read the documentation carefully the relic requires specific storage conditions you must not write them heard that relic docs got to be around here somewhere look for them hearing a drone ventilation and cooling servers gotta be fancy doodads in here need to be controlled sorry to make you wait business can't be stupid it wasn't long not even long enough for me to grow bored is everything all right you seem tense a moment it will pass i can get to work on that just one condition you wish to make demands of me only one focus on me oh got any candy left stuff was pretty fun last time bedroom nightstand i got an idea be right back looking for the perfect thing ah you'll like this [Music] i know [Music] [Music] manual details a special tip controlled container relic needs to be kept real cool so chip's gotta stay in the freezer yep could damage it otherwise okay switch on thermal layer detection in the editor should be easier to spot where you are know who's keeping the chip hmm air conditioning standard model for hotels of this caliber temp matches that stipulated in the docks but no way the chip's hiding there too risky temp fluctuations risk of damage oh donaghy's looks like mr arasaka had something to celebrate really think you'll find the chip in there no way tim's too low could fluctuate nice try though just a fancy ass fridge tip doesn't match the guidelines won't find a thing here right grab the heatsink matches the spec in the docks your nobody's got the case here guaranteed we got it good work looks like we got everything we need get out of the editor [ __ ] camera's packed with new tech motion sensors heat sig activators iff you skilled enough to kill it all mucho more than enough just need access to their subnet alarm firmware is fresh but saw excited birds chirping on a bbs something about lots of seeds fall into this sieve let me generate keys i can forge their six automated turrets latest scanner model system is all connected to the server can you shut them off externally no way gotta get in check out how they link into the system first looks like all their security systems are linked to the hotel subnet we need the flathead no other way to shut down these systems can't get around them ourselves nope at least i'm fresh out of ideas steph was pretty good loaded safety's on good to know though once you're in there don't forget about that iron [Music] get everything you need yep that'll do thanks judy we got it later t-bug nice work today see you soon i'll wipe the cash on your data you were never here keep it i'll put it on ev's tab portable device for handling bds i already uploaded your calibration settings not as sophisticated as what we got here but should do the trick and it keeps you out of harm's way clever speaking of harm's way know what i see looking at you walking talking corpses we needed that recording judy the bd practically does our job for us the bd will be the death of us seriously if arasaka finds out you have it you're dead i'm dead judy relax nobody will ever know evelyn please no shortcuts you go that route city you'll always win so be careful of course i will be besides we'll talk in a bit let's walk well what do you think think i see how you know so much about your nobu it's simple men like pillow talk a bit too much so it's just about the sex biz and biz only you sure your nobu doesn't expect this kind of move from you he's got no idea trust me he's too busy with netwatch to give me that kind of attention besides even if some suspicion takes root in his mind it shouldn't matter he won't react in time and that's something you'll handle right you're not worried our sock will flag and scream anyone who's had dealings with yarn over well they'll have a long list then packed full of big names much bigger than mine you tell me who they check first corpo hot shots and cut throats or a little bedroom play thing like me intel on your inobu the chip the beatty from kenpecki wins a right plan's perfect job like this comes one in a million thanks now the punchline please just sounds too good to be true what's the catch cold feet are you looking to get out of it i want to know if you're really in control here you're not sending me into the sort of [ __ ] i can't wait out of v i have zero reasons to haze you we're in this together really trust me that i got this so what now v do this job for me i mean me alone no splitting the pay out with anyone else no middlemen no decks you want to [ __ ] over our fixer i knew something was up dex is a middle man and useless one at this point evelyn you don't mess with fixers that's the one rule every merc in this city knows and actually follows but if we're smart doesn't matter mistake like that will cost you rep without a rep you're nobody you sure you want to do this better ask yourself that question do you want to spend the rest of your days blasting scabs or become a legend overnight your choice if i agree they'll be held to pay for sure i know whatever you decide it stays between us i can offer 50 eddie's enough to do whatever the hell you like i'll be finished dex won't forgive a dirt move like this dex isn't the only fixer in town but my offer is the only one you'll ever get let me think about it if you need me call i'll send you my number okay good luck now go i need a few words with [Music] how judy looking mr v turns out everyone's recording from kenpecki was worth our time beautiful t-bug already called said she's working her magic and the flat head nothing yet on it now t-bug says no chance at that ship without that buy to work then mr v no no don't thank me [Music] so stout here start by telling me how you got this number no more than your number heard you misplaced a convoy you shut him up spill what you know don't make me wait no not on the horn let's meet cut a deal a deal fine first exit off skyline driving towards the nid storm channel under the overpass meet you there [Music] no don't cry what a sweet little face you have going in or stand out

but they're expecting payment so i could go that route too fine the latter but on one condition you pay with our money sounds solid enough i'm in you pay with that chip and that's all you got to worry about try to [ __ ] me in any way and i'll be seeing you real making a soon this guy's already good at dead if he'll take you down with her [Music] [Music] [ __ ] go ah there you are let me hear what

worked together before dex took his break so dex already paid the maelstroms for the corporal bot thing is can't be sure the gang goons are still willing to hand it over he paid up front well whatever let's go get this tech you scheme yet you got a plan that [ __ ] can go smoothly this is maelstrom gang world ain't too complicated mites right the strong survive either you [ __ ] others or you get [ __ ] so into the borg beast then give me a minute okay tell me when you're good and stealed let's go see these bastards all right let's knock on their door see if they even open up [Music] [Music] i

thanking us sweet booth is soundproof jackie now now mr wells is right we're gonna be going over some sensitive material but if it's all right with y'all i'd like to start with a question for mr v evelyn parker how'd you fare couldn't have gone better in fact she liked me so much she made me another offer another offer mm-hmm kind where we ditched the middleman and split the pot in even 50 50. what ditch the middleman [ __ ] now that's rich [Laughter] clients never learn do they i do appreciate you sharing this info though mr v you see trust is essential in any partnership that's to be long lasting and fruitful appreciation don't convert to eddies and evelyn offered us a bunch he's telling it like it is dex y'all need not worry truly we'll come to that i thought you'd be pissed that you'd lose it i lived in nc too long to blow my top every time some amateur thinks they can take me for a ride parker ain't the first and sure as hell won't be the last how about we go over the plan what you got for us dicks this well here goes nothing me and dex have already covered the fine deets ops wise should be a stroll on the beach elaborate i want to hear it a delaman will drop your asses at the front door of kenpecki plaza you'll stroll right in thanks to your false identities then with bugs help you'll breach the hotel subnet mine and the flatheads help last but not least you slip into your inobu's penthouse and clep the relic it goes without saying we do this on the hush ideally no bodies not a one you'll have t-bug on comms for the duration time for your burning questions transports a delamane premise cab company in all night city desean don't ever work with anyone but the best i consider delamane just that yeah who needs creepy nosy cab drivers when you've got a clean ai to get you from point a to b in style and how he bags a permit to operate every year still a mystery if everything goes as planned de la maine will drop you back here if things get sticky you head for the safe house which is the no-tell motel quiet no questions asked make our next move from there but i'm flat certain that won't be necessary anything else these new identities tell us more what's our cover hello ramon victorino and you're hairy conwell ramon yeah okay what do we say we're there for biz as usual corporal armsteal case anyone asks you there for a bogus meeting with our osaka's defense rep hajime taki anything else how do we get in the penthouse your nobu's got barely any muscle hardest part will be penthouse security if we want to disable we'll need to neutralize konpeki's dweller elite runner monitoring the hotel subnet 24 7. only catch is there's no way to get in the dweller's den from the outside hold on how you want us to get inside a room you can't get into trust me when i say whatever hitch you think of debug solved it already this is where the flathead comes in you'll have to get him in the ventilation shaft guide him to the dweller and force the dweller to take a break flathead will stay there jacked into the dweller but thanks to that i'll be able to roll out your red carpet into the penthouse anything else okay feel brought up to speed perfect i got a question when did we get to the real reason we're all here now's a good time as any fresh talent gets 30 always but i'm willing to make an exception in your case i'mma cut you a nice juicy 40 as a bonus for your honest tv that's more like it dex kajing baby last thing kenpecki's got a strict no iron policy security gates the works so you dogs will leave your lead spitters in the ride take the flathead inside in its case caught some deft suits so you'll look the part too cheetah thanks t so not to count chickens but why don't we see our eddies all depends how miss parker avails herself of her role but a week two tops my guess what do we do while we sit around suck air you sit tight heads down cause old uncle arasaka be watching now as that old greek dog says life's a banquet so don't go thirsty but don't get drunk either your chariot awaits outside my cue to delta ii got a prep to jack in be there when you come on comms any other issues now's your chance plan what's your take enough i hope to put me in a luxury cretan villa from which i'll never set foot in cyberspace again promise to send me a postcard no offense but i'm gonna burn any and all bridges need a clean break you and dex know each other a while um why well you know peeps say all kinds of things everything we hear is an opinion not a fact marcus aurelius i think you and dex both philosophize philosophizing
