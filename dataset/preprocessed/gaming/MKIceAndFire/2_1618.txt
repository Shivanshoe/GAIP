Satan mr. Satan has been knocked out of the ring he's lost the match well then let's begin the cell games shall we mr. Satan [Music] I'm gonna take a break then I'm gonna mess him up real good he still doesn't have the slightest clue what he's dealing with world champion my ass so who's first well I guess I'll go first if that's okay well well in the interest of transparency how is hoping to save you for the end [Music] grenades [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you certainly do know [Music] [Music] [Applause] no fun both fighters under the Sun once America [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] way tougher than I imagined zero room for error [Music] [Music] [Music] well look at you I must say I'm rather impressed I wasn't expecting to have this much fun do you better eat one of those Senzu beans Goku I'm having way too much fun to start now if we give Goku a sensor beam and all of us team up on cell we can take him down that's enough trunks you don't have any pride as a saying to you and you don't know him at all you would rather die than beat his opponent in such a way but if we just let this go on he can do it I'm certain of it I hate to admit it but no matter what I do I couldn't go beyond Kakarot level he's some sort of genius but even as powerful as he is cell is still one step ahead of him so what are we supposed to do he's got something planned I can tell let's just find out what that is what's wrong are you not feeling well I don't want the fun to stop here [Music] you win I'm dropping out I've got a good idea how strong you are now so I think I'm done now what what or fitting the match what what the hell is he thinking Goku you do know what you're saying don't you you do realize that once you've run out of people to fight me every last person on the planet will have breathed that last breath you got the wrong idea you still have plenty of people to go up against can I choose who goes next would that be okay with you are you seriously going to forfeit I got a feeling about this next match it'll probably be the last one if your next opponent can't beat you then it's safe to say that nobody can but just based on what I was able to learn while fighting you myself I'm pretty confident this guy will have no trouble taking you down get it now that's why I'm fine with dropping out of this thing all right you've piqued my interest just who is this mythical fighter you won't stop going on about the next one up to fight cell is he is the only one who's capable of taking down Seth all right Gohan you're up what did he just say come on you ready you you want me to fight sell Goku you're being completely ridiculous if you couldn't handle sell then what makes you think Gohan can go hannes hiding way more power than any of us realize it's downright unreal you guys he started tapping into that power while in the hyperbolic time chamber I never could have imagined this here you gotta check this out so you know I've got to ask God did you have any trouble keeping up with my fight with sell earlier well no but that's because you two weren't fighting at full power right I can't speak for sale but me I was fighting at my full power but it seemed like I was holding back to you am i right Gohan is that true yeah good go hon you wanna be a scholar don't you and save the world otherwise you'll never get the chance to become one okay I'll do what I can [Music] so I'm going to fight self [Music] [Music] you
