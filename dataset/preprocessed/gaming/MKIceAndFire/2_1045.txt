the planet furon this planet is now a territory of the furon empire resist this [Music] good evening my fellow americans in recent days rumors have run rampant of flying saucers alien invaders from other worlds indeed of my own demise i'm speaking to you tonight to put these rumors to rest the truth is america has been attacked not by little green men but red and our invaders are most definitely of this earth despite the efforts of this administration our nation has been infiltrated by communists godless deviants who hate us for our freedom-loving way of life their conspiracy details of which are only now coming to light included drugging our water supplies and controlling our media via mind control the result was mass hysteria a national delusion which provided them the cover they needed to execute their fearful scheme but your military and intelligence agencies fought back and i'm proud to report that once again america has emerged victorious however the price is dear at this moment millions of americans are working hard and playing by the rules unaware of the lingering toxic pollutants in their minds to combat this lingering menace we have set up testing centers across the nation at shopping malls local schools even churches the test is simple and painless why our family had it just this morning and i'm back at work doris is in the kitchen baking brownies and little billy's out playing tag in the rose garden right now it's completely safe so trust your government trust your president freedom is on the march my friends good night and god bless america step inside citizen you sure this thing is safe step inside citizen jeez louise i don't know hey buddy you heard the president if it's good enough for him it's good enough for us yeah yeah yeah well i guess a test couldn't hurt [Music] um like shooting monkeys in a barrel [Music] and so the world breathes a sigh of relief the threat of alien invasion proved a false alarm as for those who scan the skies for a real visit from outer space they may be in for a very long wait perhaps the lesson is that we should turn our gaze inward remembering that man's worst enemy is often himself [Music] you
