hoffman the bastard is hoffman spit it out look hoffman's been hanging on to that data disc he stole from prescott back on vectus all those goddamn months i spent trying to crack the encryption for him we still didn't have a freaking clue what was on it well i bet it's the data on asura and that unlocks it we have to get it to hoffman and crack that disc he's at anvil gate that's a hell of a long journey marcus i hate to direct people but we got visitors wow watch out here nuts so uh do so so so man that was nasty okay let's move out keep your mind keep your mind this is all i can recover i've tried to contact you over the years but i've been held prisoner at azura since press conference keep your mind on the emulsion countermeasure that's all that matters since press got abducted me from the estate terrorists had abducted me prison uh so now what now we go see hoffman sam you're from anvil gate what's the quickest route cross the deadlands it's gonna be rough but i can take you straight there just give us directions sam you went on you stay here with carmine and jason supervise the salvage marcus we'll catch up with you when the situation's under control okay okay good luck come on we've got a long walk ahead of us let's get going hey it's a barge looks like the one we shot down earlier anyone got a pump and some duct tape i hate those chompers little creeps can't leave anything alone yeah imagine rooting around looking for parts all the time hey i make intelligent use of free resources that's how come we're still alive to [ __ ] about it come on the locust must have more of these gas barges there's our ride let's track it [Applause] when we hijack the barge let me drive i think i've got a way to control it it's all yours beard keep moving uh what's in those cages it's a keep out sign what almost worked looks like our barge they've gotta land sooner or later come on or else we're gonna lose them heads up guys i think i saw movement out there whoa it's in our way spread out and keep moving get out of the way [ __ ] here we go again stay sharp hmm there's got to be more oh i bet all his little ugly buddies are out there somewhere dude um [Music] ambush in here down here comes some more let's move whoa whoa artillery incoming rod get out of range content incoming keep moving we've got to take out that catapult marcus anything about those turrets look familiar to you they're using old dancers yeah they were using them for ingenuity uh uh let's get up there whole lot of grabs coming to crash the party marcus that turkey gun could save us a whole lot of sweat i'll take any help i can get if it means we get a ride out of here okay let's see how good this thing is sweet who's that look at all this ammo they're definitely setting up home here grab what you need and keep moving [Music] [Music] see that's what happens when you flood their tunnels they rebuild anywhere they can yeah i thought it was kind of weird to see them up here strolling around they ain't the car for a day at the beach seems like they've dug themselves a new home they must be excavating the whole area hey that barge looks like it's setting down anyone up for a hijack yeah first class to anvilgate let's do it hmm take out any guards before they sound the alarm stop him before he stabs the horn crying let's try that side entrance the side gate's clear okay go that's what hoffman would call a serious lack of vigilance we better start liberating some supplies this must lead into the main compound [Music] ah crap oh at least we didn't walk into a hail of instant death yeah we don't take out those gunshots that comes next yes either we shut down that turret or a freaking ground state oh content dude nice wow that was character farming huh you got to hand it to them grubs they built the last so any idea where we are now um in the [ __ ] up to here why did hoffman have to move to the other end of the freaking world i just hope the old man's still alive how long since we last had radio contact with amblegate just over a year if he's dead bernie would hang onto the disc heads up there's a barge over there let's see where it lands hmm take cover after the next salvo run for it go now incoming ready go incoming okay now fine looks like that barge is leaving well if we're lucky they think [Music] looks like we need to scale that tower you read my mind beard you sure you can control that overgrown bladder when we grab it yeah tinker toes cause you know bladder control ain't your strong suit once it happened once okay anyway i grabbed the nav system

to go under it well there's an old sub laid up the shipyard in endeavor yeah if it's seaworthy if you can get the motors running and if you can fuel it now son that's where i come here i'm x merchant navy i can fix it drive it and fuel it if you can find a place to build a tanker we can detour via mercy or char i know mercy it's an emulsion pumping station let's try there first you sure you want

small one's gonna be a lot easier to sneak into azure you see size ain't everything don't you mind dizzy none sweetheart just gonna look you over and uh see what kind of shape you're in didn't special ops use these in the pendulum wars [ __ ] if i know but she's real handy for the job marcus this lady's gonna need some parts see this rotor crack clean through and then there's the fuel she's empty okay time to look for the goods then so what's first here you go get the fuel will i dismantle it good [Music] look sharp we've got more drops um who's next oh wow well nothing worth salvaging from this rust bucket where do we look next let's head outside and find the docks guard let's see if this one is wow i'm looks like a free fuel supply to me you can't just we need to use the brown come on let's move it okay that's how we bought it get the brow in position what the hell's a brown the ramp move the ramp wouldn't say that then guards one locus by the control room come on we gotta move

lost me at life cycle it's not a fuel marcus it's a living organism it's turning everything lambant including us it's a parasite so you can kill it yes that's it exactly mera wants me to adapt the countermeasure to kill it without harming the locust but there's no time left for that we need to shut down the maelstrom first to land reinforcements where do we go there's a train that'll take you
