brutal life they left one country to go to another and made something of themselves they passed that wealth on to the next generation my parents they built on it they gave it to me so you want me to move well that would solve my immediate problems but no no you can stay in yara but castile wants a change here he does i talk to him every day he wants it as fast as you do sometimes it is better to swim with the current than to go against it so i should just accept the arrests the outcast system the executions every modern country in the history of the world has dark days only difference now is
