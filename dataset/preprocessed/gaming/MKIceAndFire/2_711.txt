yes are you v please step in the vehicle okay hello v i'm jefferson ferraris you've already spoken with elizabeth my wife the one running for mayor of night city the one so the one who is d.a until recently but just vaulted into a seat on the city council i gather you now understand why discretion is of the utmost importance nice to meet you mr perales mrs perales hmm right again liz you see my wife is a great judge of character said this would work now i see why so what do you got for me carter let's go elizabeth well as you're probably aware mayor lucius rein recently passed we want to know how why whatever else is pertinent it's all over the news of course it was media feasted for weeks pieces like that are their lifeblood right think they missed something we have reason to believe they did yes or as i remember someone tried to zero ryan a few days before his death the ncpd sees no link they're saying it was a random cyber psycho attack claiming the mayor died of natural causes causes unrelated to the attack it's in the official reports ryan died at home due to a cardio implant malfunction these suspicions of yours wouldn't have anything to do with the upcoming election would they of course they would if lucius ryan was murdered we want to know need to know what makes you think the cops got it wrong got any evidence shortly before ryan passed he made cuts in the ncpd budget perhaps got on someone's bad side that way in any case we have the cyber psycho attack on a bd our chief of security scanned it but didn't find anything out of the ordinary so to speak we need a brain dance editor a real one it's raw footage the brain dance it has to be back where it belongs today where a lot of people will be in a lot of trouble if you agree to help you can see it right now where'd you get the scroll ryan was making a public appearance bb's scrolling standard procedure for events like that following the attack the ncpd impounded the footage as evidence we had to pull many strings to extract it all right see what i can do excellent we'd be happy with any find that would clarify things alleviate lingering doubts well what do we got here question is what are you doing here my brain too isn't it and this time don't go scrolling every ass you see eyes on the mayor stuff belongs to city hall let's make it pg hold it stop right there slow your roll river ward ncpd police let him in let him wait it's important gotta speak to the mayor's chief of security prim do it after the conference who's the hulk guy no idea those ass clowns are all the same second conference in three days no idea what this blitz is for that's why i'm mayor and you're not now's when we need the visibility you're spreading yourself too thin i'll rest tonight my room that the red queen's race is ready yes of course good now go gotta practice red queen's race cause any inner synaps zaps sure bunch of old brit farts and powdered wigs shouting off with their heads you know you're allowed to say you don't have a clue they left literally seconds before the attack and it looks planned like it was done on purpose that or the psycho saw his chance and took it don't get paranoid on me hold it sports security cream do it after could have chromed at the city with what he was packing probably what happened buddy disappeared from the morgue sight unseen and then some pig got himself a new set of wheels in an ugly ass suit know that we're just talking out your ass again once you've seen all i've seen don't need to know things to know people are the same everywhere okay it's coming at your ass terminal crashed right as he went through the gate glitch was no accident now seeing stranger coincidences like like when you bang some chick and then her sister later same night and it turns out they're both sisters of god that really happened to you no but it could have well well well do it after the conference the tune don't recognize it tune what he's humming wouldn't call that a tune he's really into it you're here fantastic so any thoughts did you uh see anything suspicious anything at all or are we paranoid whole thing stinks worse than coronado bay in july so suspicions confirmed any questions at this point red queen's race what is it got me never heard of it sorry who's holt ryan's deputy and his bulldog so to speak running in ryan's place now conference why was it held for no particular reason ryan liked the sound of his voice and seeing himself on tv and that sort of thing as far as i recall the drop at night city's violent crime rate was the excuse for this one ryan came out to touted sorry drop ryan reclassified pacifica an independent district stats for that part of town stopped counting clever cop who saved ryan know anything about him detective river ward good guy we worked a few cases together you want to talk to him i'll put you in touch mayor's hustle the ncpd no all hand-picked by holt and on a corpse payroll but there are ex-cops among them anyone else besides ryan's detail have access to the terminal ncpd that's it sheesh ward had great timing either has crazy good luck or had a source got good info i'm gonna need some of each well said sending you his deeds if you need anything else let us know we'll help so my this is ward who am i talking to name's v looking into the death of one lucious rhyme i wonder why you're not a cop jefferson and elizabeth perales hired me to do it presumptive mayor sniffing around his untimely death interesting done some digging got more intel also interesting all right i'm headed to chubby buffalos be their stat hey elizabeth hi how can i help you how's the campaign trail promising jefferson's beginning to rise as holt's numbers slip people seem to really trust jeff our message is simple and honest voters are starting to notice how we treat them genuinely not like data on a statute if we can maintain this momentum i know jefferson will be our new mayor how's jeff handling all the campaign chaos he's thriving v he's in his element jefferson was born to change the world gotta win the election first he's never more comfortable than when he's with voters some say jefferson's too honest too open but they say it out of respect not spite campaign coffers are full i hope we're managing just fine it certainly hasn't been easy true independence can have its limitations but it keeps the corporate leashes off your neck exactly right actually liz i gotta go no problem we'll talk later great so as i was saying you never get yourself chipped kinda like having a dentist with no teeth isn't it i have good rep you won't hear any complaint about me but why your job would be a lot easier with some zoom capable karachi optics i'm sure it would until the day this planet gets hit by a massive solar flare i'm talking about a geomagnetic storm that wipes out all live circuit systems uh implants included so why would i get karoshi if sooner or later i just go blind if you're so paranoid why are you chipping other people with chrome i like the job besides nobody wants to hear the truth anyway you mind taking a look at my chrome sure make yourself comfortable oh it's a good thing you answered i could probably use your help probably fine i could really use your help can we meet can i hear the things deep breaths tell me what's going on do you remember saul the leader of the clan i left yeah yeah i had a falling out or something doesn't matter right now he they nabbed him this is just not suitable for a coffee tell me when and where you don't know how good it is to hear that swing by the elder calder's cap i'll explain it all the cal does i thought you parted ways look it's a long story just hurry over i'm here oh all right someone here to see you looks like oh i wonder what about your river ward in the flesh my partner detective han okay thanks for agreeing to me you really intend to work with a merc don't know what i intend just yet now i'm gonna see if i hear anything new about rhyme's death you back on that boss already told you to drop it i can say it again you know he hates to say things twice and if you couldn't give a rat's fat ass about any of that eat my advice as your friend let the case go see me do anything just sitting here sipping coffee santa gossip fine do what you of are gotta go get my little girl anyway and you two at least find a quieter corner wouldn't want to be overheard okay talk i see detective hans not a fan of hedge runners don't take it personally detective hans not a fan of anybody except his daughter he wanted to talk before the attack you wanted to talk to ryan's hustle get some info dude what was it you know what tom was right acoustics are a little too good in here got my car outside okay sure some of the boys from the precinct saw horvath around arroyo shooting up dumpsters hollering how he's got to meet with the mayor brought him in brought houin peter horvath cyberpsycho who attacked the mayor later he took him downtown but then he got lost before they could get a statement so you saw him as a potential threat decided to warn the mayor just like that because he got a good heart make it sound like that's something to be ashamed of shamed nah just not something you see every day said he got lost how's that happen what's it mean it means someone didn't want him counting roaches in a cell that day before you ask me no i got no idea who my turn why's perales looking at this now why does he want it done unofficial on the hush hush as i see it braless is out to smear holt so he thinks holt's involved no but even if he's not the murdered mayor isn't great optics for his deputy mcgrawles could just be scared doesn't want the job of a guy who just got carried out feet first who would red queen's race heard anything about it know what it is maybe i have maybe i do it got anything to do with ryan the guy was headed there the day he died fine we're gonna see my ci all i've heard is some fancy ass club no idea where to even look for it see i might know then we'll go talk to the woman horvath worked for or actually we could see her first up to you i'm sorry we can't shake this case something's up just look how quickly it was closed this way you can get your job done while i find evidence that gets my chief to reopen the case win-win so where to first let's go see your informer club's a better lead fine with me my guy works here you go talk to him i'll wait outside tell him igor says hi he'll know what it's about he's your ci he doesn't know me well uh last we met it didn't go so well for him people he ratted out got wind of it i think you got a better chance of getting him to talk without me at least voluntarily who is this guy a proud proprietor he's got all sorts of clients and he's nosy as hell so he knows all about everyone plus he's a coward perfect combo all right wait here then you're looking for a general inspiration or something specific because i can help with both looking for a club rag queen's race if i was you i'd try somewhere a little more welcoming lizzy's over in kabuki is a good start or clouds in japantown want an address look club's invitation only right you don't know the address it means you're not welcome igor says hi [ __ ] no said i was done i was out hey neil piss off relax just got one question to ask you nothing to see here sir come on ghost i said let me alone got it can't make me do a damn thing red queen's race give us the address we're gone i heard that already last time then those [ __ ] show broke all my fingers wasn't here then now i am i'll make sure nothing happens to you anyone asks we'll say we got the address off a body we fished out at the bay uh fine it's outside city limits near the river bonita street area you been there made some deliveries goods sometimes peeps we got no idea why you want to go poking around there the club's empty he shut it all down shut it down before or after mayor ryan died soon after i guess thanks neil my shitlock well well that's what i call a breakthrough it seems promising but i'd still hit that part where are you going now we can talk go ahead it seems promising but i'd still hit that market market morvath's employer when i mentioned before i just wouldn't let that lead drop okay let's go see this market of yours you're gonna take my car sure thanks ah [ __ ] a good 90 of any detective's job is talking but you know that already i'll say you're kind of natural the other 10 what's it consist of writing reports so who we supposed to talk to cyberpsycho's boss you said christine markov 42 file has her as horvath's sole employer soul contact too actually come on me okay no idea who we're looking for i'm gonna have to ask around i'll start from the left you take the right it's a beautiful day huh christie markov nor has his doll here don't know any christine this isn't bd heads anonymous christine mark christine markov no but i know who she is okay you christine markov we have some questions you badges looking for data on peter horvat worked here apparently yeah he did then he stopped working started making [ __ ] speeches all the time would beth make good scratch here could have bought this whole market with the oh chromium i made scabs on scats here [ __ ] millionaire like we all are so where'd he get the eddies know anything well if i knew i wouldn't be here selling scarp to tower trash i get myself an av flying my [ __ ] slim ass out of here peter showed up one day with all that extra worked up too whacked enough that i asked him where he got it he said somebody finally seen what he was what and then he launched right into one of his tie rings when the weird behavior actually started when you're talking about pedo weird doesn't mean what it means for everybody else horribath never was completely normal but the post-jail horvath versus the free jail horvath gunks both but completely different goings these uh speeches what did he have to say ryan corpse got him by the balls and [ __ ] but he still managed to [ __ ] me his motto why'd he have it in for the mayor looking for reason in that whack job probably thought ryan was talking to him through the tv promising all sorts of [ __ ] then cease him to give a [ __ ] look i told you what i think in horvath's world everybody was out to get him lucius ryan was out to [ __ ] him then get him so as horvath saw it who else had it in for besides ryan a madame president mostly then arasaka the giza and when he died it was the sun's tone would that be all detectives you're spooking my clientele somebody'd finally seen what he was worth orvath had sponsors we might have guessed as much like seemed like we didn't get a lot out of that sometimes intel makes sense once you've got some context say for instance somebody says they got a headache minor detail means nothing right usually sure but then the guy waltzes straight into oncoming traffic neighbor remembers someone had worked on the air conditioner in the guy's unit a guy whose head always hurt accident coincidence or maybe air dispersed poison a deliberate hit you actually caught a case like that no made it up still proves my point your boyfriend got sent out for years doubt you want this elections are around the corner ncpd had to up its stats the rest was for show to let him out pig walking the streets with you downright unsafe got a beef with all gangs or just the tigers i'm a cop what do you think good thing nobody got killed a little less paperwork okay red queen's race now gonna ride with me sure i'll ride with you come on me this is animal turf i can see that lock up any of theirs recently not lately no but they're not big fans of pigs either i can't go in without a warrant but you uh-huh all right be in touch you find anything tell me so [ __ ] off nothing to see here uh found a side door animals are letting their guard down probably haven't checked it out in ages ugh now looks like a normal body shop to me tell them you got a punch cop intuition something like that everything okay got spotted okay hang on be right there so the club's around here some i'm getting too old for this come on i swear i won't completely kill you huh hmm awesome ah it's the [ __ ] yes ugh hmm unfortunately so look at that um bang bang here we come nice someone really wanted to cover up him down what should we be looking for let's try to find something that looks like an officer go so foreign oh come on you hear me breathe thanks for leaping into action back there no problem you feeling okay i'll live what was that fee you asked me one heart attack that killed ryan yeah as i said from the start but someone spiked his bd that's what killed him [ __ ] i think you could be right come on me looks like an office sort of comps for what we want comps above all yep stiff is a board you ask me he's been dead at least an hour no no trauma cut pretty sure he didn't bring it on purpose ah club like this you don't want tt banging down the door when you're banging away and things start to heat up hard probably must have gotten a little too heavy and messy oh okay yeah let's do that coroner will find him at home i'll tell him how to write it up died in his sleep quiet as a baby boys are getting him out of here of course nobody will see him no way yep yes all right i'll buzz you later weird the guy looks familiar doesn't he v i'm not in the mood for jokes think we've seen everything we needed to let's go i'm gonna look around some more okay do well you will waste your time as i see it though okay that's delta i think i saw another way out on the way in [ __ ] still hanging around with this punk shut it harold i know what you did not about to ask why you covered it up not even why you jumped into this mess to begin with just want to know who gave you the order what's the matter river why do you even care your conscience is clear you can sleep tight at night you know why because i took all the responsibility you got no idea how this city works i think a goddamn inspirational idealist [ __ ] actually means something it does never did hey don't look at me that way merc you know i'm right i know this town inside out so you know how it works at city hall in the street those are the same ryan knew it too he fought for this city cleanly at times dirty at others but always with a lot of heart wouldn't have wanted him to get dragged through the muck politics bores me to tears every mayor same [ __ ] different suit not every mayor saved the city from militech panzers back when the nusa tried to take us but ryan did you think people remember that all that matters is his death cause it reeks of schedule v appreciate the help but this isn't your base i'll take care of it how are you gonna do that am i under arrest gotta scroll got a motive got your confession so yeah you could be but it wouldn't make much sense you don't even gotta say who ordered you to go and clean up i know anyway so since even our brass's fingers are all over this i gotta take it to internal they won't do a thing either not to me they'll put you in their sights though just go home ward get some sleep find all this easier to take in in the morning i mean that's my plan [ __ ] should have fed him some lettuce and goodbye only way to be sure maybe it is but it's not my wavy holt's murdered ryan wanted his seat all this tritest motive in the book that's why i believe it use the ncpd to cover his tracks even if that's what happened don't have any solid proof got a bd that somebody spiked just got to figure out who and that i think i could do taking this to internal affairs got enough to get this case reopened do it and you gonna report back to the paralysis yep okay i'm gonna stay observe a little thanks me so about ryan got a pretty good idea what happened great come by please it's a sensitive matter i'd rather discuss it face to face we'll be waiting so we're upstairs thanks just gonna tell you one thing probably gonna be more than one but all right don't tell them nothing don't get involved this muck is deeper than you think suck you in if you're not careful if i don't give them something they're not going to pay me we'll manage without that there's no sense in which you got to eat fine do whatever the [ __ ] you want not like you listen anyway hello v please come in make yourself at home jefferson will join us shortly please have a seat thank you good to see you v elizabeth tells me you have answers for us i'm all ears case is pretty complex leaves a lot of questions unanswered i'd rather not draw any conclusions yet but you must have an opinion jeff honey read between the lines the case is complicated but dying at home of a cardiac malfunction that's not complicated so we were right yes and that's enough for me we have to be careful very careful jeff that's what v is trying to tell us thanks for your help v your feet you two watch out for each other hey there now where did we leave off careful please right we'll return to this later are you still there and the conference did you manage will we be in city hall no no no jeff was a council person until very recently he has just as much of a right to use that space as ryan get it done today we are not pushovers we are not going away the conference will be at city hall m you
