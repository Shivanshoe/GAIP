hello craig said we'd do this tomorrow i like to get a jump on things well i don't you'll have to come back tomorrow right okay i'm sorry hey craig no sorry it just it looks like we're gonna have to run something else on the cover i don't know uh maybe the expressionist piece you know what i think i can make today work are you sure you're here no moment like the present thank you craig never mind we're good let's get started look around and familiarize yourself with the items i'll be waiting by the baku statue when you're ready to begin can do fist cut peter opened like a pork sausage with this the first time they fought pete got away collapsed in my yard half dead and i had to steal my dad's car to drive him to the er the first of many nurse mj moments too many i remember when fisk started illegally importing artifacts like this he bought the local harbor to cover his tracks and laid off the old staff including my dad i wish dad was here now to see how the tables have turned i can't get over this image so much tension between these two figures let me know when you're ready to begin sounds good starting with the prize a one-of-a-kind kakemon baku beautiful it's a mufune correct mr fisk has exceptional taste did you know him well before his arrest in a professional context i handled many of his sales let's move on please now this exquisite piece exemplifies the traditional tarashikomi puddled ink effect the two neo are so imposing i can see why fisk liked this piece definitely his style he loved the duality destruction screams but creation toils in silence was there ever anything irregular in any of the sales you handled for him no no of of course not not that i was aware of notice the intricate gold inlay on this ceremonial tea set it's just a friend in the da's office mentioned that fisk used art sales to launder stolen goods i'm sure i wouldn't know anything about that oh i know i was just wondering now that he's arrested if you had ever noticed anything strange you know what i'm actually running short of time why don't we grab the cover photo while we can when i told my da friend i was doing a piece on you he mentioned your name was familiar just the photo please stand right there are you sure there's nothing you'd like to say maybe off the record regarding fisk's activities i don't think your readers would have any interest in damn it wait here please wait i recognize that statue craig i'll call you back my dear i think it's time for you to go oh um could i use the restroom real quick fine follow me thank you this this is a really lovely space it is and this will be the last time you see it the ladies is around the corner be quick of course be right back hello craig funny you should call because the reporter you sent is clearly not working the puff piece we agreed upon no she's here now i've got to get into that back room if that statue is what i think it is this just turned into a huge story what do you mean he had schedule if she's not your reporter who is she craig who is in my auction house oh my god no i do not trust you to fix this well the first thing pete told me about this fisk used it to hide evidence why didn't the cops take it i know this statue opens but how he's holding something that's the neo behind them but it looks different something's in one of his hands what is that she certainly is cozy with fisk statue can move most common pose is latent power mouth closed left arm down right palm facing forward hmm maybe these pieces move nice so close i've seen these before [Music] that's it norman osborne what is this devil's breath what is devil's what the excuse me sir you you can't beat not good where's the statue in in there about one ginseng i was on my way to the exit when i saw you you're lucky to be alive this is the guy i saved five minutes ago listen whoever these masked guys are they're after this vial but i'll never get it out of here while the place is swarming with them right okay um you hide back there i take out the bad guys you make a break when it's clear sounds like a plan good to see you pete yeah you too not exactly how i pictured us meeting again though honey it's exactly how i pictured it [Music] did she change her perfume focus pete focus yes all right of course should clear these guys out before i push forward okay pete i'm hidden near the front give the word and i'll make a break for it will do how about that file what's in it that these guys want so bad notes on something called devil's breath fisk was hired to build a secret research lab for it not clear what devil's breath is but it seemed to scare fisk he compares it to pandora's box not much shook fisk we need to get you and that file out of here hang tight there we go that's all of them no let me go mj stop no hide [Music] not cool with the hostage taking guys what is up with that glowy stuff on your hands are you guys ghosts never fought a ghost before [Music] huh [Music] was a workout huh looks antique i think i know someone who could help track down where this came from a job for later i just talked to craig you are not the reporter he was sending you don't even work for heritage arts never said i did hi mary jane watson daily bugle you you will not write a word of what you saw for the record what do you know about the file those masked men stole that i don't what about the long history of stolen goods fisk has laundered at this auction house your editor will be hearing from our attorney mix like the last six months never happened since when did mix become italian i have no idea but i'm still glad he makes these fries totally best in city so how's the grind at the bugle hmm well yeah well i just got an all-caps text from robbie about my so-called antics tonight so it looks like i'll be meeting with a legal team again uh as soon as you read the article you're gonna write guaranteed promotion so creepy mask guys what's your take just another night in the city it's your take i feel like there's a bigger story there let's not make this all about business how's how's it going with you did did you get that promotion no but we're on the cusp of something really big you know oscorp would hire you in a heartbeat right one phone call to him sure but dr octavius's work will help millions i'm right where i want to be right where i should be almost sounds like it's more important than your other job i've never heard you talk like that before a lot can change in six months why did you ask me here pete you know just uh just dinner between friends friends was that what we are well maybe we could be you know if that's what you wanted there's a lot of baggage here yeah sure but is that so bad i mean baggage can carry good things too like uh like money and keys raspberry lip balm do you remember why we broke up this is a trick question isn't it saved by the siren talk to you later go [Music] love seeing you two together again you always were my favorites [Music] uh hey it's me what's with the units heading down third looks like our old friend herman schultz is at it again shocker didn't he just get paroled yeah well i guess it didn't take no worries herman's just a big cupcake i'll have him back in rikers by bedtime just had dinner with my ex after saving her from masked criminals and now i'm gonna go beat up a maniac who uses shock waves to rob people what a perfectly normal life you have peter parker peter i just want to make sure you haven't left any equipment you built for your friend around the lab it's no bother to me but if the grand committee stops by again don't worry doc i make a point not to leave anything there but i know my friend appreciates you looking out for him there's a lot of people who don't like him very much that buffoon jameson and his audience of sheep please the people who do great things in this world are those who don't let bullies like him stand in their way people like us you said a mouthful doc take care [Music] 10 10 the witness called in a narcotic fail incident is active in dutch tiles over [Music] hi herman seriously that's what you said last time i don't want to you wow let's consider it pull hurt what's the money for herman what do you care actually i don't i'm just trying but this could be so much more rewarding if we connected on an emotional level wait i forgot you don't have emotions come on herman at least talk to me so we can make it interesting gotcha now let's talk i said i've [Music] done noted [Music] honestly herman why are you robbing again you know the police are watching your every move i mean we all know you're kind of dumb but i didn't think you were this dumb you must be desperate which means you're not just stealing for yourselves you must be working with someone or for someone you can tell me who it is now or make me punch it out of you later it's your choice enough back [Music] you know what herman that's like zero personality but your suit is awesome can we talk design details maybe later good work spider-man did you learn anything about his motive i tried but he's not very talkative plus i think he hates me you have that effect on a lot of people but you love me right yuri i tolerate you wow that might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me [Music] looks like i got some free time maybe now's a good time to look into that mask oh it's mj hey mj you're up late just catching up on the news looks like you had quite an adventure with shocker tonight yeah he was unusually combative anyway thanks again for dinner what do i owe you how about a favor you still have that mask from the gallery yeah i'm actually on my way to the feast center now to ask martin lee about it martin lee why he has a degree in dart history if anyone knows about the origins of that mask he will just keep me in the loop like i said i think there's a bigger story here and i plan to be the one to break it up sure so i can call you like whenever yeah whenever whatever so i guess we're talking again cool almost morning mr lee will be here soon i could use a snack mr lee's usually in his office now i could patch these shoes they'll last a while i never used to feel safe at the other shelter peter what can i do for you i'm sorry to bother you mr lee i have a friend mary jane she's a reporter she's doing a story on art imports and she found this piece well she wanted an expert opinion on it and i know you have a degree and this might be the first time i actually get to use it let's see what you have interesting where'd she find it i'm really not sure what what is it a replica of an antique chinese opera mask i haven't seen one in years symbol here roughly translates to demon demon my father read me ghost stories with that mask and symbol in it when i was young scared the hell out of me peter listen that mask it's it could be connected to dangerous people mary jane might want to find a different story do you think she's in trouble i don't know why i take the risk hey the symbol inside the mask means demon it really spooked mr lee never seen him like that he even said you should drop the story fat chance do you think mr lee knows more than he's letting on no i think he just had a weird flashback or something i know his childhood was pretty traumatic yeah that makes sense demons huh catchy name okay gotta get writing see you soon well that went about as well as i could have hoped up got some time to kill before doc needs me at the lab let's do a little spidey workout in the city [Music] peter mr lee spoke to me he seemed worried are you into something dangerous oh it's just a story mary jane's investigating don't worry i'll make sure she's careful please tell me you two are back together we're talking again baby steps i hope i didn't upset mr lee he's just concerned i was actually touched by how concerned i knew he liked you he admires how dedicated you are to helping others i think you remind him of himself when

stations that could benefit the public now i launched them but now that i'm away oscorp's going to shut them down unless they prove their value i was hoping you could watch them i left details in each one thanks man as long as they're here it's like a part of my mom is too well it's not gonna pay the bills but it sounds like it means a lot to him i've got a couple stations measuring air pollution the idea is to catch the um what's the word contaminants before they reach toxic levels between you and me i think oscorp wants this to fail because it might show they're polluting the amount of polycyclic hydrocarbons in the air is way too high and rising if it keeps getting worse people could die the particles are concentrating in trouble spots like mini clouds of smog i'll swing through them and get samples then trace them to the source nasty as they are i gotta swing right through those clouds for these clouds to be visible to the naked eye that level of toxins must be up there i'm getting some good stuff well good samples of bad stuff anyway got it feels like i'm breathing from a tailpipe the toxins coming from two types of cars and a faulty smoke stack i better get photos best smoke stack picture i ever took great light on that one perfect the department of environmental protection will take it from here maybe i should make a green spider costume for earth day well harry station just stopped the public health crisis oscorp's gonna have a hard time arguing it's not useful spiderman shocker has escaped and now he's robbing a bank on east 31st what happened i thought he was behind bars he was but one of the guards just walked up to his cell and released him then gave him his suit back i knew shocker was working for someone what did you get out of the guard wish i could ask him but he's dead whoever made him release shocker didn't want any loose ends damn looking at the security footage the guard was in some kind of trance and it might have been the lighting but it looked like his eyes were glowing well that's creepy okay i'll see what i can get out of shocker when i get to the bank peter i've been looking into the demons sounds like they've quietly established a power base in the vacuum left by fisk a vacuum i created by putting fisk away jameson was right the demons are my fault what were you supposed to do let fist keep god fathering are you

do with him i'm sorry jeff i'm busy what's up have you started looking for martin lee yet no i told you i can't start a manhunt based on a hunch from spiderman but i'm telling you he's the guy get me some solid evidence and we'll talk solid evidence right hey it's me hey so what are you thinking i'm thinking i screwed up and that kid lost his father i know you too well to say you should give yourself a break what about the police do they have any leads on leaks they're not even looking for him even yuri doesn't believe me then it's up to us to find him i've been doing some research go to this address martin lee bought a controlling interest in this recycling center last year you think he's hiding out there maybe we know he's not a feast if he's not at the recycling center maybe he'll find some evidence as to where he might be yeah good work mj i'll let you know what i find oh one more thing i talked to the detective about questioning the arrested demons they're all claiming martin lee has the power to quote corrupt people corrupt what does that mean they say it's sort of like mind control it brings out the negative part of you makes you do things you wouldn't normally do hmm sounds a little far-fetched this is coming from a guy who can run up walls mj's hunch was right police is crawling with demons gotta take these guys out then have a look around foreign okay that's all of them maybe if i can find where it gets its power from looks like i could override the circuit i need my electric webs well that did something it looks like the circuits need a little more juice there looks like the circuit's still stable maybe there's another junction box close by gotcha almost there one more box to do uh huh that's it [Music] oh man lots of high-tech equipment maybe later i can recycle this stuff into some weapons of my own these must be where they're planning to attack wait these are osborne campaign offices all the paths originate from the same address guns from fisk's armory truck bombs this is crazy explosives from fisk's construction site this wasn't a gang war the demons were stealing from fisk to go after mayor osborne hey did you find lee no but you were right lee's using this place as a front for the demons bomb making gun running oh my god and it looks like they're planning another attack this time on norman osborn's campaign offices we must have some kind of beef with norman osborne i found an address here i think it's their staging area if i hurry i might be able to stop them be careful it's me make it quick i'm busy getting yelled at by my boss martin lee and the demons are planning another attack this time on norman osborn's campaign offices are you sure we've had a lot of false leads in the past week trust me on this one i'm sending you the address of a recycling center you'll find all the evidence there got it i'll get those campaign offices evacuated but if you're wrong about this you're gonna help me find a new job [Music] so [Music] consolidated shipping a lot of guys i should try to do this quietly but also with style [Music] woof [Music] so oh foreign please not out here better check inside huh invoice from an auto shop pale horse rides that's one expensive tune-up what else can i find around here they have bases all around the city this is bigger than i thought looks like the demons have an army [Music] as if one deadly growing whip wasn't enough [Music] i don't know what i was expecting but it was definitely not this hey mj i think i stopped the demon's attack on osborne's campaign offices nice did you finally no but i found something we should look into a place called pale horse ride sounds familiar i'll check it out and get back to you coffee silver bird we're descending to location there's another one safety's off well this is new no no no this one's mine all right i'm executing this sonofa hey that's not how we do things down town code sm-1 whoa whoa before we do this who the hell are you guys code sm-1 code sm-1 holding for orders copy code sm1 i have a visual pull for silverburn ah [Music] nice entrance solid eight out of ten out of ten release him he works with us yuri explanation please this is silver sablinova head of stable international a private security force paid for by mayor osborne oh the mayor has a pet army now next time you get in my way i will not be so gentle go we'll talk later hey sorry about that stable thing i should have told you earlier but it all happened so fast it's okay we're still best buds we're not best buds well that took a dark turn anyway sable has the mayor's ear and unchecked authority we've searched that address you gave me found plenty of evidence of a bomb plot but nothing that leads back to martin sorry about that yuri any progress on the martin lee angle anyway sable has the mayor's ear and unchecked authority we've searched that address you gave me found plenty of evidence of a bomb plot but nothing that leads back to martin lee i'm working on that peter so if you're running this place while mr lee's out of town who's doing your old job me but i could always use more help you know anyone actually i do his name is miles morales why does that sound familiar his father was being honored at city hall oh i talked to him at the funeral he's a smart kid he's just having a tough time i knew a boy like that once i remember it helped to uh stay busy might help him too here's his mom's number thanks i'll give her a call hey you haven't heard from mr lee have you no why i'm just curious i've got a few minutes before work i'm gonna look around see if there's anything else i can do to help you out oh you don't have to i know i want to i should check out lee's office pete glad to see you're okay this office is locked how do i get in there quietly i don't feel safe huh never seen that room before whoa what the high voltage lines what needs this much power there i understand but the account number is in mr lee's office which lee's journal a key wonder where the lock is that room i saw from the crawl space it should be right on the other side of the shrine looks like this note is for me huh the shrine in the photo is missing the picture hmm some kind of puzzle lock that seems right oh i see yes wow what are you hiding lee can feel my power growing feeding off my anger father would say i've lost the path of balance that he could never understand the only way to fight a monster is to become one whoa this is the folder mj found at the auction house this might help us figure out what lee's planning next yeah it's a burn room wired to destroy evidence one more the police had found this or may i want to think of what could have happened hello peter mr lee i thought you were out of town did you find what you were looking for martin you're back can get that thank you and heading off again shortly i'm afraid just needed a few things from my office you must have heard about city hall yes tragic peter was there he was very lucky and an osborne rally i didn't know you were a fan well what matters is you are both safe amen but the bombers are still out there who knows what they've planned next oh i don't think you or may have anything to worry about as long as you stay away from places you're not supposed to be well i should go when will you be back when my work is done wait i finally got your evidence head to the feast center in chinatown what am i going to find a nice lady named mae parker and some really weird stuff hidden in lee's office but listen he's got another attack planned where when still working on that but i think he's going to use something called devil's breath sounds destructive what is it a substance created by ozcorp probably a bioweapon of some kind i have a folder full of info on it i'm holding on to it for now i'll send copies as soon as i can okay we'll check his office if the evidence stands up i'll put out an apb mj hey just checking in peter hey can i call you back i think you'll want to hear this wait why are you whispering just in the middle of something how about we catch up over dinner my place oh sure i'll even cook cool see us wait remember how you told me about lee's corrupting touch i think i just saw it in action how some perfectly nice homeless people just jumped me thing is they had glowing eyes and i remembered yuri telling me something similar about the guard who released shocker so shocker was working for lee it's all connected there's more but i guess we'll talk about it at dinner yeah see ya dinner huh what should i cook hi doctor how are you parker exciting news come by the lab uh like now this is my defining moment can't wait to show you cool um i've got dinner plans can i come by later dinner can wait you need to see this peter uh okay be right there i wonder if this means i have a job hey doctor hello peter i'll be just a minute wow look at all this new stuff we really need to get better about organizing our workspace where did you get all this equipment called in every last favor took out a few loans it's like we're starting over once again but this time's going to be different you've been busy just getting started you know until now we've been looking at prosthetics from the wrong perspective why restore people to what they were when we can make them better okay i think that should do it you ready [Music] everything okay damn it this is all your fault norman you said well i know who you're not voting for in the next election sorry i have a habit of making bad jokes intense situations uh it was a good joke parker just a bit of an overreaction on my part no don't worry why don't you take a break i'll uh i'll clean this up and uh get us ready for another test [Music] so uh hope you don't mind me asking but it seems you and norman have a bit of a history we were lab partners in college became friends decided to start a business we both had visions of changing the world just in different ways wait you were at ozcorp when it started i'm half the reason it's called oscorp in grad school everyone called us the o's add corp to that and well it is a catchy name but why'd you leave norman became more and more obsessed with genetics he started a project i considered unethical and there was this anyway lawyers got involved i chose to leave in exchange for a settlement but that money didn't last very long i've relied on grants ever since if this project doesn't work don't worry it'll work uh let me let me just fix this up i'll brew some fresh coffee be sure to run a diagnostic on the control unit could be a short huh no good gotta reroute this circuit [Music] [Music] oh why don't you do the honors this time i think we did it next step neural interface that's a lot of work for you to do by yourself sure you can handle it apparently not judging by today's debacle because i still haven't found another job my funds are still i know it's okay don't worry i'll figure it out what's a few bucks when you're trying to change the world right to changing the world i missed a call from mj doctor i need to go but i'll be back later don't worry the work will still

so what's the boss doing with the money from this lead job easy does it what kind of vehicle needs tires this big where is it i swear i left it over here that guy's not going anywhere maybe i can distract him what is this some kind of military hardware office must be to my right need to move careful through here those barrels seem important why is it what's in these  come on tombstone you're right rick won't notice won't be there god damn it accent i'll fix it ah you got some stones rick let's see if they break [Music] such a disappointment [Music] [Music] and now i need a new welder

we go gps trackers what is tombstone using these for all right boys time to move get the gear from my office time to go okay i want to say don't ever do that again but since i know you're going to anyway here take a few of those next time nice thanks you know tombstone is crazy and pretty much invincible right everybody has their weakness mine is whatever you're cooking right now smells amazing the chicken curry uh just needs some time to simmer no dumplings i hope you're never gonna let me live that one down are you nope the great dumpling catastrophe i still can't believe they evacuated the entire building i went in january too your neighbors hated me yeah they were pretty happy when we broke up yeah so let's talk about what you found in lee's office well lee clearly has issues with norman osborn yeah but but why i don't know yet but his next move looks like it involves devil's breath whatever that is yeah i'll dig into it so i was thinking what if we teamed up wait you want to be my sidekick like a spider girl spider woman no woman no not a sidekick a partner oh not again hey it's your crime system thingy looks like a residential break-in charles standish hmm that sounds familiar oh oscorp cfo wait you don't think this has anything to do with lee do you sorry to cook and run did did you just leave your clothes on the kitchen floor ah where do you want me to uh the couch is fine dad see you later yeah hey it's me this curry is legit so what do we know about charles standish let's see chief financial officer at oscorp single known for his art collection if lee's after him it's got to be related to devil's breath i'll run a search on everything in that file let me know the second you find something i think lee might be planning something even worse than city hall so are we partners now because it sure feels like we are partners sounds good okay see ya partner police look like they could use some help [Music] [Music] somebody was in a hurry spiderman you're hurt i'm okay but you gotta find mr standish fast those guys in the masks kidnapped him and forced him up to his place he lives in the penthouse top floor okay sit tight huh so glad you're here i can't find my car could have sworn i parked on this level uh um [Music] wait you guys work here too this building is serious about parking enforcement [Music] good fight hey for effort elevator won't work they know i'm here but maybe i can sneak up through the elevator shaft i may finish it should be able to make it up to the penthouse from here [Music] ding ding okay almost there stay out of the light nice and easy [Music] how there's standish okay now what enter your password [Music] he sounds nervous i should take him out shhh we're eating good one peter hey foreign m [Music] [Music] sleep it off okay all clear hope standish is all right [Music] let's try this again it's safe now what were they after just financial records about devil's breath how do you know about that why do they want it i don't even know what it is mr osborn's been pouring money into it for years but he keeps the whole project a secret i'm the only one who has any record of it not anymore looks like they copied some records to a secure server payroll information on a dr isaac delaney who is he i honestly don't know come on come on wait the elevator hold on i almost got him try to fall slower [Music] you okay yeah i think so good good you know as elevator chefs go this is pretty nice hey yuri you okay yeah but i didn't get much out of standish before these sable guys stepped in and told me to back off what's the deal i get the sense all they care about is keeping him quiet because he knows about devil's breath right whatever the hell that is i'm working on that i think i just got a lead a lead you sound like a cop don't you mean spider cop [Music] uh yuri that's fair what happened with standish he's safe okay good and the demons they were looking for a name you got a pen yes go dr isaac delaney okay who is he what's his deal i was hoping you could tell me i'm honest just give me a few oh and before i forget you left that tracker from tombstones at my place i'll drop it at dr octavius's lab let you know what i find on delaney do we have an update on the situation in clinton i'll post x-ray under attack it's the demons stable teams this is control what's our status in times square apc under fire repeat we are taking fire hey do you have time to check something out for me no but if you ask nicely just got a call about a suspicious looking box on a rooftop in hell's kitchen i could call in the bomb squad but if it's just some kid's science project yeah i know budget crisis yadda yadda so will you please check it out there's the magic word i hope it's some kid's science project man i miss those days school projects are so much easier than real life projects hmm looks military great weird spider-man so you found one of my recon points who is this wrong question the correct one is can you stop the bombs i've planted mystery man's got recon points spread all over this computer's tracking bombs around the district and they're about to go off i gotta move i don't have much time one more better hurry so close to perfection nice work with the bombs but you made it to your throat too much hurts the accuracy is this some kind of sick game to you games are for kids and i'm a professional and i get paid like it guess your client wasted their money sometimes information's worth more than money and i've learned plenty watching you mj what did you find out about isaac delaney check out the picture i just sent which one is delaney i don't know i guess you'll have to go to the party to find out good thing i already have a costume [Music] [Music]

michaels [Music] thank you [Music] uh [Music] so hmm that's all of them gotta find lee [Applause] [Music] stop them from hurting each other what did lee do to these people [Music] not that guy again [Music] apology don't be okay later yuri i need your help i've got reports of shots fired at dsu yeah that's me i'll explain later but right now you need to find a dr morgan michaels martin lee's coming after him copy that spider-man who is this dr michaels i think he's the head scientist on this devil's breath project did you find him yes and no sable says they have him under protection at a safe house somewhere in the city but they won't tell me where i thought you guys were working together so did i okay i have an idea on how to find him i'll let you know if it works attention hey did you find dr delaney at the party yeah but so did lee oh no what happened lee corrupted him and made him kill himself that's horrible we have to stop this guy we will before delaney died he gave lee a name morgan michaels morgan michaels how is he i'm not sure but i bet he works on the devil's breath project have you learned anything from that devil's breath file yeah get this a few years ago osbourne came to fisk and asked him to build a lab but to keep it hits from regulators secret lab for devil's breath if it's as dangerous as we think it is i can see why where's the lab that's not in the file osborne destroy all records of it all i have are invoices from osborne's personal account to fist construction knowing fisk he kept the invoices around for blackmail material on the mayor everything leads back to norman osborn guess it's time to pay him a visit i doubt he's gonna tell you anything i wasn't planning to ask okay that's how i can get into norman's office can't get in there without shutting down some security systems but if they see me they'll put the whole place on lockdown i should be able to hack into the security network modules from the outside they're the network cables just need to follow them to the security module looks like there's four of these around the building that should make things easier what the hell security teams call in stable team alpha standing by looks like an electrical problem copy that keep an eye on the exterior while we try to track down the issue just when i thought it would be easy all stable teams looks like we have some sort of software problem we're calling in a specialist copy that continuing exterior sweep what all agents someone's taking control of one of our subsystems initiating delta protocol man everybody's got drones these days stable teams i need a status report exterior sweep negative we are all clear still look like a software issue we don't know we're evaluating please maintain current alert level attention all stable teams there's a small possibility we have a trespasser on site damn it another subsystem is going offline i need a team to scan the 85th floor exterior copy control bird inbound gotta move hi mj little busy right now i'll be quick listen i gotta lead on charles standish's location i think if i can get to him i can make him talk he knew about dr delaney he probably knows about morgan michaels as well okay just don't do anything crazy nice now i can get into norman's office and hopefully find out more about morgan michaels and devil's breath exterior sweep negative should we go on lockdown not yet mr osborne is in the middle of an important call but keep tracking there must be someone out there hold on switching to a secure line i'm way ahead of you wilson i had my people go through all your files if you try to expose our business arrangement it'll be your word against mine and i'm not the one behind bars right now wait is norman talking to wilson fisk neo statue what are you talking about the neo statue from the auction house they must be talking about that file mj found who has the file we do norman but it doesn't tell us enough which is why i'm doing some slightly illegal but morally acceptable bne right now jackpot gr27 hmm dr morgan michaels is the chief scientist but the location of the lab is redacted ai controlled crispr if that actually works it could cure any genetic disease cystic fibrosis huntington's this is crazy [Music] creepy whoa gr-27 is devil's breath it's designed to cure diseases but in its current form it's like a bioweapon dr michaels keeps the only sample with him at all times that's why lee wants him we find michaels we find devil's breath hey pete what's up mj get this devil's breath wasn't designed to be a weapon it's a treatment for genetic disorders but its current form is wildly imperfect in trying to fix the body it rips it apart we need to locate dr michaels i don't trust sable to contain something this deadly i may have a lead on that charles standish is being held at stable central park compound if anyone knows michael's location it'll be ozcorp's cfo i'm trying to reach him now reach him that place is crawling with guards how are you trying to reach him very very quietly gotta go partner sneaking into a sable compound that could go bad fast i should head to central park all units officers are pinned down by hostels and masks reported location is near the theater district looks like doc checked it peter i've had an epiphany it's all about the mind take me for example a mind of unlimited potential shackled to a tired old body think of what that mind could achieve if it were freed in developing our neural interface we need to think beyond replicating the tired putterings of our physical forms instead reach into imagination and possibility reach into the mind i've never heard doc this excited by a project i hope he's not too excited where are you mj crap reach him that place is crawling with guards how are you trying to reach him very very quietly gotta go partner stand is just somewhere in there gotta get past that guard time to see if these lures pete gave me work that gap at the fence looks promising just need to distract the guard house guest must be standish he's here somewhere what's that demons are killing anyone related to devil's breath standish is in real danger got it time to move standish i knew it i've got to get to that tent standish insecure ma'am lock out calms as well i do not want leaks to press about michael's or as soon as boss gives the word we'll give michael's move to the new safe house they're moving him have to find out where before we lose our shot get that truck go coco charlie are both on deck for dr michael's relocation man add two more units he carries the only sample of devil's breath i will not be responsible for pandemic looks important no not in frame there's dandish's tent can't believe michael's just carries devil's safe houses if dr michaels is in one of these standish might know which one nothing sector's clear almost there continuing sector sweep oh [Music] charles standish holy crap charles where is dr morgan michaels please sent you didn't he no [Music] he wants to kill me he told him to do it do it himself i'm not with the demons i'm not with sable i'm a reporter and i want to see lee stopped just like you what i've heard your byline stable won't listen to me she has michael's in the bowery they're moving him to a new safe house tomorrow at noon but she's totally ignoring grand central grand central the demons were talking about it when they held me they're going there to get to get what charles what are the demons need to get at grand central definitely not a stable guy sorry charlie okay time to go no he knows something [Music] well that was maybe the most awkward swing in my life mj is not happy hey okay another thing sorry charlie you knock a man out destroy my background research and the best you've got is sorry charlie is everything a joke to you what mk no i screwed up it was a tension breaker pension breaker right you know this is exactly why we broke up i thought we broke up so you could focus on your career we broke up because you wouldn't stop treating me like a baby don't do this mj don't do that mj oh that's too dangerous mj it may not have super spider powers but i'm not made out of glass you snuck into the middle of an armed military you know what can we not do this right now please did you learn anything about dr michaels fine michaels is in the bowery somewhere sable's moving in tomorrow at him awesome anything else was he saying something about grand central before i jumped in he was no it was nothing listen i gotta go peter filing deadline peter that's how you know she's still mad peter nice work mr superhero peter i'm about to begin another test oh sorry my bus broke down and there were no cabs but i'll be there as soon as i can hey sorry i'm late morning parker or is it evening that doesn't matter check the neurosensors would you we need a faster response time on it try to get it under three milliseconds [Music] okay looks like i could optimize this power relay [Music] [Music] [Music] this [Music] nice okay what next looks like some impedance in this neurosensor circuit [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] finished [Music] signal to noise is out of whack a new signal processor should reduce lag [Music] i got it doc 2.8 milliseconds good work peter so [Music] yes [Music] [Music] i'd call that a mild success i call that unbelievable do you need some help yes doctor what's going on it's become that obvious my doctors call it a degenerative neurological disorder probably caused by overexposure to toxic chemicals in my reckless youth sorry is is there anything i can do you already are the worst part is it only affects the muscles the mind continues to work but it can no longer do you're the only one who knows peter i'd like to keep it that way of course uh if you'd like to seek a position with more of a future i i came here to work for you because of what you've got up here that's not going anywhere so neither am i oh peter before i forget i read the most fascinating article outlines possible next steps for the neural interface i'll take a look thanks doc man i remember the first day i interviewed here showed up with stains on my shirt 10 minutes late from stopping a mugging still can't believe doc hired me i hope he doesn't regret it now hmm direct interface with the basal ganglia exciting but risky i don't know doc you'll need a gallium silk array to make it work even then odds of injury are pretty high gallium genius never mind the risks we'll work them out in time doc's really sick at this rate he'll lose control of his motor functions within a year and if we're not careful an intracranial implant could make things even worse even alter his personality we need to proceed carefully peter is starting to suspect he hides it but i can tell he's seen my twitch noticed the decay of my fine motor control well i'm the one who wanted a genius for an assistant of course he knows i just need more time my work can improve millions of lives save millions of lives it can also save my own i just need more time um doc i'm sorry my aunt just texted no worries peter i was thinking of taking a break myself as soon as i check our telemetry data thanks i'll be back in a few hours [Music] hi mei let me guess running late nope i'm actually on my way now have you heard

my mind it was a shame so many had to die with no heroes to save them that officer saved your life didn't he he was here because of you and norman wanted to use him a futile and where was norman during all this slinking away like a rat he knew what was going to happen and he fled norman is a hidden cancer on this city he must be excised with no trace of his corruption to return norman hides behind his mask of lies i will break it apart and drag him into the light put on the mask become one of us thanks but no thanks one way or the other you will join me all the souls you've lost the innocent victims you couldn't save martin their blood is on your hands you can stop oswald you have so much strength i can give will their bodies filled the gutters and you did nothing i can't see

superhero you think you save people but you just make it worse this is your fault my fault he was under your protection do you really need two of those stop we need to brief mr osborne now i'll go with her thank you i'll remember this not getting much coverage i should look for more towers to activate yuri tell me you've got a lead on martin lee's location we have footage from a guy at a coffee shop looks like he hopped into a black sedan after the crash black sedan great let me finish we have a partial plate and one of my patrol guys just found a matching plate black sedan in a parking lot near canal and hudson you're a good cop yuri i'm on my way spider-man hello is this working dr michaels how are you calling borrowed one of sable's radios transit hubs are the most likely release points for devil's breath airports bus terminals train stations it'll spread like wildfire from there why the hell is ozcorp developing a fire weapon in the city shouldn't this be an antarctic bunker devil's breath is personal for norman it's been his obsession for decades the project breaks every state and federal regulation on the books but he doesn't care if the city finds out he can kiss re-election goodbye never mind re-election he'd be tried in the hague for war crimes why are you telling me all this aren't you just as culpable as norman yes completely but lee's actions have been a wake-up call we've ignored the project's risk for too long i trust you spider-man you're the only one trying to do the right thing please protect the city from our mistakes damn devil's breath is gone i should call mj and warner this is mary jane watson please leave a detailed message and i'll get back to you as soon as i can what are you up to now mj stander said the demons are looking for something at gct but what could they possibly need here should probably call peter and let him know what i'm doing actually scratch that he'd probably just tell me to go home and change myself to my laptop i'll just check things out quick and let him know what i find this gaia microbe dispersal device releases specially formulated microbes into the atmosphere and in turn leaves our oceans and rivers cleaner than when man first walked the earth mr lee this will be easier for everyone if you remain calm and do as i say police over here no um i would like to speak to mayor osborne who's calling the man he is looking for what do you want i want you at grand central terminal in 30 minutes by yourself or there'll be more blood on your hands hmm mj i'm on my way are you hurt no i'm fine just hurry going as fast as i can what are you doing at gct i'll explain later listen lee's going to release the devil's breath you've got to get out of there he's not going to do it until norman osborne gets here wait this must have been lee's plan all along make norman responsible by forcing him to release the devil's breath himself sort of makes sense in a twisted psychotic way okay i'm here coming into the terminal now anything i should be on the lookout for he's i have a family please don't hurt looks like he's got some drones patrolling i guess he's prepared for you don't worry i'm in the ventilation system can you see a safe exit point southwest corner on my way if i get any closer the drones will spot me see that tablet i'm looking at that controls the drones you think you can snag it yes if you can distract them and not get shot i'm ready tell me when okay i'm ready incoming okay move wait listen i'm a reporter i have a direct line to mayor osborne i can help make sure he arrives on time how first let move they're coming jump over the railings oh drones get to cover you still got that tablet yeah better work fast okay i got this come on come on almost there they did it good job now let's get you out of here about the devil's breath i'll come back for it now we're partners remember can we argue later if we don't help those people they could die so could you i can't let that happen no no i got myself into this i'm getting myself out what do you mean you got yourself into this i don't like this there's too many of them then let's start taking him out quietly that did it grab him see if you can break up that group i'm gonna try and separate them do it mj did you know lee would be here not exactly what do you mean i thought something might happen but not like this why didn't you tell me i thought we were partners hey partners trust each other peter what do you mean i trust you yeah when i'm sitting at home behind a laptop oh come on can we please get

transit points throughout the city police and stable agents continue to battle with rikers and raft escapees meanwhile mayor osborne has gone on record blaming spider-man for the prison break and city-wide sickness and branding him a fugitive but he has yet to provide evidence and many believe the mayor is just deflecting blame since an exclusive report by the bugle revealed that this disease originated in a secret unregulated oscorp laboratory here in manhattan mayor osborne insists that oscar turn it off but has not provided any further evidence to support this claim [Music] dr octavius why how did i let this happen i just got a call from the hospital they said you went awol i need to get back to work the doctor said you still have 14 broken bones which means i have 192 non-broken

sherlock show me what you got in this watershed mortgage board city feels a little more under control miles is watching feast mj is tracking at devil's breath cure time for me to focus on finding otto stopping whatever he has planned yuri we need to start tracking the big boys still no leads on octavius no nothing forensics can't even do a sweep of times square everyone in that department but the intern is sick i might be able to turn something up let you know what i find you know what i like about you kid you're always getting better gee thanks creepy stalker guy you can call me taskmaster because you keep leaving me tasks that's kinda on the nose there's a group of mercenaries committing crimes across the city these mercenaries wouldn't happen to be your mercenaries would they no all i know is they're getting paid well for their work unless you stop them that is what's in it for you i get to watch and learn spider-man here to lend a hand thought you might need one officer you don't know the half of it never seen anything like this devil's breath stuff forensics is having a hell of a time news reports say this is where otto released hmm some residue on this sign maybe i can isolate it [Music] a.t rich leader sequence this looks promising oscorps modified cpf1 definitely devil's breath should be able to track the dispersal path now the trail goes in a few directions i need to find the right one vapor trail heads up that building trail jumps between these buildings trail leads down into those vents what was otto doing up here should be a door or an access hatch around here [Music] this is moody there must be some way to hit the lights let there be light whoa was otto using this as a staging ground chaos of the prison break would have been perfect cover to move in norman i feel like i can't turn around without seeing his face he smiles for the cameras collects his accolades and keeps his booty oppressed against my neck why can't anyone else see how selfish he is how reckless how evil if only they could be made to see the norman i know the man behind the mask looks like otto's been studying sable's tech for weaknesses good old rhino my second favorite russian otto developed a corrosive to free rhino from his suit a certain government agency spent years trying and failing to do that only took otto a few days looks like otto recorded messages for his crew alexi i've followed your career with great interest the world sees you as a witness dullard i see a warrior with a poet's heart i know you desire freedom from the battle suit you're sealed inside help me achieve my goals and freedom shall be yours matt gargan aka scorpion aka crazy pants mccrazy it's rare for me to admit this mr gargan clearing your debts was more difficult than i anticipated you are in arrears to some demanding individuals but once the reservoir job is finished your financial obligations will be finished as well otto octavius is nothing if not persuasive old man vulture i've tangled with him more than anyone else here power source for vulture's wings gave him spinal cancer and otto's developing an experimental treatment to save him adrian what bitter irony that your miraculous wings should have brought such horrors on your body you are now working for me when our work is settled the treatment i've developed will cure you you won't shuffle off this mortal coil just yet my friend electro total live wire that one electro's big pipe dream is to become pure energy doc actually managed to modify his harness to get a little closer to that goal max when you first conveyed your dream to me i thought you were insane pure energy but as i dove deeper into the problem i discovered a way to give us both what we desire i promise you when we are done you will be pure energy or so close to it is to make the difference irrelevant what's this now uv bulb huh nothing happened otto must have used this map to plan but it's blank unless there's something here i'm missing it must be a way to get that lamp on there we go hidden markings otto's tasked the villains to destroy oscorp holdings throughout the city he's trying to take apart norman's empire piece by piece what's vulture doing in times square electro's disabling oscorp power plants make rhinos targeting oscorp shoreline properties which is he hitting first and why please going after the devil's breath anti-serum using something called icarus scorpion must be trying to poison the city's reservoir another oscorponed property seems like the last stage of the plan is a direct assault on oscorp and most likely norman icarus this is it hello spider-man we've never been properly introduced i'm auto there is no icarus is there no martin needs no assistance to secure the anti-serum icarus was a ruse to get you into position into position huh so refreshing to work for a man like octavius back up plans for his backup plans mj hey oh pete are you okay what's happening traffic's rough listen lee's gunning for the anti-serum we need to find oscorp's devil's breath lab before he dies on it right now i'm pulling every building permit in the city if there's a record of the lab i'll find it that's great okay yeah talk soon empty failed softened him up time for plan b [Music] [Music] that was almost heartwarming electro you really grew in prison didn't you no adrian it's me spiderman what are you babbling about nobody ever gets my jokes our longsuit ends tonight insect you thought we had a healthy give and take man if i misrepresent you spiderman i must break you you got it you got my joke i'm so happy i could almost stop fighting almost gotta be honest liked it better when you two were loners the wisdom of experience a fine pairing just like oil and water need to catch my breath take no over [Music] wow [Music] he doesn't stand a chance but i don't think you guys are assessing this situation accurately max [Music] [Music] one down one to go how many times have we done this dance adrian a dozen two dozen [Music] what's happening electro's been grounded spider-man i presume if you really cared about this city you'd be helping me expose osborne for the criminal he is by killing innocent people i would have restored the power you're sick you need help i have all the help i need and we will not stop until norman gets what he deserves [Music] i hate it when they team up just need to catch my breath [Music] what time oh man i need to update yuri yuri vulture and electro are down four to go i saw also noticed a rooftop in times square exploded wouldn't happen to be related would it nothing gets by you it was octavius's staging ground he's using the villains to pull apart oscorp vulture and electro were targeting power plants scorpions going after water treatment not sure about rhino yet something along the shoreline that's good enough to start i assume you're going after scorpions yeah city's already on the brink if we lose clean water we might never come back i'll update you when i make progress sounds like a plan [Music] [Music] i should check on miles hey pete are you okay that's what i was gonna ask you i'm fine but you and me are in the middle of it we're busy but people need help and i'd rather be doing something than waiting around for somebody else to fix things you know yeah i heard that just make sure you protect yourself masking gloves and rest there's the reservoir no sign of scorpion better take a closer look [Music] now if i was a mercenary dressed like a scorpion where would i be behind you me i'd end it now but octavius is paying and he wants to torture you which i respect [Music] damn it what did he inject me with [Music] whoa what the is that a sea of poison can't be this can't be real must be the poison but i can't take any chances gotta get to higher ground and analyze whatever he injected me with okay should be safe for a minute i need to analyze the neurotoxin so i can create an antidote scorpions made some upgrades hallucinogenic neurotoxin my brain will create nightmares that my body thinks are real i have to create the antidote fast first i need a natural steroid this extract from an eclipta alba plant should do the trick esu's greenhouse is nearby hope it's in season [Music] okay poison bad i kind of should have known that [Music] there's the greenhouse eclipta alba it should be inside the greenhouse there it is it can be both the secrets said [Music] just that hallucinations intensify you can get through this doc you sound like i did before the neural interface affected my mind my obsessions were always there but the interface allowed me to fully embrace them [Music] i have to fix this fix you somehow is [Music] i'm sorry doc i'm so sorry yes yes you're sorry and yet

synthetic atrophy gotta get there fast giant deadly scorpion tails lovely thanks brain how'd you get this number always asking the least interesting questions it's not how am i calling you am i

faith [Music] hey mj what's up you okay i'm fine combing through oscorp records hey this is random but do you remember that trip we took to staten island with harry to find the best pizza in the city yeah 10 hour odyssey for burnt toast with cold american cheese how could i forget something about all these old paws corp files made that day pop into my head harry was so excited about riding the ferry just made me think about how much simpler things were back then no jobs no super villains you could throw away a whole day looking for bad pizza just cuz it feels like if we take a nap the world will fall apart yeah this adult thing is rough but i guess the work we do means today's kids can have their own staten island adventures in safety kind of a circle of life thing circle of bad pizza yeah you're right that's a good way to look at it thanks pete calling agents in manhattanville requesting an update on your status patrol agents in manhattanville requesting an update on your status

spider-man's face off for free [Music] we could just stop now you know i won't tell anybody you know what octavius will do if he finds out you failed i failed yes you freak show [Music] a little forced together time might help you boys learn to play nice all right yuri that's four down just octavius and lee left something tells me they won't be as easy they're only half our problem though devil's breath cases are getting worse and ozcorp is being coy about an anti-serum i'm worried they're seeing dollar signs in a seller's market i'd expect nothing less from our beloved mayor leave devil's breath to me one of my best people is on it hey i've been through the city state and federal databases if this devil's breath lab does exist it's off the books the only other place i can think to look is in norman's personal vials i've already been through his office computer are you thinking his penthouse that building's full of staples man if they spot me other residents could get hurt in a firefight i know but i might be able to get in undetected i can sneak in find the last location and get out if anything goes wrong i'll call you for backup okay it's risky but we need that location
