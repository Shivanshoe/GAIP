so if Android 17 and 18 are activated do you think Vegeta will be hard to say honestly I just hope he can scrap those two before they're activated if this dr. churro built a lab in such a remote location that's not like people very much he wasn't exactly a well-respected scientist no surprise there I wonder if the genus already run into well are we close to where the lab is this dr. zero was working for the red ribbon army definitely not a good guy over there hmm looks like someone wants to die it's closed what just happened [Music] how dare you I created you you didn't create us we had lives before you ruined them listen to me you must eliminate Coco's allies they're coming that's an order do you hear that it's an order 17 we're not gonna follow a single one of your orders we're just gonna take care of ourselves now geezer there's another one what in the world is going on in there let's go I feel a lot better now hey what's that hey I don't think I've seen you before big guy what's your number 16 Android 16 huh interesting so you're an earlier model Android 16 I've never heard of an Android 16 wait so so those are the androids that dr0 was talking about Trump's can you confirm that these are the Android you originally warned us about yeah I've never seen that large one they called 16 before what at least I haven't seen him in my time so what's going on here who cares just one more hunk of scrap to add to the pile I'm going to make weight where's dr. Shiro oh the old man I took care of them good hmm all right let's go get going to where I'm not crazy about doing what dr. Shiro wants but as Androids I think we should do something so let's go kill this Goku guy hey sixteen you were created specifically to kill Goku right correct well I guess that settles it then but where are they going don't tell me they're actually gonna try to find Goku well that's what dr. gyro wanted right to kill Goku I couldn't give a damn about that Kakarot ha don't make me laugh they're going to pay for not recognizing my power [Music] [Music] it's a highway out [Music] well well I didn't expect to see you rejects roaming around in here you're going to tell me where you're going right now whether you want to or not we're off to find Goku we're gonna kill him see that's what I thought too bad that's not going to happen because I'm going to blow every one of you to pieces Yusei and sure are full of yourselves aren't you that pride of yours it's just gonna get you killed faster you know you've got quite the mouth on you for a machine Zoe's up first the punk the woman or maybe I should just scrap all three of you trash cans at once wait that's right we still haven't seen what you can do 16 why don't you fight him negative my prime directive is to eliminate only Goku wow what a letdown fine I'll do it then Vegeta are you all right so you came you're really starting to piss me off Vegeta and 18 are about to fight so back off what still just watching isn't much fun I guess I could play with you guys you know what that means you and I won't be having any interruptions hmm be warned I don't plan on going easy on you just because you're a woman [Music] [Music] [Music] got a gun [Music] that wasn't the best you can do [Music] prepare yourself [Music] idiots Johnny [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself this my junior it's all over the news no matter it's not like you're a big deal [Music] [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] prepare yourself prepare yourself [Music] [Music] maybe I shouldn't admit this but I'm actually kind of impressed you held out this long damn woman now you've done it oh I think it's time we end this little game you're about done right don't worry they're still alive you'd better hurry up though give them those Senzu beans of yours so should we get going but are we going to ask them the whereabouts of Goku nah it'll be more fun if we have to find him ourselves ah you can be such a child sometimes seventeen you know that you think so whatever I'm fine as long as we can make a stop in town my clothes are a mess I think I'm going to need a new outfit sure why not hey wait wait huh what do you want what is it that you guys are after I mean why are you doing this well first we're gonna take care of Goku I mean why are you going after Goku hey this is all just a game I mean you probably won't just stop because I asked you to write negative we were created for the sole purpose of eliminating Goku you heard the big guy yeah but shouldn't you be helping your friends instead of talking to us they're gonna die Oh see ya bye I gotta help the others so they knew all about the sense of beans and just let us go on our way they didn't even feel the need to kill us [Music] don't go after him just leave him be he'd finally become a Super Saiyan regained his pride and confidence as a warrior getting beaten that badly was probably too much for him to take even trunks who defeated Frieza so easily couldn't lay a finger on them that's it isn't it no matter how strong Goku gets there's no way we can win okay here's the plan you guys go to Goku's house then move them to a different location immediately before we do anything else we need to make sure Goku gets better so right what are you gonna do piccolo [Music] what's gotten into piccolo all of a sudden he went that way okay I think I get it he's got one final trick up his sleeve one final trick what do you mean so you know what's in that direction right I'm not really sure what are you trying to say that's commies place and what does that have to do with anything when I was back on Planet Namek I spoke to guru he told me that if comi and piccolo hadn't separated they'd be as powerful as a Saiyan so I'm betting that Piccolo's gonna combine with commie and go back to being his true warrior self but wait if comi ceases to exist as he is now won't the Dragon Balls disappear too but if either of them die separately well then the same things gonna happen anyway so piccolo probably feels like this is our best shot at taking down an enemy this powerful but what about my I mean what about Vegeta what do you think he's up to relax there's no need to hide it anymore I mean we already know that your bomas kid all grown up and from the future Vegeta the only one who doesn't know what oh I see I'm sorry for hiding it from you hey no need to apologize I'm going to meet up with chiaotzu if things get hairy again I'll be back gotcha we're gonna get Goku and take him to Master Roshi's place okay okay make sure you tell Goku not to overdo it right we'll tell him [Music] [Music] you
