No is he I'm sorry Uriel without his leadership the monks will leave and the temple will fall the mongols one what's that next to him a Lotus Sutra written in the abbot's blood his final act like a samurai's death poem the point of this Sutra is that we can all be buddhas from the lowest hasn't to the greatest nobel written with his dying breath not for himself but for those he left behind sure the sutra to the monks if they see the abbot's devotion they might stay [Music] and this is the sutra the abbot wrote in his own blood a final act of devotion a call to stand up to cruelty a call to stay and not surrender we will honor the avid sacrifice norio we must not let Kushi temple fall enjoy the Guardian saved us once now his brother and Lord Sakai have saved us again and together we can defeat the Mongols now we need to find the statue of Buddha where would they take him the statue is here yes my lord the Mongols stole our sacred Buddha and rode off toward the coast we'll return the
