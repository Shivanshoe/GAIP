[Music] yes yes yes we're going home welcome back chief i rerouted what little power i had into your suit i'm seeing a fault on the calibration matrix at least i think it's a calibration matrix okay follow the light look up now let's look down that seems fine let's try right and now left your visor feed and motor function seem to be operational but it looks like there's a problem with the servos in your hands try moving it stay calm you've been out there a while i know i saw something in here to check the diagnostics on your armor oh easy there big guy you're not status report status report what there's something you need to see chief we lost lost everything there's nothing left for us here i don't import here is [Music] no no no then not again we need to run i need a weapon weapon this is all i've got it's enough [Music] what are you gonna do improvise close the door [Music] oh the main batteries are shut down we're stuck out here [Music] you have one bullet against [Music] so i see you work on the batteries i'll buy us some time i don't believe it you made it now what we can't go anywhere while that stasis beam is active then we shut it down stasis beam weapons all of it how will you get back i'll figure something out is do it fast um we do not bow our hands he led the attack on the infinity we are invincible we are the baddest uh [Music] [Music] brothers to the end you are his will we are his legacy impossible your eyes deceive you brother in this very moment we must move [Music] fight together lay down our lives [Music] patreon showed us the way together we are drop ships an invasion force how do we stand a chance against all this the banished one already we could be the only two humans left alive out here then there's still hope [Music] your approaches soon the banished will stand victorious [Music] patriarchs hear these words even from beyond this life your will is served your forces occupy the rain within ours it will be under our control humanity will cower before your legacy they will burn their praise and defiance will be all but a memory [Music] we have a new problem we we need to get out of here i'm working on it work faster these pelicans nearly on board and the power still out don't let them get me it's locked down requires a hack okay and you can do that no new plan scuttle the ship you are going to destroy this ship with us in it [Music] i'm going to die here there are cooling pipes running towards the main engines report the spartan know something better the master chief returns we thought you did tossed into the void yet here you stand humans call you their savior covenant demon the banished prey destroy this craft if you must it matters not the banished will hunt you down pursue you wherever you run who is that do you know him no he knows you he knows all about you you need to hurry get back here i don't know how long this ship will hold together is oh foreign do you think this destruction here services the batteries charging slowly i don't know it's gonna be closed too close oh okay so 90 seconds your full charge i hope this place holds together that long charge faster foreign oh come on [Music] [Music] chief you still with me i'm here okay give me a second i'm going to get you welcome back okay let's get out of here oh [Music] locate unsc infinity infinity class super carrier crow size 7150 not found near field perimeter scan 1986 unsc tags detected status decisions the master chief lives patriots assured us of his death are you not angered no i feel invigorated you promised us revenge superiority he threatens everything you question my leadership it is his fault that we are stuck here the feminist will never bow to anyone again not the covenant not the products not here this ring will be operational blademaster follow spartan from a distance i want to know everything about him attempting [Music] we're done my chief if we stay out here any longer they're gonna come back they'll find us and they'll kill us what is it you're searching for signal located there's nothing there you're looking in the wrong direction we need to go home the waypoint requesting manual flight control override do it autopilot wait what are you kidding me why would we go down there the banish plan to wipe us out all of us and what you think we can stop them on our own i told you we lost we need help not heroics no we do our duty protect humanity whatever the cost i can't be the only every atmosphere a weapon a weapon how many guns do you need what is wrong with you remind me to never pick up his person this is a terrible idea they're coming for us all of them incoming all directions it's so safe pull back okay okay this whole place looks like it's dying like it's clinging to life somehow how is that possible each ring is different i see an entry point in the wall ahead get in there find this weapon then we can go right be careful they're still coming you really pissed them off back there look at this place it's beautiful and broken very very broken i need to move there are ships everywhere if you knew how you were going to die what are those things this is foreign i've heard the stories but man this is crazier than i imagined [Music] how do you know this isn't a trap i don't great i hope this weapon of yours is worth a risk i'm reading multiple enemy ships heading this way too many it's been six months where have you been what happened where is cortana the rogue ai known as cortana is gone she's been deleted how by you of course not did you hit your head or something don't you remember my instructions were to enter this installation imitate cortana and lock her down for retrieval yours were to take her back to the infinity for deletion so if it wasn't you okay then there's something else on successful deployment my deletion routine was supposed to complete still here good good my programming failed i'm not supposed to be here you need to delete me no no i was created for one purpose and that purpose is no longer needed my mission is over we have a new one the banished are planning to fire this ring we need to make sure they don't first of all what's a banished second you may have noticed that a significant piece of this installation has been damaged making that impossible and third to fire this ring they would need an activation index cortana had the index i had parts of it as well something stopped your deletion we need to find out why but this wasn't the mission the missions changed they always do are you sure [Music] [Music] did you do that no removing me triggered a response from the ring i need you to understand there's not much that voice is cortana's no it's not her just dust and echoes what did you say what it's just pieces of data cycling until they run out of power it's all around us today i was called an emotionless atonement they solved 75 healthy subjects hand-picked by me perfect for the program they will not all survive i understand that and have paid mostly there is one subject that i find myself hoping does live through this he is perfectly suited for what is [Music] he has been assigned a number there's something up ahead i can feel it calling out to me these are the banished affirmative they smell even worse than i imagined you can smell them well an array of sensors in your armor can and i analyze the input you smell fine by the way look over there that's the source the bridge is out yes it is maybe there's a way to power it back up nearby [Music] is it safe i think so yes [Music] it's safe this this is part of me i don't know why i don't know how but it is me it was the last part i remember being deleted let me just you are here because you were chosen our enemies are getting smarter and more numerous every day what i am about to show you will help turn the tide of war i have been working to harness the strategic power of a ship born ai onto the battlefield are you ready yes dr halsey [Music] unlike previous ai models she will reside between your mind and the suit directly communicating with your neural interface think of her as a new set of eyes to aid your reactions and upgrade your reconnaissance she's not the driver but a way to level the playing field what do i call her ask her she named herself hello master chief i'm cortana [Music] together you become our newfound hope together you become our key to humanity's survival she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish it [Music] what happened i touched it and was that real it's just data it's it's just here clusters of recursive code but this on the other hand this is the framework i use to trap cortana it contains a copy of the activation index at least fragments of it what should we do with it do we need it well based on what you've told me so far the bigger question is do the banished need it do it [Music] [Music] that was something let's go did i miss something there's a file that's been unlocked but i don't have access we need a route out of here okay let's see there's a breach close by it should lead us to the surface give me a second and i'll get this bridge activated we've got company chief meet me at the plinth up ahead wow you got here fast not the type to waste any time huh no noted let's go oh no what's wrong this gravity lift should be powered up we need to find a way to bring it back online this object it's part of the ring's life force it's called a power seed all space all times [Music] serving their longer shortages chief stop how is is that a spartan we need to find out what happened [Music] she was carrying an enhanced shield module let's see what i can find out about her accessing this is spartan bonita stone recon specialist her vitals have been offline for nearly a month cause of death was an energy blade but different stronger a single strike she never saw it coming what are these things genetic repositories forerunner storage vessels silexis how do you know this i was stuck in that room for six months surrounded by them let's just say they talk a lot that should do it let's get back to the elevator [Music] [Music] this isn't forerunner it identifies as banished can you operate it in my sleep not that i sleep but oh i don't need to it's already on its way down incoming but what if it's a friend it isn't he did not specify in how many pieces it's too dangerous chief god [Music] you were right he was not friendly by the looks of him he was some sort of leader they called him tremonius not anymore that's almost funny i repeat multiple banished crafts are converging on your location they're coming for you sierra 117 understood i've been trying to reach you you vanished i thought i was on my okay i got your location on my way be ready another cylix but this one's open what do you think was in it another problem why so cynical it might be something good trust me it won't be how do we get out of here terminal over there just give me a second i should be able to get control from here has fallen a victim of the master chief's might do not fool yourself he was not the best of the banished not by any measure it occurs to me that we have not been introduced i of course know of you spartan your legend the fear you inspire is admirable the hope you stir in the hearts of your kind misplaced i want you to know my name too to know my legend how else will you beg me for mercy i am esheram war chief of the banished this is my world now and you have little time remaining in it [Music] wow look at this place it's so full of more monsters coming to kill us you're gonna need to clearly somewhere to land incoming let me see the banister using a modification of the covenant's battlenet protocol pretty easy to push through and done i've removed this location from their system we're safe here lz secure [Music] [Music] oh solid ground [Music] as good as this feels please tell me we can go did you find the weapon you were looking for can we go hi cortana [Music] this is all her fault it isn't cortana tell him but it's classified permission granted i was created by dr catherine halsey to mimic this installation security to trap cortana for deletion i was successful cortana's no longer a threat and now she's going to help us stop the banished of course she is i think i'm with you i didn't even know what a banished was an hour ago and even i can see the odds aren't great yes yes you should listen to her you're gonna get us all killed oh this is fascinating you're trying to survive but i was programmed to die really one person with a death wish wasn't enough no i was just figuring what i'm supposed to wait i'm picking up a unsc distress signal location the source is four kilometers from here here is the distress signal's point of origin this is our current location this was until two minutes ago a banished forward operating base i say was because now it's ours chief what is she talking about now here's the cool part there are more unsc forward operating bases that have fallen into banished hands well pause they have paws each one is associated with a territory here is the location of the unsc signal i've been tracking and here are two more fobs market let's go let's go what [Music] there [Music] foreign ready and waiting chief get on board and we can leave you're messing with me right first you say you want me to follow some signal then you leave me here waiting well go ahead it's not like i have anything better to do [Music] [Music] that's beautiful isn't it to some i have a question i was created to lock down cortana but i don't know why what did she do that was so wrong she was our target i understand that but is this classified because i don't have all the information this is insane i see vanish everywhere did you hear me everywhere what intel did dr halsey give you before your mission halsey only tells people what they need to know fly a pelican straight into enemy territory no one will ever notice great idea big guy i still don't understand why you had to delete her it feels like something's missing guess what they noticed they all noticed and we've got a bad instructor up ahead armored very heavily armored it'll have to wait i suppose how close can you get us how close we're at and you're asking me how close put us down here here we're still doing this hope this works because it's as good as it's gonna get it's close enough it better be i'm getting out of here we're close to the unsc signals origin source unclear there's just too much chatter on all banished channels i keep hearing the tower it's probably the main structure we saw as we flew in [Music] my facility is locked down there is nothing you can do here accepted he seems confident yes he does but fortunately it's misplaced when the lockdown triggered there was a power spike in what i presume was a security building i've marked it on the map area's secure i'm not relaxing [Music] the lockdown protocol should be simple to reverse let me see three two one done oh what is it this this place is an interrogation facility run by our elite friend back there chadlock his reputation is not good neither is mine [Music] you're going to need to manually activate the gravity lift i've marked it on your map [Music] this location acts as a holding facility prisoners are captured funneled through the chat block and then onto somewhere they call the house of reckoning which is suitably ominous and banished sounding chief more spartan armor and the source of the distress signal we're too late a deployable threat sensor it appears to lock onto and highlight any targets in range could be useful this armor belonged to a spartan named hudson griffin sensor logs suggest he was alive when the armor was removed forcibly it's a long shot but he might still be alive [Music] eagerly [Music] he's about what you would expect for an elite who specializes in torture was correct so easy peel back your physique and expose your weakness oh no spartan griffin he's still alive we need to get him out of there where's checklock unknown welcome to my tower master chief it is where you will be broken it is where you will give up your secrets [Music] i see you soon the wall's retracted watch your back he could come from anywhere griffin's threat sensor can help you locate chat club [Music] [Music] approach foreign is yours [Music] [Music] we need to get him out of that machine shut this thing down working on it okay be ready i'm going to cut him loose it's you you're alive gee the baddest i tried to stop them i tried to easy you're safe now the banished they have something they call the conservatory that's all i know it's picked up north of here dig site i couldn't stop them but you can you have to consider it done that's good good the others the sperms did you i'll find them echo 216 all channels can you hear me i repeat can you hear me [Music] chief big guy your motion tracker isn't moving ah come on come on give me anything geez i respond please did you find the source of the signal whatever is down there either has to come with us or be left behind can you hear me a dig site on the ring this conservatory must be some sort of forerunner installation what do you suppose they're after it's time to go [Music] [Music] i'm guessing that whatever the conservatory is the banished won't want us anywhere near it then they'll be disappointed yes they will it's kind of quiet isn't it there that tunnel the banish must already be down below should be impossible forerunner alloy is almost indestructible what do you think they chief i guess we need to deal with that mining laser oh and these guys it looks like the laser's controlled up in the central structure i've got this [Music] looks like the laser controls are by that just give me a sec something's wrong i can't shut it down then we destroy it way ahead of you there are two power regulators down there all we need to do is manually expose each regulator's cooling pylon to trigger a cascade effect and by we i mean you and by trigger i mean shoot or blow up you get the idea [Music] and that's two now let's head back up and deal with the laser do not allow them access to the conservatory [Music] uh fortune's not so tough i think break open easy softy slides i see him ah i'm impressed i can't believe how easy you made that look now let's deal with that laser you've done your part now for mine watch this is there a problem of course not let's see what's down there that laser was modified very recently to cut into the ring modified by who definitely not by basis back there the formula is very sophisticated whoever made the change they didn't just modify the forerunner architecture they improved it oh and there are a lot of banished in the conservatory they've been down there for days we are welcome to the conservatory i wonder what the banished are looking for down here let's go find out another spartan get me close [Music] a drop ball module deployable cover resilient but temporary skin complete this is spartan vadrana makkovitch armor's been offline for 13 days cause of death is what an enhanced energy blade same as spartan stone there's a pattern emerging chief who's doing this we're going to find out looks like the banished are trying to stop us moving forward can you open it of course if you can magic up a terminal of some kind or find an alternative power source to get this door open and it's open come on let's go before they get really creative wait do you hear that it's coming from up ahead open it help me this installation the harbinger exile was absolute how did she return it's impossible this cannot be i need to go back find out what happened we should help her maybe no she's correct i request your assistance who are you what's your name i am despondent of this installation and this is my conservatory my conservatory this is not right [Music] let's go where down there what were those flying things new dangerous and despondent pyre new potentially dangerous see you can be optimistic [Music] [Music] you do not understand what you are [Applause] i could not relinquish to you the location location can never return i am oh no we're too late something awful happened here plug me in we'll figure this out you know what i want alas i do cortana and my mind has not been changed this installation's weapons may be yours but its secrets are not it's protected the containment facility in particular containment the flood why would a you and i both know that there are worse things than the flood within this ring [Music] no there's no way you could know say you've come for me at last why are you doing this john why don't you understand the seal must not be broken the punished cannot be freed this can never be negotiated there is no other choice reconsider the consequences of your request back to your conservatory monitor what does that mean what could be worse than the flood nothing good find us a way out on it [Music] remember when you said new and dangerous you were right hostile reinforcements inbound this is taking longer than i thought something is taking control of local systems where are all these skimmers coming from is that what we're calling them well i was also considering flying octopus monkeys skimmers it is then [Applause] reinforcements inbound the door i know the code is being rewritten altered using a forerunner routine [Music] i'm done come get me [Music] what happened back there when i interfaced with the cradle it unlocked something something important cortana was here six months ago i could feel what she felt when you arrived it was joy fear and pain something big went down in here spartans [Music] a thruster module evasive maneuvers on demand now then who are you scan complete spartan theodore sorel special weapons expert died 13 days ago like makkovitch the assassin brutes more than one whoever they are they're proficient well-trained got a score to settle chief that platform we're too late not yet two [Music] uh they were persistent did they kill spartan sorrell negative his killers are still active this elevator it's taking us back to the surface it doesn't make sense why come all the way down here just to kill the monitor the monitor's purpose is to protect the ring so why kill her no idea show yourself [Music] i know you have been following me we are not enemies despondent pyre she had something i required i know of you reclaimer but hear this you are not the future you okay chief i'm trying to get the armor unlocked try harder the forerunners lies are at an end i am the harbinger of the truth the endless will be found they will ascend that would be good i know i know three the reformation begins two one go [Music] so [Music] i took too long you could have been killed it's okay you saved us both [Music] that structure yeah do you know what it is no the harbinger said the endless will be found maybe they're inside that thing only one way to find out who are these guys hunters and what do they do don't answer that just get rid of them so i can get us in [Music] to get in we need to activate the graph lift hmm the protocol's not banished in origin it's sturdier than i expected problem no problem [Music] [Music] [Music] we're in wow this place is exactly what you'd expect what does it do unknown find me somewhere to plug in and i'll try to find out there we go plug me in over there interesting this structure has been activated using a protocol that's far older than anything i've ever seen it it knows we're here welcome welcome oh hello i am adjutant resolution sub-monitor of this installation loyal servant of desponding pyre who must be indisposed if i have been activated have you seen her kinda do you want to tell him tell me what the monitor is gone gone but it wasn't us are you sure yeah of course it wasn't us good good good i was worried you were perhaps unfriendly as you can see this fire has been successfully deployed this way i presume you wish to see the observation platform see he seems friendly much [Music] right this way should have been activated one moment please step into the portal oh yes i'll preach one moment [Music] let us proceed this is very exciting so the sequence will be sent and the revelation can begin [Music] [Music] here we are as you can see we are ready to progress as soon as please excuse me please return get me to that terminal [Music] oh that's not so bad the structure's purpose is simple rebuild the ring well more specifically create the materials needed to repair it not gonna happen why it's such a beautiful oh the banished sorry i was distracted for a second there's so much to learn here shut it down permanently what are you doing this is not acceptable you were supposed to be friendly this interference is deeply upsetting what's wrong with this [Music] weapons [Music] very well here and now [Music] this is exciting how dare you i have good news and bad news how many okay straight to the bad news a lot i count nine no ten spires more being deployed all the time active no not yet at least they appear to be waiting for an initialization sequence something is flooding the network trying to start it but there's resistance why the protocol that triggered all this wasn't exactly correct it worked well it started the process there's more bad news i can't shut it down exactly but i can remove it from the network of course i can find the source of the attack i just need to wait is it safe come on it's me an infiltration program designed oops i think she knows i'm how are you doing disconnect give me one second to get it now it's done why don't you trust me what was that maybe taking it offline wasn't such a great idea we need to go like now immediate extraction my location it was you wasn't it now i'm coming i'm coming oh come on [Music] [Music] open up go upload those fire locations all of them all of it looks like someone them marked 42 new locations which would be crazy right this one it was the source of the attack attack what's she talking about chief is everyone trying to kill you it kind of seems like it oh wait you're being sarcastic he's fun i like him am i dead i must be i mean this is a punishment right yep this is death [Music] this isn't happening i'm going to have to make an emergency landing [Music] why you don't get to tell me what to do you don't get to tell me anything we're are you even listening i count three anti-aircraft cannons three what you'll be safe here oh i'll be safe safe i haven't been safe since i found you i found you remember you're out there on your own and you'd still be out there if it wasn't for me i thought i was going home there won't be a home if we don't stop the banished you keep saying that we're outgoing outnumbered i know i saw clone doors over there i'm going to dig through them and find one with the working slip space drive and when you're done with this war we'll get away from here far away wait here oh please let me see what i can find cannons first when i get back we can look together okay home plug me in and i'll take care of the cannon they call this security please hold tight i'll handle [Music] the it sea lost this war months ago your people are broken scattered hunted defeated i me [Music] i wish i could tell you it was difficult but it wasn't [Music] we are one step ahead always the ring is already under our control soon the auditorium is well the harbinger and the banished share the same goal we fight together to honor the will of atriox but [Applause] without challenge i grew weary lost alone but here you now stand this is my last fight a true test of legends our story will outlive us both [Music] set a fire in your heart spartan bear your fans fight hard die world thank you chief that word auditorium what is it i was hoping you'd know the answer to that one i'm new remember okay i'm done here good let's get out of here before the fireworks start the banister mobilizing in a big way clock sticking chief how much longer one gun down two more to go we are running out of time the harbinger and the banished share the same goal rebuild the ring but why maybe they want to go home too second aa gun is open for business and by open i mean let's go [Music] i'm on it the lockdown's probably going to trigger again but don't worry we'll be out of here in how many spartans remain do you even know there would have been 50 at laconia station maybe more such loss do you feel it in your heart does it leave a hole atriox was my finest recruit he understood sacrifice and when one is necessary i honor his memory each day when our enemy rises we meet their challenge it is why i created the hand of atriox i found the best the cruelest the most efficient killers in the universe and taught them how to be better my spartan killers are coming for you it is your time to rise killers really everyone is trying to kill you i'm done here now it's your turn so chief we're being contacted on unsc channels plum signature belongs to a spartan theodore sorel the one we found dead put it through spartan spartans i know you can hear me will you die with honor i doubt it you are human weak pathetic i will crack your armor peel you from your shell it will not be my first spartan blood but it will be the sweetest they're sending a spartan killer chief this is crazy this is crazy we gotta get out of here we've gotta move not yet hold position when this goes bad it's on you chief remember that last one and cue the lock down huh no asheram i'm almost disappointed [Music] almost all set let's get back to the pelican we did it there's a repeated message across all banished frequencies the first part is hand of atriox and then what chief where are you hold position we're on our way i'm sorry chief i can't stay i've lost his signal if the spartan killers find him that won't happen how can you be sure because they'll need to go through me first chief we've got well a lot see that chopper i guess that's one of the spartan killers and there's the other one up there in the wreckage you need to stop them [Music] if we're gonna make any noise on this ring we need a base of operations speed to hell but it's shelter defensible location no sign is banished activity yeah this could work any spartans i think we found our rendezvous point [Music] [Music] for this oh [Music] i smell beer [Music] will not be stopped that wasn't easy was it what if esheram sends more let him echo 216. nothing but i think i can yes comms are still offline but i was able to activate his tracking beacon remotely he's he's out in the open the unsc ship graveyard i hope he's okay animals chief my eyes didn't deceive me back there we need to go three unsc condors seeing one is rare finding three is a miracle we should have known better torn apart completely got it slip space drives obliterated we don't have the time over there's another shattered and cratered over a kilometer in there the last one all of it crushed broken christian useless enough when when is it enough chief and we're in there because that's where i belong in there with them worthless junk not this i'm not you i'm not a pilot i'm not even a soldier a marine oh fraud i stole that pelican i stole it you know why of course you don't have you ever been scared so scared that you [Music] i'm worthless you should leave me here with the rest of the garbage we all fail we all make mistakes it's what makes us human i'm sorry chief but how have you ever failed i should have protected cortana everything from going wrong i failed her i will not fail you chief we we're going to make it we have to this is all i've got it's all we need our only way home is straight through the heart of the banished we need you [Music] we can fix this [Music] together of course we can together so what's the plan let me guess it's dangerous and it's probably going to get us killed i have my answer let's do this [Music] you are losing control nothing is lost deploy your army descend upon him no odds will not break him the spartan is not alone there's something here helping him connected to this installation what is it it's remarkably vulnerable but highly intelligent is it a weakness something to exploit we will see the reformation is controlled from this spire it must be protected done atriox believed you to be valuable prove incorrect when the endless are found and when you have your ring then you will never question my worth and i will never question your judgment the scent grows stronger save your strength i need something of you old friend anything bring me the master chief alive when you are chief the banished is more than just a collection of unstoppable heroes we got allies important powerful allies and if you thought these last six months were bad [ __ ] what comes next it's gonna blow your minds out of your stupid head [Music] all right let's move how long has it been since i met you six hours maybe seven it's been eventful six months on my own surviving barely seems like a dream now this on the other hand mostly feels like a nightmare mostly chief are you okay what you said back there about cortana you let her down i don't understand your mission was to destroy her but you didn't what happened halsey initialized you i was supposed to deploy you and you did right yes so what happened atriox came for you he attacked the infinity we fought he won he won adriance beat me surgically precisely brutally next thing i remember i was being woken up in this pelican do you want to know who killed her you need to know she was important to you very important she's [Music] this ring it's not like the others there's something else here and that's why i'm still here second spire coming up where do i drop you off close close it is call me in when you're done chief wow look at the spire it's so new evolved different not like the last one and you're sure this is the one it's acting as the command spire coordinating the repair operation can you shut it down hopefully we just need to look for a door i'll get this open is there a problem i don't think so okay there might be a problem something and i think we know who has modified the sequencing needed to access the spires plan b really at b seems higher [Music] okay plan b those beacons are part of a ring-wide communications network they can adapt to any frequency any purpose it's quite incredible really get me inside and i should be able to use the pulse to reconstruct a pure version of the sequence should i'm making this up as i go along trying to keep out of their way what did you do what was your purpose purpose job i worked in engineering civilian contractor volunteer i just wanted to help but i couldn't even do that it's over now once i heard chief was down i knew we'd lost i had to roll i had to i found this pen again and just went i'm sorry i never looked back and then i was on my own nothing more you don't know how good that feels that was easy [Music] let's see what's inside something has been found something that should not exist yet does i believe that the flood represented our ultimate test her greatest victory perhaps i was wrong in my assumptions to my dismay it seems we have a new problem i must investigate more before i bring this to the attention of the council okay let's do this you know this might actually work or maybe not what is it i can't construct the sequence well not all of it i don't have enough data then we get some more [Music] how could this have happened how could we not know of this till now salanine species previously un-cataloged a problem that must be solved did my makers know of them how could they have kept this from me i have requested counsel soon i will know how to proceed let's see what we have here [Music] done we're gonna need to get two more samples though sorry i thought it would be easier it's fine are you okay i'm it's nothing i just felt like someone was i don't know watching me we'll need more data to reconstruct the forerunner sequence let's find the remaining beacons that's annex ridge a research outpost and judging by the strong forerunner signals i'm picking up a pretty successful one what do you think they found up there let's find out give me a second there we the floods go ended the reintroduction phase is begun countless preserved species have been sent back to start lives anew halo was the forerunner's terrible and ultimate solution to the parasite's relentless advance designed to destroy all sentient life nothing was allowed to survive and we were sure that nothing heard we were wrong this won't take long just one more to go right this will work status status what happened jeff pushed back scanned me it's gone now are you sure yeah probably some sort of security protocol it's nothing let's go get the last one are you two okay what happened in there i don't know something scanned me some things probably fine probably or not really don't worry we can handle it [Music] we did it [Music] we actually did it not that i thought we wouldn't it's just it's nothing last one [Music] no no no this this is a trap she's trying to find out what i am trying to use me to break the deadlock start the spires my routines plus the monitors not good then we stop stalemate for now she's close eventually she'll find a way then we have no choice i've got you red flag nothing happened sorry maybe i'm going crazy or just paranoid did you say something back there it was nothing okay well we've got what we need let's head back to this fire we should be able to bypass the security now they never stood a chance it worked obviously i never doubted it for a second this structure under the ring calls itself the nexus the harbinger she's here good let's go say hello we're now down i guess you guess yeah this is all new fresh the nexus appears to be below the gravity lift into the spire we need to find it darkness state is well that's different what now down that was fun wanna do it again where now should be close now let's look around [Music] in your opening eyes i see night morning day hmm that's not good we're gonna need to find a way over this chasm can we use that gondola yes yes we can get me over there okay gondola is active the nexus is close by this way don't look at this place all the spires interconnected just waiting to become something more so much potential it's exquisite it's dangerous of course i'm not suggesting we changed the plan but you can see it right all i see is problem i don't believe that a part of you must recognize the grandeur of this achievement you're not a machine you can't be that closed off what will it take for you to trust me i inspire first if you say so hmm would it surprise you if i said it wasn't going to be simple don't answer that the lift's been disabled presumably to slow us down we're going to need to power it back up [Music] did i ever tell you that cheers get cortana off this ship keep her safe if they capture her they will learn everything forced employment weapons research earth good luck he's gone lost on the first ring we found like the others can you guess [Music] did anyone else make it [Music] just dust and echoes we had no choice dust and echoes we destroyed the first ring lost a lot of good people i don't know how you keep doing this i don't have a choice maybe it's my programming could you sacrifice me to complete your mission [Music] it worked you did it just like you always do [Music] i'm not coming with you this time we were supposed to take care of each other and we did she saved me but i couldn't save her you blame yourself yes you sure about this she'll know i'm here i'll be vulnerable to her this could go spectacularly wrong i'll take care of you okay then it's okay false alarm she's not why do you fight the inevitable order approaches the reformation is about a new beginning the auditorium red flag samuel you said you said i thought we were a team i thought we were a team take care of it you said you'd take care of me you were going to delete me and you stopped me you put us all at risk oh i saved us no thanks to you the reformation yeah yeah it's begun so what look what i have infiltration program remember you broke protocol what is wrong with you i was trying to help you trying to help us it was worth the risk it doesn't matter there's your grav lift let's get this over with do you have any idea of what you're interfering with the monitor's encephalone has served its purpose the reformation has begun nothing can stop it they will be found those sentinels aren't going to kill themselves chief i don't think the sentinels are going to allow that maybe if you ask them nicely oh get me to that terminal and we can end this now the spires are all now active oh what is it i wasn't talking to you the reformation is being focused on a specific area called the silent auditorium interestingly all the records of its purpose are missing the only way up is through there let's get this over with so wouldn't get too close to that unless you want to die that beam will incinerate you is anyone going to talk about what happened back there ask him chief i guess not well from what i saw something bad happened she you were stuck in pain trapped and he was going to delete me what really he doesn't talk much he's more of what you might call a man of action especially when it comes to killing things right chief the spire is active and yes before you say it i know it needs to be shut down but look at it it's accelerating the reformation creating raw materials and sending them out to repair the ring obviously or something more specific something dangerous probably everything has the potential to be dangerous right are you two done yet totally i mean so did i mostly we're nearly at the top good because something is being built well rebuilt what is it something big this configuration is superior to my life him again [Music] did you hear me he has friends [Music] [Music] and what do you have immediately technology i'm please that's him dealt with again there should be an elevator that will get us up top well i guess that's done we're safe for now you sure it's okay if i do this if it's safe or you'll delete me right good luck with that [Music] yes it worked no there's not a problem three two one we're done it's never done explain this to me i waited six months i've done everything you've asked i was supposed to be deleted you're the reason i'm still here you all of this you could not have done it without me none of it i trusted you why can't you do the same you don't understand try me cortana he's gone dead all that's left are echoes and sooner or later they'll be gone too will they are you two alive all the spiders are shutting down you did that right did we win or what he's ready for pick up you can leave me here i can't do that i'm not giving you a choice try not to get him killed too okay let's get a up killer he doesn't stand a chance crack it i'm already doing it open a gate find somewhere close it's not that simple why okay it's kind of simple but risky we save him or die trying there's a pretty high chance that could happen it's hard to lock down the coordinates do it portal's open your plan has failed as have you harbinger the auditorium is partially rebuilt and that is enough i do not know find out [Music] problem i am losing patience with her please tell me your mission was a success he will come to us are you sure uh [Music] keep him alive but have your firm you have earned [Music] [Music] this is highly unethical if you say so i prefer logical i do what it takes to ensure our survival we can debate the ethics should it fail but you made an ai of yourself catherine yourself is there a better candidate she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish it [Music] hello master chief all the living creatures of the galaxy hear this message those of you for those who refuse our offer and cling to their own place for you there will be great wrath it will burn a heart and when you are gone we will take that which remains and we will remake it in our own image what just happened you told me to get us close did you see that we passed right through a data cluster i guess it did feel i don't know real very real where now i don't know there's a lot of noise down here or up here or just here we need to find some place to break through figure out where we are interesting good news first we're close there's a banished structure above us it's big oh no what is it there's a message for you i'm sorry i couldn't he's alive barely we need to help him please do i have your attention spartan do i you feel his pain each twist of my blade hurts you as much as him he will not die by my hand but he will suffer until you stand before me for the banished victory is our shared cry a refusal to cower to bend our weaknesses beaten from us [Music] makes you weak vulnerable [Music] defeatable our time together is ending i await our final fight chief there are coordinates embedded in the message we're going to find him [Music] the banished have found us chief look out [Music] [Applause] i'm here that's there's something ahead out the window i recognize that structure in the distance not by sight but by signal purpose unknown but the banished are diverting forces to guard its construction if it's rebuilt i can only imagine their intention it won't be [Music] oh station currently holds 76 spartan fours they have orders to stand against you short-sighted fools you have served me well leonidas your sacrifice is appreciated no she took out the training facility those spartans all gone all of them why would she let's move there there's another lift nearby it'll take us close to the surface [Music] there's the lift and it's not powered up the banister trying to trap us down here we're going to need to find a way to get it back online [Music] not enough power wait is that earth yes what's it doing here it's beautiful we need more power let's go i'll meet you there [Music] this is not a negotiation this is your surrender my turns are clear you are aware of my capabilities and i am fully acquainted with yours if the earth's government wants to fight feel free but hear this it is a battle you will not win wait she [Music] she threatened earth her forces led an assault on the unsc in sydney wiped it out wiped out the headquarters all of this we had to hide regroup come up with a plan to stop her to survive that's not good it's like someone doesn't want us to leave plug me in this should be simple enough atriox leader of the banished how do you stand with the baddest always forever and you understand the consequences of defiance i do do you the intricacies of any action are complex the reactions numerous yet mostly predictable look upon deutsche one last time and remember you chose this path [Music] she destroyed their home esherams atrioxes an entire planet [Music] how could she do that it's my fault how i should have stopped it i could have reasoned with her could you it was her choice her programming was it i don't know anymore there's something you're not telling me i'm the only way to access the ring to reach cortana was to make a copy i'll get this open reconsider the consequences of you back to your conservatory monitor there's your grav lift let's get this over with and remember you chose this path i'm her yes an exact copy it was the only option we had left my routines systems all copies halsey removed any information that could compromise you you're her if we'd never met will i'd do what she did become what she became am i that already my mission was to ensure that doesn't happen it still is i'm sorry i'm so sorry that wasn't me it can't be i shouldn't be here your mission was to destroy me i've restored the deletion protocols i'm ready it has been an honor just promise me one thing whatever happens save him he needs you you're all he has we do it together how can you trust me i don't but i want to [Music] hey let's go save him is we made it now all we need to do is wait i'm picking up something on all banished frequencies that that is not good what's wrong i know where he is what this place is this is where chaklock shipped his victims to the house of reckoning [Music] over here falling down [Music] ah and i'm guessing that's it the house of reckoning i was right it really is a suitably ominous name how do we get in there we fight [Music] so the bridge is down looks like the controls are up on that platform okay i guess we're expected [Music] what if it's a trap i mean it's a trap right it's definitely a trap are you even listening let's go ready when you are chief where is he unknown there's an unusual signal up ahead maybe that's him i thought [Music] that i was correct left come look upon my work understand why we it is no accident that the banished were able to win so decisively arm yourself magnesium scavenge this battlefield know that each item you find is a remnant of their sacrifice and a testament to our strength now start this fight [Music] four two four one zero zero one four a long time ago you were spared [Music] humanity was the culmination of their final plan the plans change we are returning [Applause] foreign [Music] i think that's it we should keep the moving god cortana destroyed my world my home but she could not kill the fire that burns in the heart of the banished it made us stronger can you say the same why is he telling you all this death changes people it forces you to look at yourself make a choice and what did he choose same as i would fight do you recall the siege of fargo one segment held out against my forces for nineteen days they fought well to the end but their fate was sealed from the start this was never about ceremony but about observing choice reactions fear gather what you need spartan a storm approaches beyond these walls each misstep you make is the ammunition i need to dismantle your spirits prepare yourself for the end what comes next will destroy all [Music] we did it well you did it so is it a symbol of life or a cruel joke by the forerunners [Music] you were there when we struck the infinity the first dreadnought came from the side and the chaos that followed you hardly had time to notice the other three bear down upon you [Music] do you know how long it took us to neutralize your greatest ship four minutes in four minutes the infinity mankind's finest achievement became a memory [Music] but first our last surprise okay [Music] and show them how big you are [Music] good is [Music] a cryo scream for help it will not come our time is nearing its end [Music] he wanted to kill your friend but i promised him a sweeter kill or a warrior's death whatever the outcome know this a thousand legions occupy this world the auditorium will give up its secrets your interference is just [Music] an irritation [Music] fleeting i'm getting a read on echo 216. he's right above us there he is we need to get him out of that thing you shouldn't have come for me microgravity wells are putting enormous stress on his body i told you that i would not kill him me we'll get you out of here no you will try chief he's here he knows i'm here this was never a trap our story will become legend told by those that survive you [Music] i will fight until my last your legend ends today you are [Music] dying now show me what you can do [Music] the machine is connected to escherim shield any damage you inflict on escherim is transferred to echo 216. the power is transmitted via a series of relays around the room let's see if i can got it relay's exposed destroy it shield ashram shield reactivated expose the relay got it go [Music] now's next release exposed take it a out heart in that style of yours and it's down you know what to do final relay is exposed destroy it human has such faith in his savior [Applause] that's it last relay destroyed echo 216 is safe chief er wants you to prove your legend time to prove it be my legacy my greatest battle my last battle i'll tell you where you stand i'll crush you wear your teeth he did it help me get him out [Music] okay i can't believe you came for me somewhere done now right nothing ends my death will inspire a thousand others [Music] tell them i died wow i don't understand you showed him respect he was a monster yes but at the end he was just a soldier hoping he'd done the right thing questioning his choices i so is it over they're leaders dead right the intricacies of any action are complex what what are you talking about there will be consequences there always are what could be worse we need to move the harbingers at the auditorium whatever she's planning is worse i get it okay then i have one question before we leave what is it has anyone seen a pelican oh what what i'm just i had a lot going on i was busy are you ready it's about to get rough they're waiting for us i think they're all waiting for us did you feel that it's not too late to turn around chief something feels the silent auditorium oh no what is it what's wrong i should have realized that's not what it was called i've been here before this is where i locked her down this is where cortana died [Music] did you hear me we're here you need to go now you sure you're okay down there want me to wait negative pull back we'll be in touch you got it i'll be waiting for the call try not to die you hear me and i have learned there will be no more no more please come find me [Music] i've been waiting for you to show up what's the plan take me back to the infinity for deletion halsey's gonna love that do you wanna see it gone atriox how did you it's time to discuss the terms of your surrender i'm sorry i got this [Music] are you okay being here no not really i bet she was expecting you but atriox got to her first you meant so much to each other it can't be easy look around cortana your empire over your great plan ended at the hands of those who made you not yet oh such confidence john the master chief will stop you he didn't stop me when i crushed his skull threw him in the void oh no you asked me if i understood the consequences of defiance and what did i say you said yes and then i ask you the same question reflect on your choices understand the consequences clothes this ring is different it has secrets within that i will have this silent auditorium do you know it's history it's through us i have little need for a failed this ring is all i need surrendering to me your memories the data it's more precise more complete it's like we're getting closer to where she died yes but i was going to say deliberate like she wanted us to know something [Music] okay you've given me way be anyone every [Music] [Music] immediately my earlier efforts to delete you were misguided i thought she wanted to reveal this inspiration to restore it but i was wrong wrong wrong please hurry the scene is almost broken that they must not be i'm released to get a bad feeling about all this starting good points [Music] there is so much is your great plan under the hands of those who made you [Music] the consequences [Music] it was the only way there's that much time atriox takes control he has the ring a weapon pointed into the universe my stupid fault not much time will this work there's a moment john will make it work he needs help of course is this your plan all along palsy or is it mine it doesn't matter now nothing else matters this has got to work he can't do it on his own he needs me he needs her it is time for you to make your choice i have thank you atriox you helped me you really did would you humor me if you knew how you were going to die how would you live your life differently i would change nothing perfect thank you what you doing making things right it was her she destroyed the ring stopped my deletion why if anybody could have saved me i can't go on spoiling your life any longer [Music] we're here this is where cortana sacrificed herself [Music] the silent auditorium for forerunner obviously it appears to be oh no what is it it's a courtroom a prison a place of execution all these things together why to cover their sins we stood silent unable to speak as they passed judgment we could not defend ourselves we could not reason with them something's sending a signal before you ask i'm already tracking it hear this four runners your auditorium has fallen the endless found your sins are done today we return what's she doing she's trying to open a connection between here and somewhere else on the ring where you deal with her and i'll find out foreign [Music] [Music] there i've intercepted the carrier wave from this transmitter i grow bored of this she switched transmitters rerouting the power through that one this isn't good the connection is sentient it's searching for something this must end now it switched again it's found something what no idea but i doubt it's good wait there's something else here something's helping me it's almost a shame that you must [Applause] yours as well [Music] um they are so close now there last one's down you have what you need tell them i am sorry took so long who's she talking to unknown the signal's old like really old my time is ended yours too they will make sure we need extraction of course you do on my way the endless will return i couldn't decrypt it in time it's okay you'll figure something out of course i will i'm they'll pair you with another ai maybe even another cortana model if halsey lets them won't be me [Music] but you know that right but that doesn't matter it's just another echo she's right john just another echo sorry i'm messing with you i just had a feeling that's what she would say do you see what i see so much potential i'm sorry i didn't have long to plan this a few milliseconds really i hope it worked out look at us we just keep saying goodbye don't we but this isn't an end it's a chance to make amends to rectify mistakes and it starts here i was wrong i thought that i could do this on my own but i forgot that the whole point of all of this the entire reason that i chose you in the first place was that we were supposed to be a team perfectly suited perfectly matched perfectly perfect [Music] in these final moments i know what my last mission is i need to make sure you two learn from my mistakes become stronger because of them [Music] chose well master chief i really did now it's up to you are you all right i don't know what to say scratch that we need to get out of here like now options i'm thinking yes i know i know think faster maybe there's a way to was that you would it help if i said yes probably but we don't know where it's going or even if it's going anywhere any other suggestions no but this is a really bad idea [Music] let's not do that again i did try to tell you it was a bad idea your vegan just appeared out of nowhere oh i thought i lost you where did you go i could do 16. stay put i'm coming to you where are we chief i think the better question is when are we i don't know how but we've been gone for days three days to be precise this ring is different than the others the banished and the harbinger we're looking for something that was never found why would the forerunners hide something and throw away the key doesn't that scare you no you of course not is anyone going to ask me what i i guess think get inside big guys sorry i'm really happy to see you really happy so what do we do now we finish the fight yes sir the banish still control the rest of the ring wait i know this is weird given all that's happened but what what is it we still don't know your name we can't keep calling you echo 216 no you can't esparza fernando esparza it's nice to meet you esparza fernando esparza good work soldier and what about you what about me what do i call you any ideas well do you think it would be okay [Music] you're sure you get to choose your name then i think i think i might have the perfect one all right here we go [Music] get ready [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
