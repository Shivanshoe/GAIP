[Music] go on how long do you intend to keep that look since dad died I've been doing a lot of thinking trust me Mom I have my reasons Wow suit yourself but for the record I much prefer your normal look to this gaudy Super Saiyan business yeah I'm sorry you know you'll get bigger with each passing day and you look more like your father too you think so your fashion choices are yours to make provided you keep up with your studies understand yes ma'am thank you I'm not sure where to start maybe piccolo can give me some good advice [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] you [Music] um piccolo there's something I wanted to talk to you about sure yeah but why are you still a Super Saiyan huh I don't really know how to explain why but I'm trying to continue my training you still feel responsible for your dad's death huh yeah that's part of it I need that's why I'm still a Super Saiyan I want my body to get used to this form a bit more I see so it looks like I didn't need to worry after all huh since Frieza showed up even after we believed he was dead I always thought I had to be on my guard but if cell or some new androids show up you're the only one that has what it takes to beat them so I planned on giving you a push in the right direction when you needed it but I guess you really didn't need me to do that oh so that's what you mean it makes me happy to hear you have so much faith in me so you got a more concrete training regimen planned just being a Super Saiyan isn't going to cut it you know yeah it's just I still don't know what else I can do hmm I guess that's understandable you pretty much did all you could do in the hyperbolic time chamber do you have any ideas with regards to your strength they're probably as strong as you can get right now so you won't see much rapid improvement in terms of raw power what you lack is mental fortitude mental fortitude your dad he knows how to remain focused in battle you on the other hand you're still too emotional you might be right about that if I had focused more I could have prevented cell from self-destructing so what should I do hmm you might not like the suggestion but why don't you try training with Vegeta he's the strictest guy around when it comes to emotion and not just with others but with himself too he might be able to provide some insight into the mental aspects of combat understood I'll go ask Vegeta if he can help me out [Music] all right better find Vegeta so I can ask for his help [Music] [Music] what do you want would you mind fighting me so I can get stronger my dad died because of me I need to get stronger so something like that doesn't happen again it's up to me to maintain peace now I need to protect earth in my dad's place don't be absurd do you think Catherine's dead because of you you're the one that's going to replace him you arrogant spoiled little brat huh but I damn it I wasn't planning on fighting ever again but I've changed my mind now come at me [Music] [Music] [Music] right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] more power than this [Music] [Music] [Music] you dare hold anything back believe the power you use to blow sell the pieces it makes me seasick how much you remind me you are far more powerful than this when you defeated cell you were holding backwards you know a soft spineless brat like you could never replace kangaroo stupid child yeah the Cheetahs right I can't define who I am based on who my dad was I I need to do some serious soul-searching I'd better stay a Super Saiyan a little longer it's not gonna be happy about it though greetings thank you so much [Music] this thing's filled with power [Music] [Music] [Music] readings [Music] yes [Music] hmmm let's see what do you think [Music] thank you so much [Music] right excuse

star okay okay I'll limit it to my training school that'll be something you [Music] thanks to Gohan and his father the planet was freed from cells evil clutches the people of Earth were finally able to live in peace once again however during times of peace people have a tendency to foolishly grow complacent such as the fate of mankind [Music] about seven years had passed since the confrontation with cell this is the quiet settlement of Satan City here resides mr. Satan the man mistakenly believed to have saved the planet the city was renamed after him for his heroism go on is now sixteen years old with no schools anywhere near his country home he had no choice but to do homeschooling and correspondence courses but eventually his mother chichi decided to send him to a high school in Satan's City armed bandits began appearing so frequently in Satan city that Gohan began to run into them on his way to school from time to time to combat the crime in the city Gohan would transform into a Super Saiyan and make short work of those that disturbed the peace to protect his identity Gohan made sure to leave the scene as quickly as possible the mysterious hero came to be known as the golden fighter and rumors quickly spread about his true identity the golden fighter again huh who gives this guy [Music] from Super Saiyan to superhero I took way too long I need to hurry [Music] oh man I'm gonna be late I have to hurry [Music] yep finally at the high school high you're the new guy Gohan is that right I'm Marisa nice to meet you and this here is Vidal you won't believe this [Music] Fidel's dad is none other than the legendary mr. Satan really mr. Satan no yeah that's right you're late today weren't you did you happen to see the bank robbery in town oh I'm not sure the golden fighter took out all the bandits okay why are you so interested in bank robberies herself makes total sense though right she is mr.

normal life let's see how you handle my ultra fastball I've got to take nice and easy [Music] you're not getting a single hit off me [Music] [Applause] [Music] what you actually hit my [ __ ] but I

[Music] [Music] need to talk to Bulma hopefully Bulma can help me figure something out [Music] hey this looks like some high-grade stuff hey there [Music] hi Bulma there's something I wanted to talk to you about what's up hmm you need some sort of disguise to hide your identity so do you have any idea how I can do that of course I am a genius after all really please whatever it is I'll take it no problem it'll take some time though so sit tight Thanks you have no idea how much this will help me oh yeah do you know where trunks is he's probably getting whipped into shape by vegeta in the gravity chamber vegeta mentioned something about making him stronger than you oh yeah wow he sure is intense [Music] the gravity chamber huh where was that again [Music] go on when did you get here not too long ago the word on the street is that your dad's putting you through some grueling training yeah he promised he'd take me to the amusement park if I can land one hit on him really Vegeta said that keep at it then I know you can do it yeah I'll make sure my dad keeps his promise guess I should say hi to Vegeta while I'm here hi Vegeta sorry to interrupt go on look at you you're out of shape even in times of peace you should be training right speaking of training I hear you're teaching trunks how to fight I am he's more than old enough to prepare himself for real combat by now and he'll soon surpass you if you keep sitting on your ass like that oh yeah I gave trunks some words of encouragement earlier he's looking forward to going to the amusement park hmm he's only going if he can manage to hit me but that's not going to happen [Music] perfect timing Gohan it's ready not fair our make me one mom whoa this is great this will definitely work I know right thank you so much

things cost you some trouble that's for sure well I'm fine but I think a lot of the villagers are hurt yeah stakes made a mess of our supplies and businesses ah that reminds me I found some vegetables when I took care of the monsters those are probably from Tien spawn hey you know he likes farming [Music] oh those are some rather tasty looking vegetables well if you don't mind I could use them to make something delicious and nutritious for everyone what do you say that'd be great we'll need the energy to rebuild everything those monsters destroyed I'll go pick some more vegetables from Tim's farm then Gohan would you mind helping me we can get them cooking in no time oh sure thing I mean uh who is this go hon hmm I'm the great Sailor man oops [Music] oh man your cooking's the best yeah
