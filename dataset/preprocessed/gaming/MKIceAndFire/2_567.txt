matters me's gonna hear about this sooner or later and i don't want her to be alone when she does ran out of road uh [Music] the guy who killed uncle ben is gone he'd think that would bring me some peace but i don't feel peaceful not even close [Music] police confirmed tonight that there's a serial killer on the loose one with a unique twist he hunts other killers his latest victim is dennis carradine a convicted murderer and arms dealer carradine has been identified as the perpetrator in last year's shooting of queen's resident benjamin parker some new yorkers we spoke to applaud the fact that violent criminals are being taken off the streets hey somebody wants to clean up the trash i say more power to them but police caution that the perpetrator is a threat to everyone this individual is a dangerous psychopath he commits acts of extreme carnage and brutality leaving the initials ck written in blood as a signature the crime scenes are so gruesome they shock even veteran officers due to the letters and the horrific nature of the crimes authorities are calling this man the carnage killer anyone with information should call the police immediately this is whitney chang for the daily bugle news network horrible but at least it's finally over the man who took ben from us won't ever hurt anyone again maybe now we can move on peter what's the matter aunt may the truth is i'm glad he's dead i know that's wrong you're relieved a bad man can't hurt anyone else that's different you're glad a murderer was brought to justice there's nothing wrong with that i know it's just i part of you wishes you're the one who did the bringing to justice yeah no that's not what ben would have wanted he wanted you to work hard graduate go to college all the things you did wherever he is he's very proud of you and so am i i wish for bad things to happen to this carotene guy a lot that's perfectly natural he killed your uncle yeah peter parker it's bad enough you feel guilty about ben i i won't let you beat yourself up over this why would it be your fault did you kill that man no he was a criminal he associated with awful people it's not as if you had any control over that well what could you have done so you feel better my husband's still gone i think that'll hurt forever you said you thought maybe we could move on yes uh now that there isn't that question hanging over us where is he why don't they catch him now we can look ahead but it's not like being happy we'll be happy again peter i promise you you heard whitney chang some people are grateful to the carnage killer i kind of know how they feel that's not the same as condoning it you're not glad this carnage person is out there murdering are you you want them taken off the streets don't you yes

thing with all the nasty stuff they make here but it's built to survive a 9.5 earthquake so yeah just got it a shake for breakfast a shake lunch and a sensible smack upside the head for dinner i you can't lock me up man the russians can get to me inside you might be able to make a deal with d.a harper for protective custody if you help stop this gang war innocent people are getting caught up in it i can't it's bigger than me now all the gangs in the city are at war everyone's scared of everyone else the russians got here at almost the same time you did i know one of my guys must have dropped a dime now that your future looks let's go with limited what'll they do keep arming up take out what's left of my men and everybody else in town they're ruthless i promise you by the time they're done you'll wish you had herman schultz back so you broke in here for a power-up absolutely guns won't do it anymore everybody wants an ace that the others don't have the kind of fighter power that you can fight an army with and i bet they don't care who gets caught in a crossfire that's why they call them bad guys what are all you tough guys so afraid of the carnage killer he's murdering my people huh the the russians hammerhead's crew mr negatives men everyone thinks the other guys are paying him i'm starting to worry he's some kind of freak like that giant lizard a while back or that dude with all the the robots as long as he's out there killing the gang war goes on and it gets worse unless you want to go for a butt whipping hat trick you'll tell the cops everything you know about the gang war okay but it won't do any good look the city's full of trigger-happy wise guys scared the carnage killer's gonna get him that's one fire that's just gonna keep on spreading huh huh you know as much as i made fun of these things they're pretty clever i could get this kind of kinetic energy into my webbing now who's the thief huh so you know oscorp but you might not know me i'm harry osborne when my father died he didn't just leave me a business he left me a new york institution but too often lately both ozcorp and this city have been preyed on by criminals now today i'm announcing a joint venture with a man who like me recently returned to the city where he was born and wants to help wilson fisk new york made me the man i am now i want to give something back it was my privilege to rebuild this great city after recent crisis but that was just the start allow me to introduce you to the enhanced crime test force now the police are doing a fine job with limited resources but when they face threats outside their normal rather than increase the burden on taxpayers mr fisk and i are financing this hand-picked task force ourselves vigilantes like spider-man only make the problem worse this is our city and we're taking it back together still willing to take oscorp off your hands young man and my answer is still no well that's fine i'll just wait until you die of the disease that killed your father attention all task force personnel you are authorized to begin phase one of the suppression initiative repeat phase one of the suppression [Music] initiative now's a good time to take down some bad guys while the task force is putting heat on available units please respond to a disturbing the peace situation suspects may be armed [Music] no more tricks try to keep up there's going to be a test spider slam i'm still experimenting with the catch phrases what do you think i almost died just then [Music] spiderman showed once again that no crime is too small to escape his notice what makes someone decide to be a henchman low self-esteem [Music] uh that is the last time i eat garlic pizza before putting on the mask yikes that's some serious heat gotta find the people quick someone please help me on my way hold up i can't get out thank you i couldn't have lasted much longer i think my costume protects me but not enough every second counts just a few more seconds [Music] a sobbing woman embraced the son she thought she'd never see again reunited thanks to spider-man car 42 we have reports of fighting possibly gang-related in central park southwest corner can you check it out dispatch said it was the southwest corner of the park i should be first on the scene just a few blocks as the spider swings [Music] ah [Music] public support citizens are tired of the crime wave and have doubts about the mysterious figure known as spider-man despite all the good he's done ah so what else is new but i've obtained the records of the officers on the task force they show allegations of corruption and police brutality none of it proven but still are these the people we want to trust with this kind of power spider-man i'm on here the spider kill him i know what's bothering you you think because i took down herman schultz it means i like him more that's just not true you'll get the same up close or personal attention i promise [Music] i might just have a future at this now to find the one that got away hey wrapping up bad guys is my thing i can help you okay mr craven the hunter you got my attention we have shots fired at the bus station proceed with caution suspects heavily armed you know i love i know how the task force is going to stop the crime wave when all they ever do is come after me all units officers are under fire at the bus station need assistance immediately web slinging failed hey pay attention am i gonna do this again for your bed you get pressed [Music] and of course the daily bugle never gets spiderman i like impressive but you are still raw inexperienced i was experienced enough to beat your friends i am russian but i am no friend to those pigs my name is sergey kravenov men call me craven the hunter so you left me that note huh judging from the wet you're one of those crazy reality show guys who runs around naked in the woods eating bugs how can you help me i can make you a true hunter not just a boy pretending to be a man should you wish to accept you may find me here until we meet again parker why didn't you get me pictures from the fifth godsword press conference oh sorry mr jameson but i've got school you know life outside the job in my day your job was your life a press pass is wasted on you [Music] maybe jonah james and i could be friends if we actually i just got an idea for using my press pass i've got to admit it would be nice not to feel like i'm fighting this battle on my own this craven someone i can trust raven obviously doesn't know who i really am but i've come to my house i don't know i've always worked best alone but then again i've never tried it any other way if craven can teach me his hunting techniques i won't have to rely on police broadcast [Applause] okay don't be nervous you need information on craven and you've got a press pass to get it with easy peasy never mind that if he finds out you're a photographer and not a reporter he'll have you stuffed and mounted if this costume made my butt look big somebody would tell me right uh mr kravenoff it's me peter parker from the daily bugle we spoke on the mr kravenoff [Laughter] i apologize for startling you i am craven please forgive my theatrics i merely wish to demonstrate my skills the videos online do that pretty well i saw you take down that siberian tiger with your bare hands without hurting it tigers are endangered i simply relocated the beast for its own safety as well as that of the local villagers true hunters wish to conserve the natural world it is where we find peace you're a long way from the natural world i craved a new challenge i came here to hunt the monsters oscar created the cross species the deadliest combination of animal and human i ended their threat but i grew fond of your city and your city grew fond of me and i decided to stay except now you're hunting normal people no only criminals only those who prey on their fellow man have anything to fear from me this new task force is sending a pretty strong message no vigilantes ah i do not trust them they are paid for by fisk i am sure you've heard the rumors of his illegal activities sure everyone has but no one can prove it and the police seem okay with him because he has paid those who are corrupt the rest are desperate to avoid looking incompetent well the public is desperate for an end to the crime wave i have only one agenda to get results based on my experience the research the police aren't big fans of vigilantes the police had their chance to stop the crime wave they failed miserably uh i don't think they like being reminded of that i do not wish to insult them but it would be a far greater crime to have the power to help but refuse to act would you not agree yeah as a matter of fact i would is man really the most dangerous game in their own way yes but men are merely highly evolved animals the current crime wave provides fascinating opportunities to study them the patterns of the various factions and what are you finding out that criminals are not unlike beasts they have hunting grounds specific behaviors many traveling packs but there are differences such as animals spray on others for survival only human beings are willfully cruel so you're saying you feel a responsibility to use your power to help yes to have such power and not use it is to be unworthy of it well thanks i i think our readers will find this very interesting good good i must take this call but please look around take pictures of anything you wish yes no i said tranquilizer darts no i have no interest in automatic weapons they require no skill i i'm an artist perfection just the image i wanted great composition pardon the interruption would you care to see my latest trophies foreign cross species beautiful are they not i thought spider-man captured them an inadequate solution they escaped so you killed them to save the lives of their victims yes but also in self-defense they were deadly opponents i know i mean i can imagine when do you consider it okay to kill when there is no other choice i do not take life lightly but when it is necessary i do not hesitate if my failure to act cost the life of an innocent person i could not live with myself i know what you mean they all had superhuman powers how'd you beat them i have trained myself to the peak of human ability and learned many natural means of enhancement not drugs like the scum who pollute the streets but the secrets of native cultures herbs potions mysteries forgotten by so-called civilized man hunting criminals some people might wonder if you're the carnage killer he is no hunter but a brute a savage his very existence is so offensive to men like myself so even though he's hunting criminals you'd like to take him down of course he dishonors what i do without honor peter the hunt means nothing last question is there anything you haven't accomplished yet ah yes i would like to leave a legacy when i am gone pass my training to a protege my only family his brother who and he chose a different path i never had a son but perhaps forgive me i am becoming melancholy as i get older so do you have what you need mr parker yeah i think i do [Music] whitney whitney should i be jealous who is this that's no way to talk to a lady or even me felicia this is the number i gave whitney chang how'd you get it the name's black cat as in cat burglar as in i get my hands on things i'm not supposed to how about you spider do you ever get your hands on things you're not supposed to i heard you were back in jail listen if you're calling to tease me about breaking out i'm insulted i can think of a lot more fun things to tease you about if you're smart you'll get out of town before i find the time to chase you funny that's what i was going to say to you things are getting dangerous around here spider why don't we chase each other out of town hmm i'm too busy to fool around with you i i mean play games with you bye felicia funny how one crimes up it's my fault okay let's go see what craven's got to teach me besides mustache grooming [Music] i knew you would come yeah well don't get any ideas about me being your sidekick but i'm on the trail of the carnage killer and tracking's a little out of my wheelhouse ah yes the killer i thought he might be you but i have watched you and i see that you are no mad man you spied on me only briefly there is much a hunter can learn from observation i see in the way you carry yourself like a lost child that you lack someone to guide you to help you become a man i have no son of my own i do not want my legacy to die with me i can make you the ultimate hunter let us work together to to find this carnage killer and suppress the crime wave let us do together what we could not do alone still gonna operate on my own of course as we lie but we will be there for each other when it is needed i sent you an address there is a back alley from which the russians move stolen onscorp equipment to a safe house use the little fish to catch the big ones yeah i've heard that before it is tempting to catch the easiest play but in our case the most obvious criminals are the most inconsequential wait follow them see where they go i get that but i'm not gonna let anyone get hurt if i see these guys threatening someone's life they're going down illegal money is usually paid in cash if you follow low-level criminals as they drop off the earnings they will lead you to the next rung of the ladder you're doing well now listen higher-level criminals prefer to keep a low profile but just as animals must visit a watering hole they must collect their money and pay those above them i'll give them this the way these guys hustle all over the city they're getting one heck of a cardio workout if we don't have everything ready when the truck arrives we'll be in big trouble gotta get a photo of that crate of oscorp tech so i can trace it this crate is heavier than your mother if you drop that i'm not taking the blame for you quick get the crate loaded before someone sees us good shot that oscar deck will go to their superiors do not lose sight of it i'll stick to it like well me i hope the bad guys appreciate all the effort i go through looking for them can't lose that truck it's my ticket to the russian secret clubhouse can't let that truck out of my sight [Music] craven's tips are paying off i get the feeling there are a lot of bad guys in there i better keep a low profile i'm guessing this isn't a restaurant guide the carnage killer these must be all the places where he killed these guys friends a lot more than the police know about i know what craven would say a clearer picture of the predator's hunting [Music] [Applause] [Music] grounds [Music] [Applause] so this is where all the cool gangsters hang out a party to ask other rich man for money to fight crime he wants to fight us eh let's see if he has the stomach have you seen him he got yuri [Music] help i see him i learned a valuable lesson today kicking bad guys in the face is fun [Music] uh [Applause] hmm so i have seen more of these task force fools flying around like pigeons one of them arrested arcadia they are well paid and well protected there in order to get them back then maybe we get to the men who pay them [Music] uh [Music] what i could do with equipment like this harry won't mind if i borrow this for a little while [Music] [Music] you'll be dead before you see me move go see what that was how can anyone be that fast okay lady how much coffee did you drink why can't they all be like that i'm gonna guess this was not a meeting of the wilson fisk fan club [Music] craven i'm sending you pictures the first one looks like a map of places the carnage killer struck ah yes good good the more we can learn his habits the better next up is a flyer for an anti-crime fundraiser hosted by wilson fisk i think they're going to try and kill him there even if fisk is crooked i can't let them do that especially with all those innocent people around the fundraiser is tonight they will have put their plan into action already you must go to the location and stop them just one problem i don't have an invitation i'm guessing you don't either then we must improvise i am too well known to bypass security but under your mask spider-man nobody knows who you are here's a hint i'm not rich enough to go to this then you will find a way i believe in you [Music] wouldn't mind chatting with fisk see what he knows about all this but i kind of have a feeling he's not the most approachable guy in the world and none of it matters if i can't get inside wait i think i've got it with that fundraiser's level of security i can't use my press pass to bluff my way in unless i'm really supposed to be there a photographer needs a reporter and i bet i know one who's already planning to go oh whitney uh thanks again for using me on this hey i get it college is expensive you want to make easy money taking boring pictures of wrinkly rich people go nuts but you should probably stay away from me let me guess you've got some pointed questions about the task force among other things i gave it 10 minutes before i get kicked out hey harry pete oh man i i know we haven't seen each other much since we were kids but this doesn't seem like you're kind of seen society pages i'm a part-time photographer for the bugle smile great got it thanks fisk is putting a pretty big target on his back why do you think he does it he grew up in hell's kitchen lots of crime gangs i think this is his way of taking control standing up to the guys who bullied him when he was a kid but knowing fisk he's also got a plan in place to profit from it whitney chang says the cops on the task force are crooked too i just supply the tech fisk can pick the men but the police chief cleared them all the chief's desperate to stop the crime wave he's not going to argue with the guy who's helping him do that well one thing's for sure the task force is getting results and no one likes to mess with success hey i gotta ask why fisk i hear some pretty shady rumors about him he's the only one rich enough who was willing to work with me i've got i've got a lot on my plate i can't waste time worrying about people attacking oscorp and our public image could use a boost i'll tell you this though the rumors are true fisk is definitely into some illegal stuff but good luck proving it drinks gentlemen whoops you know don't worry about it i gotta go anyways i've got uh important things to do me too something fishy about that guy better follow him oh foreign time to get into my work clothes now doorbell guess i better get creative please what do you want from you nothing we just need your way to uniform so we can serve fisk a special recipe what are you gonna do with this depends how much you bother me you're deliberately moving really slowly is this like some sort of mime thing thank you oh it's so scared we'll see who is stronger thank you liberating take that [Music] open sesame okay that didn't work on the plan b just what i want you won't get me so easily spider i feel bad you're not you're not all right you're not good this will shake you up okay i'm sorry that was corny i might just have a future at this well i saved fisk from the russians now to find out if i have to save anyone else from him these people are movers and shakers i can learn a lot just by listening in oh yeah sure i've heard the rumors about fisk but let's be honest how many men get to be that successful without getting their hands dirty it's my lucky day so this is gonna sound like a bad pickup line but you seem really familiar have we met judging from your bargain basement suit i doubt we move in the same circles oh i get it born with a silver spoon in your mouth hardly for me silver's an acquired taste well uh i'm here for the daily bugle so uh you know anything interesting about fisk i know he hangs out with rich older men and you're scaring him off so i'll have to say goodbye look me up when you move out of your mom's basement i don't live with my mom i live with my aunt well nice meeting you um my name's peter cause if you care i'm felicia but what [Music] well he knows how to make an entrance blotting out the sun time to talk to the big man himself hey back off uh should i tell whitney chang he has no comment on the russian mobsters tied up downstairs it's all right i like this young man's boldness he mustn't reveal that to anyone it would play into the criminals hands they want to make people afraid to support my anti-crime efforts but if no one knows what they did they'll get away with it and try again oh i assure you they will not get away with it meaning what exactly well the task force will get them of course we've been gathering intelligence on this organization for some time but no one's been able to stop them yet not the police not spider-man don't say that name to me spider-man he fancies himself a hero but he's let crime run rampant the police are bound by the laws of probable cause spider-man is not if he hasn't stopped this scum by now he's either incompetent or he simply doesn't care what's your beef with spider-man seems like you're after the same thing if spider-man is going to operate outside the law one would think he can accomplish things more expediently but he contends himself with apprehending purse snatchers he's a dilettante a thrill-seeker worse than useless still he does seem popular with children in fact i recently secured his likeness right you what how about this carnage killer is the task force chasing him we are interested in catching anyone who commits a crime but it's a lot harder to find one man than an entire gang of them and i bet the fact he's killing guys you don't like doesn't exactly bother you i do not condone murder of course but am i shedding tears for his victims no i am not gathering intelligence huh find out anything interesting the russians are clever they operate in cells each knowing very little about the others when one group is taken down it rarely leads to further arrests but someone's got to be calling the shots well they do have a central base of operations but very few know where it is finding it will be another matter entirely it's this very war that will be the end of the gangs the more they escalate the harder it becomes for them to hide wait are you saying the russians are still smuggling guns into the city don't put words in my mouth young man i'm just a backer i leave the crime fighting to train professionals not excuse me i have funds to raise yeah i've got uh important things to do [Music] too that map i found showed a lot of russian mob activity around a trucking company seems like the perfect cover for bringing weapons into the city wherever those weapons are going spidey's going to quick before those task force idiots see us relax we set the car on fire ten blocks away we're distracted by that [Music] i haven't done this kind of heavy lifting in years me neither but there's a reason we've lasted this long not many of our soldiers even know about this place yeah here i guess everyone's a big shot [Music] is it true what they say about the killer is he one of the cross pieces i heard he is just a man if that's true jack the ripper was just a man i am telling you there is something demonic about anyone who could do that to a human being nighty night that's the kind of heavy artillery you see in a combat zone i can't let it and boom goes the dynamite [Music] huh [Music] hmm i lost three men to that carnage killer if someone doesn't get him soon patience misha i hear we are making progress they say bad guys don't think of themselves as bad guys but come on you must know we've got the great way to make sure those weapons don't hurt anyone is to wreck them i'm good [Music] the police report said four containers were stolen from oscar means halfway there [Music] [Music] uh sit back relax and enjoy being [Music] unconscious that's true we have the carnage killer the boys are making welcome right now they should kill him right away before he can escape say what you want but i won't stop worrying until it's dead it's escalating gotta make [Music] and me without my marshmallows [Applause] ugh huh you deliberately moving really slowly is this some sort of mime thing was that movement i [ __ ] him i was disappointed i'm still experimenting with catchphrases what do you think i learned today kicking bad guys in the face is fun hey i said i wanted my butt medium rare i'm telling you he's right where we left him your men are panicking like children i believe you just show me so i can tell them i saw it with my own eyes better yet take a picture with your phone you can show them yourself we've bitten him senseless i bet they're wishing they paid for that sprinkler system about nowhere now now we'll see who is stronger this one time i fought somebody who was a real loser and they were still better please i keep telling you i'm not who you think i sell advertising then why did someone break in here to save you huh i don't know what you're talking about since now eh a weakling like you could never kill our men alone tell us who you're working with talk oh nobody oh please please nobody that guy's gonna kill her [Music] now take some time to think about what you did [Music] please no one help me stop whining and stop talking i can't let those goons kill him [Music] [Applause] yep would your mom tell you you could be anything you want cause she was wrong i will try to keep up it's gonna be a test i might just have a future if i was working with the carnage killer you'd be dead right now be glad you were wrong these guys seem to think you killed a bunch of their friends it's not true it's not true i was going to my car and i saw someone attack one of these russian guys he's the killer but not me how did you end up here i yelled then the killer ran i went to see if i could help the victim then his friends showed up my hands were bloody but they wouldn't believe that i didn't do it this man you say was the real killer what does he look like white uh red hair skinny wild eyes the strength of a madman not the kind of madman i work with your license says you live in jersey if you can prove you weren't in the city when the carnage killer struck i'll let you go no problem i was in san diego all last week at a convention that's the ambulance i called you'll be okay now [Music] craven i've got a description of the carnage killer excellent i've used the map you provided to identify his hunting grounds you think he'll be out tonight a true predator never stops the hunt my friend meet me at the location i am sending you that's him wait you can only truly know your prey by watching him stalk his own oh please dude i didn't have anything to do with that drive-by i was just a wheel man real man who saw all those people die oh you admit it good now you're going to tell me all about it then you're going to give me answers the spider i'm a big fan of the look but your execution boring you know real spiders liquefy their prey from the inside you should think about it and you're the carnage killer why'd you do it i get having a grudge against criminals but not criminals killers no one knows death better what do they see when they feel her cold arms wrap around them what special insights do they have there's so much to learn you're crazy and you're welcome for what doing what you want to but can't i i don't know what you're talking about i'll show you i could teach you how to be a real predator the spider you're just pretending take off your mask spider-man i need to see your eyes when you die i know the truth in your darkest moments you wish you were strong enough to be like me admit it give into it that's it go ahead kill me you know you want to no i don't chill i told him you'd never be like me [Music] thanks for the help you chose to disregard my advice so i assumed you prefer to handle matters yourself what was that anyway you expected me to just stand there and watch him kill that guy or stop him permanently i am trying to unleash the killer instinct in you boy the one you try so hard to deny that's not who i am and it's not who i want to be ever then there will always be a greater predator than you i guess we'll find out thanks for the smooth ride i sincerely hope i can return the courtesy by slaughtering you quickly and with minimal agony good day mr cassidy my name is donald menken i want to assure you that you are a most valued guest here at ravencroft we're going to learn a lot from you and i'll learn a lot from you answers you don't even know you have eager i like that well then let's get started shall we [Music] calling all task force personnel due to increased violence involving the gang war in the suspect known as spider-man you are now free to employ extraordinary measures initiative immediately [Music] spider-man whitney here i just did an interview with the task force and they're blaming the rising crime rate on you watch out so what else is new all units remain on high alert we've got multiple gang wars breaking out over the russians old territories everybody wants a piece it's like the old west out there so be careful dispatch my informants keep telling me about a new figure called the kingpin who's moving in to fill the power vacuum no one seems to know his real name could you get some information on that for me kingpin great that's all i need some new wannabe trying to build an empire [Music] that's when you think i can't get any [Music] better appreciate you being here they won't tell us what we've got they said it's dangerous the bad guys want it my pleasure the last thing any of us need is more dangerous stuff on the streets not being very subtle are they hey spidey this look as suspicious to you as it does to me stop there be cool think about it is that stuff worth your life daisy just got it nice going spidey jump on i have a feeling there's more where that came from spider-man do me a favor and look up my head cars wired to explode gotta try to neutralize them dumped it [Music] better up there than down here [Music] friendly neighborhood fireworks that's what i'm talking that would be the perfect spot for an ambush last chance hey spidey can you move that [Music] good work spidey come on we're moving out these guys aren't messing around [Music] give them this they're who car persistent they go up here it'll be a disaster skinny why can't they all be like that just in time what makes someone decide to be a hedgehog no self-esteem i can check that one off my list dispatch car 228 we checked out the game museum nothing happened let's talk to the lady who called she still swear she saw spiderman breaking in but that place is locked up tight no alarms have been tripped copy that 228. she probably read one too many of jameson's editorials the kane museum that's not far might as well check it out my reputation's bad enough without getting blamed for pilfering picassos [Music] time for alternative transportation [Music] [Music] ah hey yo i bet that's worth some bank hands off stick to the plan we're waiting for the spider you set off an alarm and bring the cops no amount of money is going to save you from the kingpin you dig they're setting a trap for me with idiots like this not gonna happen better take out the cameras so the cops will blame this all on me let's see what i can do before they figure out i'm here yeah shut your mouth and do your job the lady says museum we go to the museum that's to steal in museums great i think i know who's about to cross my path got the spider what is that impressive why am i not surprised i see him they say bad guys don't think of themselves as bad guys but come on you must know that was fun i expected better from you felicia what am i supposed to do you could have hooked up with me i mean yeah i i meant work with me i'm gonna take down bad guys instead of being one you should try it sometime [Applause] but working for the kingpin felicia organized crime you're better than that oh you have no idea how good i am yo over here don't feel bad you're not you're not all right you're not good are you just a scrawny kid and of course the daily bugle never gets pictures of me winning like this this ain't right we weren't supposed to fight the spider alone you were supposed to help us lady let that be a lesson to you fellas follow a woman just because you like the way she fills out a cat suit i'll be disappointed every time your track record isn't great sometimes i even impress myself [Music] should i have served my time like a good little girl get out when i'm old and wrinkly i don't think so you're saying the kingpin got you out of jail how much power does this guy have that's what it's all about isn't it power his yours and mine can you at least say some fun bad guy things like first you spiderman i love that one now you know how the other guy feels when you hide in the shadows it's not fun ah never mind let's fight [Music] why must you always make things so hard i know i'm playing hard to get but i'm worth it you're just dying to get your hands on me aren't you you naughty boy uh your heart wasn't in this felicia tell me what he did to you i was transferred to ravencroft the kingpin came to see me just to be clear we're talking about wilson fitz yes he said he knew i was after power and and he could give it to me you owe him that's how it always works isn't it the doctors did experiments they called it dna crafting or crisscrossing cross species genetics you've seen what can happen why would you do that to yourself boy you are thick i did it for you so i'd be like you so we could be together but then the kingpin ordered me to kill you or die myself i couldn't i can't felicia i i don't know what to say don't say anything i'm not interested in your face just your lips i can get you help witness protection a new life safe from the kingpin and maybe maybe someday we can get to know each other like normal people i don't want to be normal people run away with me we'll go somewhere exotic with our power we can live like royalty adventure excitement romance and that sounds terrible to you no but i've got responsibilities well i'm not one of them don't worry about me i've always done fine with a target on my back i can't just let you go fisk owns too many cops if i'm in custody i'm as good as dead you can't do that to me any more than i can do it to you you ever decide you want some fun in your life look me up felicia wait it all makes sense fisk becomes the kingpin by eliminating all his rivals with his anti-crime task force and the public thanks him for it he writes a few big checks and everyone looks the other way but it's not just the task force i've been taking his enemies down too and the one who's been pointing me toward them is craven can't let him get away with this i need to know more inside information on fisk and i've got an old friend who can get it so [Music] better make myself presentable [Music] wow everyone knows fisk is crooked but you're saying he's actually setting himself up as the top crime boss in new york that's what i've been hearing i'm uh working with whitney chang on a story and she needs proof you're closer to fisk than anyone i know not really he keeps his business private but as an investor i do have access to the task force's financial records [Music] okay one of the addresses you gave me came up large payments to a security consultant fisk handles all the personnel decisions he's the one who hired this kraven off guy but he cooked the books so technically ozcorp's paying him he's trying to throw me under the bus join the club you okay yeah it's just i trusted someone i shouldn't have and i probably should have seen it but after losing my dad and uncle ben i guess i wanted to believe you wanted a father figure i know what that's like my dad shut me out of his life to focus on saving his own and all he ended up leaving me was the disease that killed him huh harry i'm sorry what is it it's genetic very rare my father extended his life by spending a fortune while he looked for a cure i don't have that kind of time there's got to be some hope gene therapy that's what all my dad's research was about is that why norman started the cross species experiments yeah he thought he could give himself the resistance some animals have to conditions like this but the closest he ever got was the work he did on spiders with your father but dad disappeared and his work went with him your task force their body armor has medical applications can it help at all it's not a cure but it can give mobility to people who can't get around on their own the task force has helped me improve on it and protect my research from criminals who'd steal it but it was a mistake to work with fisk yeah he knows you're sick he figured it out and now he's waiting for me to die so he can take oscorp for himself listen pete take it from a guy who knows when the people you trust turn their back on you it's just proof you have to handle your problems yourself but sometimes you still need help harry i'll do whatever i can for you just tell me what spider-man no one knows for sure how he got his powers but he looks to me like the only successful healthy example of cross-species genetics out there you take pictures of him you must have some way of reaching him well peter i need spider-man's blood that's what i'm talking about [Music] if my blood could cure harry i'd give it to him in a heartbeat but it'll take time and lots of research to find out and he's in no mood to wait i've put this off long enough gotta catch up to harry and talk to him [Music] you came thank you i'll pay whatever you want mr osborne wait i've checked with scientists familiar with gene therapy and i can't give you my blood it's too dangerous dangerous i'll die without it not right away there's still time for more research every other cross-species subject has turned into a monster i don't know why it's different for me i'm i'm looking into it i've paid the top minds in the field to look into it a fortune they don't have the answers i'm willing to take the chance it's not just about you the lizard the other cross species they hurt people get out kill people just get out i can't give you my blood until i know it's safe i can't trust anyone i'm on my own mr osborne i no no just just go [Music] really at the end of his rope i should have noticed a long time ago but i was busy being played for a fool by craven i can't believe i fell for his act but why would he teach me his hunting techniques he was going to betray me yes that's one of the things i'll have to ask him [Music] craven time for a little mentor mentee chat no discuss our mutual goals map out a five year plan explain why you're working for a human jello mold looks empty maybe i can still find some answers it's all for me he was gonna kill me and stuff me like a trophy all this time he's been studying me testing me figuring out my strengths how to beat them [Music] you're a fake a coward this is your idea of a fair haunt oh no it's only the prelude the antidote i gave you should remove all effects of the tranquilizer i want you at the peak of your abilities stop acting like you're king arthur i'll let talk about honor you lied to me betrayed me for the kingpin and his money that was incidental i did not betray you i truly taught you all i knew not just so you eliminate the kingpin's rivals but to make you the worthiest possible opponent the foe i knew you would be my greatest hunt now you are ready and now we will see who is the hunter and who is the prey so you used me to take out the what kingpin's rivals i noticed you jumped in to stop him talking to me for a time he sought fear but he is little mortal ambush me from the dreams you've been a poor sport he wanted me to watch cassidy kill that kid why so i'd kill him so i'd feel guilty just because you're a sick freak it was a test to see how strong you could be you could stomach this spilling of your blood i admit i'm still waiting for an explanation for your mustache impossible i studied you you are not capable of this kind of fury you lack a killer instinct you deliberately really slowly is this like grasp at shadows i get as angry as you do i want to hurt my enemies just as much the difference is i know it's wrong come get me boy hard to spot him in those trees but i have to try there is no escape they say bad guys don't think of themselves as bad no one dies [Music] i beg you kill me give me death over defeat you're saying death isn't defeat you planning on coming back as a craven zombie or something anyway i won that means i call the shots what are your terms you're a few episodes short of a season craven but you've always had your own loony coat of honor so you're gonna tell me how to get to the kingpin the truth everything you know very well you have won that right ask and i shall answer i ran into someone who says kingpin gets test subjects at ravencroft how the institution has lost all government funding it now relies upon private donors of which fisk is the largest now that norman osborne is dead and they just let him experiment on inmates like some kind of dr chubbenstein they encourage it they view the inmates as hopelessly damaged useful only as test subjects i know you you're always checking out your surroundings you notice everything yes it's true i met with fisk in his building where i took note of the locations of his cameras weapons and accessible points of entry he has a telek 4566 security system and i know the passwords well you get a gold star draw me a map and don't leave anything out the information i have given you will get you inside the building but you must still face fisk himself i'll distract him with cupcakes this is why you will lose you underestimate him he has fought for his life since he was a boy if you show even a moment's weakness he will see it and kill you the old killer instinct huh a lot of good it did you i'm not sure if the cops can pin anything on you but if not take my advice and go back to russia fisk doesn't seem as forgiving as i am oops maybe james and i could be are you kidding me with everything going on in the city they're sending task force guys out of town i heard it's about that stolen club tech some kind of armor they're trying to get back so we need backup now but they don't care if working like us get killed only fisk has that kind of influence i should hitch a ride on one of the trucks see what he's up to [Music] [Music] please [Music] i'm not used to driving that kind of truck why can't tony come cause we're going to see the boss and only his top guys get to know where he goes when he's not here so shut up and do your job i had a feeling listening in on those guys might pay off now to stick to their truck and let them take me right to the fat man himself [Music] only one thing will work on this door ionic webbing i have eyes on spiderman i like hurting people can you at least say some fun bad guy things like the armor in the world can't fix stupid spread out secure the area you got it i want a perimeter set up all points of entry watched i'm on it i catch anyone slacking off they'll end up padding my arrest stats understood sir maintain radio contact check in every five minutes i'll spread the word the boss wants everyone working double [ __ ] i tell the boys task force cops working with crooks no who could have possibly predicted that except everybody [Music] hey pay attention i'm not gonna do this again for your benefit [Applause] webs do your stuff [Music] and of course the google never gets pictures of me winning like this spot armor might look cool but it doesn't make them any faster me effort i gotta feel like you don't respect me sometimes i even impress myself it really is so hard to get good help these days did that hurt oh wait i just remembered i don't care it's my lucky day [Music] who can resist that [Music] i see you don't feel bad you're not ionic webbing is my best shot here to me like the elite task force wasn't all that i'm sure you're quite pleased with yourself neither does the seismic fancy blast hey pay attention i'm not gonna do this again for your benefit got the spiderman hey unconscious bad guy was i in the zone or what man this armor is sweet ain't nothing gonna stop us now today kicking bad guys the armor is only as good as the guy inside and those guys i might just have a future at this i don't care what beef you have with a guy in your old crew there's no russians no more italians can you at least say some fun bad guy things like curt spiderman i love that one whatever those guys get paid it's too much anyone else hear that i knocked out your tooth but don't worry i left it under your pillow makes heavy metals so much lighter just you and me i can check that one off my what no elevator music this guy's cheaper than jameson smells like sweaty fat guys and burritos in here no offense to burritos [Music] well if it isn't the kingpin catch your name but i have to say you look more like a bowling ball than a pit or maybe a beach ball i have no idea what you're talking about i mean i'm impressed you take control of crime in new york right under everybody's nose the whole city knows you're cooking and everyone still kisses your tokens you must take what like a week a lot of ground to cover is what i'm saying the only criminal i see is the masked man guilty of breaking and entering into my private building a violent vigilante the daily bugle has branded a menace fine play it like that but one way or another you're going down and now you've threatened me i dare say jonah jameson will praise me as a hero after i kill you in self-defense of course you set cletus cassidy loose on the city not just to wipe out your rivals not to scare me to make things so bad when you took over it looked like you fixed it you running around in a costume acting out some adolescent power fantasy i live in the real world spiderman yourself when you go camping the bears hide their food come down here immediately you expect me to fight it myself people don't expect a crime-free utopia they want a world that makes sense where if you stay out of bad neighborhoods you don't get hurt they want order you're wrong people want justice they want to know that if they work hard and play by the rules everyone else has to follow they'll be okay people yell jackson fighting dance party well more of a seismic blast really you're so bad your high school yearbook photo was taken from a helicopter what do i pay you for get down here what what is men like me to make the hard choices to make the wheels of the world turn so they can work their phantom jobs and live their small lives and get a cookie at the end of the day knowing that someone strong i'm going to shut you have no idea what i've done to survive so talk to me let's hear it you hired craven cletus cassidy you're so proud of it tell me what you did you're so glad i could have you arrested for 10 pounds of crack by which i mean butt crap you're so bad your high school yearbook photo was taken from a helicopter i'm not a fool spider-man i've admitted no wrongdoing broken no laws there's no evidence against me i have proof you paid craven no my task force did as a security consultant i am shocked and horrified to hear he's done anything improper if indeed he hasn't he was hired for his legendary skills and and a strong code of conduct that would never allow him to betray a client craven might not give you up but cassidy will oh lunatic like that oh come now his word can hardly be believed and besides a man would have to be a fool to deal with someone of his ilk directly i assure you i am no fool i'm afraid spider-man that you are the only criminal here yeah we'll see about that this is not an action film boy just because you're young does not mean you can hack my security and gain access to my personal how are you doing that huh now who's underestimated who stop that i demand you stuff [Music] all units max dylan has escaped custody and is at large in sector 4. what did you do i have no idea what you mean thank you for showing me my areas of vulnerability i assure you they will be gone when you return uh he's using those generators to make an energy shield gotta take him out it's like times square is getting worse no one cares well i'll make them here everyone you're just i can't get through that energy field looks like he's drawing the power for it from generators just like [Music] get out of here if i don't wreck those generators i'm not getting anywhere near times square i don't have time good so much for the force field now i can get over there i recognize that guy what happened to him i want you to stay away now it's too late foreign [Music] uh there's something familiar about you max dylan you don't even remember you said i was your eyes and ears said we were partners i remember now i did say that and i meant it liar you abandoned me left me in that place let them hurt me all alone in the dark max i don't know what happened i can see you're in pain i can't help you unless but that doesn't give you an excuse to be one of them i know we're fighting but could you recharge my phone jolt affected my web shooters for a guy full of electricity you're pretty damn uh at first i felt kind of bad for you now not so much whatever happened to you it's affected your mind but there are people who can help places you can go no that's what those doctors did and all they did was hurt me never again all i wanted was no people to notice me you've got some serious self-esteem issues don't you [Music] ravencroft max i just found out what they're doing stop fighting me tell the police what they're up to we can bring them down together web shooters really don't like oh really how do you play video games web shooters aren't worth it and your power bill's gonna be through the roof [Music] foreign [Music] no it's all getting dark [Music] or not to feel sorry for the guy he was a victim and if what he said about ravencroft is true i've got to shut that place down oscorp's one of their big donors maybe harry can help [Music] yeah mr osborne you were right fisk is but as long as you're here i'm confident we can stop it right as long as i'm here [Music] i have it sir richard parker's spider-venom formula but every time it's been used there have been serious side effects more serious than death i'll take my chances now get out [Music] dr kafka is that supposed to happen no i'll shut it down attention all task force officers with the growing threat posed by the masked vigilante called spider-man we are clear to escalate phase three of the suppression initiative he advised there is no phase four this ends now [Music] all units be advised we have reports of rogue elements of the task force installing unknown devices possibly dangerous and populated areas proceed with extreme caution there could be mass casualties if i don't find those bombs right away we have a suspicious device in midtown east all units evacuate the area it's come to my attention that a low-level worker at oscorp has been killed after falling into a tank containing genetically altered electric eels his name is something nauseatingly common oh yes max dylan osborne's people are trying to keep the matter quiet i wish to see this man's body for myself given the fascinating properties of oscorp's cross-species genetics and maybe a great deal to learn from his corpse if he is in fact dead i'm hearing interesting things from our friends at the coroner's office [Music] thank you i can't tell the regular task force guys from the renegades but they're all after me so it doesn't matter i'm gonna get to the rift fast just made it [Music] we have a suspicious device in midtown all units evacuate the area first either you're with the guy setting bombs or you're stopping me from getting to them either way we have a problem ionic webbing makes everything better i love getting paid fighting let's see how you do hand in hand [Music] oh no i didn't oh yes i did i like hurting people let me show you police brutality you don't know the meaning of the words yet let's go for a swim with great power comes great responsibility can't forget that [Music] has been notified so [Music] can we all just admit this whole task force thing was a terrible idea time's ticking i love getting paid i'm gonna

with the blackout and our score cannot respond repeat cannot respond i better get over there now i think i've had enough coffee a riot at ravencroft we don't have the manpower to handle it all we could do is close the bridge seal it off what about the people who work there we send us some task force guys to evacuate they're having a bad time any chance you can lend a hand i'm on my way [Music] this is a nightmare how'd it get so bad so fast it's like someone deliberately freed all the most dangerous inmates this is worse than i ever imagined [Music] with the staff and the non-violent inmates i've gotta get those people out stick around a while okay here's one for the highlight reel to evacuate anyone who's not involved in the ride we should break dance fight instead huh you should

like that i'm supposed to be the funny one doggy on a leash here's one for the highlight reel and of course the daily spiderman help me let's see this again in slow motion you're starting to get predictable we should break dance fight instead you should see me do the worm [Music] and the judges give spidey a perfect score men menkin right you work for oscorp i'll try not to hold that against you what happened here it was cassidy we tried treating him with an experiment don't i know what you and fisk were up to using these people as guinea pigs okay fine fine but the danger's real cassidy changed into something horrible deadly and he wants to make more like him how do i stop cassidy uh i'm not sure you can you'd have to overwhelm the symbiote we injected him with stop it from functioning inflict too much damage for it to handle perhaps with fire or intense vibrations it's all theoretical we plan further studies but [Music] what did this nutball cocktail of yours due to it i don't fully understand it but like everything else the goal was to cure the osbornes in this case by creating organic intelligent life forms nanites that rely on the body survival for their own now listen to me any disease any damage they can recognize and heal as well as protect and defend the host symbiotic relationship more cassidy's a loony psycho killer when did he turn into a social butterfly he had an abusive father absent mother he was always jealous of other kids with loving stable families so he's trying to create one yes out of the most dangerous inmates at ravencroft he wants to build a family in his image i'll get you outside which is more than you deserve but then i have to go after cassidy i agree he's headed for the sub basements where the most damaged inmates are kept now if he makes them into beings like him no place will be safe okay i'm fine from here my car's outside get to a hospital tell the police everything or after i'm done with cassidy i'll come looking for you oh heavy-duty security i wonder what they had here i get the feeling something seriously wrong was going on here now take some time to think about what you did wrong that water's got a live current in it i'll stay on high ground that was fun let's do it again [Music] got the spider what's that a little ionic weapon deep inside you're just a scared kid aren't you that you're not on the outside ionic webbing makes everything better i might just have a future at this [Music] um electrical equipment burn marks i bet this is where they held max dylan i get the feeling there's something behind that wreckage spider-man i thought he was my friend i thought he cared he heard me bad he said i was his eyes and ears but he lied they all lie i know what he can do now he won't trick me this time he'll never send me back to ravencroft and he can't kill me energy can't be created or destroyed only transformed and i've only just begun transforming [Music] [Music] uh gotta stay out of that water or i'm gonna get one heck of a jolt uh [Music] [Music] the venom project great why is it never the puppy project or the chocolate project [Music] [Music] gotta stop cassidy before he makes things even worse now you're trapped in my web little spider don't fear the darkness let it in then you'll be like me i think i'm my true self spiderman and you can too i'll show you how i know what it's like to be part of something bigger you'll find out soon soon there are two those who are like me and those who are dead which one are you blast has a way of bringing people together on the floor how on earth is that actually it doesn't look like anything from earth i've never seen anything so horrible in my life [Music] that is the most disgusting thing i've ever seen [Music] can't leave now people are in trouble [Music] tracity that's as far as you go one of you is already too many i'm not cletus cassidy not anymore i'm my true self now i'm carnage this is it personal i just poor little spider you're just not ready to see the truth are you i didn't web up your mouth because i don't want you to suffocate but you're starting to talk me out of it see you think you're joking but i know what you won't admit to yourself when i killed those criminals you were happy you were grateful to me weren't you no i it's not too late to understand i'll tell you whatever you want to know you say you're searching for answers in death but what were you trying to do when i stopped you make others like you a family so we can spread the message the truth that chaos and death are the only wrong you're trying to create a family because you never had one you weren't looking for death cletus you wanted the life you never had now who's not seeing the truth you said you killed to understand death what are you trying to understand the meaning the truth the secrets it reveals about all of us that we're afraid to see i can tell you that death is a part of life it happens sometimes for a reason sometimes for no reason you're wasting your time looking for some cosmic answer in death life is where you find meaning and buddy you've wasted yours what makes you think i'm anything like you you wanted to do what i did end those criminals forever that's true i didn't want to admit it but i'd be lying if i said i didn't feel that way i knew it but that's human anger wanting revenge it's not wrong to feel emotions like that it's wrong to act on them here's the real difference between us spider-man i'm at peace with who i am you shouldn't be and you should then why aren't you sorry cletus i just figured out talking to a psycho killer isn't gonna give me the answers i'm after i know what will death hey you'll be less nervous if you picture me naked you know what that's weird don't do that what i was always meant to be [Music] you we'll wake everyone up i wish why are you fighting me practically already is to stop people like you is don't want to be alone again please just let me die that's not the answer cletus none of us are gonna find any answers here what's the matter peter you look like you lost your last friend hey but i know for a fact you've still got at least one it's uncle ben i miss him so much i just feel lost without him he raised me i loved him and he died because he was looking for me i'm not sure how to live with that let me ask you something pilgrim your uncle ben he was one of the best people i ever knew everyone loved him he had an amazing life right so why do you want to make it all about how it ended what counts isn't how he died peter what matters is really the way he lived i i want you to make his life mean something i want you to be the man he raised you to be the man that he was so proud of when he saw what you were growing into he told you that all the time your uncle knew what a tough place the world could be he knew that it needs heroes and hey take it from me you are one of those heroes so what do you say are you gonna go out there and prove it i want you to do it for uncle ben and for me yeah yeah stan i will i miss uncle ben i'll always miss him but i don't have to replace him because he already gave me everything i needed now it's up to me to honor his memory by using what he gave me in a way that will make him proud nuff said naf said [Music] oh you can rely on me mr mayor i consider it my honor to provide any help i can then what happened to young osborne is tragic but never fear i'll continue to finance the task force myself and at the risk of seeming overconfident promise you with the criminal organizations that plagued our city crushed the crime rate will go down to a manageable level yeah goodbye [Music] there you are they're coming my friend come in i couldn't have done this without you chameleon what happens now now the real work begins [Music] you
