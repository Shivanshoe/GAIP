this is insane how did mary get her hands on this kind of tech it takes a sick mind to come up with killer microchips perhaps a disease mind but definitely an ingenious one perfect psych profile for a group like zero day wouldn't you say her affiliations aren't my priority bagley she's keeping these people enslaved and it sounds as if she's selling them this is huge [ __ ] this is a dystopian nightmare right whether you toe the line as a slave what's zach she triggers that microchip and you're a pile of spare parts dedsec we'll have to crash that slave auction get all the information we can out of there the location will be on the invitations she hasn't sent out the invitation yet but when she does badly monitor the drone networks give us a heads up when mary sends out her fleet until then i reckon we're in a holding pattern i'll get in touch if i hear about anything else that might interest you cheers dedsec [Music] all right since we're waiting for our cordial invitation to marry kelly's tasteless theme party we can finally get back to what really matters solving the mystery of zero day who are they and why do they frame dedsec for the bombings bagley what have you got glad you asked today the great ai detective has two leads for his dog's body politic obviously albion needs looking into but i also have a more unusual thread for you to pull on there's a new hacktivist group on the dark web scene called the 404 but instead of being in it for the lulls this lot seems to be in it for the brutal reshaping of society by any means necessary sound like anyone you know all right i've got some options then i've marked both on your optic i found a potential recruit for you drop in a pin on your map [Applause] london this is 404 the first peer-to-peer activist network all are welcome if you want to make a difference join us we're taking down the elite one contract at a time i found that on the dark web looks like all the cool kids are forming hacker groups these days but this 404 might actually come in handy in our fight if all are welcome that means we are too i say we infiltrate four or four we get their connections we get their assets if you play nice they might even help you take out zero date that matter maybe they are zero day only one way to find out i found street view images of a ctos up that's been covered in 404 graffiti they're marking their territory like an over-excited chihuahua dropping the location of the hub on your map that's the ctos up there if you were listening to this it means you want to learn more about 404 know what we know do what we do make your way to the walkie-talkie club it's no big secret that the club is a fun for clan kelly but the place has all the secrets too more will be revealed there the hub just dumped a massive load of data into your optic how forward [Music] yeah mom what are you saying you have arrived at the walkie-talkie club where those with more money than sense come to lose both the walkie-talkie club is frequented by all manner of crooked elites and the owners clan kelly have an ai in place to collect blackmail materially find that ai and let's see for ourselves what these corrupt scumbags have to hide [Music] so yes [Music] huh i thought that was easy before very nice dead sec well you worked hard and persevered and now we have nothing the ai is not actually here just a relay sending the club's data off site i'll find where it's all going and you find a way out of this loud obnoxious sweat hole deal deal anymore i've done some digging and it looks like the facial recognition ai was created by brokertech brokertech they're one of the biggest software companies on the planet always keep their noses clean too if they're buying blackmail material from the kelly's that's big news everything the ai is collecting here is being sent directly to brokertech hq we have to go there to get the data you arrived at brokertech lead innovators in software and ai technology founded by ceo skye larsen when she was just 25. talk about an overachiever oh wow there's so much dirt buried in here it would be a shame if you know someone were to put it all online i believe that's exactly what our 404 friend has in mind i've got this [Music] ah huh foreign [Music] [Music] i have all the blackmail data and dear god people are disgusting i wonder how this family values politician politicians appreciate his s m sessions on public display oh well let's find out blackmail data is hereby leaked brilliant give me the kryptonite i'd say it's a thankless job but someone just sent us a video link named thank you.mp4 so at least it's a one thank job show me you have completed your first contract with 404 the dark web's first peer-to-peer hacktivist network i am

about meeting her are we she's giving me stab happy stalker vibes worth the risk in my opinion she seems like a real dead sex fan and i'd certainly rather have her as a friend than an enemy if she isn't with zero days she might know who is and if she is with zero day it's probably a trap either way we'll have new information agreed let's do it the thing you're after is around here is things may seem bleak now but a new society awaits you a society of peace is a chance to leave the trojans of the world behind things may seem bleak now but a new society awaits you a society of peace and

uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] everything you are is in your brain your love your fear your dreams even the cheeky ones are all electrical signals firing back and forth between your ears this right here is more powerful than any computer but it has its limitations i watched my mother succumb to motor neurone disease and her loss made me realize that death comes to us all but what if we could change that what if we could scan your brain and upload the neural map to the cloud that would mean the end of human suffering of death itself and the beginning of a new society where war oppression disease are all worries of the past hello my name is skye larsen i'm ceo of broca tech and this is daybreak now since all of you have signed up for our waitlist i'm sure you're eager to see how daybreak really works but before we do that i'll ask the technicians at the board to cut the live feed we wouldn't want any uninvited guests recording these trade secrets daybreak is an imaging system which scams uh [Music] there you have it dedsec the big contract you want to go after sky larsen as in the sky larson oh i want to do more than that problem is larson hasn't been seen in public in nearly two years and he can't kill a hologram i've been trying to track her down i've found a home here in london but that well you do know larson is a certified genius she's the queen of ai what in the world does she do that deserves killing plenty but you need to see for yourself a mansion's in westminster things you'll see in there she disconnected bags can you find skye larson's address of course i'll just crack open the yellow pages oh look there she is right under b for billionaires who obviously don't publicize their home address you sweet dumb baby i've narrowed it down to some james's square but that's the best i can do i bet now knows where it is we should call her tried already she's offline now it seemed pretty shaken when she talked about the larson mansion there must be something seriously wrong going on there [Music] hey i found skies no wait the property here is owned by someone called sky la what are the odds this house does not belong to sky larsen but why do you suppose they leave their front gate open sky larsen's residence is nearby let's see what i can find i told you to stay [ __ ] still stop i can't take it right you're right please stop defense possible suspect or suspects reportedly location control we are ready to engage thanks god brilliant negative no sign of the target yet no vision of target well this building has a not at all suspicious profile the property is owned by kakani medical but there are records of basement digging paid for by brokertech i believe you just found skylarson's london residence famously vacated two years ago after larsen stopped making public appearances i'd say a nice navally wellness check is about you wouldn't you [Music] uh hmm [Music] me is polishing the mandatory sentence [Music] welcome
