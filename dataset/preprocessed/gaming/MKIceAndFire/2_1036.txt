country like an invisible force field whatever thing right you're talking strategic defense right well that eclipse device is actually a satellite and when launched it'll allow armstrong to temporarily disable that safety net leaving our country defenseless that's what salome meant by borrowed time that's right nightshade 2.0 and he's launching it today as a demonstration for potential buyers liars who the hell would buy something like this terror groups rogue nations psychopaths with a lot of money they're plenty so he's planning on dropping this safety net giving anyone who wants to suck a punch us a free shot what are you doing is that dollar prayer good idea let me hop on the line when you're done i got a couple you know i mean things i want to throw in there i'm looking for
