we'll need more data to reconstruct the 4runner sequence let's find the remaining beacons [Music] [Music] let's go that's annex ridge a research outpost and judging by the strong 4runner signals i'm picking up a pretty successful one what do you think they found up there let's find out [Music] security they abandoned your vehicle you will soon join them [Applause] uh [Applause] [Music] foreign he's here [Music] i'm are this uh let's capture that fob feast on your flesh no more hostels around fab juliet i think we're ready to claim it capture confirmed another fob secured for the unsc look around you can see where the ring has been slowly trying to repair itself without the spire's help pretty impressive for six months huh imagine what it could do if we left it alone for i don't know a few million years still have some beacons left to find before the forerunner sequence is complete which one's next lc confirmed stand in mind so [Applause] if you can cover me i'll get it on [Music] acknowledged i've known the chief to do a lot of things over the years failing isn't typically one of them uh [Music] oh i will kill you myself [Music] right there [Music] we're in range of a high-value target it's a group of those skimmer creatures we don't know much about these guys but that never stopped you before right there's a beacon nearby we should check it out hello so so and yet i still stand up [Music] [Music] [Music] let's try that when we're not getting shot at this is a disgrace oh [Music] how dare you [Music] i will give me a second there we go countless preserved species have been sent back to start lives in you halo was the forerunners terrible and ultimate solution to the parasites relentless advance designed to destroy all sentient life nothing was allowed to survive and we were sure that nothing heard we were wrong this won't take long just one more to go right this we'll [Music] status status what happened chief something pushed back scanned me it's gone now are you sure yeah probably some sort of security protocol it's nothing let's go get the last one are you two okay what happened in there i don't know something scanned me probably fine probably or not really don't worry we can handle it [Music] we're in range of a high-value target it's a group of those skimmer creatures we don't know much about these guys but that never stopped you before right target eliminated now the crew [Music] great work chief you brought them all down and we've gained some valuable combat data about the little weirdos if we make it off this ring it'll be useful i doubt this is the last we'll see of these creatures oh [Applause] [Music] we lost left but we do have orders that's our mission now another fob platform chief claim it um banished force is eliminated fob hotels ready for liberation so chief thanks for the help spartan griffin fire team taurus glad to see you made it back off reach we've got to get the captain into the hangar bay can you help sure can be warned the hangers [Applause] let's move [Applause] there we go another fob is ours this one was built on one of the most active battlegrounds in the first 48 hours of the war unsc and banished records both suggest that it was absolute chaos it raged all over but nowhere quite as intensely as the island just north of us where we got shot down you might recall the data we've been gathering is fascinating but still incomplete one more beacon and we can bust that spire wide open i'm picking up a unsc distress signal not far from this location not so [Music] so come on reinforcements inbound those marines will live to fight another day i hope we see them back at the fobs [Music] i've made attempts to complete our forerunner dataset algorithmically but no luck no way around it we need to reach that final beacon hopping out coming up on the last are beacon please [Music] [Applause] [Music] sure [Music] [Music] hey so oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] we did it we actually did it not that i thought we wouldn't it's just it's nothing last one [Music] no no no this this is a trap she's trying to find out what i am trying to use me to break the deadlock start the spires my routines plus the monitors not good then we stop stalemate for now she's close eventually she'll find a way then we have no choice i've got you red flag nothing happened sorry maybe i'm going crazy or just paranoid did you say something back there it was nothing okay well we've got what we need let's head back to this fire we should be able to bypass the security now [Music] let's roll i survived six months on this ring i ain't dying up there foreign [Music] that's right what's up [Music] two ah [Applause] uh oh [Music] go go [Music] so [Music] home [Music] yes [Music] they never stood a chance [Music] it worked obviously i never doubted it for a second this structure under the ring calls itself the nexus the harbinger she's here good let's go say hello clear now down i guess you guess yeah this is all new fresh the nexus appears to be below the gravity lift into the spire we need to find it uh more banished how come they're here to protect the harbinger clearly will it work what do you think if i told you what i oh i get it sarcasm you're funny too [Music] [Music] oh you are finished [Applause] [Applause] leave me hmm [Applause] oh [Music] oh um that's one dead [Music] stays [Music] ah ah must be completed [Music] me is [Music] you
