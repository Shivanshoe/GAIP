holy crap thor where the hell did you come from i was serving the comments when it started reading bolts of metal from the skies it is unbelievably good to see you dramatic don't you think it doesn't matter he's here now you did what you were supposed to do thor you gave up your powers i'm everywhere hmm uh fruits so oh hello just like all times seems he missed me as well i see them focus on those mechs kamala you okay yep [Music] [Music] getting around them later don't worry she's up to it [Music] altitude so can you hold it up with wind turn the ship apart uh [Music] hurry this up boy again heading for the command deck [Music] um that you've been gone nice security subsystems just came back online it's working can you enable lockdown he knows we've got the inhumans and enough evidence to implicate them okay maybe you're just out of practice i can handle the large one myself [Music] do not do this ah hmm [Music] oh wait the damage has already been done avengers no one we're trying to restart the engines but there's not enough power we're out of time people brace for impact hey got a thunder stay behind me now bring it [Music] keep going it's working [Music] have you all completely lost your senses ah prodigal son returns you almost obliterated all of manhattan well holier than val where were you while the world went to hell coming to terms with my feelings not making news all right all right all right all right all right everyone just take a breath we planned on interrupting the aim experience showing the world what tarleton was up to they said tap toys of his they harvest their powers through the torture of these inhumans they expose them to near lethal amounts of dark terrigen and that is only step one georgie boy is gearing up for a war and what's worse is kamala here has found some evidence that might show what really happened to steve hi every hero has to start somewhere you remember me hi show me this footage jarvis are you done i've broken the encryptions so there is more to see george we have to shut down the reactor it's pulling us towards that heat signature but there's no way to disengage the crystal make it out and seal the door what george go this can't be right hey to the command deck what evacuate now no no no no cap what are you doing just stop what are you doing no cap smashed the reactor he had to have a reason what reason hundreds of people were infected people died not take it easy did you take some responsibility tony oh there's the bruce i know throw everyone under the bus why don't you no it's not the time no it's okay now see he's been waiting to do this since golden acres haven't you haven't you this is our fault all of ours how do you not get that what i get is that you actually believe all that crap you said at the hearing i believe that we are dangerous you really think the world is better without us yes i'm out of here you all have not changed look at her she can be fixed she can't be cured i've done the experiments i've checked our dna over and over and over again you and i created the perfect disease no actually i do the job i make the tough decisions dude i stand by the people who made me who i am i am warning you who you are what you are that's why monica got the better of you i was just agreeing with you big guy that banner is a challenge guys don't do this this is exactly what tarleton wants i'd say this one i guess that's it then i'm all alone not quite miss khan jarvis i assume you can keep this thing in the air for quite some time yes that's a relief without proof there's no hope but i can't just give up this can't be how it ends i can't believe i'm all alone in here live on the scene here in manhattan what we witnessed tonight is something this nation has lived in terror of for five years a tragedy on the scale of a day was narrowly avoided over the skies of new york thanks to the quick actions of advanced idea mechanics if not for the fast response of their defense forces the chimera would surely have crashed into manhattan doing untold damage to this densely populated city the avengers are indeed back but their motivations are unclear and their tactics as concerning as ever much of america rests uneasy tonight as they wonder where these once mighty heroes could appear next what their goals are and what kind of destruction they might leave in their way wow even the shield guys left maybe they thought hulk was gonna smash the place up jarvis is there a recording of bruce's interrogation of monica certainly miss you can access it in the interrogation anti-chamber if i may be so bold miss khan what do you hope to find in the interrogation footage i don't know i have to try something maybe she slipped up ames the real enemy i wish bruce and tony could see that no offense jarvis but i sure wish there was another person on board none taken miss kong okay interrogation footage there's got to be a clue here somewhere let me guess you're planning a big reveal at the adaptoid launch come on monica give me something scour the earth you will not find our lab the adaptoids will launch bruce saving the world requires sacrifice this is useless i just want to talk to my dad calling yusuf khan no no don't jarvis i didn't mean to hello are you guys that you oh oh come on if you're there i miss you so much look i'm not angry i just want you to come home i'm sorry i should never have told you to hide your powers perhaps you're scared a little unsure the important thing is that you always stay true to yourself i love you beta i love you more wow the adapters will launch scour the earth you will not find our lab scour the earth you will not find our lab scour the earth you will not scour the earth scour the earth that's it of course the satellite the satellite avengers if you can hear me i think i found a clue look i know i messed up i wanted to blame ames so bad for what happened to me on a day it blinded me the cap must have had a good reason for what he did i i know it people people believe in the avengers not just because of your cool powers but but because no matter how bad things get no matter how much you disagree you always come together don't you get it your differences are your greatest superpower [Music] i was just some weird kid from jersey who didn't fit in but you saw me for who i really was you accepted me there's still a bad guy out there who wants to hurt the world but we can stop him good isn't a thing you are it's a thing you do oh i'm sorry i shouldn't have said i get it altitude dry ice look i'm not very good at i'm sorry so same good so you uh found a clue yeah it's the interview listen scour the earth you will not find our lab okay monica's right the lab's not on earth i'm not following okay when i was captured monica and tarleton had this argument tarleton had to leave the room and then monica pulled up the coordinates to this satellite called ambrosia ambrosia that was a shield biomedical research project aim must have required it during the takeover it would be a great place to hide proof of inhuman experiments right if you wanted to study in humans on the cellular level zero gravity be a perfect place to do it good job okay so we know where we need to go we just need a way to get there project star booster as i recall you abandoned it because you couldn't generate enough acceleration in the auxiliary rockets yeah yeah no need to bore everyone with the details that was before i had access to mr shrinky jarvis get pim on the phone we need a way to get up to this space lab he's the only one who can help please tell me this is a social call yeah it is uh i'd like to socialize with a few of your pin particles you need to shrink down an accelerator well then you'll need to break into a high security aim facility ever heard of meridian you're gonna have a hard time getting in that place is no joke i gotta say you give a hell of a speech when you're pissed at us uh we were idiots as much as i love your squirming it sounds like we've got work to do i can get us to meridian us we're in this together right no time to lose [Music] aim confiscated all my research when i was captured they haven't figured out how to use the particles but they'll be well protected okay there aren't a lot of ways into meridian i think our best bet will be to hijack one of their hyper circuit trains and take it directly to the heart of the operation i can hack the trains but it'll leave the anthill exposed aim will be able to pinpoint our location you'll need to hurry so we go in loud and smash the base up good i prefer the direct approach in all my time undercover inside aim i never could get the clearance to see meridian well nat you're about to get your chance uploading the coordinates to the hyper circuit station entrance let's move out [Music] so how many super secret research bases does aim have too many but meridian is its most important one besides new york you nervous about using pims particle tech on your suit hang smart but if pim particles are unstable on their best day if he can get it working it might be just what we need so let's say hoping for a mirror you know i can still hear you right oh crap that we did it again sorry changing channels we can access the nearby equipment bunker if we shut down its energy look for a chest with gear nearby a resistance ally is in trouble nearby and needs your help but that stinks this guy's not getting back up [Music] y'all we've got this time i need someone i surprised huh bye [Music] from huh uh aim units on radar the local security system just disengaged nice thanks adventures theo work your magic you're safe now repositioning so there's the hyper circuit station it's protected by a force field destroy the field's power source and i'll hack into their system to call a train understood look for a chest containing special resources nearby [Applause] oh crap that's not good i don't like the sound of that running into some serious firewalls here i need more time ugh uh foreign [Music] but the whole place is an alert now really tony victory [Music] foreign [Music] one of my old aliases damn it aim has been spotted near the anthill we need that particle sample asap we may be out of time not yet we're almost there let's get what we came for there's meridian holy crap the abs have been busy i'm picking up a pin particle signature deeper in the base i'm updating your hud that's why i love you jarvis uh you guys are cute [Music] you
