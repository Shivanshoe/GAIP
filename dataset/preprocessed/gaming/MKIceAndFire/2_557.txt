go to the library and see what popo is up to [Music] so [Music] young people always drive themselves forward but it's important to take a step back and look around sometimes [Music] [Music] morning hey devila you keep running around like that you're gonna trip and fall on your face i think i'll be okay but thanks for the warning [Music] there's no better sight than children in high spirits it makes me feel young just looking at [Music] them if we turn this entire plaza into a field we could probably improve our food supply situation oh easier said than done though [Music] when you're knocked away you can defend to recover quickly [Music] visiting popola again today [Music] these books speak of ancient technology far beyond anything we could ever imagine what could have happened to this world [Music] good morning how's yona doing today her cough's still pretty bad that's worrisome i know i keep hoping she'll at least get a little better but i don't know i feel like i'm failing her oh stop that you're the finest brother a girl could hope to have anyway i was hoping you might take care of this for me i got a request from someone in the shopping district they need you to get some mutton from the northern plains got it i'm on my way since you're going to the plains let me give you a map trust me it'll come in handy [Music] oh and one more thing would you mind purchasing three medicinal herbs from the client while you're at it i used my last one earlier here's some money hopefully this is way too much well then buy some freona while you're at it you don't have to it's okay really thanks popola for everything what's this all about just the way you and the other villagers always take care of us we really appreciated us all think nothing of it people need to look out for each other right besides everyone here wants to see jonah healthy and happy so hang in there okay i will [Music] asked me to organize the books but i had no idea there were so many i never should have taken this job [Music] yonah oh hey jonah you're supposed to be in bed see now your ribbon's all undone i'm sorry i just thought i'd see if the library had any books about how to cure my sickness jonah look don't worry you're gonna be fine you just need to eat and rest if you take good care of yourself you'll get better you really think so i know so anyway i've got work to do so i need you to head home deal deal [Music] people say the world is dying populations continue to fall while plague and disease run rampant [Music] if that wasn't enough monsters called shades now roam the land as well threatening our very lives but i can't let any of that distract me [Music] my sister is sick and my only goal is to ensure that the two of us survive it's not easy for a pair of kids to live on their own [Music] but the villagers have been kind to us and despite everything somehow i feel like we're gonna be okay we have to be there's no other choice [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] me and [Music] hey i better get this mutton back to the [Music] village [Music] [Music] oh [Music] damn what are shades doing so close to town [Music] i had no idea shades were loose so close to the village [Music] hey i can't even go hunting in peace anymore time to get this meat to the shopkeeper [Music] great [Music] [Music] here's that mutton you wanted oh thank you you wouldn't believe how popular this stuff has been lately oh and this isn't much but i'd like you to have it and tell popola i said thanks okay you got it [Music] make sure you stock up on necessities before heading out to hunt [Music] do [Music] so [Music] come back anytime [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] i delivered the mutton oh and here's your herbs great that should help with the food shortage and thanks for the herbs too that's all for today you should hurry back to yonah thanks [Music] uh [Music] welcome home how'd it go today anything exciting happen because i just stayed here all day like you told me to i tried reading books but i finished all of them so if you have any fun stories you should tell me hmm well popola told me about a legendary flower called a lunar tear have you heard of it that's a silly name i guess but people say finding one will make you rich beyond your wildest dreams if i ever found one i'd buy you so many cookies your stomach would hurt could a lunar tear make me better sure with that kind of money we could buy the best medicine around the kind that'll cure anything jonah what's wrong it's nothing [Music] goodnight [Music] okay i'm off to popolis see you later and please stay out of trouble today okay [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] hey popola need a hand with anything i do have something but i don't know it's going to be a bit of an ordeal i'm sure i can handle it aren't you confident well you know the little wooden bridge out in the northern plains right the one where the pillars all rotted out exactly we had a team of carpenters working on it but they were attacked by shades wait really but it's so sunny there yes i know apparently it was overcast that day and the shades caught them off guard one of the carpenters was seriously injured but they can't move him so long as the shades are there i'll go take him out if you're up for it it could be really dangerous i'll be fine popola i've been training every day i'm as strong as anyone in the village heck i killed a bunch of shades by the village gate just yesterday oh that's a bit disconcerting anyway are you sure you want to take this job yep i got this [Music] seems like people did nothing but write books in the old days and i can't read them either they're all written in funny languages [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all of them that should take care of the shades for a while [Music] [Music] what [Music] you're back hey popola did everything go all right were you hurt i'm fine oh thank goodness i was so worried i felt like i sent you into a really dangerous situation and if something had hope a lot look at me i'm fine i know it's just i'm just relieved as all oh here those carpenters left some money for you wow thanks go buy something nice for yonah okay [Music] oh speaking of yonah she came by this afternoon what she was supposed to stay home i think it's okay she just wanted to ask me a question about what she was asking about the outside world you mean outside the village exactly she seemed excited too poor thing was talking a mile a minute she's probably been getting nutty ideas from some book again don't worry i made sure to remind her she isn't allowed beyond the gates thanks but she was worried about you so you'd better hurry home yeah i will thanks again [Music] do [Music] hmm [Music] yonah where'd she go maybe she's still at the library [Music] so [Music] [Music] doesn't look like she's here i'd better go ask popola hey popola i can't find yonah really you have any idea where she might be she stopped by earlier today but that was a while ago did she say anything she just asked if i knew where lunar tears grow she's so cute i told her how they used to grow around the lost shrine long ago why is jonah asking about lunar tears oh crap what's wrong yesterday i told her that story about how lunar tears can make you rich oh then we got to talking about how we could use the money to buy medicine to make her better you don't think she i think that's exactly what she did i have to go find her what's the fastest way to the last shrine through the eastern gate got it thanks jonah i have to get to the eastern gate [Music] i have to find yonah i should check the eastern gate what's that i can't believe this she really went to the lost shrine [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] [Music] look at this rock slide there's no way yona could have made it past here maybe she found some other way in [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] so [Music] what [Music] sweden [Music] dc [Music] i'm coming [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] there are shades here too she'll never make it out of here [Music] so [Music] huh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] do [Music] oh [Music] [Music] whoops [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] yep [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] yep all right looks like you can get outside from here [Music] sleep [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] that ladder's broken i could probably get up there if i had something to stand on [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] see [Music] what is it with these things [Music] [Music] i don't have time for this i have to save jonah give her back [Music] get out of my way give my sister back oh ugh for the love of all that is holy would you please stop pounding me then move yoda by the heavens i have never been treated in such a manner i am a being of incalculable importance and yet you approach me as a common cockroach jonah say something jonah this is why i loathe dealing with people now here i admire your pluck one young man doing it alone against impossible odds come on yonah but such a plan is incredibly foolish you stand in the presence of ancient wisdom i am a text of the darkest most arcane type and i could be of great assistance to you you're a what indeed i could swat these mindless creatures like mere flies were i so implied i am grimoire vice my very name brings kingdoms to their knees i will grant you one final chance bow your head and accept my power or go it alone and fail there so how do we save yonah once i destroy these shades the magic barrier preventing your passage should simply disappear [Music] you can really do that i am grimoire vice my very name brings kingdoms to their knees do it already vice you will refer to me by my full and proper name just keep coming you shouldn't have turned your blade on me pal creatures with a single word i grimoire pies shatter the very universe itself now prepare to prepare to oh dear it seems that the frantic bludgeoning you gave me earlier has caused my memory to me escape me are you for real you are not nearly as helpful as you claim to be uh did you just soak the blood out of those things you all right vice hang in there it would seem i can regain my powers by defeating these monsters is this magic magic indeed this is the true power of grimoire fights hold on yonah i'm coming yes is that all of them [Music] it seems our task is going to be more difficult than i first envisioned look how these foolish creatures charge heedlessly into battle still dealing with both of them at once may prove to be a daunting task it's a defensive barrier that sounds bad enemies with such barriers are impervious to both weapons and magic like i said bad that said the enemy cannot move so long as the barrier is in place focus your attacks on the other now put it out of its misery is this more of your power are you sure you know what you're doing now is your chance attack with all your might [Music] do [Music] they are not but a horde of faceless minions swat them aside focus on the small ones first one to go keep your gun up [Music] so yonah i'm sorry i didn't mean to i just wanted to help i'm the one who's sorry you must have been scared out of your mind are you okay um perhaps we'd best depart the shrine's about to collapse come on yonah let's go you're faster than i thought i tried i really did but i couldn't find a lunar tear and i'm so sorry i i just wanted to make you rich and get rid of this disease i'm sorry don't worry about jonah what's going on she has the black scroll yeah when did this happen the weird coughing started about a month or so ago the disease curses the afflicted with strange runic symbols that gradually spread over the entire body and i fear it is fatal yeah i know oh yonah come it's best to let us sleep [Music] so this is so unfair jonah hasn't done anything why do terrible things keep happening to us i would gladly help the last by the means to do so she's just a little kid she doesn't deserve this oh you're back i was worried about you i heard you went through the eastern gate and wait is that a book yeah it's now see here i am grimoire vice and you will treat me with a proper respect wait your grimoire vice hold on what you know him of course he's the white book i was just singing about he's in your song yeah the song of the ancients it's an old tune that's been passed down through generations of villagers it's in a forgotten language so i doubt you could make much sense out of it do you know what it means well it's not like i studied it or anything but i can tell you bits and pieces there's this terrible black book that shows up and starts spreading disease all over the place but then this white book appears and saves the world and everyone's happy you know how it goes what is it uh it's nothing so how exactly does this white book save the world it's just a song yeah i don't really know the details ah oh be sad look why don't you go ask popola she's got a big brain maybe she knows something that's a good idea thanks [Music] a white book a black book and disease is something the matter no i was just thinking [Music] i heard about yonah i i don't know what to say i'm so sorry well maybe you can help what do you know about the song that devila was singing wait is that grimoire vice you know vice finally someone who appreciates quality when they see it yes well the song of the ancients let's see [Music] when the great black book grimoire noir brings calamity upon the world the white book grimoire vice will appear with his sealed verses [Music] he will then use them to vanquish grim war noir and purged the calamity he wrought or so the legend goes what's a sealed verse no such records remain so i can't say for sure but they seem to resemble some form of magic [Music] magic that's it uh what is so the song says grimore vice purchased the world of this calamity right and he does so using these sealed verses oh and do you believe the matter i infused in the shrine is one of these sealed verses exactly vice with your power we can cure yonah guys don't get too excited this is just some old legend hey vice was just some old legend yesterday but here he is and if he's real the rest of it must be too he can cure the black scroll i know he can do we know anything regarding the whereabouts of this grimoire noir sorry but there's nothing about that in any of the records all i can say for sure is that there are a number of sealed verses out there also it appears the shades you fight and these verses are intrinsically linked then we'll go kill every shade we can find no that's far too dangerous what an absurdly reckless plan so i should just do nothing while jonah suffers i don't think so but well it's clear i won't be able to talk you out of this so i've heard the shades are gathering near a village called the arie it's past the bridge on the northern plains they should be done with the repairs by now i marked it on your map for you maybe you could find one of the sealed verses there [Music] once you arrive be sure to speak to the village chief he lives in the house up on the highest point in the area got it and be careful [Music] so [Music] [Music] i must say that song of the ancients is a rather catchy number i can see why the birds kept it alive through the eons yeah it's a real toe tapper wait do you even have toes [Music] hey do you have time to take this parcel to the airy friend of mine helped me out and i want to give him something special sure thing oh and this is really fragile so you need to be careful okay don't go rolling around or getting knocked over or anything like that you'll need to take it to the chief's house in the area it's the house at the highest point in the village [Music] ah crap that did not sound good i think we broke something well there is little point in finishing the delivery now let's go back and apologize yeah i'm so sorry but your package got damaged during delivery yeah i thought that might happen should have bought the guy a nice steel rod or something anyway i've got another one here so maybe you could try the delivery again [Music] hey can i ask a favor i'm currently on duty and i need someone to relay a message for me i ordered some training weapons from the blacksmith's wife but they still haven't arrived can you go to the shopping district and ask her to send him over thank you so much please give the blacksmith's wife my regards will ya [Music] [Music] so hey there uh is something wrong you don't look too happy yeah i'm in a bit of a pickle listen you know about the chickens we keep in the village right lately their eggs have been disappearing at first i thought it was a thief but now i think the hens are just hiding them i guess i can't blame them but the village really needs though i need you to find the hiding spots and bring me an egg that work for you these chickens sound pretty smart yeah they're clever little buggers anyway just ask around i bet someone in town will have an idea where to look [Music] oh hello what perfect timing can i ask you to go buy something for me sure what do you need i need three tulip bulbs they only sell them in seafront so it'll be a bit of a hike do you often get asked to handle such in-name shopping trips i don't think these trips are inane yona and i survive on the wages i earn from these jobs everyone has it tough around here but they still manage to give me work honestly i'm grateful for it i see well then keep up the good work i will ah your sight for sore eyes could i ask you to handle some work for me sure what's up my children want to eat mutton every night and i keep running out and i certainly don't have time to hunt a bunch of sheep look if you can get me 10 pieces of mutton i'll pay you higher than market value how's that sound sounds great i'll be right back how dare you make me hunt down goats they're not goats they're sheep what is the difference they're totally different the white fluffy ones are sheep and the scrawny hairy ones are goats people are different as well yet you're all just called humans yeah yeah please get that button my kids are driving me crazy you're looking for chicken eggs i saw one hidden in the shadows once [Music] uh that really doesn't narrow it down there are shadows everywhere [Music] we've got some nice materials in stock if you want to take a look [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] thanks [Music] hi there the guard at the northern gate says he ordered some weapons from you any idea where they are oh you know i did have an order for that huh i completely forgot thanks for the reminder dear here's a little something for the trouble welcome we've got a wonderful line of weapons to choose from [Music] [Music] thanks for your support [Music] [Music] oh thank the gods you're here we've got trouble what kind of trouble there's a wild boar in the northern plains who started attacking villagers the victims all made it back but who knows if we'll be so lucky next time so you want me to go take care of it yes and we'll be sure to pay you well sounds good to me oh and a word of advice once you kill it make sure you take a bore tusk let's just say it'll come in handy the chickens in this village like to lay their eggs in high places for some reason maybe that'll help you find where they're heading hmm maybe we should check out the fountain by the library [Music] be careful if you head north sheep hunting there really is no task too immodest for you hey it's harder than it sounds they're really squirrely and they run away fast so smite them with magic what is it shades no you're right if i use magic i don't have to get close might i make another suggestion what do not yell and every time you come to a realization you can save yonavice heck maybe you can save the whole world can i though i wonder i guess i won't use you for kindling after all you really should treat omnipotent magical beings with more respect [Music] wow [Music] [Music] again [Music] [Music] hello [Music] ah crap that did not sound good i think we broke something well there is little point in finishing the delivery now best rebecca apologize yeah i guess [Music] hey it's a wild boar have you the skill to hunt one of those down i don't know they look pretty strong [Music] this is impossible [Music] so [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah i thought that might do you not fear these shades of course i'd be stupid not to but i have to save yonah no matter what i see then i won't try to stop you you're a pretty good listener for such an old-timer vice i should be offended [Music] [Music] it appears to be deserted [Music] ah is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] this is a weird place for a village how are we supposed to reach the chief's [Music] house [Music] crap that did not sound good i think we broke something [Music] well there is little point in finishing the delivery now let's go back and apologize [Music] yeah i guess [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] is anyone even here [Music] i can't take it anymore [Music] kylie must not be brought to the village [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] dude [Music] [Music] huh [Music] oh [Music] hello [Music] builders [Music] it's dark in here [Music] so [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] we don't trust your kind [Music] [Music] food [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] um i'm looking for someone who knows about the sealed versus you just like her like kindness well this appears to be a glorious waste of time hey there leave our village at once what please just listen to me first you are cursed [Music] this must be the chief's house who goes there well we're be calm strangers [Music] hello sir i have a package for you it's broken go away what guess we'd better go back and tell the client what happened [Music] it would appear there are no powerful shades here the sealed verses would never be found in such a place yeah let's go talk to popla and figure out a new plan [Music] um [Music] leave before you get hurt there's no reason to go on leave our village at once you bring death to this village [Music] so [Music] so [Music] wow [Music] the heck is that [Music] nice flowers those are luna tears legendary flowers of almost perfect beauty you're kidding those are the ones i told yona about hands off the flowers uh vice why is that lady in her underwear i fear we have greater issues to deal with wait is she a shade [Music]  i knew this would happen [Music] this woman is certainly not to be trifled with did we get here [Music] [Music] [Music] heck the girl wields magic [Music] oh come on are you serious what the heck is going on here [Music] stay out of my way he's my idiots [Music] hold back until we have a chance to approach [Music] you just spat something out those are those are these guys shades too i didn't know shades could get that big the scale of this one is like nothing you've encountered god [Music] died let's just focus on defeating this thing [Music] [Music] [Music] here uh [Music] um thanks i told you to stay out of the way [Music] [Music] uh get back here [Music] the symbols are disappearing huh is she human this one has been possessed by a shade she exists as neither fully human nor other i feel bad for treating her like one of those things we have to help her you're awake you i'm sorry we attacked you we thought you were a shade well you're half right now get the hell out of here now see here we made our apologies and came to your aid the least you can do is grace us with your name it's okay vice she's probably just exhausted my name's kaine ah the name we heard back in the village look nothing good is gonna happen if you stick with me so do like i said and go get lost already would you get lost all right oh and one more thing that monster back there it's mine stay the hell away from it a half human and a giant shade she's kind of pretty but she's really intense [Music] we need a new plan maybe popola knows something [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] there must be a sealed verse inside that enormous shade i'm certain of it maybe but there's no way we can take that thing on now i need to get stronger [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] a giant shade in the area yeah it took all we had just to chase it off i wish there was some way to strengthen my weapon you know there's a little shop at the entrance to the junk heap that might be able to help if you bring them materials they should be able to use them to enhance your weapons interesting guess i'll check it out oh but it won't be free you know i figure you'll need around a thousand gold or so a thousand gold if you need money try visiting the tavern that's usually where people go when they're looking to hire someone good advice thanks [Music] ah good just the man i needed could you gather two medicinal herbs from the northern plains for me i've been exhausted lately and i need a boost they usually grow in patches of grass or by the bases of trees i don't think they'll be too hard to find two medicinal herbs you got it [Music] thanks for securing those herbs for me i must be getting old if i need this stuff [Music] might as well check out the tavern [Music] the chickens in this village like to lay their eggs [Music] you hunted down the bore oh thank you and it looks like you found a boar tusk too they say boars become tame around folks who carry one of those apparently they'll even let you ride around on their backs sounds like hokum to me but if you're brave enough you might as well give it a shot [Music] here's your mutton ma'am oh thank you i swear these children of mine just loved their mutton if you ever find any more i'll be happy to buy it [Music] please get that button [Music] you're looking for chicken egg uh that really the black squalls do you know about the lost shrine off to the east it's a large stone building surrounded by cliffs folks say you can find a number of unusual ores there but it's a rough area and most of us don't have the guts to try [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hey you got a moment because i've got some work for you if it's paid work i'm all ears fair enough listen my grandmother is running low on medicine and i need you to gather some ingredients i need three medicinal herbs three berries and three royal ferns you may have to leave the village to find some of it though so i hope it's not too much of a bother no problem i'll be right back that's three medicinal herbs three berries and three royal you taking it easy today i hardly ever see you around here this time of day hey there want to let a girl buy you a drink uh i'm not old enough to drink devila also isn't it morning when the sun never sets what difference does it make ah never mind you'll understand when you get older i do love this tavern though it's the nerve center of the whole village folks come here to relax or swap stories or even look for work come back whenever you have a free minute is there really nothing that can cure the black scroll no medicine in the works of man can hope to stand against it there has to be something out there perhaps a drug exists to temporarily ease the pain but none can truly eradicate the disease [Music] but if the legend is true then i hold the key to saving your sister you're right we're gonna save jonah and cure the black scroll that's the spirit lad look at that no wonder they've been so hard to find [Music] you
