[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] ah moms oh well then ready to hit the books again go on [Music] well then ready to hit the books again go on well then ready to hit the books again go on that's what I like to hear you should study up and surprise your father with your genius when he gets back yeah shifting hurry back dad we missed you [Music] roughly a year and a half had passed since the fight with a dreadful Frieza but there was still no sign of Goku returning to earth the world had entered a period of peace that peace however was to be short-lived as a new threat was rapidly approaching the planet Oh everyone's here already grilling you felt it too right it's Frieza and someone else with enormous power like his yeah kind of hard not to notice there's no way we're gonna miss a massive energy reading like that this can't be good do you really think it's Frieza well sure seems like it they'll know we're here if you don't quit your foolish babbling and lower your power levels they have Scouters after all the namekians already lowered his at least one of you is smart piccolo they're here they land it over there it's Freesat it's gotta be I can't believe he's still alive hold on I think there's someone else with him do not fly there got it we can avoid Scouter detection by simply walking up to them you guys have actually fought against someone with this much power we supposed to do once we get close to him you'd rather stay back here and rot is that it suit yourself all of us know what we're up against just to be perfectly clear birth is completely done for this can't be happening [Music] in the world did Frieza survive [Music] Kakarot why didn't he finish that bastard off and to think we're going up against him [Music] first we'll move it on foot of course [Music] man the closer we get the heavier the air seems to get we're almost at his ship are you sure you're ready for this yes so this is earth I've seen worse hunks of rock it seems this Super Saiyan Goku you keep going on about is set to arrive here in three hours so you intend to wait for him Fraser why of course father but I want him to suffer for what he did to me so I think I'll slaughter every last one of his beloved Earthlings I couldn't care less about the Earthlings but we do absolutely need to rid ourselves of that Super Saiyan by any means necessary hmm and what brings you here earthly I'm here to kill you the mysterious savior from the future what's that now you're here to kill us you say eliminate him well now it seems you've got some skill come at me with everything you've got unlike Goku I won't take it easy on you Goku oh I see so you're an ally he's never met the guy only know him by name idea you do realize that killing my men puts you in grave danger do you not now I have to kill you myself you miscalculated a miscalculation who I beg to differ wiping you and the rest of the field from this planet would be child's play that's not what I meant you're about to find out what it's like to fight a real Super Saiyan and I'm not talking about Goku there's another one right here [Music] [Music] [Music] to be holding anything back [Music] [Music] how is this possible Frieza impossible [Applause] those two huge powers they're both gone the world is going on one way to find out [Music] keep your guard up we don't know who we're up against right I'm gonna head over there and wait for Goku you're more than welcome to join me how does he know about my dad he's gonna show up right over there if you're coming then follow me so do we do I'm I'm gonna follow him yeah meet you I'm going to find out who this creep is [Music] you like a bad guy [Music] um so how do you know my dad well I've only heard about him I haven't had the privilege of actually meeting him yet oh really so hey how do you know when Goku is coming back well I'm I'm afraid I can't tell you that I'm sorry so can I ask you are Super Saiyan when you beat Frieza earlier weren't you how did you do that unfortunately I can't tell you that either sorry what's your name that too you can't even tell us your name well what about your age I'm 17 so you can tell us your age but that's all I can tell you I really uh well I guess it doesn't matter you saved the earth after all it'll be another three hours before Goku gets here so please just hang tight a little bit longer [Music] he should be here soon huh cuckoo dad how'd you guys know I was gonna be here this young man here clue to thin who is he do you mean you don't know who this is at all nope never seen him before that reminds me who took care of Frieza and the others that was some crazy energy we've got him to thank for that as well you made quick work of them by becoming a Super Saiyan a Super Saiyan Goku I need to speak with you in private if you don't mind with me yeah sure hey what's the big deal you're gonna keep us in the dark sorry guys just hang tight for a bit okay [Music] I guess I'd better go talk to him [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay let's see what he has to say [Music] I need to know something are you able to become a Super Saiyan it will yeah I mean I couldn't at first but I can control it pretty good now that's great now I have to ask would you mind transforming for me now you got it that's good so what now now I'll become a Super Saiyan two and I'd like you to fight me and I won't go easy fine by me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey I can see your feet it freezes so easily he told [Music] if you only had arrived here earlier some reason [Applause] I know a little technique called into the transmission instant transmission [Music] just changed history no reason history amazing you're just as good as I heard no better even okay I'll tell you everything but please it's important that you make sure not to tell anyone else what I'm about to tell you gotcha don't worry talk away your secrets are safe with me it might be difficult to believe what I'm about to say but I've come here from 20 years into the future using a time machine the future 20 years from now my name is trunks I'm Vegeta's son what Vegeta son actually now that you mention it you do kind of look like him I'm gonna be born two and a half years from now but that's not why I came here there's something much more important I need to tell you so please listen huh oh right three years from now on May 12th at around 10 a.m. two incredibly powerful figures will appear on an island five and a half miles southwest from South City who are they are they aliens no they're Androids they were created by a mad scientist from the former red ribbon army named dr. Shiro a red ribbon army that's right the same one you took down many years ago oh yeah when I was just a little guy I thought I got rid of those guys a while ago like unfortunately dr. Shiro survived and continued his research so what's he after world domination or something else crazy I'm not entirely sure but it's possible that was his end goal but his androids were designed to be killing machines and they have meaning the androids were free to kill and destroy to their heart's content it's been just me against the two of them I struggled to make it out alive wait what happened to everybody else they're calling 20 years from now I'm the only fighter left in the fight three years from now my father over there Krillin piccolo everyone is killed only Gohan managed to make it out alive he taught me how to fight four years before I came here in the time machine as you know with piccolo gone the Dragon Balls could no longer be used meaning we couldn't bring anyone back once they were killed the androids unquenchable lust for bloodshed eventually turned the world into a nightmarish hellscape they're too strong nothing can take them down hey wait hold up a sec what about me they didn't kill me - did they even you couldn't join in the fight not too long from now you'll fall prey to a severe heart virus well this is a pickle I'm guessing Senzu beans won't work huh man this sucks on so many levels I can't believe I'm gonna die in such a lame way I really wanted to fight those guys yeah you're disappointed you can't fight them are you scared well yeah I'm scared but you said they're crazy strong right of course I want to fight them I see you really are a true saying warrior aren't you here when you start to see symptoms take this it's a medicine developed 20 years from now it should keep you alive whoa really awesome thanks normally history shouldn't be changed but I've got to do whatever I can to prevent those atrocities from coming to pass my mother always spoke very well of you she knew you'd help us that's what pushed her to complete the time machine wait your mother she knows who I am yes she knows you well wait you said she built a time machine isn't that right and the only person I know who can do that is no way your mom isn't yes she's right over there [Music] h-how'd of all the stuff you just told me that's got to be the craziest I thought she'd stick with the option to think she'd end up with Vegeta of all people I mean it just makes no sense please make sure not to tell anyone I can't have people knowing who I really am if you do well I might never be boring oh yeah right mum's the word well I'd better get going back to my own time I need to let my mother know how everything went here hey are we gonna see you again making a round trip in the time machine requires a lot of energy so it'll take some time if I can survive until then I'll definitely come back to lend my support three years from now stay alive what a great new goal now I'm gonna start training extra hard for the next three years [Music] [Music] well now I just got to figure out what to tell everybody about this stuff hey Goku we just saw that guy take off where did he go Oh him yeah he uh I guess you could say he went back home went back home so just who is this guy uh he he uh well peace hey isn't there something more important you should be telling us huh if you can't find the words then allow me to help you what you mean you heard my sense of hearing is leagues above any of yours relax alright I won't say anything that could possibly endanger him we're not going in and prepared if we die it won't be for lack of skill we die what are you saying on the hunt for the Androids piccolo explained the situation being careful to avoid revealing anything that could expose trunks identity the others could do little to hide their shock at what he had to say about the terrifying truth regarding the two androids that would appear three years from now in order to prevent history from plunging into darkness everyone made the decision to train for the upcoming fight against the androids androids huh man I never thought I'd hear anybody mentioned the red ribbon army again was that young man really from the future I'm just as shocked as all of you but I actually think we can trust this guy Kakarot spill it how did you get off planet namek alive right we've been going crazy wondering what happened to you yeah for a second or two I thought I was done for but then right at the last second I somehow managed to find a spaceship that's right begin you forces you took one of their ships but when I jumped in and started to fly away the spaceship took me to a planet called yard ran those game you goons had attacked yard right before so they must have had that as the destination so that explains the getup I'm guessing that's what the yard rats wear yep they were all super friendly they gave me these clothes since mine were torn up pretty bad I find it extremely hard to believe that you came back from your drive empty-handed those freaks maybe week they have strange powers you picked up some of them right bingo I wanted to learn a lot more but they really only had time to teach me one technique of theirs it's called instant transmission transmission yep instant transmission the weird thing is is that you have to home in on the energy of a person not a place so you can't warp to a place unless you know someone there that's one heck of a downside huh it's not much of a downside if you asked me well I guess there's nothing you can't do now huh all right I guess we'll all see each other again three years from now the androids will arrive May 12th at 10 a.m. on an island five and a half miles southwest of South City we'll be meeting up on that same Island an hour earlier 9:00 and don't show up unless you're ready to fight we're not gonna babysit those unable to pull their own weight Kakarot you may be a super Sam but mark my words I promise I'm going to put you in your place soon enough don't forget that the number one say in here will always be me all right so I guess we'll see each other in three years where we said hey don't show up unless you really feel you're ready all right we'd better get going so piccolo what do you say want to train with me and go on I've been dying to fight you again sure sounds good to me yay I get to train with mr. piccolo again alright see you guys soon or in three years right we're making a stop home first right dad mom's been waiting for you oh yeah right guess I better get some face time in with chichi huh piccolo is it okay with you if we do that fine but don't waste too much of our time [Music] oh yeah training with piccolo I can't wait I won't go easy on you mr. piccolo is pretty strict [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mom's been pretty mad at you for being away for so long really what I'm not looking forward to getting yelled at again Chiti I'm home hi mom Goku is that really you of course it's me you look like you've been doing pretty good you had me so worried where have you been this past year and what's with those clothes and go on what are you doing in that outfit yeah about that you know it's kind of a long story [Music] what you have to train go on because you're gonna fight some robots in three years yeah that's okay right okay are you insane do you think I'm just gonna let you waltz in here and just rut go on studies I'm not trying to do that it's just well the earth might be in big trouble about three years from now no I don't care what you say I'm not letting go on train with you hang on wait you're saying the fate of the earth isn't as important as Gohan studies are of course go on studies are more important nothing's more important than that what you don't believe that right come on let go on train with me Oh fine this is the absolute last time you hear me GT but in three years he's done with all this fighting you got that Thanks chichi I'm sorry so even Super Saiyans have their weaknesses all right since that's settled let's go train cuckoo cuckoo hey hey I know that voice it's commie yep reading you loud and clear how's it going I'm glad to see you've made it back to the earth I've been waiting for you my apologies but would you please come to my lookout I must speak with you oh really does it have to be now I was getting ready to go train what I have to say concerns everyone everyone oh god don't worry I'll be right there commie good I'll be waiting you guys I'm sorry but there's been a change in plans looks like I got ahead - commies place what do you think want to come with me Oh Tommy huh I have absolutely no desire to speak with him gotcha tell you what why don't you guys go on ahead and train without me really okay dad so do you know where we're going don't need to I can find you guys just fine I'll just search for your energy are you sure go on get going be sure to do your best with piccolo until I get back though all right leave the kid to me I'll whip him into shape and wonder what's so important that commie needs to interrupt my training you you it's so important that commie needs to interrupt my training all right there it is I think there was something off about comedy [Music] hey commie mr. Popo long time no see I've been waiting for you Goku Oh what's up well I have something to tell you about the Dragon Balls [Music] Shenron under the weather or something no no you see yeah my life is nearing its end call it in old man's intuition what ah no need to dwell on the matter it's simply a feeling if you say so but not all hunches come true you know indeed but should you have any wishes let us err on the side of caution and act now gotta think this through got it commie uh-oh better head on back now piccolo and the others they're over there [Music] you [Music] hey Goku natural Ruby what's up let me guess you need help with something yeah you guess right yeah what is it uh sinzu beans all corns growing a new batch of them they're still gonna need some fertilizer though so I thought that you might be up to the task of getting some me why don't you do it oh because because I'm busy doesn't look to me like you're doing anything it should you and krillen are probably gonna

water isn't it well it's called that but it's just normal water I was supposed to take this from Koren as part of my training man that was tough and wonder what Yahoo Robi does up here all day train

yeah trainings gonna be great can't wait to join them for sessions [Music] [Music] [Music] might cause some trouble later best to deal with this now [Music] all right time to tree Oh dad sorry about that now what do you say we start out with training all right for starters I want the both of you to come at me both of us are you seriously that full of yourself Gohan I want to see you at your full power try and catch him off guard and overwhelm him okay [Music] pretty good [Music] not done yet looking forward and whenever that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] need to work hard man you gotten stronger go on you think so of course he has unlike other kids he's already gone up against the likes of Vegeta Frieza good point being here reminds me of when you first started training me mr. piccolo you mean when you were a pathetic ball of tears okay I'm starting to get it so this is where you guys trained when I was dead huh yeah mr. piccolo was super tough on me I had no choice in the matter it was useless to us back then and I did what I had to do to fix him sorry to put you through that piccolo Gohan's a lot stronger now and it's all thanks to you and who knows if he keeps it up there's no telling how strong he'll get might even get stronger than us stronger than you too no way he'd better we're gonna be in real trouble if he doesn't no kidding and that's why I'm here to help you guys out let's show him how strong you can get in three years Gohan yeah speaking of everyone I wonder what kind of training they're going through Vegeta's most likely sticking to himself off somewhere doing his own thing oh don't worry about him I'm sure Vegeta will be fine [Music] you
