still before he hurts himself good easy rest now i need two more things fresh red root grows just behind the house can you pull a cluster what else i i know you're a god not of this realm but there's no mistaking it he doesn't know does he about your true nature or his own that is none of your concern the gods of these realms don't take kindly to outsiders trust me i know when they find you and they will they'll make things difficult the boy will want answers that will be my problem whatever you're hiding you cannot protect him forever but you're right it doesn't concern me i also need lamb's crafts do you mind it's a white petal flower in my garden just a handful fine lambs chris i like her i mean she lives under a turtle you are too open with her we do not know if she can be trusted she hasn't tried to kill us yet would this help i dropped it when you were chasing the animal what's wrong with me if i if i lost it then you did lose it i'll take better care of it from now on oh exactly what i need so he's gonna live yes then we are leaving wait not without thanks you want solitude this mark will hide you from those who might make your journey difficult [Music] us [Music] there's a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods follow this path down then head towards daylight will we see you again as much or as little as you like now get out of here come boy this underground passage should put you back on your path to the mountain just use the boat wait and take this you can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world it will always steer you towards your goals [Music] i see a boat [Music] nightmare mom used to tell me about them didn't think they were actually real yeah they give people nightmares or they are nightmares i don't remember which i wish i could ask here we go isn't that heavy yes doesn't see me do not touch the water why do you know what is under the surface no then do not touch the water [Music] over there now we'll get to the mountain foot i just can't believe i'm here thank all of us there was a time i thought i'd never leave my woods not even my own beds you were not to blame for your sickness oh i know i guess i'm just saying this is great there's the mountain how close we are not available look at that it's thor the war god of thunder that's right i never thought you'd listen to mother spoke with the gods i some of them did did she speak of one who could feel no pain oh that sounds like baldwin an ace your god son of odin and frigg and odin is king that's right why do you ask i think i see something just sitting there in the middle of the lake i see runes there this just can't quite make it out it reads sacrifice your arms to the center of the water awaken again the cradle of the world what throw our weapons into the water guess that won't be a problem for you are you gonna do it [Music] hmm the axe did not return what is this it's the world serpent [Music] stay calm boys [Music] mom said he's friendly what is it saying i don't know [Music] that was amazing wait there's the shipwreck way over there see that and there's a statue of thor except i can see a lot more of him now the water dropped when the serpent rose oh that must be why the beach wasn't there before see and there's the mountain look it that building leaves from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple it was all just under the surface except for the statue good thing huh there's even a dock there next to the [Music] flag we're going to the dock first right we'll be the first people to walk on and who knows how long you know that servant he's one of the giants he's so big he's wrapped around the whole world an exaggeration i don't know it's pretty big to me oh [Applause] boy yes sir it's some kind of drawing maybe a map oh maybe a treasure huh a very long time is this the way to the mountain it would seem if it isn't the bearded beaver in his sax seed if i got something for you too brock but how did you none of your [ __ ] business now get in here i got something for you and don't go making pig eyes at my spot i saw him first okay do you think he wants to test our patience when word gets out about my new shop folks will finally come out of hiding they'll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wheels you watch you rush around like that everywhere yes catch the pile of rocks here with that key of igtra still you can open a magic door to the branches of the world tree a shortcut between the realms if you ever see them out in the world use it to get back to me quick but it's only one way straight back here and nowhere else and whatever you do never never ever never ever throw yourself over the edge of the path lest you want death yeah i don't see us wanting that let's get to it i'm sure that's a load off your mind of luck with all the rampaging [Music] what is this a horn here's the end can we without knowing the outcome well we usually push every button pull every lever we see outcomes we can predict no this is something else we must develop your instincts i knew it we are blowing the horns no we are testing your resolve i have resolved a bunch of it focus up boy that tower leads through to the mountain i'm ready i don't know these rings if we find a cipher i bet i could figure it out huh when the water drop new beaches were exposed we should search them for resources look here [Music] [Applause] oh you're very perceptive and reckless take caution when lighting these braziers sailor and hell walkers will swarm to the flames like moths i assume we have you to thank for freeing us from a watery grave us other spirits the lake of nine is full of most are able to move on from this realm but we lucky few are stuck here in midgard until our affairs are in order perhaps you can help them as well we have no desire to help you spirit ah but you already have i only wished to see the sky again farewell oh he disappeared oh let us not be distracted [Music] huh so hey it's a fragment of a language center we should look for more like this huh [Music] so i guess we should keep an eye out for other spirits what did i say about distractions but it sounds like they needed help they are spirits boy dead things they have no needs only wants it feels wrong to ignore them we will get over these feelings mom would have wanted to help them what was that boy nothing i thought as much i wish we could have gone on a trip like this with mother she could fight didn't she yes she fought beautifully yep come boy another marker uh good now when you're done gawking i got a favored ass what is it dwarf there's this alchemist on var been working out in the vellunder mines you haven't heard from him in maybe i don't know 100 winters or so probably dead but uh maybe you can find him he's dwarfing like me where's the fancy green ring owes me a favor you look if it is on our path oh i see how it is not a something for nothing type are you fine if you find don vary i'll make him whip you up something special this entry stone here oughta get you inside those mines the velander mines is right through these doors might as well have a look see inside don't you think good stuff something for the boy hey nobody's twisting your arm what does it say yes sir uh these runes read death inside i need that alchemist for something i'm stewing up for you if in your smarts you'll find him so rock said his friend was dwarven like him wearing a green ring look if you wish i will be gathering resources for our journey no why not because i do not run errands for dwarves oh dwarven but no rain one of his crew scorch marks there along the floor and wall weird i guess we keep looking we i mean i'll keep looking that is so leader if that kills us that's it no bala no hell no ever it does not attack oh mom made them some more dangerous than that then do not drop your guard come [Music] uh we got him up follow me adress sorry not ready yes [Music] [Music] ugh huh not him hey i thought you didn't care i noticed the lack of ring while looting the body boy yes sir hey it's another treasure map ah huh [Music] huh oh on that severed head attached to the soul eater well we know what happened to avari now we can just go tell brock i don't need to fight it right no we will fight it but because you are frightened of it oh [Music] oh go up that was good right you must learn efficiency boy this is crazy how are we supposed to kill something made of rock be strong atreus stay focused and look for a weak point yes sir stay quiet movement here we go uh god uh [Music] believe it you are stronger than you know thank you father let's see if that's the alchemist ring green ring dwarves inscription the alchemist but where's the rest of him ash is most likely solely to got him i guess we should bring this back to brock can you read it sir these runes were written fast it spells out he jeans stainey hmm i don't know that one we will ask the blue one so now you're interested where he found his alchemist a reward was promised hmm [Music] hmm uh [Music] ugh yes [Music] i think you got him oh what what'd you find your alchemist i'm sorry brock the hand is all we could find still wearing the ring there was a solider inside and well you must have burned away the rest of him suppose you'll still be wanting some compensation huh naturally naturally he says miani for oxy i'll take a closer look at this here ring maybe anvari left a bit of magic inside before he croaked dwarves can do that sure dwarves and magic jewels is like flies and pig lips supple ones oh i'm not as interested as i thought say uh you didn't happen to run yourself a foul of a scruffy fella about yay high doesn't feel pain sounds drunk but probably just slow hey how'd you think i feel about it if i'd wanted a seer business i'd have set up shop outside of brothel or a fighting pit nor fighting brothel uh did he say acer like gods no be extra careful out there you two the roads are teaming with more than usual complimented dead [ __ ] lately you've noticed any idea where they're coming from maybe they ran out of rooms in hell or could be odin stirring up trouble again or maybe they all got lost why don't you ask one while he's chewing your face off uh we'll just be careful thought so brock what do you know about the serpent in the lake i know he's too damn big uh all right now you're talking good choice you know being small like us that's natural blessed so uh you sticking around for grains of wisdom [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] oh boy look at this place this must be a branch of the world tree boy stay on the path right right i know we jump really idea all right what'd you break and next time well worth a shot my god not too hard look here another look it's the world serpent he's so much bigger than i imagined oh look he bit thor or will bite him looks like i still can't read these what is that smells awful poison oh [Music] uh another cipher piece i'll see what i can fit together oh what were those things they smell awful your mother called them scorn poles poison magic she was the one who showed me how to disable them what it's just funny to think of her teaching you something yes hmm whoa sure is foggy here [Music] another dwarf should no is of no consequence uh excuse me but um how did you come by that uh axe that is my concern alone and uh while i won't dispute that i i know that blade it was one of ours but uh we didn't make it for you step aside i can't see the woman we made it for i was uh well i am quite fond of her and i would be somewhat displeased if it turns out that you did something to her it was my mother's she left its father before she died face dead i'm very very sorry to hear that she was a fierce warrior and a good woman [Music] okay i will make improvements to the axe but nobody asked you to well it's it's true but but knowing your mother she would have insisted i repair that act of vandalism perpetrated against her axe by my brother i knew it you are brock's brother the other half of the brands here the blue one is your brother yes though my talents are vastly superior no boast i swear to freya do not undo his work improve upon it only yeah but can you can you put it down over there that handle is no filthy okay then i'll just i will just oh oh oh oh is that dried blood oh so what were you working on oh that i call it the sky mover just up that mountain awaits a treasure trove of rare resources once i mine it i'll need a way to bring it all down and you know how to fix it not even a little did you really make that axe for my mother oh i'd recognize it anywhere ask me it's one of our best infused with the echoing screens of 20 frost trolls give or take but why her how did you know her she sought us out in the beginning she was a special woman she wanted to protect people i suppose we thought it was a chance to give power to someone who'd use it for good she even spoke our native tongue she'd say mothering some gengor aegen vegum hans gengurai that's right that's impressive i see a lot of her in your eyes you know thanks don't touch me what i didn't i won't i'll come back later be careful where you're going there's nobody nice out here anymore since all the people left i mean i hate to generalize but um mostly they just try to kill you good tip um i know it's not my business but if i were you i wash off that symbol painted on your neck we were told it would help protect us was that a lie oh no it's a protection stave all right but you can't render that pigment into paintable texture without blending it with boar urine and is that really better than death maybe a little well well it's your neck [Music] uh [Music] go go huh system i can't tell are we getting closer to the mountain we are focus up god stop you uh [Music] yes [Laughter] [Music] it's locked magically woof do you think for this last leg up the mountain that maybe i can carry her i told you no why she meant more to me than you anyway what i just meant i spent more time with her you are off hunting it would serve you to stop talking [Music] oh [Applause] let him down [Music] [Applause] [Music] father [Music] ready yourself [Music] and ogre here who built this place [Music] oh huh so god system whoa i can see why mom wanted us to bring her here indeed wonder if cindy knows his sky mover is tangled with roots up here i doubt it i do not care is that smoke stay back boy what is that you must find another way up the witch wish she was here bet she could get us past this my magic is useless against the black breath and there's no way around it odin saw to that long ago what are you doing here making sure you can finish your journey why would you warn us i was busy saving my friend if you remember the black breath is a corruption of magic even i can't dispel only the pure light of alpheim is strong enough to break through but that road is long what does this goal mean to you it's everything follow me why help us maybe i see more of myself in you than i'm willing to admit maybe maybe by helping you i'll make up for a lifetime of mistakes [Music] or maybe i just like you even though we shot your friend even though you shout my friend yes where must we go to a realm beyond your own [Music] you
