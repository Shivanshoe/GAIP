[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh the wild the weaver [Music] and the worm three primal forces from which the world gaia springs the wild is creation formless and abundant the weaver shapes making order out of chaos the worm whose purpose was to destroy the old to make room for the new went mad now a force of corruption feeding on greed malice and hate it ravages gaia [Music] through its unwitting accomplices mankind the balance between those three forces is long gone now insidiously the worm gains more and more ground every day vitalized by the damage humans have brought to the earth we the werewolves remain born of man beast and spirit we are the vindication of gaia and the wild all right they should be ready now the best way to get indrin out of the region is to attack their bottom line we have a plan to convince them there's no profit to be had here but miller if you please i've recently gained access to the system that controls all the on-site oil pumps that's our target we tamper with the pumps and send dummy data to the system to make them think their oil field is run dry will that really be enough according to the internal files i got my hands on they treat unprofitable sites like gangrenous limbs they'll give this one the chop right away i don't know even if we do manage to push them out they'll only set up somewhere else we need to hurt them bring them down not chase them away we've already talked about this kahal they're too close to the cairn if we stage an attack they'll look for the ones who did it i don't want indran's eyes on our home our best option is to work in the shadows but if something goes wrong my wife ends up on her own in enemy territory i don't like it i'm going to be fine call we've been preparing this for weeks we've calculated the risks and if there's any sign of trouble you and i go in and retrieve her but i'd rather we stay covert but miller will have the easiest time on her own i'm heading out i want to be done before daybreak take care of adana while i'm away i think she's going a little crazy all cooped up in here don't worry i'll talk to her you just focus on your mission call i've got this i love you see you soon endrin one of the most destructive companies north america has to offer known for their violence and endless greed if we left them to their own devices they'd rabbit to this place so there was nothing left but dust i don't like thinking that ludmilla's on her own ronco i understand she's my sister remember and she's a donna's mother i should be out there with her i gave it a lot of thought her chances of success are better if she's alone it's as simple as that if things don't go as planned you can tear through as much entrance scum as you like to get her out but for now we stay put go rest while we wait not looking forward to packing all this up tomorrow morning what do you think old friend yeah that makes two of us not too keen on this plan david did an impressive job installing all this i'll have to thank her for this later got everything squared away not a lot too square away all i'm doing is pressing a button once lou miller gets me hooked up still got a ways to go before i can do much more than that if i tried to breach their network they'd be on us in a second says the woman who got her hands on their files we'd never been able to take the fight to engine like this without you besides you installed all of this on your own have faith in your abilities that's sweet coho but i just wish i could do more but how are you doing talk to your daughter yet no not yet i'm just heading her way hey how you doing i'm bored out of my mind there's nothing to do here and it's wet and miserable we're not on vacation edie we're here for gaia for the cairn and you're here to learn how we do things i know but couldn't i have learned how we do things back at tarker's mill it's not like you've got me helping out with the mission or anything try connecting with the spirits feel their presence around you the pain endurance causing them that connection makes you a garu i'm trying believe me but i just can't don't worry it's always harder before your first change and if the change never comes if you're human like your mother that's fine she may not feel the spirits but she's the finest infiltrator we have why didn't you go with mom anyway she's all alone out there if something happens to her i wish i could have but rodko wants us to keep a low profile and there's no one better at that than your mom rodko's a dumbass hey that's your uncle you're talking about and the leader of our pack you know it's his job to make those decisions everything will be all right don't worry try to focus on the spirits we'll be leaving this place soon [ __ ] wake up we're gonna need you a helicopter just touched down on the site's landing pad apparently it's some endrin exec their presence has shaken things up tell me ludmilla's okay she's okay they've still got no idea she's on site but their guard patrols have changed and certain areas are locked down and that includes the one luke miller's in so what's the plan now the mission sunk we go in there get her out and wait for things to quiet down but to get her off site the locked off areas need to be manually unlocked and luke miller's stuck on the wrong side [ __ ] fortunately she has already secured a terminal she'll guide you to her location over the radio go now bring her back there's no time to waste my sister needs you ludmilla i'm on my way remember stay out of sight i'll open any door i have access to to their network i've opened all the external ducts oh the area you're passing through should be deserted right now though door's locked ava there's gotta be a terminal close by find it oh and uh deactivate any cameras you see while you're at it guards i'm looking at the southern part of the outer fence and a [ __ ] ton of guards there's no way i'll be able to make a move without being seen southern part of the outer fence got it there he won't live long enough to raise the alarm they sold their souls to end ron they don't get any mercy hell of a time for a malfunction i'll go check it out any idea what could have lost it i don't care i just want it fixed and fast some big shot just arrived on site folks upstairs want everything oh so i'm in the refinery perfect i'm not far now nearly the passageway leading into it [ __ ] something's following me what is it i think it's a black spiral dancer but miller just hold on [ __ ] rocco i heard no more sneaking around we fight now go i'll reach with repeat i'm done [ __ ] around we need additional units so [Music] in the next room so just watch out we need more immediately [Music] we need right i think i should be able to no please no [Music] [Music] sorry foreign [Music] [Music] listen to me oh damn it no you need to fight the rage oh it's for feed stop it no what have i done rafiq there's no time to mourn we need to go um [Music] uh just reported back to base not that there's anything to report no kidding though i guess we've got a special guest coming tonight yeah an engine rep no less she should be here soon you know they're hiring right think you'd ever make the move to hendren hey what's up all clear dusk we're good to go five years ago i abandoned the woods of tucker's mill i abandoned my cairn engine killed my wife i gave in to rage the worm touched my soul i had to leave my daughter it was the hardest decision i ever made and in other news andren is joining the fight against global warming the energy company today announced that their new biofuel will be hitting the market soon this revolutionary new formula will be unveiled alongside the opening of their new headquarters this exile was my only choice i'd become a danger to my pack i often wonder what's become of them of rotco of ava of 80. this is the closest i've been to tucker's mill in five years alcohol we're here you're off how much time do we have before they notice the guards on the outside have gotten quiet they report in by radio every hour that's our deadline for getting our hands on the explosives and getting out of here what do your clients intend to do with them anyway the weather stormers they're planning on blowing up a big magadon pharmaceutical plant good [ __ ] ribbons i know megadon's methods they're the scum of the earth and guess what these explosives were originally headed to endrin another mega corp of [ __ ] stealing from them is just icing on the cake let's go through the plan again just to make sure everything's clear you've got to swap the delivery label on the creative explosives intended for ender you do that and they'll load us up with smiles on their faces all you've got to do is open the gate to their delivery bay for me i'll create a diversion while you're exchanging the labels got it we'll have to play it tight though one hiccup in the plant we'll have you sneak around back by their storage facility security should be pretty thin there especially if you go through the ventilation docks all right i'm off hey before you go are you sure you're up for this man you seem kind of stressed out back in the truck i'm fine come on we've got a job to do right if you need me i'm just a chirp away good luck brother that does it this month's orders inventory checks ugh hmm i'm inside okay reached out to me you know they're hiring and the pace pretty good i'm sure it is they're going toe to toe with a group of activists right now lambda mankind if i were you and stay here keep your head down i think you hear the new android announcement about their new bio fuel they say they're going green by the end of the year the only thing green about that fuel is the label it's the same [ __ ] with new branding a marketing stunt they're not running the most attractive operation here i mean they're pumping out weapons not selling time shares looks probably not their priority i made it to the delivery bay good see that command post next to the gate you should be able to open things up for me from there good morning oh hmm so dusk you're up on once i've got their attention you go find what we came for and slap on this fancy new delivery label got it hey you in the truck what are you doing here i'm just here for a big up man pickup what are you talking about there's no pickup on the schedule well check it again i i gotta be on there all right all right i'm gonna have to search that truck according to the intel we received the crates of explosives should be stored around here all right dusk the delivery label's been switched it's time for us to get the hell out of dodge wait i smell something give me a minute to check it out i knew i smelled it silver whoever ordered this intends to kill garu dusk they're shipping out silver bullets you know what that means change plans change of plans i need to find out who's buying these bullets and why buy me some more time so who's the lady the boss is meeting with upstairs for the special the silver bullets who even uses that [ __ ] is she picking up some golden guns while she's at it you know what they say the client is king especially when the client's name is endrin ship it's loaded how are things on earth shouldn't be much longer doesn't like waiting or paying clearly you're not getting anything until ending is paid up you can tell that to your president watkins in person i don't think you understand what's at stake here oh i understand that you've just been attacked and you're looking to hit back i also understand that you need our ammunition to do that and we've got that ammunition right downstairs ready and waiting to go as soon as you've paid us sorry major the business is business well [ __ ] you two then we'll attack parker's mill without your help and rest assured mr watkins will hear about this tucker's mill hey you and i need to talk who are you how'd you get in i'm asking the questions who are you talking to the woman and what's this attack on turker's mill i'm calling security let's do this thing died security tarker's mill my old cairn donna i have to go back dusk what the [ __ ] are you doing i just had to pop a couple guards who wanted to put a bullet in my head get the [ __ ] back here already sorry but i didn't have a choice keep the engine running we're out of here as soon as i get back the alarm went off in the boss's office but i'm not getting any response from that sector take your positions people maximum alert until the situation's clear what i got eyes on an intruder [Music] stay vigilant weapons ready action uh we need help so much for the stealth no reply from the delivery bay either [ __ ] what's going on huh hmm [Music] [Music] so uh should have picked another job so so where are we headed parker's mill we're too late engine is already here what do we do stop the truck what's even down there my home dusk stay out of this wait call rocco radco they've cleared our northern line they have an exo we'll take care of the wounded later we have to stop them let's go over there [Applause] [Music] right rocco you'll regret that however boy tell me where's adona don't worry kahal your daughter didn't fight this battle how are your wounds riddled with silver they'll take days to heal but things would have been far worse if you hadn't stepped in i just did what i had to do nothing more i honestly never thought i'd see your face again why'd you come back all i was worried about adana when i heard that karen was being targeted i had to come back for her you know i couldn't stay not after what i did to rafiq i told you that your rightful place was at my side and what you had done could be forgiven but no you chose to abandon us me the cairn your daughter where is she rodko with ava working undercover at the biggest hindrance site in the pacific northwest best option available to us after the failure of our last mission rocco you let it donate infiltrate engine my [ __ ] daughter after what happened with her mother your daughter is the best undercover agent i have we will not win our fight for gaia without first bringing indran down and with your daughter on the inside we're closer than ever she may not fight like we do but she's every bit as strong you should respect that the work she's doing inside endrin is absolutely vital more so after what their private [ __ ] army just did to us i'm afraid her work won't be able to stop indrin from retaliating against us not after our last mission your last mission what do you mean you remember the old abandoned mine not far from here hendren bought it and turned it into a training center for their new recruits and launched an attack to wipe them out but tank girl stopped us the woman you saw in the exo during the attack she drove us back tank girl you call her i encountered her during my last mission she was trying to buy silver bullets from an arms deal that's where i learned she was planning an attack on the cairn major greener that's the name her men give her but to us she's tank girl and she leads entrance troops with about as much grace their attack on the cairn was their first wave of revenge for our attack on the training center we managed to repel them this time but it's only a temporary victory it might return at any moment and endrin just keeps recruiting soldiers then we've got to go back to the mine and destroy their training center it's the only way to buy the care in any sort of safety no matter how brief go back no not until i'm well again then we can strike i'll take care of that goddamn training center myself you know i can handle it on my own no you're no longer a part of this pack it's my responsibility and how long will it take for you to get better days weeks if they return the cairn will fall i'll think about it go pay your respects to your fenn and come back to me then we'll talk about the mine the cannon is in a bad way dusk what are you doing here i thought i told you to keep clear you really thought i'd leave you behind like that you should know me better than that by now besides looks like you need all the help you can get i really don't want to lose my front row tickets to the call show thanks dusk okay yeah no thanks sounds real weird coming out of you put that [ __ ] away well if you really want to help i'll go look after the injured i rang the weather stormers and asked them to lend us a hand too don't worry about me you just do what you gotta do good to see you made it through okay thanks in no small part to you i'm glad you came back go home lamb to mankind really helped us out too we're lucky to have them with us adana was only a few days old when ludmilla wrote this letter those bastards kitamona how could they silver that's what killed her they had three snipers training agnes didn't even know how to fight he was a spirit healer a caretaker of children endrin doesn't show anyone mercy and we won't either it has been many a year since i last felt your presence warrior of gaia it's been nearly as long since anyone called me that your care needs you and the wild has need of your protection the eater of souls is fighting with all his might to take control of it and he is winning the corruption takes many forms but the effects are always the same you must help us fight back tucker's mill looks nothing like it did when i left yet you still protected the forest with everything you had your strength your aura what happened to them as gaia weakens so too do i the english the jaglings the gafflings they all suffer in kind the eater of souls tries to corrupt them but they're minor spirits they are every bit as important as you or i but in my weakness i must look on powerless to act as they disappear which is why we need your help you must help me to combat the worm to protect the wild i came back to find my daughter have you seen her a ghana a dear friend and always respectful of nature you fear for her safety then she too is fighting for gaia in her own way but do not worry you both walk the same path you will find each other in time to fight your battles you will need power power i can provide by helping you develop your warrior gifts thank you me fenn you may find lost spirits during your travels return them to me and i will be able to strengthen your natural abilities one last request before you depart many of your kin fell in combat i would ask you to bury them you will find their bodies both inside and around the can your penumbra vision will show you the way soothe their souls and send them to me so that they may travel to the wild without being captured by the worm i will if i can but my priority is endurance training center weaken the forces of the worm there but never forget your brothers and sisters gaia needs you i hope broadcast changed his mind i went to see fenn he's gotten so weak please rodger let me help you let me deal with this training center why is it that you care now call we were so easy to ignore when we went right in front of you what you want to be part of the pack again i want to help the pack i want to protect adana but you don't intend to rejoin us i've already given into rage and killed one of our kinradgo i can't take the risk of doing it again you already know i disagree nonetheless we are united by those we mourn so i'll accept your help tell me about adana have you trained her just as i promised you i made her into a warrior i taught her everything she needed to fight to defend herself so that we wouldn't see a repeat of the tragedy that befalled milan [Music] you say that but she's working undercover inside andrew's walls that doesn't sound like your kind of training donna decided that she could best aid our struggle through more covert means it took me some time to come around but she was right she's a talented infiltrator just like her mother rest assured though don is just as much garo as you or me her first change will come in time no matter what path she chooses to take tell me about eva how she doing when you went into exile she succeeded you as my lieutenant she was ready and willing but it was hardly a smooth transition i was forced to make some concessions i can imagine there are a lot of humans in the caring a lot more than when i was here ava's lambda mankind i'd heard about a group of activists they're actually getting a lot of attention at the moment not sure if that's the best thing for the pack that's what i thought too at first how so for the longest time i never trusted humans but then i saw how they fought how they stood strong for what they believed in i saw their potential even i had to admit that ava was right the humans have been stalwart allies in our fight for gaia and now you've seen firsthand what indran is doing to us our ranks grow thinner every year ava's humans aren't afraid to put their lives on the line for their planet what more can i ask for so what can you tell me about this so-called training center ava managed to get a hold of the mine blueprints to help us prepare for our previous attack the site's weak point is its power supply they apparently haven't had the time to give it a proper upgrade the whole thing is powered by one big propane tank just like it was when it was a mine i see so if i blow up the tank the whole mine will cave in taking the training center with it then we'll need explosives you'll be happy to know i didn't come back empty-handed i'm aware i met your new friend dusk right give me the explosives you two stole we've still got a problem though you don't know the layout of the site and i'm too injured to go with you huh i don't like touching the stuff but i suppose i'll use ava's radio equipment to guide you it should do the trick perfect so we'll stay in radio contact take the explosives and go good dusk my friend i leave my son they killed my son he's lost a lot of blood i don't know if he'll make it through the night has anyone told me this letter must have been sent just before the attack on the cairn go fiona warrior and survive keep your eyes open if any of those [ __ ] show themselves just fire do not hesitate they're currently recruiting at their training center then perhaps i need to enlist [Music] you hear the internal motto around the kit there's something the cost of the fine is always less than the caustic clients tell me about it pump action rivals with a holographic sound you're here to enlist the army doesn't have that [ __ ] yeah or you've been having some trouble lately you hear correctly we were attacked a few days ago we pushed him back but let's just say we're a little understaffed right now what's in this training program of yours anyway that's classified but those who survive their training become real killing machines with real thick wallets too what do you say you interested absolutely that's the spirit did you register on our website no i prefer to do things in person can't say i blame you what's your name cahaul philly cajole filling hell of a name there you go you're on the list all right then go report to the instructor for testing he's in the warehouse oh and one last thing looking at you it's pretty obvious you've done some time try not to mention that the instructor hates ex-cons this way control i've got a candidate for you welcome you're looking to sign up you have to talk to the instructor head over to that building in the courtyard i'm here to be recruited you how'd you make it through the physical without breaking a hip all right gramps let me just find you on the list here i signed up at the entrance kahal film ah right here you are and let's get down to business you ready for the interview i'm ready let's start with a technical question then our assault troops are equipped with a new type of pump action rifle what kind of site is it equipped with a laser sight wrong they have a holographic sight but i understand why you'd get that wrong grandpa back in your day they probably still had bayonets let's talk andren now the company has an internal motto for those in the know can you tell me what it is the cost of the fine is always less than the cost of compliance that's the one sounds like you're gonna fit right in some guys roll on in complaining about the company not having a moral code screw em okay enough of this paper pushing [ __ ] i know a combat vet when i see one welcome to andren's training program head over to the waiting room someone will come get you new recruits in a few minutes understood so you managed to get through their tests just like that well done they want to make you wait we don't have time for that you should see a command post overlooking the waiting room you'll have a computer inside and a service door leading into the mine that computer will allow you to open the service door and cut communications with the lower floor center [Music] now [Music] so i'm in the mine the propane tank's at the center of the site there should be a service door that leads there major for anyone who brings back one of their leaders heads damn cross your fingers we're gonna be part of the team for the next attack yes what's up so during this comprehensive checkup you'll be treated with a serum reserved for the engine elite the serum will heighten your reflexes increase your pain tolerance and make you stronger than the time to watch one of ever training sessions which you can see through the window behind me i'm a good shot i see the tank you're gonna have to cut through the medical sector to get there they're injecting something into their recruits we've been trying for weeks to figure out just what's in that serum of theirs how long will it be before our latest batch of recruits is trained two months for most of them less for the ones who react well to the serum excellent i'll communicate that to major brainer when she returns huh foot so the injections have something to do with the worm we think so but we can't prove it yet that's one of the things ava and donna are investigating there's silver here lots of it smells overwhelming you must be in their armory the propane tanks downstairs from you uh alert the best we need additional units [Music] i hate exo's [Music] i made it to the propane tank that there's a soldier guarding it he's more monster than man though just muscles stacked on muscles one of their elite soldiers one way or another you can have to deal with him security's detected an intruder but he's not going anywhere now that we've got the site locked down stay on your guard and put a bullet in him hmm should have picked another there's an job in here [Music] security breach now to set the explosives there we go the explosives are in place find him yes this is about those big bastards uh you should see air vents running along the top of the walls in some rooms when the ventilation system isn't running those ducks will lead you straight outside um search the warehouse if you find the intruder don't try to play here give the alert immediately oh what's the latest on the program the flamethrower xx just clear testing just got the green light for their deployment good keep it up oh ah huh oh i'm almost at the control room steal yourself cutting the ventilation [ __ ] ventilation system's down good news ava's just arrived back at the cairn and brought your daughter with her hadana [Music] i imagine you'd like to see your daughter before anything else she'll be in ava's quarters i'm sure so uh nobody here but her computer's on old notes from ava before she created lambda mankind my irish brethren but that was a lifetime ago you know i hate it when people mess with my stuff that's an impressive amount of equipment it's the bare minimum for leading a handful of activists against a mega corp like indrin i haven't changed much have you aside from a couple of new lines on your face thanks [ __ ] you know i always knew you'd come back it was just a matter of when this isn't quite the reunion i had in mind but it's a happy one i heard about your handiwork at the mine a donna cahal you must have a lot to talk about i'll go check on the solar panels catch you later donna ike how are you doing you've grown it's not worth trying to rebuild that bridge now not after abandoning me for five years i'm sorry adona where do you think an apology is going to get you you know it was hard enough to get over mom's death but dealing with the fact that you chose to leave me behind when i needed you most that left a scar you were so focused on doing what you thought was right that you never thought about what it might do to me maybe you're right i didn't think about how it might hurt you i spent those five years finding my way back to the man i was even if you were with me i wouldn't have been me and you'd have been just as alone i was in no state to look after you i couldn't have been the father you needed i wasn't stop kahal i'm really not in the mood to hear you rewrite our family history endrin just carved a bloody wound into my cairn they killed my friends right now all i care about is tearing entran apart rodgo told me you and ava were undercovered andrew during the attack that's right i managed to infiltrate the fracking site they just upped my security clearance too i've got access to their protected data this is the best chance we've ever had at taking endrin down we sync them from the inside how was it with rotco and ava honestly it was hard at first rodko was he was really mad at himself over you going away over mom's death be obsessed over my first change trained me for months and months but as we trained i started thinking i don't want to go through my first change are you scared [ __ ] no i just don't want to be a garu you're all too unstable mom wasn't a garu and she was one of the best fighters the karen had ever seen i think that's why i drifted toward ava and her way of doing things fortunately rodko mellowed out after a while so i've noticed there are a lot more humans in the care now than when i left it took him some time to come around but he finally realized that ava's methods serve gaia just as well as his do now he's got no problem with the idea of working with humans or my choice to follow in mom's footsteps how was it honestly but as we are mom i think i was able to talk with him earlier seems like he's gotten more open-minded in these past few years it took him some time to come around but he finally realized that ava's methods serve gaia just as well as his do now he's got no problem with the idea of working with humans or my choice to follow in mom's footsteps you really do take after your mother took me back at first i miss her too coho i think about her every day she would have been proud of you if you say so i'm proud of you too that's nice of you to say and all but i know you didn't want me to follow her path that you wanted me to be a warrior like you and rodko i don't know about that but garu's life has a share of problems too i can't blame you for following your mother's example she really was exceptional she sacrificed herself for gaia and she didn't abandon me so you know anyway ava and i will keep working at endrin's fracking site we're going to take those [ __ ] down from the inside you've seen how bloodthirsty engine is did you know they have a price on your head they're not the first and they're not about to scare me into stopping we've lost too many already and if we run how will we honor their memory the pack comes first besides endrin doesn't suspect me at all i'm secure over there secure endrin has full confidence in me well the whole team at the fragging site looks to me for my expert chemical analyses as long as i stay there golden girl there's no way they'd imagine i'm connected to those scary eco-terrorists least of all the cairns engines built a fracking site it was a rush job they'd set it up and posted guards before we had any time to react it's a danger to nature and the spirits alike those sights are one of the greatest threats gaia faces today it hurts my heart to work there but i also know that i'm the best chance we've got of putting a stop to it soon sink engine from the inside and how do you plan on doing that a while back ava rodko and i discovered that endrin's injecting its new recruits with a special serum that makes them more everything yeah i saw it myself when i was in their training center the injection transforms people makes them stink of the worm there's more to it than that when i first joined endurance ranks i was trying to figure out what was going on with their biofuel project but while i was analyzing the formula for the biofuel i noticed an encrypted molecule within it no employees have access to its composition that same molecule is in the substance they're injecting their troops with as well as another project the earth blood protocol the earth blood protocol any idea what that's about not yet but that can wait until after we figure out what this mystery molecule actually is once we figure out what that mystery molecule really is we'll know what they're pumping their soldiers with and their plans for this biofuel then we'll leak that info to everyone who'll listen block the biofuels launched and hopefully put the final nail in andrew's coffin thing is right now the encryption they're using on their data is impossible to break that's why we came back we wanted to tell rodko how we were stuck and figure out what to do from here yeah i read ava's letter to rodko how can i help if you want to help go meet with ava she and rodka will be figuring out our next steps all right i'll go check in with her and then have a talk with rodko any idea where i'll find her buy our solar panels if you've got any other questions you'll find me with the rest of the pack they need me how you doing big guy figured i'd get out of the way let you catch up with 80. well from the look on your face it doesn't look like it went well she's still angry at me for leaving again you blame her [ __ ] being a teenager is bad enough but luke miller's death your exile it was all hard on her but you did what you had to you had to get away from us to get yourself back on track that's what i tried to tell her i've been telling her that for years never eased a pain though but you're back now it'll pass just give it time but donna told me about your mission to infiltrate the fracking site yeah about that we're currently at a roadblock indran's data encryption is uncrackable so she said our only way to get our hands on that data is to take it directly from the server in their lab but surveillance is tight even adana couldn't get in there without being caught and i don't think i could create a big enough distraction to draw their security's eyes away what's rotgo think about you two going undercover like this as you might imagine he was a little resistant at first but once he understood what we wanted to do he gave us the green light sounds like you've got something in mind if we want to draw a security's attention we have to hit them hard blowing up the refinery should do the trick but that's not happening until we can get into the fracking site that's step one the site is protected by an electric fence and a myriad of cameras all of which are powered by the dam injury and acquired when it bought the site now if someone could get into the dam and connect me to their network i could access their system discreetly allowing you to cut the power to their defenses without their notice exactly we can worry about the fracking site after that okay i'll go talk to rocco to see how he wants to make up the teams thanks cahal it's good to have you back but if you don't mind i'd like to take a few moments for myself lost some friends during the attack don't worry take all the time you need so any news on the group that was supposed to launch the attack on the sunburst reactor we're still keeping our ears open shouldn't be long now as soon as you've got something let me know i hope they didn't run into too much trouble so were you able to talk with your daughter adana told me about her and ava's plan to get their hands on the encrypted data inside the fracking sites laboratory to bring endrin down from the inside yes i think they've got the right idea if we manage to chase endrin from this region they'll just continue their dirty work elsewhere it's time for a decisive blow so we follow ava and adona's plan will attack the dam to bring down the defenses of the fracking site i want you to lead the incursion you coordinate with ava and adona over coms and allow them access to the dams network ava gave me the rundown but if i set off a single alarm things will get very dangerous very quickly i know one sign something's amiss and the tank girl will be at the dam before you know it so while you're sneaking through the inside of the dam i'll be creating a diversion on the outside that should keep your attention off you and even if someone does raise the alarm at the dam tank girl will have no idea why you're really there good you can count on me excellent we'll have declan meet you near the damn he's got the relays you'll place to get ava and adona access to indran's network [Music] you
