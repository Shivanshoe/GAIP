[Music] [Music] [Music] aller how's it looking up there it's good damn metric rock movement is normal same for the combine patrols how's it going in the stockyard one combat mini reactors from a shipment of 4,000 they're never gonna miss it here see for yourself don't get greedy guys we're not made of time here what a minute and I'm out Derek Lee oh also I spared the cone by moving supplies before the quarantine zone now place has been deserted for years that is well we're look into it when we get back meet back at the city cause babe we'll be there soon what is it Russell what do you terrific [Music] I mean booth yep they got the reactor easy-peasy I'm headed back to the safe house right now to meet dad go be in touch Wow let's over here what is it this doesn't seem like a routine 3 are you sure everything went ok 100% we hang out and be smart where are you taking me you and said [Music] Alex yeah you've gotta get moving Russell open Anthony I know I caused this so technically not an accident you've got to get moving wait wait where's that it's fine patron [Applause] okay yeah you saved me well yes I had no way of knowing who wasn't which man so yes do we know where they're taking him criminal holding and then when they realize he's Eli Vance to Nova Prospekt but I'm already working on a plan to get him back you close to my lab he's following the drone underground what to do Russell what did you face right back there that's the crazy thing I don't know just blurry pictures of a building the city no die something else and whatever it is they gonna kill anybody who saw it and anybody who knows anybody who sort which means us and your dad Russell Jeff hang on what was there yeah I'll be there in a minute [Music] that looks great okay Liz wait nope it exploded I'm fine by the way right good thing Russell they've got dad I know this this is bad you're gonna find out what he knows and then yeah they're gonna kill him Oh God but the good news is we've got something they don't which is my plan to give them back great let's hear it now pretty soon they're going to realize that your dad is not going to talk and that happens he's off to have his brain sucked out Reza potentially maybe not though I mean I could just drill and smash oh yeah still your dad right well what they will do is take them by train from here this is Eli to Nova Prospekt and if it gets on that train that's it right not necessarily grab something that represents us okay that's you I thought you said us well one of us me will have to stay here for this plan to work alright fair enough just outside there's a second train that also leads out of City 17 through the quarantine zone okay both trans intersect here at Fairview Junction you take your train get there before his train and hack into the controls that'll let me take over the system train comes to a halt you deal with the combine situation and we get your dad back sounds good where's the train I'm taking out the back through the yard it's decommissioned but I think I can hack into its controls oh and get yourself a pair of Russell's on the way out wrestles the gloves Alex you know the gravity gloves I have a few sets through there you can calibrate them out by the ship got it we can do this Alex we got that didn't you though I said we can just as we're gonna do it yeah we are what are you every stand on the way all right you know how this goes there should be a bunch of junk down there I am at something with your hand open yep you tethered now close your hand registered now flick your wrist to bring it in you're attached make a group try catching it boom yep great try again your honor one more time you've got it just a little flick of the wrist that's it perfect we're done Oh oh wait I almost forgot Alex up here you're gonna need a gun don't worry it's unloaded it's unloaded man Oh almost forgot guns need em oh here you go oh you took care of that Lachlan good great did have the key for it but should have given you that that's that's on me [Music] all right here we go they stopped there for you judge block Alex goodbye obviously just do you know I am still a nerd hello Alex we might have a problem probably nothing to worry about did the train stop it stopped didn't it yeah what happened ah it's jammed when the combine shut down the quarantine zone there must have tightened security which means yeah you're nowhere near Fairview Junction you're just outside the koozie and this is as far as we get by train good I'll see if I can get you in some other way I got it dead zombie here I picked up the combine sealed up the qz this one must have squirted out I've heard they've had trouble with barnacles or without sign the containment area tell us like this probably either one of them knocked out it uh would you look at that resin and if there's resin around here it should be a combine fabricator keep an eye out we might be able to upgrade your firepower a bit huh I think I came here out this with my movies for your what it's a tool with multiple functions so you know Alex that thing's incredible you need an incredible brand name something that really sells the combines not going to be here forever the whole derivitive of the Russell's but yeah provisionally sure the Alex yeah you guys work together right yeah well I interviewed a Black Mesa Mesa try again in a year I don't need to tell you what happened after that lucky break for me really honestly it's a miracle you and your dad got out of it I take it the quarantine zone is behind this hatch yeah yeah that's where they keep it I'll look around for a control panel to open it up that's my control panel I've probably scrambled the circuit there considering no one would be dumb enough to open the hatch it shouldn't be too hard to put back you know Russell now that I'm walking into the quarantine zone you just hit me I don't know anything about the quarantine zone actually the word quarantine comes from the Italian Carranza Shawnee which means 40 days the period that all ships were required to be isolated before crew could go ashore during the black pen all right cool [Music] haha there we go finally I'm gonna head how far as Fairview Junction go go through the old subway tunnels on your way to the train yard how they started meeting dad yet I don't think so which is good news because we've still got time that's great all bad news because they've already killed him and you don't need to move and Kolb's you just period O'Bannon still there out mm-hmm Russell are you seeing this Wow Oh hey Russell I've just found a loose arrange of God knows what this Mason skull and crossbones on I don't see one probably medicine man do you hear that totally yeah that's that's the way we gotta go oh just so you know the Russell's have a built-in display shows your Risen mo you know might come in handy thanks Alec I think that's a combine fabricator but something in it I want to see how this thing works no I bet it should fix up that pistol nicely good thing too I gave you one of my lesser guns well you know in case it doesn't make it back tell you what myself if I die why are you doing you owe me a gun anyway that's my gun [Music] no I sure to Gallic Thanks talk about what anything about that Nara radio silence since he got on the train yeah well the good news is he's probably fine because they're taking him to Nova Prospekt and that there is a floppy disk we used to store information on them with magnets if you can believe it specifically two micrometers magnetic iron oxide three micrometers barium ferrite a 1.2 journalist I'm reading it here on my computer i download at the Internet you've done the entire minute yeah yeah possibly a using [ __ ] garbage okay it's just cardboard right yeah weird though well what's letting cardboard [Music] I like you all right what's up I'm really affect No Russell Russell [Music] [Music] oh they had expands into okay so what's that border got doing here right but I mean in general I have a brain I'm sorry my brain is injured that's terrible and I hope look I'm actually pretty busy looking for my father Eli you know yes the condign have a man I really do need to get moving that kind of I yes do not go ahead I'll show you something look I appreciate it I can't stick around I it is important I know I'm sure it is the Arab fans must go this way anyway okay [Music] you hear we combine like you lying I would help I really would but the owl expanse is honestly very busy saving for dad you were not seeing him he is dead what boy he will be is or will be it is a matter of perspective how expensive Oh cannot predict I look thank you for everything but I really have to go I'm sorry but I really don't have time for riddles noodles drilled yeah I am 17 [Music] I'm sorry look if if I can if I run across your friends I will see what I can do you have saved my kid I have it then you will [Music] courage Alex [Music] [Music] I will help the Alex that route to the northern stuff why for guidance okay thanks are you done healthy I didn't eat it later thanks for the help you will be welcome Alex Alex perfect nose back can you hear me are you okay Russell I'm good yeah I've got him on the train he's on the move you got to find CFU Junction before they get there oh that water got a man you did give me a Crabby oh right what a fine tell me how you read some Russell I didn't eat it right now cause shouldn't now that's that's right oh that zombie has a shotgun do you have that yeah let's get the shotgun and get out here [Music] [Music] hurry up and load that thing it's getting louder [Music] we did it this is fine it's really dark breasts yeah can you just talk about what about anything literally painting well I think that given our situation you're a retinal fear of the dark is actually quite appropriate you know I can give you easily a hundred reasons to be terrified okay that was my fault call be more specific next time because flashlights and it's not unlike yourself there's also sensitive to the dark oh yeah meaning it should go on automatically when the lights go out absolutely right I make a club sandwich do you need to start with bread not from a bread line from a bakery across the street baked that day okay you add tomatoes lettuce not vegetable paste fresh then you add bacon that's from an animal we used to call the pic toast the bread and then you add a second sandwich on top of the first one you put ham in it also from a pig and Turkey from an animal Turkey it was six inches tall and weighed a pound and have a governing greedy n't spawn five different continents it was the most impossible food item you could imagine at any age before now I know it right that is thanks press you're welcome Alex wait is that a bit all fine soldier yeah when you guys were off stealing the reactor I saw the convoy leaves pies in here so I guess they're interested in this place again Oh keep an eye out something's definitely up Oh panic watch out see it okay so right now what it's like to live on earth on a scale of 1 to 10 I'd say relative what would you rate it before the phone oh that's a toughy good day unsafe sex yeah strong sex we gonna combine offers like a name you know Oh a night yeah that really would be nice [Music] [Applause] Murdock [Music] so wouldn't we get the card by not at birth what are you doing I'm going full production mode on the Russell's quarter I'll be sitting on a landmine gold mine yep so here's the plan conservative estimate I think of one year to get wheeled and conquered by the combines get them off the planet so that's year one then another year to mass produce the Russell's so just quietly we will need to rebuild society first you know to get some basic infrastructure and jobs money that sort of thing otherwise people won't be able to buy them you know so yeah three-year plan that's what the infrastructure thing in the future oh yeah definitely you're gonna want to put that in your to so three here Russell plan you think you think you have a job for me job Alex you wouldn't been to the ethics of course you can have a job it'd be brothers oh well well it would be stock obvious five to 10-year vesting period obviously could be very lucrative for you Alex I don't know what any of that meant but sounds good yep sounds good Alex [Music] they have automatic weapons without them to service online weapons gene coded so out of luck unless you find one that's an unbonded oh you're open just a minor genetic modification I and go for us I'm just gonna roll with these genes at everything you should have plenty of time to get the override back online all right I'll be able to stop the train right here you sure you can do that absolutely you just need to activate the terminal nice then you'll need to be ready for a fight they're not gonna give up your dad easily I'll be ready right that's a terminal there I'm on it do hurry though maybe it's missing a piece okay don't worry the train is coming just give me a little as he takes a second you're doing great yep doing great no words words okay [Music] in sports which we've got to stop that train in taken down okay it won't stay Wow okay let's go how about I don't know we need to find Ana yeah [Music] that's you dance pressed about dad dad dad I mean I'm worried okay I'm gonna reach out and pull you up it's gonna be okay you ready okay give me your hand how expense oh yes I said oh thank you thank you to stay there I'm gonna figure out how to get over to you know Alex listen a superweapon it's something big they gotta hear the QC some kind of hope but they about to move it then we gotta steal it before they do so what's the plan you head to the boat I'll take this thing back to Brussels to get to work right up like where is the boatman dad where's the boat the Northern Star I guess look to the start got it dad is right in the middle but you see yes big get up a brown seem to defy company great thank you dad I'm gonna go find this vault go stay safe baby i love you I love you too [Music] thank you hey Russ keep an eye out for that okay I'll let you know if he gets here I'll win you know it got a bit messy back there but you did get that back yeah what that's probably gonna draw some attention not probably actually it's definitely drawing attention look they're looking for you now okay so just be careful you know if we can get this weapon we could change things forever yeah yes look I know we've only been working together for a few hours now but I want you to know I'm proud of you okay you're under a lot of pressure here wow so much pressure in fact than I well I hesitate to even bring it up but I did notice that when you reached out for your father's hand head he actually grabbed it his grip would have crushed all the delicate sensors in the Russell's okay totally understandable and would have been worse by the way in this case great having said that I have a hard time imagining another situation where there would have been the case and much like your father the Russell's are priceless okay so just you know moving forward Russ I promise your gloves are safe with me dad said you stole some files about this weapon well when it comes to combine description Eli's you guy systems robotics networks I can make short work of those might as well be an alien language well it is an ami language anyway look Eli you guys Alex look out the window involved yeah your dad didn't mention it was floating so even if we make it there we still have to get up to all the cables look at all the cables attached to it all we have to do is follow them in bridge whatever then the other and down comes the vault simple easy to follow yeah I like this plan have you heard any combined chatter about dad escaping no nothing it's all about sending reinforcements and the quarantine zone on the plus side that means that is still on his way back to you we've heard of the recapture in my pants and on the downside getting the vault isn't going to get any easier [Music] [Music] [Music] look to the Northern Star I am why are you thinking like that no no sabor de God said look to the Northern Star to help his friends which sounds like warteg on concept but I guess it isn't oh that does make more sense and some sort of combine substation they usually generate power and host security protocols like the power and security need for a giant fault [Music] that was weird and the power's out looks like we're taking the stairs [Music] and stays around let's try get that power back on anything look like a breaker box in there hey Russ name is Don fight of the bumblebee that's it [Music] [Music] now it's back on let's check the elevator boom power back up Hey looks like we're taking fire this place is overcrowd how dangerous do we think this stuff really is well it is spores from another dimension so probably yeah extremely a rare opportunity to examine Haley in the floor up [Music] [Music] I'm really starting to think I shouldn't be reading this stuff agreed just keep moving maybe briefly oh dude some freaks oh really what does reeks like rotting animal mixed with ammonia mixed with I never savage ever the same no no no it wouldn t know why we [Music] Alex Alex what happened there was like a dog looking white main thing Oh hey Russell this thing fell out on the top that elevator will take me up to the substation [Music] Oh [Music] Alex doggone what happened new development it went into a dead guy doc yes how did shoot both of them it was nuts Russell about them oh it was that's a bee warrior she knew well let's think about Alex he's on fortune moving at 3 miles an hour plus he's a fugitive he's only got one leg this obstacles no direct path you know what I'm not gonna lie to you he should be back by now yes get it towards the dangers give me the ones worried about you Kampai do know how to upgrade again there's a combine shield blocking your path I figure out how to shut down Alex it's your lucky day that combine weapons unbonded how are you sure sure on the case and never leave them on the case please I didn't even need to be at your genetic code that's okay there'll be a next time those combines your daughter but don't come back you know yeah hetero you're all right though right yeah rest okay well we've gotta get you out here and up to the roof I'm working on it alright here it is now just snip those cables and altogether see a way to disconnect the cables in here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right so go inside decorate the parcels got great at the for account we have been trapped in the died you're free now it's okay your friend sent me the added expense free what are they doing to you here what they do to us all [Music] the come by train from us the power they use to protect their weapon there there we are by ourselves we have to stop them from killing your friends the vortigaunt will expect ourselves and exact our own vengeance you must go to the weapon what I can't get into the vault if the substations are still online do not worry there is no distance between us [Music] Thanks good luck [Music] putting a lot of trust in their order got to shut down all the substations see I trust him yet Beecher because he doesn't know that fault isn't going anywhere we'll be standing there with no month to break into surrounded by convo minute Russ trusting him is only been here we'll do this we've to do this in your right he'll be fine we're all going to get crowded down here us comm channels gone crazy since we took out that substation I know we're after the vault now whatever is in there they really really don't want to happen well now I just wanted to you know that's the spirit [Applause] oh you're us Russell but dead on Eric Barry dad we just took down a substation good because when they move this thing that weapons gone we maybe get it tonight we will you still got that data plot right I do Restless things BioCode I'm gonna need the tiara yep it's right over there okay great you good honey for sure you go ahead I'll be fine dad I promise keep that promise I'll get to work on the data part Bres house tacular does he seem okay oh he's fine Alex he's working the way over there okay thanks oh he is missing a leg yeah yo he was missing a leg before right well it's it's still gone Davis children Oh Alec are you seeing that the photographs are taking down [Music] okay there's no direct path from where you are to the halt so you're going to have to stake your way there well huge so it shouldn't be hard to know which way I'm going I don't understand what they're doing with it here if this weapon is so powerful why keep it locked up in a dump like this my guess is they're trying to find a way to ship it off earth back to their home or some other planet why not use it here they already won this war Amex we can take a shortcut through that building okay I don't see a way into this building so I'm gonna look around what is this place anyway it's a distillery I made hot Karen things like that yes vodka good oh god no Russell doesn't like vodka got it well I I never said that but it's not good it's poison but what I love it everyone okay that's all very confusing let me figure out how to get in and then I'll buy you something wonderful if you could actually yes okay back on the train up and running again ignore that we'll meet you outside it looks as if they're a combine barricades up ahead they're stopping anyone from getting any closer to the ball okay make your way into the distillery and see where it takes you my truck back online with finding on our dime Kenneth BAE there's definitely a bunch of little bottles in here does alcohol go that a tiny improves that's all go tally Russell you're raising up Alex come on Alex Alex well there you are there you are there's no straight shot to the vault I'm gonna head inside and find a way out you keep your total yourself and I don't show you in it Alex hey hey put the blood on you you put the blood yeah a little situation here yeah you sure do us you don't have a gun on you did ya look at that nice one too thanks for the money which is up inside this guy you keep your tongue to yourself and I don't shoot what the hell was that that's Jeff Jeff well don't worry you can't see here's just if I don't got him here like Mozart whoo all right now let me help you out see on the other side homework and your voice down there he is right watch this [Music] see is totally predictable but you will rip your arms off if he finds you hey hey those things are nasty you gotta cover your mouth got it thanks hey I almost forgot what's your name Alex Alex pants hey Alex I'm Larry nice to meet you try not to get killed oh come on hey Alex Oh more or less we're breaking up well that's right take all the help [Music] there should be a big tunnel side to plug in the poor there's nowhere that's gonna be correct you get it open I'll figure out where leads [Music] [Music] what did you do the job yeah I trapped in the trash compactor oh yeah I hope you came across some of the good step okay the coast is clear time to get that slide open so we can get through those tunnels [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yeah that tunnel into the vault great also little heads-up I think the tunnel is full of antlions just in case I cut out permanently I'll on yeah you know aliens stabby legs oh yes very small I can't no I like tiny that's not them these ones pretty dangerous right well whatever they are they're down a tunnel yep you know Russ I'm sorry I didn't get you any money back there that's okay oh you could pick up some on the way back oh wow check it out my gun just keeps getting better and better yeah Russ technically I don't think there's a whole lot of your gun left anymore I'll tell you what let's put that idea on hold for the house shut about my gun when you get back that's an aneurysm that's an empire yes so you do know what I am landlord yeah Miki's hey any news on the data uh your dad's hits down he's working on he's got to be close great do you think a headcrab between a gorilla into a zombie honestly if there's a gorilla on the loose I'm not sure headcrabs gonna make it much worse I catch what happened yeah what is it dad it doesn't look like they actually built the weapon it's like big I don't know discovered something well maybe they uncovered it what do you mean it's gone reading this right they tracked it to an old apartment building in the qz but instead of going in to get it they grabbed the whole building and don't default around it they must have been care about in this day I'm trying to figure out whether we ought to be [Applause] [Applause] oh no wait damn what it's not a fault it's a prison they didn't feel it to keep us out I tried to keep something in I don't know I'm not sure if this data pot even knows but they got something trapped in there okay so if it's not a weapon are we still doing this the way I see it whatever's in there doesn't like the compound very much so we got that in common true so are we still doing this we've come this far I say we keep going and if you find out it's something they really shouldn't mess with we'll call it off that's my girl I'll let you know what I find out good luck try to lock out someone wielding an hour whoa Russell boards just took down the last substation Oh [Music] back home let's play another backup I heard so hit towards those beams right right nothing I'm on my way there's something up there no come by maybe a scavenger be careful come here [Music] [Music] okay we need to move the box where this thing is going to be black mix up all over again well now I'm telling you it is still here when she gets there she's gone when history of today makes you think you know something but this game of gardening survived Black Mesa he ready to holding help and then just end up here we finally caught and you're gonna let him go again move the box all right Micah then disappeared Hale I like do have a super weapon god damn it rusty got Gordon Freeman oh wow that's good right this is very very good not a miracle all right so let's go save Gordon Freeman [Music] humming hey give me a second okay so the plan is to get to that control room and get Gordon he'll be honest people talk about him a lot but I just assumed he was dead man turn hey dad are you there yeah what about if Gordon survived Black Mesa where's he been I don't know but I've been available story do you think they're doing it here looks like that no Peggy once we get Orden bad you can really get ambitious don't you think recipe people we can take down the city well he's time to humanity one not wanting to bend you can do it again and this time you won't have to do it alone Russ what do you think they're doing to Gordon Freeman in name question are they you know soaking his brain oh I think they got a minimum well well either way let's not find out I'll get day before it happens breasts what's the deal crowbar oh you mean gordan freeman scoffs way I'm a black man with nothing but that crowbar no way you know nobody doesn't sure yes but not mine I'm out of a gun mending business okay [Music] hey Russ you want to swap in here yeah no I would probably die instantly Alex we're getting close to the vault now you're not gonna have many more chances to use your rhythm good point Oh see if there any upgrades I can use I can't believe my petrol mine at the fire I was thinking about giving it to court those beans are coming from the top of this tower right yeah that's right there's the control room I see it we're almost there Alex urea yes it looks like you will be able to get into the vault from up there there's a terminal that extends a bridge to the entrance what's the security light inside I got all laid out in front of me that tell you there is security but I've never seen anything like it it doesn't make any sense I guess I'll have to improvise don't worry honey I figured out Alex did head those control stock the vault to the station on it I'm gonna go rescue the savior of humanity you know honey you haven't been doing too bad yourself have enough 88 last name all right looks like the break the bridge is fully extended just need to gently dock the vault to the bridge how far can that be oh that okay well one of these has to bring in the vault for Donnie right right Oh most certainly just look what maybe oh stop that one now with the creatures moving why is the brief delivery no press Vietnam movie Alex Alex the boats right there just go and get him I'm on my way [Music] [Music] Oh let's try house deactivation dance oh lucky break there did you imagine that thing blocking your way yeah nice don't jinx me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah oh yes we did it all right Alec that tractor-beam over there looks like it'll get you up to the ball you got it well yeah okay drive up a lot of interference I don't wanna talk to you about that yeah and then you'll come out with gorgeous legs down so everything is gonna be everything will be fine dress talk to you soon dad okay this is weird but I know it doesn't look too dangerous [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right coordinate let's get you out of this thing [Music] impressive work Gordon Freeman Gordon Freeman miss you wouldn't need all that to imprison Gordon Freeman so who are you perhaps what is not as important as what I can in exchange for coming all this way some believe the fate of our worlds is inflexible my employers this in a particular direction from time to time what would you want not easily combine off earth I want the combine off earth that would be a considerably large much too much given the interests of my employers well you asked what if I could offer you something you don't know [Music] dad what is that me what is this what's happening we are in the future this is the moment where you watch your father unless what unless what unless you were to take matters into your own [Music] release your as a consequence of your action this entity will continue and this entity right so he's okay right he lives my dad wins you are aware that you've proven
