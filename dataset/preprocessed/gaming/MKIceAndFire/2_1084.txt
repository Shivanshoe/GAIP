swore to protect this island with my life but now the Mongols have stolen our home killed our son right he forgot what it's like to fight someone stronger than you to be a week sometimes when you're staring death in the face [Music] you have to do whatever it takes to survive the Khan expects to fight a war against the samurai he will anticipate our every move unless we find new ways to surprise him that's how we'll save Lord Samara and retake our home you'll need some help writers concept actors too many of them hide in the grass they must be searching for you bastard scared off the horses there's some right mounts trained to return to their masters nice trick the Mongols must be hunting you we should split up I'll draw their attention while you escape I'm not leaving your side until we've saved my brother first I need to find more allies trained warriors like since a scar lady must have all that you they can help my brother can help too once we save him you'll have the islands best blacksmithing your debt he'll make whatever tool you need to save your uncle something to scale the castle walls you dream it taka can make it where are they holding him he was captured me a catchy right there and ask around I'll join you soon taka won't last long in the Mongol cage we will save your brother and your uncle [Music] [Music] [Music] you you [Music] okay let's go [Music] Jinna you found me you hunter that well I should have heard him coming let myself get distracted these people saw Mongols marching prisoners upriver they had a blacksmith with them your brother sounds like it they were taking him to a camp near the Canada Inlet I know the place did you find any samurai debris your uncle not yet but I'm still searching I'm sure you'll find someone soon pather can help you after we save him hard to believe I might see him soon he's lucky to have you you might disagree that's what siblings are for what about you any brothers or sisters Louis Sameera is my only family what will you do when his free take a breath because then I'll know there's hope for our island you feel that strongly I've watched him win victory against impossible odds and after your brother is free what then honestly I haven't had time to think about it riding well how are you woods mostly healed your bandages did the trick I suppose you're right my uncle taught me that if summer I'm masters these emotions like you master a horse or blade that's a hard way to live it's not supposed to be easy [Music] [Music] there's a spot up ahead that overlooks the river should give us a good view of the Mongol camp there's the camp tough to get inside the Mongols through that place together in days there has to be a way in let's look we need to reach taka without putting him in danger we'll find a safe approach you could scare the rocks on that side if they're loose they might give way alert the guards defenses and back are formidable the front wall they're still under construction could be a way in we can look for a gap in the front wall sleep inside and cut down the Mongols where they stand if something goes wrong they'll kill the prisoners I've seen them do it we have to go in quietly like thieves what's wrong with that before the samurai this island is ruled by criminals we changed that by creating order and delivering justice in the open we live by a code of honor and sometimes we die by it warriors like my father we just wanted to give us a safer home I want the same thing but we have to fight back I promised my uncle I'd never break our code then bend it to save my family and what's left of yours that's got a closer look see what we're up against we should wait until he gets darker let's move TACA he's been through a lot even before the invasion but you took care of him someone had to he hates it when I stole it was that or starved he didn't have a choice I didn't choose to be a son either going against my instincts my cold it's better than getting wiped out by the Mongols we have to fight back any way we can through here if they see us they'll kill the prisoners no we better stay quiet [Music] [Music] [Music] what do you think Jin that there's running with a limp your era wounded him this is when a beast is most dangerous remain inert yes I got keep after him I didn't think bears lived here they don't but the fighting in your car drove some this way so it's the rebels fault we should feed them to this bear as punishment we are not barbarians Jean [Music] the pair stumbled here is it time no but we are getting closer stay ready Jean yes ago if it's still alive can I take the shot you can control your emotions we can't him careful he could still be alive this arrow should not have killed him look uncle there's a gash in his side not from an arrow yurikawa sake you would step that star in the back what I control yourself we are not criminals like this man here we are somewhat I tried to kill you must answer for this crime with his life look him in the eye the teaching as someone I never acts out of anger of fear and take his life [Music] when we fight we face our enemy head-on [Music] when we take their life we look them in the eye with courage and respect [Music] this is what makes us samurai [Music] only cowards stray from the shadows [Music] Jin what's wrong let's find your brother I can't let them see us use all your senses think and move like [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know is that good yeah prisoner Tucker let's find out no we need to go we'll talk when it's safe come on [Music] let's get to the river we'll be safe there are you with the store had Ronin I was baptized with the leftovers that have any lower lashes Lord Shu has been captured and I could use some extra swords to free him are you looking for work no but the other straw hats maybe last I heard they were hunting mongols and sits at prefecture by the coast near the kishi grasslands [Music] this way we're looking for my brother a blacksmith named Tata don't know him but a lot of prisoners moved to here you said they were moving the slaves where they mentioned as a mobi and there was a blacksmith in the last group young man with a beard from Atacama maybe you'd better be right I hope you find your blacksmith Takas alive in Osmo Bay the town is surrounded by walls rushing in without a plan will only put him in more danger I have a friend who might be able to get us inside find him the sooner we rescue took her the sooner we saved my uncle Jin Tucker will Forge whatever tool you need as soon as he's free but after that we're leaving the island you've seen what the Mongols are doing you Lotus Americans stop them stay help us fight for a home home is where Vertica and i go [Music] my friend lives in Osmel Prefecture on the border with suits I'll find you there I know this wasn't easy going against your code I did what I had to thank you Lord Shimura you deserve better than this convince your people to stop resisting and you can walk free stop wasting my time kill me hmm you think you've lost everything but your nephew is still alive Jim my men control the roads they build war camps near your towns they see everything and they will find him Lord Sakai will fight until his last breath as will I you love him just as you love your people your father to them will you abandon your children they want to make them your slaves [Music] you [Music] that's [Applause] so I could use an archers help someone looks sensational [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he leaped from a building and they

died a Japanese quiver a gift to my greatest student rice and millet left uneaten the attack was sudden I fear the worst the Moyer would never leave that quiver behind unless she was pursued or captured to what end interrogation torture worse they may be doing the same to Lord shim Allah fear is a weapons arc I do not let the mangoes use it against you your student where would they take her fort Nakayama the fort is nearby I should have fought that come without with you better you didn't he lost enough there why did the summer I fail the Mongols fought like animals wrong answer I saw with my own eyes and archers aim relies not on eyes but on body mind and spirit you stop here We Need to Talk what's wrong sensei this bow was a gift to me from the guanaco many years ago it's a beautiful weapon of course it is and there's nothing more painful to me than the perfect blow ineptly used and it's a good thing you're giving it to me mmm who said anything about giving prove you can shoot straight and I'll let you borrow it try it out before we go into battle aim for that lamp closest to us now the ones further down the road on the left not bad let's see if you can hit the one furthest away I didn't feel like it was made for me it wasn't so take good care of it let's go a bowl like this would have helped at coma though it is a good Bowl victory is won by warriors not weapons we haven't seen the Mongols fire weapons they have not yet won fort Nakayama I hope your student is inside will get a better look at the defense's from up there this spot is perfect I'll find a way in open the gate do we hit them you always charge into battle with your huh Kemal half tide you have a better idea patience it's okay the Mongols will send men to find their missing patrol when they open the gates we strike longer we delay the longer Tomoya remains in danger you can take care of herself survey the battle for you what can we use to our advantage they have many archers they're skilled but we are better and a heroine those hanging lights will kick ups box and start fires those barrels could do some damage we'll find out on the nests one shot could stir them up the Mongols will face the sting of insects and arrows when the gates open distract the enemy in rain arrows on their heads then we stormed the forth and free Tomoya good now we wait they're opening the gates wait for my signal get ready and then to their ancestors [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sylvain prisoners tied up killed with arrows Tomoyo Hazen wait this

Tsushima was first set on a strange and terrible thunderstorm swept across our island wherever lightning struck beasts of lightning appeared his violent creatures tore through villages causing death and destruction moving too quickly but he stopped the people knew only one man who could possibly stand against the lightning beasts Signori the fastest swordsman in all of Tsushima jagannatha's never lost the duel with years of practice he had created the heavenly strike an attack that struck quicker than the eye could follow shigemori lured the creatures to a desolate Beach in Komatsu where the sand would slow their movement their clash turned the sand to ash and bleached the leaves of trees white chicken or his heavenly strike cut through them faster than they could move as the final beasts fell the stone cleared and Sue Shiva was safe again shigemori began a life of seclusion few students found him and only the bravest and most skilled proved worthy of learning the heavenly strike when a storm approaches a sword is placed at chigan or his rest by a student who knows of its location to ward off attacks from beasts of nature the murderer wishes to learn chigan or is heavenly strike it
