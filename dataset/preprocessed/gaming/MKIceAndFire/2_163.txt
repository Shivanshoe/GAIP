don't you'll have to come back tomorrow right okay i'm sorry hey craig no sorry it just it looks like we're gonna have to run something else on the cover i don't know uh maybe the expressionist piece you know what i think i can make today work are you sure you're here no moment like the present thank you craig never mind we're good let's get started look around and familiarize yourself with the items i'll be waiting by the baku statue when you're ready to begin can do fist cut peter opened like a pork sausage with this the first time they fought pete got away collapsed in my yard half dead and i had to steal my dad's car to drive him to the er the first of many nurse mj moments too many i remember when fisk started illegally importing artifacts like this he bought the local harbor to cover his tracks and laid off the old staff including my dad i wish dad was here now to see how the tables have turned i can't get over this image so much tension between these two figures let me know when you're ready to begin sounds good starting with the prize a one-of-a-kind kakemon baku beautiful it's a mifune correct mr fisk has exceptional taste did you know him well before his arrest in a professional context i handled many of his sales let's move on please now this exquisite piece exemplifies the traditional tarashikomi puddled ink effect the two neo are so imposing i can see why fisk liked this piece definitely his style he loved the duality destruction screams but creation toils in silence was there ever anything irregular in any of the sales you handled for him no no of of course not not that i was aware of notice the intricate gold inlay on this ceremonial tea set it's just a friend in the da's office mentioned that fisk used art sales to launder stolen goods i'm sure i wouldn't know anything about that oh i know i was just wondering now that he's arrested if you had ever noticed anything strange you know what i'm actually running short of time why don't we grab the cover photo while we can when i told my da friend i was doing a piece on you he mentioned your name was familiar just the photo please stand right there are you sure there's nothing you'd like to say maybe off the record regarding fisk's activities i don't think your readers would have any interest in damn it wait here please wait i recognize that statue craig i'll call you back my dear i think it's time for you to go oh um could i use the restroom real quick fine follow me thank you this this is a really lovely space it is and this will be the last time you see it the ladies is around the corner be quick of course be right back hello craig funny you should call because the reporter you sent is clearly not working the puff piece we agreed upon no she's here now i've got to get into that back room if that statue is what i think it is this just turned into a huge story what do you mean he had schedule if she's not your reporter who is she craig who is in my auction house oh my god no i do not trust you to fix this well the first thing pete told me about this fisk used it to hide evidence why didn't the cops take it i know this statue opens but how he's holding something that's the neo behind them but it looks different something's in one of his hands what is that she certainly is cozy with fisk statue can move most common pose is latent power mouth closed left arm down right palm facing forward hmm maybe these pieces move nice so close i've seen these before [Music] that's it norman osborne what is this devil's breath what is devil's what the excuse me sir you you can't be not good where's the statue in in there by one jen's else who lie i was on my way to the exit when i saw you you're lucky to be alive this is the guy i saved five minutes ago listen whoever these masked guys are they're after this vial but i'll never get it out of here while the place is swarming with them right okay um you hide back there i take out the bad guys you make a break when it's clear sounds like a plan good to see you pete yeah you too not exactly how i pictured us meeting again though honey that's exactly how i pictured it [Music] did she change her perfume focus pete focus yes all right of course should clear these guys out before i push forward okay pete i'm hidden near the front give the word and i'll make a break for it will do how about that file what's in it that these guys want so bad notes on something called devil's breath fisk was hired to build a secret research lab for it not clear what devil's breath is but it seemed to scare fisk he compares it to pandora's box not much shook fisk we need to get you and that file out of here hang tight there we go that's all of them no let me go m.j stop [Music] not cool with the hostage taking guys well what is up with that glowy stuff on your hands are you guys ghosts never fought a ghost before [Music] huh [Music] that was a workout huh looks antique i think i know someone who could help track down where this came from a job for later i just talked to craig you are not the reporter he was sending you don't even work for heritage arts never said i did hi mary jane watson daily bugle you you will not write a word of what you saw for the record what do you know about the file those masked men stole that i don't what about the long history of stolen goods fisk has laundered at this auction house your editor will be hearing from our attorney mix like the last six months never happened since when did mix become italian no idea but i'm still glad he makes these fries totally best in the city so how's the grind at the bugle hmm well yeah well i just got an all-caps text from robbie about my so-called antics tonight so it looks like i'll be meeting with a legal team again uh as soon as you read the article you're gonna write guaranteed promotion so creepy mask guys what's your take just another night in the city it's your take i feel like there's a bigger story there let's not make this all about business how's how's it going with you did did you get that promotion no but we're on the cusp of something really big you know oscorp would hire you in a heartbeat right one phone call to him sure but dr octavius's work will help millions i'm right where i want to be right where i should be almost sounds like it's more important than your other job i've never heard you talk like that before a lot can change in six months why did you ask me here pete you know just uh just dinner between friends friends was that what we are well maybe we could be you know if that's what you wanted there's a lot of baggage here yeah sure but is that so bad i mean baggage can carry good things too like uh like money and keys raspberry lip balm do you remember why we broke up this is a trick question isn't it saved by the siren talk to you later go [Music] love seeing you two together again you always were my favorites [Music] uh hey it's me what's with the units heading down third looks like our old friend herman schultz is at it again shocker didn't he just get paroled yeah well i guess it didn't take no worries herman's just a big cupcake i'll have him back in rikers by bedtime just had dinner with my ex after saving her from masked criminals and now i'm gonna go beat up a maniac who uses shock waves to rob people what a perfectly normal life you have peter parker peter i just want to make sure you haven't left any equipment you've built for your friend around the lab it's no bothering me but if the grant committee stops by again don't worry doc i make a point not to leave anything there but i know my friend appreciates you looking out for him there's a lot of people who don't like him very much that buffoon jameson and his audience of sheep please the people who do great things in this world are those who don't let bullies like him stand in their way people like us you said a mouthful doc take care [Music] 10 10 the witness called in a narcotic fail incident is active in dutch town over [Music] hi herman seriously that's what you said last time i don't want to hurt you pull me down wow let's consider it what's the money for herman what do you care actually i don't i'm just trying but this could be so much more rewarding if we connected on an emotional level wait i forgot you don't have emotions come on please talk to me so we can make it interesting gotcha now let's talk i'm done [Music] now dude [Music] honestly herman why are you robbing again you know the police are watching your every move i mean we all know you're kind of dumb but i didn't think you were this dumb you must be desperate which means you're not just stealing for yourselves you must be working with someone or for someone you can tell me who it is now or make me punch it out of you later your choice man back [Music] you know what herman that's like zero personality but your suit is awesome can we talk design details maybe later good work spider-man did you learn anything about his motive i tried but he's not very talkative plus i think he hates me you have that effect on a lot of people but you love me right yuri i tolerate you wow that might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me [Music] looks like i got some free time maybe now's a good time to look into that mask oh it's mj hey mj you're up late just catching up on the news looks like you had quite an adventure with shocker tonight yeah he was unusually combative anyway thanks again for dinner what do i owe you how about a favor you still have that mask from the gallery yeah i'm actually on my way to the feast center now to ask martin lee about it martin lee why he has a degree in dart history if anyone knows about the origins of that mask he will just keep me in the loop like i said i think there's a bigger story here and i plan to be the one to break it up sure so i can call you like whenever yeah whenever whatever so i guess we're talking again cool almost morning mr lee will be here soon i could use a snack mr lee's usually in his office now i could patch these shoes i never used to feel safe at the other shelter peter what can i do for you i'm sorry to bother you mr lee i have a friend mary jane she's a reporter she's doing a story on art imports and she found this piece well she wanted an expert opinion on it and i know you have a degree and this might be the first time i actually get to use it let's see what you have interesting where'd she find it i'm really not sure why what is it a replica of an antique chinese opera mask i haven't seen one in years this symbol here roughly translates to demon demon well my father read me ghost stories with that mask and symbol in it when i was young scared the hell out of me peter listen that mask it's it could be connected to dangerous people mary jane might want to find a different story do you think she's in trouble i don't know why i take the risk hey the symbol inside the mask means demon it really spooked mr lee never seen him like that he even said you should drop the story fat chance do you think mr lee knows more than he's letting on no i think he just had a weird flashback or something i know his childhood was pretty traumatic yeah that makes sense demons huh catchy name okay gotta get writing see you soon well that went about as well as i could have hoped up got some time to kill before doc needs me at the lab let's do a little spidey workout in the city [Music] peter mr lee spoke to me he seemed worried are you into something dangerous oh it's just a story mary jane's investigating don't worry i'll make sure she's careful please tell me you two are back together we're talking again baby steps i hope i didn't upset mr lee he's just concerned i was actually touched

i'm away oscorp's gonna shut them down unless they prove their value i was hoping you could watch them i left details in each one thanks man as long as they're here it's like a part of my mom is too well it's not gonna pay the bills but it sounds like it means a lot to him i've got a couple stations measuring air pollution the idea is to catch the um what's the word contaminants before they reach toxic levels between you and me i think oscorp wants this to fail because of my children polluting the amount of polycyclic hydrocarbons in the air is way too high and rising if it keeps getting worse people could die the particles are concentrating in trouble spots like mini clouds of smog i'll swing through them and get samples then trace them to the source nasty as they are i gotta swing right through those clouds for these clouds to be visible to the naked eye that level of toxins must be up there i'm getting some good stuff well good samples of bad stuff anyway got it feels like i'm breathing from a tailpipe the toxins coming from two types of cars and a faulty smokestack i better get photos best smokestack picture i ever took great light on that one perfect the department of environmental protection will take it from here maybe i should make a green spider costume for earth day well harry station just stopped the public health crisis oscorp's gonna have a hard time arguing it's not useful spiderman shocker has escaped and now he's robbing a bank on east 31st what happened i thought he was behind bars he was but one of the guards just walked up to his cell and released him then gave him his suit back i knew shocker was working for someone what did you get out of the guard wish i could ask him but he's dead whoever made him release shocker didn't want any loose ends damn looking at the security footage the guard was in some kind of trance and it might have been the lighting but it looked like his eyes were glowing well that's creepy okay i'll see what i can get out of shocker when i get to the bank peter i've been looking into the demons sounds like they've quietly established a power base in the vacuum left by fisk a vacuum i created by putting fisk away jameson was right the demons are my fault what were you supposed to do let fist keep god fathering are you okay you sound even mopier than usual i think i might have just lost my job the city norman actually pulled our funding oh pete i'm sorry if harry were here he could talk some sense into his dad you'll find another source your work's too important thanks mj talk to you soon

can find a second junction box ah i found it clear [Music] you were right jeff trap door outstanding think you can help me out this thing's heavy one two three well that isn't spooky at all probably

trying to help i know i'm sorry about that i don't know what i'm gonna do with him i'm sorry jeff i'm busy what's up have you started looking for martin lee yet no i told you i can't start a manhunt based on a hunch from spiderman but i'm telling you he's the guy get me some solid evidence and we'll talk solid evidence right hey it's me hey so what are you thinking i'm thinking i screwed up and that kid lost his father i know you too well to say you should give yourself a break what about the police do they have any leads on leaks they're not even looking for him even yuri doesn't believe me then it's up to us to find him i've been doing some research go to this address martin lee bought a controlling interest in this recycling center last year you think he's hiding out there maybe we know he's not a feast if he's not at the recycling center maybe you'll find some evidence as to where he might be yeah good work mj i'll let you know what i find oh one more thing i talked to the detective about questioning the arrested demons they're all claiming martin lee has the power to quote corrupt people corrupt what does that mean they say it's sort of like mind control it brings out the negative part of you makes you do things you wouldn't normally do hmm sounds a little far-fetched this is coming from a guy who can run up walls mj's hunch was right police is crawling with demons gotta take these guys out then have a look around ah okay that's all of them maybe if i can find where it gets its power from looks like i could override the circuit i need my electric webs well that did something it looks like the circuits need a little more juice there looks like the circuit's still stable maybe there's another junction box close by gotcha almost there one more box to do uh huh that's it [Music] oh man lots of high-tech equipment maybe later i can recycle this stuff into some weapons of my own these must be where they're planning to attack wait these are osborne campaign offices all the paths originate from the same address guns from fisk's armory truck bombs this is crazy explosives from fisk's construction site this wasn't a gang war the demons were stealing from fisk to go after mayor osborne hey did you find lee no but you were right lee's using this place as a front for the demons bomb making gun running oh my god and it looks like they're planning another attack this time on norman osborn's campaign offices we must have some kind of beef with norman osborne i found an address here i think it's their staging area if i hurry i might be able to stop them be careful yuri it's me make it quick i'm busy getting yelled at by my boss martin lee and the demons are planning another attack this time on norman osborne's campaign offices are you sure we've had a lot of false leads in the past week trust me on this one i'm sending you the address of a recycling center you'll find all the evidence there got it i'll get those campaign offices evacuated but if you're wrong about this you're gonna help me find a new job [Music] so [Music] consolidated shipping a lot of guys i should try to do this quietly but also with style [Music] whoops so [Music] so oh please not out here better check inside huh invoice from an auto shop pale horse rides that's one expensive tune-up what else can i find around here they have bases all around the city this is bigger than i thought looks like the demons have an army [Music] as if one deadly glowing whip wasn't enough [Music] i don't know what i was expecting but it was definitely not this hey mj i think i stopped seaman's attack on osborne's campaign offices nice did you finally no but i found something we should look into a place called pale horse ride sounds familiar but i'll check it out and get back to you coffee silver bird we're descending to location there's another one safety's off well this is new no no this one's mine all right i'm executing this sonofa hey that's not how we do things down town code sm-1 whoa whoa before we do this who the hell are you guys code sm-1 code sm1 holding for orders copy code sm1 i have a visual full for silverburn ah [Music] nice entrance solid eight out of ten out of ten release him he works with us yuri explanation please this is silver sablinova head of stable international a private security force paid for by mayor osborne oh the mayor has a pet army now next time you get in my way i will not be so gentle go we'll talk later hey sorry about that stable thing i should have told you earlier but it all happened so fast it's okay we're still best buds we're not best well that took a dark turn anyway sable has the mayor's ear and unchecked authority we've searched that address you gave me found plenty of evidence of a bomb plot but nothing that leads back to martin lee sorry about that yuri any progress on the martin lee angle anyway sable has the mayor's ear and unchecked authority we've searched that address you gave me found plenty of evidence of a bomb plot but nothing that leads back to martin lee i'm working on that peter so if you're running this place while mr lee's out of town who's doing your old job me but i could always use more help you know anyone actually i do his name is miles morales why does that sound familiar his father was being honored at city hall oh i talked to him at the funeral he's a smart kid he's just having a tough time i knew a boy like that once i remember it helped to uh stay busy it might help him too here's his mom's number thanks i'll give her a call hey you haven't heard from mr lee have you no why i'm just curious i've got a few minutes before work i'm gonna look around see if there's anything else i can do to help you out oh you you don't have to i know i want to i should check out lee's office pete glad to see you're okay this office is locked how do i get in there quietly i don't feel safe huh never seen that room before whoa what the high voltage lines what needs this much power there i understand but the account number is in mr lee's office which lee's journal a key wonder where the lock is that room i saw from the crawl space it should be right on the other side of the shrine looks like this note is for me huh the shrine in the photo is missing the picture hmm some kind of puzzle lock that seems right oh i see yes wow what are you hiding lee can feel my power growing feeding off my anger father would say i've lost the path of balance that he could never understand the only way to fight a monster is to become one whoa this is the folder mj found at the auction house this might help us figure out what lee's planning next yeah it's a burn room wired to destroy evidence one more the police had found this or may i want to think of what could have happened hello peter mr lee i thought you were out of town did you find what you were looking for martin you're back you get that thank you and heading off again shortly i'm afraid just needed a few things from my office you must have heard about city hall yes tragic peter was there he was very lucky and an osborne rally i didn't know you were a fan well what matters is you are both safe amen but the bombers are still out there who knows what they've planned next i don't think you or may have anything to worry about as long as you stay away from places you're not supposed to be well i should go when will you be back when my work is done wait wait i finally got your evidence head to the feast center in chinatown what am i going to find a nice lady named mae parker and some really weird stuff hidden in lee's office but listen he's got another attack planned where when still working on that but i think he's going to use something called devil's breath sounds destructive what is it a substance created by ozcorp probably a bioweapon of some kind i have a folder full of info on i'm holding onto it for now i'll send copies as soon as i can okay we'll check his office if the evidence stands up i'll put out an apb mj hey just checking in peter hey can i call you back i think you'll want to hear this wait why are you whispering just in the middle of something how about we catch up over dinner is my place oh sure i'll even cook cool see us wait remember how you told me about lee's corrupting touch i think i just saw it in action how some perfectly nice homeless people just jumped me thing is they had glowing eyes and i remembered yuri telling me something similar about the guard who released shocker so shocker was working for lee it's all connected there's more but i guess we'll talk about it at dinner yeah see ya dinner huh what should i cook hi doctor how are you parker exciting news come by the lab uh like now this is my defining moment can't wait to show you cool um i've got dinner plans can i come by later dinner can wait you need to see this peter uh okay be right there wonder if this means i have a job hey doctor hello peter i'll be just a minute wow look at all this new stuff we really need to get better about organizing our workspace where did you get all this equipment called in every last favor took out a few loans it's like we're starting over once again but this time's going to be different you've been busy just getting started you know until now we've been looking at prosthetics from the wrong perspective why restore people to what they were when we can make them better okay i think that should do it you ready [Music] everything okay damn it this is all your fault normandy well i know who you're not voting for in the next election sorry i have a habit of making bad jokes in ten situations uh it was a good joke parker just a bit of an overreaction on my part no don't worry why don't you take a break i'll uh i'll clean this up and uh get us ready for another test [Music] so uh i hope you don't mind me asking but it seems you and norman have a bit of a history we were lab partners in college became friends decided to start a business we both had visions of changing the world just in different ways wait you were at oscorp when it started i'm half the reason it's called oscorp in grad school everyone called us the o's add corp to that and well it is a catchy name but why'd you leave norman became more and more obsessed with genetics he started a project i considered unethical and there was this anyway lawyers got involved i chose to leave in exchange for a settlement but that money didn't last very long i've relied on grants ever since if this project doesn't work don't worry it'll work uh let me let me just fix this up i'll brew some fresh coffee be sure to run a diagnostic on the control unit could be a short huh no good gotta reroute this circuit [Music] [Music] oh why don't you do the honors this time i think we did it next step neural interface that's a lot of work for you to do by yourself sure you can handle it apparently not judging by today's debacle because i still haven't found another job my funds are still i know it's okay don't worry i'll figure it out what's a few bucks when you're trying to change the world right to changing the world missed call from mj doctor i need to go but

into that office what are they building is this all careful so what's the boss doing with the money from this lead job easy does it what kind of vehicle needs tires this big where is it i swear i left it over here that guy's not going anywhere maybe i can distract him what is this some kind of military hardware office must be to my right need to move careful through here those barrels seem important why is that what's in these boss come on tombstone you're right rick ah won't notice it won't be there god damn it accent i'll fix it ah you got some stones rick let's see if they break [Music] such a disappointment [Music] and now i need a new welder can't turn back now i need to get into that office come on now made it blueprints an apc this is what they're building for lee why does he need an armored vehicle there must be something else and here we go gps trackers what is tombstone using these for all right boys time to move get the gear for my office time to go okay i want to say don't ever do that again but since i know you're going to anyway here take a few of those next time nice thanks you know tombstone is crazy and pretty much invincible right everybody has their weakness mine is whatever you're cooking right now smells amazing the chicken curry uh just needs some time to simmer no dumplings i hope you're never gonna let me live that one down are you nope the great dumpling catastrophe i still can't believe they evacuated the entire building i went in january too your neighbors hated me yeah they were pretty happy when we broke up yeah so let's talk about what you found in lee's office well lee clearly has issues with norman osborn yeah but but why i don't know yet but his next move looks like it involves devil's breath whatever that is yeah i'll dig into it so i was thinking what if we teamed up wait you want to be my sidekick like a spider girl spider woman no woman no not a sidekick a partner oh not again hey it's your crime system thingy looks like a residential break-in charles standish hmm that sounds familiar oh oscorp cfo wait you don't think this does anything to do with lee do you sorry to cook and run did did you just leave your clothes on the kitchen floor ah where do you want me to uh the couch is fine dad see you later yeah hey it's me this curry is legit so what do we know about charles standish let's see chief financial officer at oscorp single known for his art collection if lee's after him it's got to be related to devil's breath i'll run a search on everything in that file let me know the second you find something i think lee might be planning something even worse than city hall so are we partners now because it sure feels like we are partners sounds good okay see ya partner police look like they could use some help [Music] [Music] somebody was in a hurry spiderman you're hurt i'm okay but you gotta find mr standish fast those guys in the masks kidnapped him and forced him up to his place he lives in the penthouse top floor okay sit tight so glad you're here i can't find my car could have sworn i parked on this level oh um [Music] oh wait you guys work here too this building is serious about parking enforcement [Music] good fight a for effort elevator won't work they know i'm here but maybe i can sneak up through the elevator shaft i may finish it should be able to make it up to the penthouse from here [Music] ding ding okay almost there stay out of the light nice and easy ah there's standish okay now what enter your password [Music] he sounds nervous i should take him out we're eating don't hey foreign be [Music] [Music] sleep it off okay all clear hope standish is all right [Music] let's try this again it's safe now what were they after just financial records about devil's breath how do you know about that why do they want it i don't even know what it is mr osborn's been pouring money into it for years but he keeps the whole project a secret i'm the only one who has any record of it not anymore looks like they copied some records to a secure server payroll information on a dr isaac delaney who is he i honestly don't know come on come on wait the elbow hold on i almost got him try to fall slower [Music] you okay yeah i think so good good you know as elevator chefs go this is pretty nice hey yuri you okay yeah but i didn't get much out of standish before these sable guys stepped in and told me to back off what's the deal i get the sense all they care about is keeping him quiet because he knows about devil's breath right whatever the hell that is i'm working on that i think i just got a lead a lead you sound like a cop don't you mean spider cop [Music] uh yuri that's fair what happened with standish he's safe okay good and the demons they were looking for a name you got a pen yes go dr isaac delaney okay who is he what's his deal i was hoping you could tell me i'm honest just give me a few oh and before i forget you left that tracker from tombstones at my place i'll drop it at dr octavius's lab i'll let you know what i find on delaney do we have an update on the situation in clinton outpost x-ray under attack it's the demons stable teams this is control what's our status in times square apc under fire repeat we are taking fire hey do you have time to check something out for me no but if you ask nicely just got a call about a suspicious looking box on a rooftop in hell's kitchen i could call in the bomb squad but if it's just some kid's science project yeah i know budget crisis yadda yadda so will you please check it out there's the magic word i hope it's some kid's science project man i miss those days school projects are so much easier than real life projects hmm looks military great weird spider-man so you found one of my recon points who is this wrong question the correct one is can you stop the bombs i've planted mystery man's got recon points spread all over this computer's tracking bombs around the district and they're about to go off i gotta move i don't have much time [Music] one more better hurry so close to perfection nice work with the bombs but you lean into your throat too much hurts the accuracy is

name dr morgan michaels [Music] thank you [Music] uh [Music] [Music] um that's all of them gotta find lee [Applause] [Music] stop them from hurting each other what did lee do to these people [Music] not that guy again [Music] apologies don't be okay later yuri i need your help i've got reports of shots fired at dsu yeah that's me i'll explain later but right now you need to find a dr morgan michaels martin lee's coming after him copy that spider-man who is this dr michaels i think he's the head scientist on this devil's breath project did you find him yes and no sable says they have him under protection at a safe house somewhere in the city but they won't tell me where i thought you guys were working together so did i okay i have an idea on how to find him i'll let you know if it works attention hey did you find dr delaney at the party yeah but so did lee oh no what happened lee corrupted him and made him kill himself that's horrible we have to stop this guy we will before delaney died he gave lea a name morgan michaels morgan michaels how is he i'm not sure but i bet he works on the devil's breath project have you learned anything from that devil's breath file yeah get this a few years ago osborne came to fisk and asked him to build a lab but to keep it hits from regulators secret lab for devil's breath if it's as dangerous as we think it is i can see why where's the lab that's not in the file osborne made fist destroy all records efforts all i have are invoices from osborne's personal account to fist construction knowing fisk he kept the invoices around for blackmail material on the mayor everything leads back to norman osborne guess it's time to pay him a visit i doubt he's gonna tell you anything i wasn't planning to ask okay that's how i can get into norman's office can't get in there without shutting down some security systems but if they see me they'll put the whole place on lockdown i should be able to hack into the security network modules from the outside they're the network cables just need to follow them to the security module looks like there's four of these around the building that should make things easier what the hell security teams call in stable team alpha standing by looks like an electrical problem copy that keep an eye on the exterior while we try to track down the issue just when i thought it would be easy all stable teams looks like we have some sort of software problem we're calling in a specialist copy that continuing exterior sweep what all agents someone's taking control of one of our subsystems initiating delta protocol man everybody's got drones these days stable teams i need a status report exterior sweep negative we are all clear still look like a software issue we don't know we're evaluating please maintain current alert level attention all stable teams there's a small possibility we have a trespasser on site damn it another subsystem is going offline i need a team to scan the 85th floor exterior copy control bird inbound gotta move hi mj a little busy right now i'll be quick listen i got a lead on charles standish's location i think if i can get to him i can make him talk he knew about dr delaney he probably knows about morgan michaels as well okay just don't do anything crazy nice now i can get into norman's office and hopefully find out more about morgan michaels and devil's breath exterior sweep negative should we go on lockdown not yet mr osborne is in the middle of an important call but keep tracking there must be someone out there hold on switching to a secure line i'm way ahead of you wilson i had my people go through all your files if you try to expose our business arrangement it'll be your word against mine and i'm not the one behind bars right now wait is norman talking to wilson fisk neo statue what are you talking about the neo statue from the auction house they must be talking about that file mj found who has the file we do norman but it doesn't tell us enough which is why i'm doing some slightly illegal but morally acceptable bne right now jackpot gr27 hmm dr morgan michaels is the chief scientist but the location of the lab is redacted ai controlled crispr if that actually works it could cure any genetic disease cystic fibrosis huntington's this is crazy [Music] creepy whoa gr-27 is devil's breath it's designed to cure diseases but in its current form it's like a bioweapon dr michaels keeps the only sample with him at all times that's why lee wants him we find michaels we find devil's breath hey pete what's up mj get this devil's breath wasn't designed to be a weapon it's a treatment for genetic disorders but its current form is wildly imperfect in trying to fix the body it rips it apart we need to locate dr michaels i don't trust sable to contain something this deadly i may have a lead on that charles standish is being held at stable central park compound if anyone knows michael's location it'll be ozcorp's cfo i'm trying to reach him now reach him that place is crawling with guards how are you trying to reach him very very quietly gotta go partner sneaking into a sable compound i could go bad fast i should head to central park all units officers are pinned down by hostels and masks reported location is near the theater district looks like doc checked in peter i've had an epiphany it's all about the mind take me for example a mind of unlimited potential shackled to a tired old body think of what that mind could achieve if it were freed in developing our neural interface we need to think beyond replicating the tired putterings of our physical forms instead reach into imagination and possibility reach into the mind i've never heard doc this excited by a project hope he's not too excited where are you mj crap reach him that place is crawling with guards how are you trying to reach him very very quietly gotta go partner stand is just somewhere in there gotta get past that guard time to see if these lures pete gave me work that gap at the fence looks promising just need to distract the guard house guest must be standish he's here somewhere what's that demons are killing anyone related to devil's breath standish is in real danger got it time to move standish i knew it i've got to get to that tent standish insecure ma'am lock out calms as well i do not want things to press about michael's or devil's breath could really use a coffee crap generator tripped i won't distract him for long how's it looking convoy gonna be ready five by five as soon as boss gives the word we'll give michael's move to the new safe house they're moving him have to find out where before we lose our shot get that truck go coco and charlie are both on deck for dr michael's relocation man add two more units he carries the only sample of devil's breath i will not be responsible for pandemic looks important no not in frame there's dandish's tent can't believe michael just carries devil's safe houses if dr michaels is in one of these standish might know which one nothing sector's clear almost there continuing sector sweep oh [Music] charles standish holy crap charles where is dr morgan michaels police sent you didn't he no [Music] he wants to kill me he told him to do it do it himself i'm not with the demons i'm not with sable i'm a reporter and i want to see lee stopped just like you what i've heard your byline stable won't listen to me she has michael's in the bowery they're moving him to a new safe house tomorrow at noon but she's totally ignoring grand central grand central the demons were talking about it when they held me they're going there to get to get what charles what are the demons need to get at grand central definitely not a stable guy sorry charlie okay time to go no he knows something [Music] well that was maybe the most awkward swing in my life mj is not happy hey okay another thing sorry charlie you knock a man out destroy my background research and the best you've got is sorry charlie is everything a joke to you what mk no i screwed up it was a tension breaker pension breaker right you know this is exactly why we broke up i thought we broke up so you could focus on your career we broke up because you wouldn't stop treating me like a baby don't do this mj don't do that mj oh that's too dangerous mj i mean i don't have super spider powers but i'm not made out of glass you snuck into the middle of an armed military you know what can we not do this right now please did you learn anything about dr michaels fine michaels is in the bowery somewhere sable's moving in tomorrow at him awesome anything else was he saying something about grand central before i jumped in he was no it was nothing listen i gotta go peter filing deadline peter that's how you know she's still mad peter nice work mr superhero peter i'm about to begin another test oh sorry my bus broke down and there were no cabs but i'll be there as soon as i can hey sorry i'm late morning parker or is it evening that doesn't matter check the neurosensors would you we need a faster response time on it try to get it under three milliseconds [Music] okay looks like i could optimize this power relay [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] nice okay what next looks like some impedance in this neurosensor circuit [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] finished signal to noise is out of whack a new signal processor should reduce lag [Music] i got it doc 2.8 milliseconds good work peter yes [Music] i'd call that a mild success i call that unbelievable do you need some help yes doctor what's going on has become that obvious my doctors call it a degenerative neurological disorder probably caused by overexposure to toxic chemicals in my reckless youth sorry is is there anything i can do you already are the worst part is it only affects the muscles the mind continues to work but it can no longer do you're the only one who knows peter i'd like to keep it that way of course uh if you'd like to seek a position with more of a future i i came here to work for you because of what you've got up here that's not going anywhere so neither am i oh peter before i forget i read the most fascinating article outlines possible next steps for the neural interface i'll take a look thanks doc man i remember the first day i interviewed here i showed up with stains on my shirt ten minutes late from stopping a mugging still can't believe doc hired me i hope he doesn't regret it now hmm direct interface with the basal ganglia exciting but risky i don't know doc you'll need a gallium silk array to make it work even then odds of injury are pretty high gallium genius never mind the risks we'll work them out in time doc's really sick at this rate he'll lose control of his motor functions within a year and if we're not careful an intracranial implant could make things even worse even alter his personality we need to proceed carefully peter is starting to suspect he hides it but i can tell he's seen my twitch notice the decay of my fine motor control well i'm the one who wanted a genius for an assistant of course he knows i just need more time my work can improve millions of lives save millions of lives it can also save my own i just need more time um doc i'm sorry my aunt just texted no worries peter i was thinking of taking a break myself as soon as i check our telemetry data thanks i'll be back in a few hours [Music] hi mei let me guess running late nope i'm actually on my way now have you heard from miles no but his mother said he was coming so good

things have mounted guns i can't let them spot me okay i'm in the clear that was intense oh hey mom hi honey did you make it to the shelter okay uh yeah almost there miles you don't have to work at

perspective what the hell i must be honest i was hoping to bring you here my abilities lend me a certain persuasiveness [Music] i've been watching you i was waiting for you at city hall you never came where were you this is real or in my mind it was a shame so many had to die with no heroes to save them that officer saved your life didn't he he was here because of you and norman wanted to use him a futile gesture and where was norman during all this slinking away like a rat he knew what was going to happen and he fled norman is a hidden cancer on this city he must be excised with no trace of his corruption to return norman hides behind his mask of lies i will break it apart and drag him into the light put on the mask become one of us thanks but no thanks one way or the other you will join me all the souls you've lost the innocent victims you couldn't save martin their blood is on your hands you can stop oswald you have so much strength i can give will their bodies filled the gutters and

where is this serum i'm gone so-called superhero you think you save people but you just make it worse this is your fault my fault he was under your protection you really need two of those stop we need to brief mr osborne now i'll go with her thank you i'll remember this not getting much coverage i should look for more towers to activate yuri tell me you've got a lead on martin lee's location we have footage from a guy at a coffee shop looks like he hopped into a black sedan after the crash black sedan great let me finish we have a partial plate and one of my patrol guys just found a matching plate black sedan in a parking lot near canal and hudson you're a good cop yuri i'm on my way spider-man hello is this working dr michaels how are you calling borrowed one of sables radios listen transit hubs are the most likely release points for devil's breath airports bus terminals train stations it'll spread like wildfire from there why the hell is ozcorp developing a fire weapon in the city shouldn't this be an antarctic bunker devil's breath is personal for norman it's been his obsession for decades the project breaks every state and federal regulation on the books but he doesn't care if the city finds out he can kiss re-election goodbye never mind re-election he'd be tried in the hague for war crimes why are you telling me all this aren't you just as culpable as norman yes completely but lee's actions have been a wake-up call we've ignored the project's risk for too long i trust you spider-man you're the only one trying to do the right thing please protect the city from our mistakes damn devil's breath is gone i should call mj and warner this is mary jane watson please leave a detailed message and i'll get back to you as soon as i can what are you up to now mj stander said the demons are looking for something at gct but what could they possibly need here should probably call peter and let him know what i'm doing actually scratch that he'd probably just tell me to go home and change myself to my laptop i'll just check things out quick and let him know what i find this guy a microbe dispersal device releases specially formulated microbes into the atmosphere and in turn leaves our oceans and rivers cleaner than when man first walked the earth mr lee this will be easier for everyone if you remain calm and do as i say police over here no uh i would like to speak to mayor osborne who's calling the man he is looking for what do you want i want you at grand central terminal in 30 minutes by yourself or there'll be more blood on your hands hmm mj i'm on my way are you hurt no i'm fine just hurry going as fast as i can what are you doing at gct i'll explain later listen lee's going to release the devil's breath you've got to get out of there he's not going to do it until norman osborne gets here wait this must have been lee's plan all along make norman responsible by forcing him to release the devil's breath himself it sort of makes sense in a twisted psychotic way okay i'm here coming into the terminal now anything i should be on the lookout for he's i have a family please don't hurt us looks like he's got some drones patrolling guess he's prepared for you don't worry i'm in the ventilation system can you see a safe exit point southwest corner on my way if i get any closer the drones will spot me see that tablet i'm looking at that controls the drones think you can snag it yes if you can distract them and not get shot i'm ready tell me when okay i'm ready incoming okay move wait listen i'm a reporter i have a direct line to mayor osborne i can help make sure he arrives on time how first let is they're coming jump over the railings oh drones get to cover you still got that tablet yeah better work fast okay i got this come on come on almost there they did it good job now let's get you out of here about the devil's breath i'll come back for it no we're partners remember can we argue later if we don't help those people they could die so could you i can't let that happen no no i got myself into this i'm getting myself out what do you mean you got yourself into this i don't like this there's too many of them and let's start taking them out quietly that did it grab him see if you can break up that group i'm gonna try and separate them do it mj did you know lee would be here not exactly what do you mean i thought

these lies it's over norman time to give them the truth [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] being heavily enforced by sable international who maintain tight security over all transit points throughout the city police and stable agents continue to battle with rikers and raft escapees meanwhile mayor osborne has gone on record blaming spider-man for the prison break and city-wide sickness and branding him a fugitive but he has yet to provide evidence and many believe the mayor is just deflecting blame since an exclusive report by the bugle revealed that this disease originated in a secret unregulated oz corp laboratory here in manhattan mayor osborne insists that oscar turn it off but has not provided any further evidence to support this claim [Music] dr octavius why how did i let this happen just got a call from the hospital they said you went awol i need to get back to work the doctor said you still have 14 broken bones which means i have 192 non-broken ones thanks for taking care

dealing with electro's elaborate supervillain antics while he was in the raft trapping the police with a network of energy transformers who does that only one more the last transformer trapping the police is hanging from that helicopter wow picture that's the first time anyone has said those particular words in that particular order how did they even get that thing attached and it can't be easy

feel like you couldn't still partners always hey uh so i didn't know if uh you wanted sparkling or or flat or spring or mountain spring so i got one of each am i interrupting no um mj ms watson and i were just talking strategy strategy that's right the city is in danger it needs our help all of our help all right well call the play coach okay divide and conquer ms watson we need an anti-serum for devil's breath ozcorp's developing something but there's no way they can keep it safe from octavius and lee we need to find the cure and protect it i'll chase down some leads miles you need to be my eyes and ears at feast anything goes wrong call me we need to keep that place and the people there safe all right you got it what are you gonna do getting a costume nut jobs is taking the city apart

good luck team [Music] do you have his number are you spiderman's girlfriend that'd be so cool come on sherlock show me what you got in this watersh mortgage board city feels a little more under control miles is watching feast mj is tracking a devil's breath cure time for me to focus on finding otto and stopping whatever he has planned yuri we need to start tracking the big boys still no leads on octavius no nothing forensics can't even do a sweep of times square everyone in that department but the intern is sick i might be able to turn something up let you know what i find [Music] you know what i like about you kid you're always getting better gee thanks creepy stalker guy you can call me taskmaster cause you keep leaving me tasks that's kinda on the nose there's a group of mercenaries committing crimes across the city these mercenaries wouldn't happen to be your mercenaries would they no all i know is they're getting paid well for their work unless you stop them that is what's in it for you i get to watch and learn spider-man here to lend a hand thought you might need one officer you don't know the half of it never seen anything like this devil's breath stuff forensics is having a hell of a time news reports say this is where otto released devil's breath hmm some residue on this sign maybe i can isolate it [Music] a.t rich leader sequence this looks promising so us corpse modified cpf1 definitely devil's breath should be able to track the dispersal path now trail goes in a few directions need to find the right one trail leads down into those vents what was otto doing up here should be a door or an access hatch around here [Music] well this is moody must be some way to hit the lights let there be light whoa was otto using this as a staging ground chaos of the prison break would have been perfect cover to move in martin lee can't believe this is the same man i knew it feast seems like otto and lee have more of a history than i thought how long have they known each other looks like otto recorded messages for his crew oh martin when i first realized it was you targeting osborne these past weeks i was shocked and saddened but then as the situation evolved before my eyes i felt inspired you took the ball steps i had always dreamed of martin and you took them without hesitation i am honored now to join you on this path towards true justice otto's rage is driving him a neural interface is exacerbating it but his hate is genuine he'll destroy the whole city to hurt norman norman i feel like i can't turn around without seeing his face he smiles for the cameras collects his accolades and keeps his booty pressed against my neck why can't anyone else see how selfish he is how reckless how evil if only they could be made to see the norman i know the man behind the mask looks like otto's been studying sable's tech for weaknesses good old rhino my second favorite russian alexi i've followed your career with great interest the world sees you as a witless dullard i see a warrior with a poet's heart i know you desire freedom from the battle suit you're sealed inside help me achieve my goals and freedom shall be yours otto developed a corrosive to free rhino from his suit a certain government agency spent years trying and failing to do that only took otto a few days matt gargan aka scorpion aka crazy pants mccrazy it's rare for me to admit this mr gargan clearing your debts was more difficult than i anticipated you are in arrears to some demanding individuals but once the reservoir job is finished your financial obligations will be finished as well auto octavius is nothing if not persuasive scorpions helping otto in exchange for a clean slate criminal record expunged gambling debts erased old man vulture i've tangled with him more than anyone else here power source for vulture's wings gave him spinal cancer and otto's developing an experimental treatment to save him adrian what bitter irony that your miraculous wings should have brought such horrors on your body thankfully you are now working for me when our work is settled the treatment i've developed will cure you you won't shuffle off this mortal coil just yet my friend electro total live wire that one max when you first conveyed your dream to me i thought you insane pure energy but as i dove deeper into the problem i discovered a way to give us both what we desire i promise you when we are done you will be pure energy or so close to it is to make the difference irrelevant electro's big pipe dream is to become pure energy actually managed to modify his harness to get a little closer to that goal what's this now uv bulb huh nothing happened must be a way to get that lamp on there we go hidden markings otto's tasked the villains to destroy oscorp holdings throughout the city he's trying to take apart norman's empire piece by piece please going after the devil's breath anti-serum using something called icarus what's vulture doing in times square i need to keep my guard up electro's disabling oscorp power plants makes sense seems like the last stage of the plan is a direct assault on oscorp and most likely norman rhino's targeting oscorp's shoreline properties which is he hitting first and why scorpion must be trying to poison the city's reservoir another oscorponed property icarus this is it hello spider-man we've never been properly introduced i'm auto octavius there is no icarus is there no martin needs no assistance to secure the anti-serum icarus was a ruse to get you into position into position huh so refreshing to work for a man like octavius back up plans for his backup plans mj hey pete are you okay what's happening traffic's rough listen lee's gunning for the anti-serum we need to find oscorp's devil's breath lab before he dies on it right now pulling every building permit in the city if there's a record of the lab i'll find it that's great okay talk soon empty trap failed softened him up time for plan b [Music] [Music] our teamwork beautiful ain't it helping you reach those unattainable goals like killing spiderman that was almost heartwarming electro you really grew in prison didn't you ah me europe no adrian it's me spiderman what are you babbling about nobody ever gets long my jokes tonight insect i thought we had a healthy give-and-take man if i misrepresented spiderman i must break you you got it you got my joke i'm so happy i could almost stop fighting almost gotta be honest liked it better when you two were loners a figure of youth the wisdom of experience just like oil and water sure wow [Music] he doesn't stand a chance yeah yeah we got this again hate to be the pessimist but i don't think you guys are assessing this situation accurately [Music] one down one to go how many times have we done this dance adrian a dozen two dozen once too many tonight will be your last what's happening electro's been grounded spider-man i presume if you really cared about this city you'd be helping me expose osborne for the criminal he is by killing innocent people i would have restored the power you're sick you need help i have all the help i need and we will not stop until norman gets what he deserves [Music] i hate it when they team up i just need to catch my breath [Music] what time oh man i need to update yuri yuri vulture and electro are down four to go i saw also noticed a rooftop in times square exploded wouldn't happen to be related would it nothing gets by you it was octavius's staging ground he's using the villains to pull apart oscorp vulture and electro were targeting power plants scorpions going after water treatment not sure about rhino yet something along the shoreline that's good enough to start i assume you're going after scorpion yeah city's already on the brink if we lose clean water we might never come back i'll update you when i make progress sounds like a plan [Music] ground teams this is control need a status update from firehouse starting patrol now eyes out for spiderman i should check on miles hey pete are you okay that's what i was gonna ask you i'm fine but you and me are in the middle of it there's the reservoir no sign of scorpion better take a closer look now if i was a mercenary dressed like a scorpion where would i be behind you me i'd end it now but octavius is paying and he wants to torture you which i respect [Music] damn it what did he inject me with [Music] whoa what the is that a sea of poison can't be this can't be real must be the poison but i can't take any chances gotta get to higher ground and analyze whatever he injected me with okay should be safe for a minute i need to analyze the neurotoxin so i can create an antidote scorpions made some upgrades hallucinogenic neurotoxin my brain will create nightmares that my body thinks are real i have to create the antidote fast first i need a natural steroid extract from an eclipta alba plant should do the trick esu's greenhouse is nearby hope it's in season there's the greenhouse they clipped alba it should be inside the greenhouse [Music] it's just the hallucinations intensifying you can get through this [Music] doc you sound like i did before the neural interface affected my mind my obsessions were always there but the interface allowed me to fully embrace them i have to fix this fix you somehow ah peter always trying to shoulder the responsibility even though there's no hope i can't tell you how many times your unfettered optimism has kept me going i'll miss being with you i really will [Music] i'm sorry i'm so sorry yes yes you're sorry and yet you let it happen it makes one wonder where your priorities lie i mean if i was really that important to you why would you let me destroy there's the dog [Music] to mix a permanent antidote one of harry's research stations was developing a synthetic atrophy gotta get there fast [Music] giant deadly scorpion tails lovely thanks brain [Music] scorpion how did you get this number always asking these interesting questions is not how am i calling you is am i gone maybe i'm just the favorite screams of your night reel or no when i cure this poison i'm coming for you mac big talk from the little bug right there well not again you're too late just as you were too late to help me this isn't you doc ah but it is me the me polite society found inconvenient the parts of myself i suppressed but you helped me break those chains i'm sorry i'll find a way to help you i swear it stop deluding yourself you never help anyone the poison is it you are the poison everyone you touch suffers stop running from me let me try i want nothing from you you're a failure you bring nothing but pain no stop i'm not giving up on you please just talk to me i can help you so you can treat me like all the rest containing me suffocating me no i will let my genius shine on its own there it is the atropine now i just need to mix up the antidote looks like i'm headed back to the lab count on mine i made it somehow but i'm running out of time i need to mix the antidote [Music] you're just like usborne trying to steal my genius everything that happens now is thought i forgot about you that gave me an opening another hallucination at least he had an imaginary glass jaw now i know you're the poison trying to distract me one down [Music] just [Music] another one down i can barely stand up there's the centrifuge i need [Music] i can feel it i think i did it where'd my suit go i think i took decontamination a little too far i'd better put some clothes on much better let's just go ahead and forget that ever happened oh it's still foggy need to work the last of this poison out of my system before i tackle the other villains good time to go on patrol okay i need to get after scorpion but i haven't seen ant-may face-to-face since the fire i think i can afford a quick pit stop at feast [Music] right over here until miles gets back the best thing we can do is keep everyone fed oh peter it is so good to see you how are you healthy i'm good how are you holding up man good but busy oh let me go oh there i'm okay didn't you tell me something once about accepting that i'm human just like everyone else you weren't bad masters at turning my own words against me i am fine peter just a little rundown where's miles could he help out no he is he's off picking up medical

[Music] a little forced together time might help you boys learn to play nice all right yuri that's four down just octavius and lee left something tells me they won't be as easy they're only half our problem though devil's breath cases are getting worse and oscorp is being coy about an anti-serum i'm worried they're seeing dollar signs in a seller's market i'd expect nothing less from our beloved mayors leave devil's breath to me one of my best people is on it pete hey i've been through the city state and federal databases if this devil's breath lab does exist it's off the books the only other

[Music] hello [Music] peter i saw you as a son i should have known you turned on me just like all the others i've worshipped you your mind your conscience wanting to help others the way you never gave up that's because men like us have a duty a responsibility to use our talents in the service of others even if they don't appreciate it we have to do what's best for those beneath us whether they understand it or not no you're wrong you were everything i wanted to be you just threw it away yes of course you're right peter oh i see that now the neural interface affected my mind but i can fix it we can fix it together if you'll help me do everything i can make sure you get the best out no if they put me away they'll take my arms i'll be trapped in this useless body [Music] please peter that wasn't me you said you'd never abandon me you promised remember and of course you rest easy knowing your secret is safe with me you do what you think is best doc it's all any of us can either even when it hurts like hell you know where are you going [Music] fear peter [Music] it's still viable we'll need the entire sample as a base to produce more doses how long will that take a few hours maybe a day what if we use it to cure someone right now then there won't be enough to cure the others i'll give you a few minutes [Music] you're gonna be okay ma'am i've got the cure right here take off your mask [Music] i wanna see my nephew [Music] you knew i've known for a while i never wanted you to worry i did and i am so proud of you and ben with me too all the people you've saved i don't know what to do yes you two [Music] ugh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] so hi mary jane watson associate editor congrats thank you i knew you could do it what about you find a job yet oh no but uh i'll be right with you honey thank you i was actually considering maybe a career change hmm yeah i think i might want to become a chef i'm sorry no it's you're a scientist a good one yeah the last project i worked on i created a monster octopus that almost destroyed the city so i mean you do make a hell of a chicken curry i do still working on my dumplings though going camping oh no my uh new place isn't gonna be ready for about a week so i'm gonna be crashing with miles for the next few nights oh you know you can always stay at my place only if you want to no i i mean i mean i mean yes i mean no no i don't not want to but meaning i i do want to but only if you do i never stopped wanting to me neither well i'm not an expert or anything but i think it's in the way that you ask her hey ain't getting too nervous hey all right so where do you want this uh right over here is fine all right [Music] hey so pete yeah i uh kind of got to talk to you about something i can't tell my mom about what's up well um weird things have been going on like physically oh oh uh well you know you're at that age where your your body starts to change and so you may be noticing some areas for example not that uh i think it's i think it's better that i just um i show you no no no no it's pretty weird right [Music] not that weird [Music] we were so close but i'll keep trying i will find a cure i will i love you son [Music] mary jane watson associate editor begin research notes my sources are saying the magia is mounting a comeback the old crime families were all but wiped out until fisk went away and they started filling the void the old dawns were working harmoniously for years but now that there's a power vacuum there's bound to be a power struggle it's only a matter of time before one of the families makes a move on the others better follow up with my sources in the force hopefully we can stop this crime come back before it even starts hey pete i'm working on a story you might be interested in the escort expose new one it's about the majia crime families the mob i thought they went out with swing dancing both times they were in decline but with fisk and the demons gone macosa nostra is making a comeback i love it when you talk dirty easy tiger so you know the feds raided the magia last month sure well one of the dawns had this lost masterpiece painting called the maria and now they're displaying it over at manhattan mocha and and i have a source who says one of the families is planning to steal it back tonight sounds like there's more to it than just art appreciation he'll swing by the museum [Music] [Music] mj looks like your source was right there's a small army of goons trying to break in stay on the line while i take a closer look just be careful if those guys are majia they play for keeps hurry up come on boss wants that painting we should have been in and out by now you want to try be my guest sheesh some people will do anything to avoid paying full price admission what about the guards if they give us any trouble these guys have to learn to appreciate art during business hours how [Music] time for a little demonstration of the fine art of subduing criminals i can handle this clown [Music] i know some of these guys that's frederico frazelli and sal petrillo those guys are part of hammerhead's crime family right why would he want the maria it doesn't seem like his thing i'm gonna look around make sure no one got in a different way i'll let you know if i find anything hey what is that mj someone cut a hole in a skylight i'm gonna check it out so while hammerheads guys were trying to break in the front someone else looked in through the roof looks that way no sign of anyone at all shouldn't there be guards here at night yeah maybe check the security booth near the entrance there should be cameras there too they would have seen whoever broke in the security booth's secure i need a palm print to get in any clue about what happened to the guards will be inside is there a way to override the lock not without a guard's hand actually their hand print if you can't find the guards maybe you can lift prints from the things they touched oh yeah good idea always happy to lend a hand got a handprint well a part of one looks like i'll need more weird it's like the guards just vanished another one cool trained guards wouldn't leave their stuff around like this unless they didn't leave voluntarily a flashlight i can get a partial okay i should have enough partials to reconstruct a handprint i should be able to reconfigure the scanner so it takes my data if i bypass the optic sensor i can upload my own data got it transmitting hand print now we're in nice what do you see they're alive looks like they were tranquilized no signs of a struggle definitely not hammerhead style so if not hammerhead who is there a camera feed let me check someone switched off camera five well that's suspicious let me turn it back on and see what they didn't want anyone looking at it's pointing at one of the paintings in the exhibit that has to be the maria and no one's stolen it yet i need to see this up close figure out what's so special about it the maria is a brilliant example of modern pastoral impressionism the saga of its repeated theft and recovery are almost as intriguing as the artwork itself looks like a pretty normal painting to me it is there's way more valuable stuff in that museum so why is the magia so worked up about this painting hang on mj someone's coming [Music] keep an eye out spider-man can still be here oh damn it gotta lock behind security glass hey tell frank we're gonna need to break out the big guns mj hammerhead's guys called in reinforcements they haven't spotted me yet good try to keep it that way yes but we got the signal that means he was here [Music] cops will be here any minute the hell with this grab what you can do great now they're looting the other art gotta stop them before they make it out next time try the gift shop as soon as i get home [Music] how about as a consolation prize i send you a poster of that piece for your prison cell maybe they'll have art classes in prison [Music] [Music] looks like you'll have to get your mom another mother's day gift may i suggest a bath bomb stay down peter you there you okay yeah i think i got them all a lot of heart to put back though what about the maria this could have all been a distraction my thoughts exactly i'll head back there hopefully the glass was thick enough security wall's intact and bulletproof nobody's getting near the maria anytime soon mission accomplished then i hope so yeah i am gonna have to call you right back why what's going on you look good been working out no i mean you know a little so you swinging solo now you're back with your ex that's a lot of questions i'm just curious yeah i hear that's bad for cats how about you tell me why you're really here i was just waiting for the right moment look behind you [Music] rockets who brings rockets to a museum i'm you ready punk [Music] you up [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i like your new tricks and i'm tired of your old ones weren't you gonna stop stealing art who said i'm here for the art what are you doing i think you have lives to save not again [Music] what where'd she go peter is everything okay sorry mj i just uh ran into an old friend who trouble [Music] so black cat was the one who went in through the roof she was working with hammerheads guys yeah she was probably watching me the whole time i was in there just tell me you didn't let her get away with the maria she didn't good she smashed it and stole a data drive hidden in the frame what sorry so what do you think was on that drive good question i'll start asking around and i guess i'll start following cat prints we have reports of an explosion in the vicinity of times square and bryant explosion better check it out looks like another car bomb which family set it up this time camera head again probably might be more nearby better calling the bomb squad bombs under things time to go small [Music] spiderbot's active should be tracking the other bombs okay still a few more out there [Music] disarmed need to find the others got it just one left just in time hammerhead's on a mission better keep a lookout for more of these around the city [Music] hello spiderman this is detective mackie i got your number from a friend in the force i bet i know which friend what can i do you poor detective probably better if we spoke in person can you stop by the greenwich precinct when you get a chance i hear you like meeting on rooftops sure thing see in a few this will keep me busy while i wait to hear from mj that museum heist was crazy it's not black cat's style to work with guys like hammerhead hope mj can find out the story behind that data drive [Music] harassing a civilian nearby officers please proceed to the west village spider-man over here detective mackie i presume thanks for coming i want to talk to you about the black cat i played the fifth not the new cat the old one 20 years ago i worked the case black cat is a copycat huh what happened to the original he died in prison but we never found all the paintings he stole i've got a new lead but the department doesn't want to waste resources on an old case wasting resources is kind of my specialty great head to this location i'll fill you in on the way i appreciate your help i'm retiring soon and this case is my biggest loose end so i went through the files one last shot the old cat preferred to steal art but right before he got busted he hit a smoke detector factory smoke detectors that's random not really he stole the americium 241 inside him i thought he had a buyer for the radio isotopes but i was watching a movie the other night and saw something that gave me an idea what if he tagged the paintings he stole with those isotopes in order to help him find them once he got out what movie were you watching wait don't tell me spoilers so i was thinking if we tracked the isotope we could find the stolen paintings i have a simulation counter in my suit that should do it i'll call you if i find anything thanks spider-man if i can close the books on this one i can retire in peace i think i'm close to one of those stolen paintings the signal's coming from this power box but i'm not detecting any electricity huh an art storage tube detective i found a stolen painting it was hidden in a fake power box yes i knew it leave it there i'll have someone pick it up in the meantime i'll send you some other locations we know hardy frequented sounds good wait did you say hardy yeah the original cat's name was walter hardy i'll pull his files and have more details next time we talk walter hardy the original black cat felicia hardy the black cat that i know this appears to be a family business peter the police scanner just reported an active shootout around hudson and north moore isn't that area controlled by the maja yeah whatever black cat stole it might have just triggered a gang war well i'm on my way to check it out any other updates on the museum heist so here's what i got nobody knows what was on that drive in the maria painting but word is hammerhead now has the drive and the magia families are freaked out about it must have been pretty valuable if it made a notorious art thief ignore art wonder why she's working for hammerhead she usually flies solo who knows i stopped trying to figure out felicia a long time ago felicia huh you guys on a first name basis now well i mean yeah i guess maybe well let's just keep each other in the loop okay [Music] run they're not being subtle time to shut this down before someone gets killed [Music] got them all oh boy they go here did i get everyone oh all right all right all right i give up do i get time off if i talk you won't if you don't oh this is the way here chick she told us to come down to your mixing noise sucker bait and i'm the sucker where'd you meet her bodega oh waverly [Music] mj the whole shootout was a distraction black cats set it up to draw police away from waverly street one of the other majia families has a front on waverly the cicero's maybe i can still catch her felicia takes her time she's nothing if not methodical is she now uh i'll keep you posted there's the bodega all right felicia where are you there's our stakeout gear what were you looking at felicia gotcha so [Music] oh hey spider felicia the maggie are no joke you shouldn't be playing with them oh but i like to play spiderman he's working with the cat got him amber had hired you spiderman sure do jump to quick conclusions i'm not working for hammerhead or any other crime family i'm just wrong place wrong time [Music] [Music] [Music] well that was fun now where's felicia i like watching you reminds me of old times what's on that drive not entirely sure to be honest then why are you stealing it if i don't they'll kill my son [Music] your son damn it felicia has a son it can't be i mean it could be and i could be no no no i'm not gonna think about that right now mj i found the cat but she got away really how methodical of her she stole another data drive so each family has a drive i wonder what's on him did you learn anything else uh well not much okay sounds like she's helping hammerhead make a power play on the other crime families which could end badly for everyone the last thing the city needs is a gang war i'll let you know if i turn up any info on those drives what's up sm it's your number one band wait a minute screwball uh don't tell me you're out of jail i sure am and i brought some of my fans with me aren't they just the cutest they're helping me set up for my new show in fact i'd love for you to swing by ttyl something tells me those guys weren't released for good behavior better get over there and check it out [Music] time to put screwball's fans back behind bars where they belong hey guys i promise to go easy on you if you promise to stop idolizing internet celebrities [Music] one thing hasn't changed screwball's getting others to do our dirty work what were they setting up anyway spiderman wasn't that exciting perfect way to kick off my brand new show starring you sorry my dance card's full pretty sure you'll make time for this cause if you don't my fans will get angry and people will die i just love reality shows don't you some people do anything for clicks sam know what an emp emitter is well here's an eli five if you don't disable them they'll knock out power across the city oh and if you don't disable them in the right order zap better hurry bet she's using a binary signal repeater i can piggyback on it to visualize the right path i think my webs will disable them [Music] that one's disabled gotta find the next one oh [Music] don't forget to subscribe to my channel whoa look at him [Music] thumbs up [Music] so close to perfection some upvotes some down votes but thanks to all of you who tuned in hey peter i might have found black cat's next target really how because according to police dispatch there was just a burglary matching her mo i'm sending you the location hey if you find her don't let her play you again yeah i'll be on guard she's i don't know she just seems to bring bad luck wherever she goes black cat brings bad luck that's a little on the nose pete felicia what have you done this time cops have blocked off the whole street if i can pick up the cat's trail maybe i can catch up to her looks like the security guard was hurt maybe the emt can tell me what happened what happened here spider-man uh i heard someone stole a rare book or something is the guard gonna be okay pretty bad case of photocarotitis basically a flash burn of his corneas but he'll recover i need to check the alley if alicia did this i've got to find her magnesium flare probably would burn that guards eyes if i analyze the residue i can track her [Music] [Music] got it there's the trail let's see where it leads having a hard time focusing i can't be a dad i mean technically i can be but looks like a member of the machio crime family spider-man k.o take him out and here comes some of his brothers you're done everything maybe vito got kos for acting exactly like this mr rose were right spider-man's working for a hammerhead like i told the cicero guys i do not work for hammerhead better get back on the trail those look like hammer heads guys mj sending you a pic of a plate i need you to run got it i'll let you know what i find you get it the hell where's the drive she said she wanted to deliver to hammerhead personally didn't i tell you to get the drive yeah but she gave the other ones to him so i just figured so i tell you to do something and you don't do it you know what happens next wait wait wait wait wait wait wait [Music] hey don't act so surprised you said you knew what happened next [Music] wow [Music] [Music] great [Music] here fellas it's probably overdue mj the cat got another day to drive just one more and hammerhead has the drives from all the other majia families we gotta figure out what's on those drives and there's something else there's this thing probably not a big thing but it could be a thing a little maybe a big thing please say a sentence that doesn't include the word thing okay the reason felicia is working for hammerhead is because he took her son i didn't know she had a son well certainly sounds like something hammerhead would do there's this other thing you know that she and i dated for a while yeah so oh oh are you serious i mean i don't know for sure but it's possible ew i need to hang up now okay then she'll call back when she's cooled off right i think i'll go on patrol for a while try to clear my head hey mj first things first head to this address it's the last known address of the costa family safehouse if my source is right they have the final data drive m.j listen no you listen [Music] i i kind of overreacted the last time we talked not at all you reacted exactly how i would we weren't together at the time and it's not like i didn't date other people right wait you dated people like plural the point is we're adults and there's a kid in danger so let's get to saving him i don't deserve you i know okay so i think i know what's on those drives years ago the families agreed to a joint accounting database in order to keep the peace put all their assets in one place and require all five data drives to access it so hammerhead steals black cat's son and then forces her to steal the drive so he can steal the assets from the other families hammerhead's trying to get rich quick and bankrupt the other families in the process we have to find that last drive before he does i'm on it [Music] all units advised reports of a missing vip witness in a magia investigation please proceed to cathedral [Music] felicia we need to talk oh i do miss our little chats but i've got to run [Music] she shorted out my web shooters with an emp guess i'm doing this the old-fashioned way what's going on come on i want to help then back off if hammerhead's got your son you can't do this alone why not i've done everything else alone i'm saying you don't have to why won't you trust me we worked together before answered your own question didn't you where are you going felicia why didn't you come to me with this because it's not your problem it's mine and i'll handle it maybe i don't think it's a problem wait unless you mean the gang war cause that's definitely a problem i can take care of myself huh finally web shooters are back online i can help you stop hammerhead how no killing no breaking the law your way won't get it done felicia about your son i just need to know is he he's mine and i'll take care of him [Music] stubborn little spider i just want to talk [Music] still with me i can go all night if that's

is missing presumed dead she had partnered with majia don hammerhead to blackmail the other family's leadership hardy betrayed hammerhead using appropriated stable weaponry he retaliated aggressively both hardy and the blackmail material were lost in his attack now hammerhead is out for blood blackmail no longer an option he's gone to the mattresses hoping to eliminate the other majidans by force to do this he's continued to appropriate the heavy arm sable left when they pulled up steak we've impounded as much of sable's equipment as we can but it may not be enough it's an all-out gang war and new york is caught in the middle but we may have just gotten lucky the magia have hammerhead pinned in the old harlem sanitarium if we can keep his men distracted a small team may be able to infiltrate the building and take him alive we've got one shot at this we have to make it count getting bad down there ready when you are copy that i'll get them looking the wrong way you gentlemen ready spidey check it out nice that's not regulation lieutenant sorry captain birthday present from the kid not every day you run off with the man you know i'll let it slide this time now get back on the ready line yes ma'am let's do this any of you guys read that chapter in the art of war about misdirection no good homage to civil war camera hits men versus all the other families and i'm caught in the middle of course i can't believe hammer had picked a dilapidated sanitarium for his own base no place i could totally believe it you better we just need to keep these guys focused on me while your inner team sneak in and grab hammerheads every don should have a name like hammerhead let me think how about a moose that's a majestic animal maybe stingray stick with the aquatic theme look i'm spitballing here you met with the wrong [Music] we bob have our heads guys concentrate on the spider camera heads guys fighting the rest of the mazda is like coming to a party where you hate everyone neither side has yeah she's good wow [Music] [Music] you keep beating each other up now i'm just expediting the process more maja thugs more hammerhead thugs or destruction of public property [Music] hey i can do this all day guys though i'd prefer not too uh what the hell [Music] you're gonna be like a bug on a wig shield enough with the bug puns already [Music] you know i know a guy with a way cooler shield that was about as tough as i expected better catch up to yuri hey yuri we're all good outside how's your team oh bad reception she must be in the basement or something gotta catch up to her oh good nice and creepy definitely not haunted i know yuri can handle herself but something isn't right in here i've got to catch up to her please don't let there be any bathroom ghosts i can't deal with that today probably not every old sanitarium is haunted by the ghosts of the people who are mistreated there but this one almost definitely is no talking during the infiltration huh this looks like hammerhead's base of operations yuri that didn't sound good gotta get to her fast who cares cops everywhere and the spiders here too we'll take them out we'll take them all out need a shortcut i should get this guy out of everyone's way and hammerhead nearly took his hero had everything attached to it sleep it off oh [Music] that's all of them now what did hammerhead leave a room full of goo sable tech but what's the rest of this stuff and how'd hammerhead get his fins on all this that's new feels too professional for a hammerhead production that's a lot of live video gear they repurposed the old security system come on yuri thing is i'm a gentleman you didn't knocked you could have come riding no [Music] but you had to go and sneak around that's the problem [Music] no respect [Music] coward course used to be we earned your respect you hit us we hit back made you know your place gave you the fear but now now you think a stiff breeze will blow us over [Music] time to bring the fear back [Music] drop the gun hands behind your head how about no captain i'm sorry do it now there it is there's the fear to a cat do it [Music] [Music] yuri yuri where are you uh [Music]

running the occasional scam why does he have to have such grand ambitions maybe it's that plate in his hope head still ahead of yuri on this one if she gets face to face with hammerhead she'll

casualties keep piling up last night after almost killing majia don hammerhead captain yuri watanabe was forced into administrative leave sources say she told the chief this won't stop me note follow up on this later feels like this isn't the end of her story meanwhile hammerhead who was pronounced dead at the scene was revived and escaped custody police are searching for him but there are no solid leads his men are continuing to target sable weaponry and vehicles including something called project olympus from what we can gather project olympus is an oscorp and sable funded initiative bio-enhancement technology meant to transform people into indestructible super soldiers hammerhead is ruthless and insane and now apparently indestructible but first things first figure out where hammerhead is hiding the question is what are we gonna do when we find him hey mj i'm following the police to an oscorp plant sounds like hammerhead's guys are at it again got any updates on yuri nothing yet you miss her don't you yeah you're a good team i mean not like me and you but you know i know so listen i've got a source at oscorp they're ramping up production of this project olympus equipment which is probably why hammerhead's men are attacking that plant the olympus contract is for stable international part of a deal she made with osborne during the devil's breath crisis and i just learned it's all supposed to be shipping overseas to simcaria simcari silver sables home country and also the site of an increasingly bloody civil war have you heard about this no i'm not really caught up on international news we've been a little busy with our own war here in new york it's a hell of a story i'll fill you in when we have more time yeah it'd be nice to talk about something other than hammerhead for a while what do you think about taking a vacation when all this is over vacation i'm not sure i know what that word means yeah i'm with you but seriously we both need it i'll start doing some planning let me know what happened to that oscar plan we'll do bring it on wait a minute is this a dance-off i love those it's my turn this new armor is cool and all but i kind of miss seeing your desperate attempts at 70s gangster fashion you guys get right to the point don't you so are you guys all friends outside of work or just co-workers you know maybe your whole

jetpack guy just oh hello ambush guys where'd your buddy go no one's talking huh maybe you just can't hear me over the sound of those jet packs cool jet packs guys where do i get one let me guess they fell off the back of the truck right you know instead of stealing everything you guys should try making your own stuff it's much more emotionally rewarding maybe you wouldn't be so angry all the time [Music] oh [Music] ugh hey hey come closer i dare you now is that just a regular dare or a double dog dare [Music] that yours no but it would be so awesome if it was [Music] long time no see who do

stressed can we do some relaxing breaths in out in out tell me where to find hammerhead i wish i knew if we stop punching each other maybe we can work together together never what did i do wrong here wait have you been listening to james's podcast you are supposed to be the protector of the city and yet you have allowed this hammerhead to steal all of my weapons and supplies i didn't allow anything i'm trying to stop him from stealing your stuff then you are failing badly oh that hurts but you're not wrong who knows perhaps you are secretly working with him wow now i'm insulted i do not know you obviously and i do not trust you you will stay out of my way or suffer the consequences stay out of your way while you do what while i find and kill hammerhead in love with that he doesn't die so easily he has not met me [Music] damn you what happened to you i thought you were a good guy i am good at what i do but i am not a guy [Music] austin translation i guess [Music] what happened to you can thank me by not dying [Music] hey mj so guess who's back in town silver's able i know how did you know that it's my job to know things so i imagine she's here to stop hammerhead from stealing all her shipments which is good maybe you guys can team up yeah that doesn't feel very likely at this point well listen i'm gonna keep looking into this simcharia story it's that conversation was going nowhere screwball how did you quick head to eighth and pearlman before me and my fans die of boredom uh what is she up to this time better get there before she hurts someone well if it isn't

[Applause] [Music] not gonna lie feeling pretty good about myself right now well done and you thought you were famous before hey mj sorry we got cut short earlier i had to deal with screwball again you seem to have a lot of women in your life lately and all of them challenging except for you of course you don't think i'm challenging uh no unless you want me to think you're challenging in which case you uh to challenge me in all the right ways well done thank you okay i'll keep looking into hammerhead's plans and i'll call you when i find something challenging in the meantime i'll swing around the city and do some spidey stuff all units report of truck driver in distress financial district could be hammerheads guys better check it out hey peter uh just checking in you busy sort of how are your assignments coming you mean school assignments or spider assignments both but school comes first i'm all caught up on school stuff working on spider assignments now but why are you making me do physics and calculus equations shouldn't i be practicing with web shooters and gadgets and stuff okay quiz time if a pendulum is 40 meters long and attached at a 45 degree angle how far will the pendulum fall at its lowest point 11.72 meters but why does that matter it matters a lot if you're the pendulum what oh wait so you do all these equations in your head like while you're swinging through the city i have to and so will you if you want to get good at it wow i had no idea all right guess i'll get back to it then open up or we'll open it for you leave me alone gotta get to that driver before they do you guys looking to get cool tech for cheap you should just wait for black friday like everyone else careful i heard him call for backup [Music] can you guys tell the next bunch to bring some snacks getting a little hungry [Music] you guys just don't know when to quit which is kind of admirable [Music] [Music] damn dog [Music] these guys sure are serious about stealing sable tech well they're serious about everything to be honest thanks spider-man that was a close one hey mj what's up hammerhead guys are hitting an oscorp shipping facility near seaport got it i'm headed there now question for you we know hammer has stole most of the stable weapons already and a bunch of equipment from police lockup now he's stealing sable tech that's bound for simcaria where is he putting all this stuff no idea if we can find out where we can cut off his supplies i'll try to cross-reference his men's activity with a city map see if i can't nail down a location good plan hey so i've been reading up on the situation in simcaria there's a ruling dictator attacking his own people apparently silver stables been working alone to arm the rebels and fight back but she's losing sounds like she could really use the stuff hammerhead is stealing from her explains why she's so angry and desperate maybe but i also think that he's there get moving hey don't leave i just got here [Music] you guys sure seem like you're in a hurry probably has nothing to do with all those stolen goods in the back am i right i'm sure it's all a big misunderstanding the police will be here soon to help you return what you accidentally stole now stay here while i go help your friends gotta catch up to that other truck [Music] [Applause] oh no you saw me fine you win this round and your prize is a one-way ticket to rikers okay just two more [Music] [Music] she's gonna kill someone what the hell is that a jet just get us out of here you want to find him no kidding sorry folks ridiculously loud chase vehicles coming through [Music] if you guys had stopped earlier we wouldn't be having this conversation right now what are you doing you're just escalating things let me handle the rest of these guys what are they shooting can't wait to hear from jameson after this one hammerhead's got drones now if he's really into modernizing his workforce those drones are going after sable i should help her right right i'm trying to help you right now get off your thing as soon as i take out the rest of these drones hey stable you're all clear now i'll just assume silence means thank you in simkari okay now on to that last try [Music] [Music] easy easy where's hammerhead if i talk you're coming you do what you got to do [Music] look we both want the same thing if we work together we'll find him trust me right we work together like partners yep partners so you'll call me i am 77 sure she's not a robot [Music] that doesn't sound good better check it out hey peter miles you done with your assignments yeah and i can see why it's so important but listen i took a look at those web shooters in your bag are those for me yes but only when you're ready what were you doing in my bag it was open and i could see them sort of and i uh i just noticed that the nozzle size and shape is the same as your other ones yeah so well according to hook's law elastic force is linear with distance given all factors are equal but you and i aren't equal wow you're right just a few pounds can affect tensile strength rate of web fluid consumption and a few other things but i've done all the calculations if we just tighten the nozzle diameter by 0.7 millimeters it all pretty much evens out i think i've officially underestimated you that's a good thing right seems like you're more than ready for field training as soon as i'm done dealing with hammerhead yes can i start practicing with the web shooters in the meantime nope and if i find out you even left the house i'll call it off man you're like the most and least fun superhero ever hammerhead's crew have a sable agent pinned down not exactly a fair fight let's even the odds a bit come on hey you have to teach me how you do all that i wish i could say there was an art to it mostly i just try to go where the bullets aren't well i am in your debt what were these guys after these are humanitarian supplies bound for sim carrier you've heard of the civil unrest i heard it was more of a civil war indeed well these men attacked me and stole most of the supplies but they took them i do not know i'll keep an eye out and let you know if i find any nice to meet you uh david david obademi spider spiderman okay that sounded way less awkward in my head hey mj peter head to soho i have a lead i need you to check out one of my jailhouse sources just told me that some of hammerhead's guys are always at a certain pizza shop and maybe you can trail them find out where hammerhead supplies are you know just once i'd like to have a phone call where we talk to each other about our days like normal people okay so honey how was your day well uh sable and i caught some bad guys oh so you are working together in concept you two have to find a way to work it out hammerhead's too powerful to take on alone my jailhouse source also said that hammerhead's using this project olympus stuff to quote improve himself even further further he was already a walking tank exactly my point if you two don't stop him soon he might become unstoppable ah too many people around i'm not gonna be able to get close looking like this maybe if i ditch the suit i'm just your average new yorker hey i think that's the place that got a three-star review in the bugle last week no wonder it's crowded they're mine are yours mine yeah what's up okay tell them we're on our way hey come on we got to run an errand for tony now we're almost to the front of the line i know i know just come on you need to run an errand for tony those have to be hammerhead's man better follow him but not too close so what do we got to do for tony get his laptop guess he left in his car are you serious why can't he get his own damn laptop boss probably hasn't doing something more important somebody following us be cool pete be cool guess not where is the boss anyway i don't know tony probably does though he's died with the boss freaking tony man i should be the one who's tight with the boss okay sure hey that kid looked familiar to you oh look someone posted a cat video better watch that right now yeah all these kids look the same he's also the one who helped the boss come up with that trap for the stable check yeah like that's ever gonna work i don't know sounds like a good plan to me and if we get her we get the rest of her stuff so so now you're on tony's side i see how it is listen i'm gonna go talk to sal keep people off the lot for a minute yeah yeah yeah freaking tony gotta get closer to hear what they're saying if i can't get next to them maybe i can get above them i need to get out of sight i can't be climbing walls until i'm hidden if i get above those guys i can hear them gotta get to that alleyway no one can see me now i can climb up to the rooftop swear on my mother's grave guy thinks he's next in line next in line to shine my shoes maybe ain't that the truth anyways tony said he needs his laptop guess it's got all kinds of important stuff on it as laptops do we put it up in c3 slot c3 huh if i can get tony's laptop it could lead me to hammerhead thanks oh wait stimulating conversation guys but i've heard enough spiderman [Music] we're losing too many guys okay now where's that laptop well hello there tony's laptop let's see if i can hack into it looks like he's got to find my phone app installed let's see where you are tony [Music] hey pete hi honey how's your day busy nick deep in research on simcaria i'll make it quick then your tip was a good one i'm on my way to one of hammerhead's top men if anybody knows where hammerhead is it's him that's great and one of his guys mentioned setting a trap for sable what do you think that means i think it means a bunch of old-school majia thugs feel threatened by a confident powerful woman uh right sorry pete i don't mean to blow you off but i'm on a deadline so yeah totally talk later no i don't know when she's coming you just gotta be ready there's tony i don't think that's enough guys double it up don't let him spiderman you see that sable chick can you tell that my boss wants to have a sit down yeah i could but she doesn't really listen to me or anyone give me the address wait where the address collects building rooftop no wait it's probably an ambush [Music] sable you're headed into a trap it does not matter as long as hammerhead is there you don't get it i'm trying to keep you from getting hurt i can take care of myself usually you can but hammerhead's been using your project olympus stuff i know then you know he's turned himself into some kind of giant frankenmonster and that is why i must stop him but not like this not by going right into a trap [Music] sable what are you doing [Music] so oh hey look a trap if only we had some kind of advanced warning i can handle this i'm sort of tempted to sit back and watch but that would just be petty they trapped her with their own tech it looks like the whole thing is powered by those generators one down you doing okay in there sable or is it silver or is it something else what are your friends wait you don't have any friends do you i bet you're proud of that for some reason got it hang tight while i work on the other one shut you know if we stay here hammerhead will come to us i'm not so sure that's a good idea don't mind me just keep doing what you're doing ah in thank you [Music] heart can we please get out of here now uh [Music] [Music] is two for one yes [Music] [Music] you're alive did you honestly think i was dead how did you find me same way she did watch out that girl has trust issues how long have you been watching me watching us long enough to know you're making a mistake hammerhead's gotten too powerful do you really think i have a choice hair wait is that everything you need to know about that ugly thing sorry for what i did to you but now we're even one more thing his head not as strong as you think it is bye felicia let's see what's on this thing [Music] [Music] if they're keeping sable in that place i bet they have those stolen humanitarian supplies in those other bases i should call david about this hello hi david it's spider-man i think i may have found those humanitarian supplies found for some career great can you send me the locations well there's just one wrinkle they're in heavily fortified bases guarded by bionic madman with futuristic weapons and impenetrable armor that is quite a wrinkle why don't i scope out their hideouts first and get back to you thank you spiderman i greatly appreciate all your help the entrance to his hideout must be somewhere close by huh must be underground it's time for some urban spelunking that's a new smell yuck hope i find sable before the fumes overwhelm her if i can get through this without getting wet that'd be a win hello this is so cool whoa look at this place the amount of work it takes to make this city run is just crazy i'll never take fresh water for granted again okay let's see where this leads looks like some loose bricks up ahead nice okay onward hammerheads guys they've taken over an abandoned subway platform gotta take these guys out then look around for sable but there's also the problem of space i mean we just run out of room and i just wonder whoops that would make a terrible ninja look out for the web [Music] oh ugh okay that's all of them now i bet if i follow the power cables i'll find where they're holding sable hope that's not a load-bearing subway car nice okay ah tunnel's blocked but i think i can still squeeze through body banks well this just took a turn what happened with this one what do you mean what happened he died inside the thing like the other guys who was it don't remember his name sal's cousin i think what's it messy nah what the [ __ ] i think so gotta do this quick and then find sable this place looks like their main base of operations stable jet packs i'd be good money to see hammerheads guys learning to fly in these things for the first time project olympus these pods i told you i just helped manufacture these things i didn't design them guess we got the wrong guy then on the bright side now we got our first test subject no no don't turn it on please just give me a few minutes i can figure it out now that's what i like to hear wow if hammerhead gets his hands on this thing we're in serious trouble that cop almost killed i thought you said i'd be indestructible i said almost indestructible after all you're still human then make me less human i'm i'm not sure what you mean i mean what i said now get to work [Music] all this stuff belongs to sable yeah most of it's overseas though what are you thinking boss i'm thinking about how she took over the whole city in a matter of days you mean back doing that devil's breath thing yeah that was crazy not so crazy when you got the right equipment well we got those digging things not good enough if we want the best stuff we're gonna need her yeah okay how are we gonna do that just keep taking her stuff she'll come to us xrt89 subterranean troop deployment vehicle that's the real name i'm sticking with big boy stable sounds like she's close the only way out is through high voltage wires and sewer water what could possibly go wrong if there's one take away from this underground lair thing it's that hammerhead should have fewer thugs with guns and a lot more safety inspectors i like it i will never give you you came back for me why because i need you i work alone i used to say the same thing i know what's happening in samkharia i know why this means so much to you think you know but you do not know what can i do to make you trust me look i think i know how we can take down that monster but i can't do it alone damn it he let him loose [Music] okay here's the plan good plan [Music] the hell is that job kind of nice to have you on my side for once shut up you gotta work on your fight banter though watch it they're working together [Music] [Music] stay yeah i learned from watching movies we should compare notes [Music] that was awesome high five you said you could defeat hammerhead you uh know you left me hanging right there are medical records in here yeah mostly about that metal plate in his head carbon steel super strong pretty sensitive to heat i have an idea i uh solemnly swear to uh do whatever you tell me to i will call soon wow but [Music] i guess i'll do some spidey work while i wait for sable's call hey what's that what's with all the yellow stuff huh is this some weird street artist thing a police report looks like someone was killed during a mugging but nothing was stolen hmm what's with the audio recorder so you have some work-related stress well you came to the right place that's my specialty so they tell me give me some more specifics about how you're feeling guess you could say i put a lot of pressure on myself i like to be the best plus i have a very demanding boss that what kind of work do you do everything here stays confidential right of course good because if any of this gets out you're a dead man the case file says one of nine there must be more of these out in the city there's a bunch of gps coordinates here i love treasure hunts but something tells me i'm not gonna find a chest full of gold at any of these places [Music] i think i'm close to another crime scene huh mystery person's calling card this looks familiar i think it's the last known location of a magi informant who disappeared a few months ago [Music] i'm feeling a little uncomfortable i think we should end the session sorry doc i didn't mean this guy i've just been paranoid lately like i said stressful job okay tell me a little bit more about your job describe a typical day typical day i guess it starts with waking up checking my phone see who the boss wants me to hit that day then i go grab breakfast i've been trying to do that keto thing you know then i do the hits sometimes it's messy so i gotta head home and clean up i try to get to the gym in the afternoon and dinner and i sorry um can you go back for a moment what does do a hit mean exactly it means i kill who my boss tells me to i'm pretty good at it by now get quite the resume this guy sounds like a magi enforcer feels like this is just part of the story i should keep an eye out for more scenes like this hey peter just letting you know i haven't left the house glad to hear it what's up i've been listening to the police radio and there's stuff happening all over the city like constantly pretty overwhelming isn't it how do you do it i mean you can't be everywhere at once remember what may used to say you help someone you help everyone yeah but i never really understood what she meant okay you know that lady that came in to feast the other day with her two kids the one who just got evicted yeah after she found a job and was about to move into her new place she told me as soon as i get my first paycheck i'm sending as much as i can back to the shelter so we helped her and now she wants to help others helping is like a force multiplier exactly mae was pretty great wasn't she the greatest i'm gonna send you an address as soon as i'm done with all this so stay ready and bring those web shooters with you finally i am ready meet me at my base i've been meaning to ask how exactly do you have a base in the city that i don't know about right good talk why is she always hanging up on me maybe she didn't hang up on purpose we probably just got disconnected she could be waiting for me to call her back or she could be running out of minutes on her cell phone plan i mean she's probably doing international roaming that stuff is expensive or maybe she just really needed to polish her pistols let's apply occam's razor the simplest and most obvious solution is she hates me logic takes the fun out of everything let's get to work so where's this base you talked about whoa your toys are so much cooler than mine i love this invisible floating fortress thing but now that all of new york city has seen it hammerhead will probably be here soon i am counting on it so let us work quickly i have acquired the class 5 laser array we need to calibrate it to prevent it from overheating lucky for us i'm working on my masters in calibration let's do this okay what's first pull the housing array into place on it whoa nice laser housing locked done and done we are not done oh we must reset the targeting field aerials sure thing i have no idea what you're talking about exit the hangar and navigate to the top of the nearby transmitters all righty so we should talk about the strategy with hammerhead don't you think what is there to talk about refined then focus the laser on the plate the laser will heat the carbon steel to critical temperature which will rearrange its molecular structure and soften it so i can knock him unconscious i get that part but how do you know it won't uh melt his brain when the wolf attacks the sheep he risks getting shot by the shepherd okay well shepherd just remember my no killing rule okay done how's it look systems appear functional now we must test the targeting and power levels cool wait this doesn't involve shooting me does it not yet but i do need you to launch those targets right okay ready ready bombs away oh just a few more cool with me this is fun here comes another one nice shot this is how modern do speech shooting oh oh can we do one more please you are a child yeah well we're all children on the inside whoa come back we have one more thing to do on my way we must adjust the gyroscopic navigation stabilizer in order to compensate for the weight of the laser go to that terminal and wait for me to activate the system system ready i'm going in okay that should do it you two teaming up now cute but it ain't gonna do no good uh stable use a little help here can you fix it okay that's it keep trying i'm indestructible i just want to thank you for showing me what i've been doing wrong for years if i want to rule this city i gotta modernize your [Music] me status now i can get in close this is a fight you wait for the wind can't let him hit me [Music] still no respect [Music] what's it gonna take do you know what i respect a guy who knows when to quit damn i missed keep them coming i'll make sure the next one hits [Music] i told the bombs [Music] but i'm still gonna kill you good tips that's my chance look at me you can't kill me you two got killed i gave you one chance join my crew teamwork [Music] [Music] won't work [Music] the shield's down indestructible huh i think not god [Music] too bad i gotta use it to he's quick i gotta be quicker [Music] hey teamwork [Music] i have an idea i can't wait get ready to jump [Music] [Music] run ah that was fun hey you have dinner plans i know this great pizza place i must return to somkaria right you have a war to fight you not like to fight do what i have to in order to help my people i know that's what heroes do i am no hero but you have taught me a few things oh yeah like what like how to disarm my enemies with bad jokes actually they're good jokes but i understand humor can be subjective thank you spiderman for everything i don't do hugs yeah right of course uh hey can i get a lift back to the city uh i'd swim but it'd take forever to get the river smell out of my suit [Music] ready i think the web shooters are a little tight get used to it just try to keep up [Music] ah [Music] you
