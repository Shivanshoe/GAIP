all existing microchip technologies obsolete they're coming get me out of here alive i'll give you everything down grab some of this shield shutting down his cover these [ __ ] mean business so we're clear now where's the solarium this way the locking mechanism requires two operators [Music] follow me quantum entanglement this single device has more processing power than your entire military infrastructure rumors around the lab were that menendez plans to use it as a basis for a massive cyber attack i heard talk of something called karma it may be the name for the cyber weapon if menendez uses a solarium worm to initiate an attack there will be nothing anyone can do to stop it i couldn't stop it harper get a [ __ ] rep on the support team behind us we got incoming kraken harper requests some confirmation on extraction teams eta defensive positions cracking come in damage no response we'll fight a way out with or without support this ain't over yet your team can stand out it's briggs stand out it's the extraction team boy are you a sight for sore eyes i guess we can call this mission accomplish admiral briggs good to see you you too whenever menendez is planning solarium is the key to it he's just a man admiral he'd like you to think he's something more but he ain't nothing but a sad old pitiful excuse of a man i can't figure out what is without getting inside his [ __ ] head salazar you grew up in nicaragua during his rise to power he his legend's better than anyone tell me why does he hate us so much as a boy he witnessed the country's rape and murder his people 1972 there was a colossal earthquake his family lost everything a year later the only thing he ever loved his sister josefina was crippled in a fire fraule his father started over sold drugs for easy money they became rich powerful legends of managua the menendez cartel was all but untouchable so the cia took our old father in a u.s sanction assassination right so now menendez [ __ ] hated america and started running guns in afghanistan for his own private army cia got wind if it went on the hunt for me kabul [Music] that was the photo wood showed us in the vault remember see that handsome bastard that's me the only one's your father after nam the numbers and all that he was one dangerous son of a [ __ ] it's your time mason what'd you see woods [Music] sand sand in

looking at china next no one likes the russians huh you know me i don't like anyone you might want to get your head down take it easy sal deliver the weapons now what about your end of the deal i will take you to the leader of the mujahideen he can help you find rayon menendez we have fresh horses you will follow oh [ __ ] let's do mason it's it did you make contact with jowl we're on our way to the mujahideen camp now what the hell you gonna do with that you never know i'm sure i don't need to remind you that our presence here must remain 100 deniable there will be serious consequences of russian learns of our involvement in afghanistan yo that ain't gonna happen we must hurry we believe the soviets are about to launch an attack on the camp make it kick it up again [Music] [Music] this way if a russian attack is indeed eminent you're gonna need all the help you can get i've arranged for a couple of specialists to act in an advisory capacity here they are now rahman this is woods and mason my two best men we need weapons not soldiers this should be good just so we're clear we hold off the russian attack you give us what you have on menendez yes our base is here any advance will come through one of the narrow passes leading into the valley i know this our men defend these mountains our weapons will give them an air that's your [ __ ] plan you're talking about the russian army here they come at you with brute force which means strength of numbers and heavy armor are your men ready for that they have no experience with the weaponry we brought and we do we belong on the front line let's rock it we must hurry we cannot allow them to enter the valley settle up nationally this may be tougher than we thought we got hips dropping in from the right front of the camp lead just get to that point and hold back too [ __ ] close push it through the ruins you need more than a rifle nation we cannot let it enter the valley another pto is headed this way oh vehicles btrx history [Music] nice work mason the mutual id can handle make it through here charge set they're throwing everything they have at us we've got threats all over the valley hoosier reporting rushing tanks
