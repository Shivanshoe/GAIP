okay i could take those soldiers out quietly there's a barbarian in the compound she got past the lookouts find her kill her and bring her head to the lieutenant understood i guess diplomacy's off the table [Music] when we return to the great delta can't wait to sail home to see the delta again gotta stay sharp it's not barbarians it's machines someone there over there hey i didn't see anything protect the sights ugh hang in there [Music] i really wish these people would have talked to me instead of trying to kill me oh now i need to find a way out of this courtyard [Music] that door looks promising [Music] [Music] i submit do as you will i didn't want to fight your friends out there they attacked me if by death alone i can atone our trespass i'm not gonna kill you okay i just wanna figure out what's going on where did you get that focus uh i moved the chosen people the queen the ancestors left the power of the focus to us alone the eye that reveals the legacy the legacy huh the legacy uh the truth no it is in the darkness and the lost places among the ancient ashes and the bones of the before that it lies waiting you know as a diviner it is my task to seek it out for the good of my people you're looking for data maybe we can help each other what's your name alva second diviner of the eastern expedition i'm aloy why don't we start again i've never heard of the queen our lands lie across the great ocean we haven't been here before so why come now our homeland has been ravaged by freakish weather terrible storms and blistering droughts the crops are failing the people are starving when we looked for answers it was proposed that if we had the courage to cross the ocean to legacy's landfall then we might earn the knowledge we need to save our people but so far that knowledge has eluded us so your people call this place legacies landfall no uh landfall is where we arrived to the west in the shadows of the sunken city by the broken bridge you mean san francisco yes you're well versed in the legacy it was a place of great importance to our ancestors we had hoped to learn their secrets there but so far that door remains closed even so the data we discovered there has led us to this place it might be our last chance to find something that can save your crops and your people yes if the ancestors will be generous to us once more so you said your ancestors left your tribe that focus yes thirteen diviners have possessed this one since it was discovered among the ruins in our homeland i have their honored names committed to memory so you have won but none of the soldiers out there did we each have a role to play no it is the diviners purpose to seek out the legacy interpret the wisdom of our ancestors for the good of all and to keep it safe so that no one but the diviners know how to use a focus not even the imperial family and certainly not soldiers so how many diviners are there at landfall a small group back at home a few dozen more that's a guess only the overseers know for sure and i am not of their rank so you call data from the ancient past the legacy yes all that is not lost or forbidden what does that mean all that we are capable of reading and that which is permitted okay i'm not sure i get it that's fine um so what do you use the data for the greatest secrets are the ones that improve the lives of many how to tend our crops how to hold flood waters back or even cross the ocean technology that is what i seek here technology that can help my people back home [Music] those soldiers they opened fire on me without warning why uh it is the duty of the queen to seek out the legacy and defend it from the ignorant and envious not that you seem ignorant but back home other tribes only mean us harm and we were told the same was true here does that come from your legacy the legacy is truth but we have been known to misinterpret it i hope time and the wisdom of our ancestors will guide us down the correct path yeah i hope so too i'm looking for a place in this facility called test station ivy have you found any data that mentions it no but i did find something that looks like a map but it was unreadable lost maybe i can make some sense of it uh bear there's a lot of files here i've been through all of them look in the gh facility section like i said a lost file you can't see the map okay it looks like your focus is an early model the operating system won't be able to read any files created after the mid-2050s but i could share them with you share them you can see what is lost and forbidden not lost not forbidden just a newer format there that's where i need to go but you can't get there we've been here for a week trying to get deeper into the complex the way he's been blocked by rubble what about this tunnel it looks like it unlocks from here no i thought these might be some kind of access controls but i couldn't read enough data to make them work let's try with my focus okay i believe these consoles were meant to be operated in unison but i'm not sure okay here we go following your lead the ancestors have shown us the way come on let's go you want me to come with you it took both of us to open up that tunnel didn't it this place is a maze according to the map there should be another exit further in just stay close lead the way i can't believe you actually brought us in i was driving having to stay they slaughtered the barbarians that approached the site it was like they enjoyed it most of my people aren't like that i promise oh fire gleam better stand back well that was loud [Music] there has to be a way out of here what's that thing in the wall there has to be a way out through here a dead end maybe we should try another path we haven't tried that smaller tunnel over there but according to the map the exit should be this way i'll be glad to get back above ground yeah it feels like a turn down here that can't be good they fly to him from the complex several times a day only the ancestors know why well the ancestors are dead elva of course how else could they be ancestors looks like we have more pressing concerns follow my lead send this to my stash we can fight them or try to sneak past your call uh us we have to fight are you injured oh [Music] [Music] i've never seen anyone fight machines like you do i've uh had a lot of practice now we can find a way back into the facility i'll find this in my stash later uh event i think i can pull it open i'm right behind you maybe we can get through that hatch on the ground it looks like the one we used at the first station there's consoles up here too but no way to get to them you stay put i'll see what i can find locked i think i can move these things i don't think i can jump up there i'll have to find another way those rails on the floor lead into the walls um hey would would you mind warning me next time you decide to um uh blow up a wall i'll uh try [Music] is there some there we go huh there's some space back there aha this should help supplies this one won't budge maybe one of the owners yeah if you can hop on top of it i can get you to those consoles exactly hold it there let me just [Music] i jumped on top [Music] hold on that's good jumping over made it i'm at the console wait there's data here a lot but it's blocked something's restricting access if i can't get past it my mission here is doomed i'll i'll help if i can okay but first we have to get out of here right we need to open the hatch okay let's see okay i'm unlocking a storage unit there should be a power cell inside then you need to find a way into the generator room okay i'm on it [Music] okay that brought power back to the doors you can reach me now on my way okay we need to operate both consoles simultaneously to open the hatch i'll get to the other console you stay here [Music] ready when you are okay you ready on two one two vulnerability test scenario okay that's where we need to go [Music] [Music] no no how do i shut this thing off [Music] what is this [Music] that's how the world ended [Music] test complete adamantine restructure integrity uncompromised [Music] what did we just see alva let's meet below [Music] i'm gonna share a file with you okay test log uh i think it's tuesday the second who cares i'll say this for the end of the world it's jam packed with irony we developed biomass conversion here infinite food for infinite machines and now we're racing against time to find something to give them indigestion machines won't be able to eat the wreath but can we deploy them in time god i hope so i don't understand your ancestors they were wiped out your legacy didn't tell you that the time of ashes but most of the data about that is lost or forbidden well they created machines that consumed all life you just saw how it's a miracle anything survived i don't want to know this this is not why i'm here i need the wisdom of my ancestors to help save my people not forbidden knowledge of their sins i need to find something that helps something to bring back the overseers will punish me or even worse people will die do you understand my family my sister i left her when she was 14 already you could see her bones they will starve [Music] alva alva i get it i do it's hard to explain but you and i are working toward the same goal and if i succeed your people won't need any data things will just they will get better but even if i believe you my people won't i need to bring something back okay then we'll go to test station ivy and if i can find a way to kill those vines then i will have access to the data core what i need is in there i'm pretty sure that if i take it it will unblock access to all the data that this place has and that will give you something to bring home i'm not sure i understand [Music] but every secret makes its own maze a diviner must persevere go on i'll follow another maze the road to truth is never a straight line referred to as they were supposed to stop the destruction that caused the time of ashes i never asked are you from around here no i spent most of my life in a place for the east we've both traveled a long way then this is it okay let's find a way to get into the proving grounds that complex should be testation ivy let's hope it holds the answers we seek [Applause] we're gonna have to take it out to get into the test station you with me yes oh [Music] ah [Music] ah oh that was amazing terrifying but amazing well you helped it's carrying one of the metal flowers is that how they've been distributed we shouldn't linger here there might be more machines [Music] uh there has to be some data here on the adamantine wreath we can use i trust your focus we'll see what mine cannot oh that's interesting find something the fourth test station willow it looks like it's underwater huh that might be worth a look sometime i must have faith i walk with the ancestors we shall find what we seek this console's still operational another log oh we're done in every way the wreaths work and kaval came through on a way to destroy them downloading a coded key into the deployment shell triggers an enzyme that causes the reeds to eat themselves from within but [Music] it's too late the latest projections from us robot command have sworn reproduction outpacing our ability to drop the shells by 375 not even close i guess we deserve this i deserve it for what i made here this will be my last log before evacuation so all their efforts were in vain they ran out of time at least we have the software module they created it should get rid of the vines produced by the metal flowers i need a workbench to load the module into my spear there's one back at our camp the map showed a package [Music] in here we'll have to climb up right behind you we can use the line to get down uh right easy [Music] made it but we better make haste after we encountered barbarians our lieutenant called for reinforcements they could be here anytime right [Music] now what now we get to that data core um let's hope this new module works i was blooming let's see if the software works they're falling apart door's clear now the data coordinates time to elizabeth alpha prime master override activated restoring to meter subordinate function to original code what did you do i've never seen my focus glitch like that uh i found a special type of data it's something you can't read but they kept a tight grip on the data core but now you should have access to the central server all of it should give you something to bring home you were right hundreds of archives almost all of it relating to agriculture it would take us years to get through all this but we don't have that kind of time what you said before alva hold your fire by the word of the ancestors you must stop come look at who you fired on that barbarian killed our soldiers uh only those who fired blindly she is no barbarian she gave me the data we need come look at her [Music] can't you see elizabeth sobak stands before you an ancestor reborn diviner we should bring the ancestor back it is we who follow their word commander not the other way around uh my apologies dr sobek our people's faith is strong but there are those who are not as familiar with the legacy as they should be you heard the diviner the data has been found you two with me the rest of you meet us back at the beach for return to landfall [Music] i can't talk long they will have many questions so do i your people know a lot about the past and about sobek i guess but there please i must know what you said before about working towards the same goal how long will it take i don't know a few months then you are my family's best hope let nothing get in your way you have opened my eyes to many things and for that i thank you but now you must go will i see you again soon we return to legacy's landfall it might be dangerous for you to go there tell me how to reach it just in case we made landfall on the northeast edge of the sunken city the currents around the archipelago are vicious and the only approach is from the south and it is guarded only attempt to go there if you must diviner what's the delay please go if you attempt to stay here any longer they may want to take you with us and that won't go well for anyone i better do as all of a says i need to get demeter back to gaia anyway but i might want to explore the area before i make the trek back to base and now i can use the vine powder on those other metal flowers i found earlier [Music] hey [Music] uh well they didn't have two left feet like i do i could teach you don't tempt me either forage find an inn and leave me alone hey is that what i think it is just need to merge it with gaia and she'll have enough power to handle hephaestus good news so what can i do for you i hope zoe's not upset i'm distracting you from your training yeah i don't think you have to worry about that what do you mean what happened before zoe found a way to fix the land gods i suggested that when gaia was fully restored she could just make new ones well once we get a festus that's definitely a possibility that's what i said but i guess there was something about my tone she didn't like she got pretty raw said i didn't understand the way her tribe feels about those machines which is true of course and the last thing i'd ever want to do is dismiss their traditions but i was trying to look at things differently more like you you know to see a machine as just a machine yeah i guess i led you into trouble there didn't i not your fault don't worry did you talk to zoe after your fight i suffered through a few hours of glaring silence then she seemed to move on sort of how do people do this how do i know if the next thing i say won't blow up in my face what if an apology is not enough next time you give her a stuffed animal you're the worst you know that what makes you think i know anything about any of this you're on your own abandoning me again huh well if she kills me next time it's on you better get this to gaia you did it let's hold off on the ale till it's over and done with i'll let aaron know eloy you've returned and you come bearing gifts does this mean we'll soon be able to uproot the zeniths from our lands that's what i'm hoping good it looked like you were working on something over there with gaia now growing in strength i've been trying to find a way to heal the land gods even if some people think i should give up on them already said i was sorry your friend thought it'd be a good idea to replace the land gods with new machines when gaia recovers it wasn't the land gods have taken care of our people for generations they are not some broken toy to be thrown away even if they are just machines doing their job to abandon them in their time of suffering seems cruel i'm sure varell understands that too he does now i had to get pretty mad at him at first though you know i can hear you guys right [Music] var looks pretty focused he's been obsessing over the data revealed to us by poseidon just the other day we read about mountains hiding deep underwater that spew fire if i understand correctly gaia said the flames they release come from the very center of the earth like a heart beating with the life of the world as always the cycle can be found in even the most unlikely of places of course var is mostly interested in watching explosions happen underwater you ever play that board game erin setup strike i'm the one who gave it to him i was hoping it'd distract him enough to spare us that ruckus he calls death metal no such luck i should get going if you need me you know where to find me aloy there are more supplies in the chest help yourself need to talk about something else yes actually looks like things between you and zoe are better now i suffered through a few hours of glaring silence then she seemed to move on sort of how do people do this how do i know if the next thing i say won't blow up in my face what if an apology is not give her a stuffed animal you're the worst you know that what makes you think i know anything about abandoning me i should go hand this over to gaia by all looks like you got what you wanted yeah it's almost time to go after a festus finally we get to rock and roll you know at least that's that's how the old one said it i think [Music] i bet you're used to that focus by now i can hit machines in their weak points i guess that's something i wish all the other data was as easy to deal with to be honest it's hard to understand half of what's on there and then the other half reminds me this isn't a fight you can win by just waving a hammer which is kind of what i do but hey that just means i gotta study harder make myself useful just give it time what else have you been studying with your focus yeah i've been looking into this uh vegas place you found gaia showed us everything that happened when you went to get that poseidon thing i mean this moreland guy seems pretty smart though risking the tanakh clan lands for a light show is a bold move maybe i should check up on them at some point just in case right anything happen i should know about uh zoe asked us to help her bring more plants in here not for eating apparently if you ask me place as fine as it is metal might be plain but it's sturdy nothing wrong with that who needs a bunch of vegetation i should get going i say hi to gaia for me did you know there used to be a rain forest so big the old ones called it the lungs of the planet that sounds lovely yeah they burned it to the ground at some point oh but they helped bring part of it back in sobek's time that's good to hear i wonder if it grew back after zero dawn wherever it is i'd like to think so the world is in peril and we fight amongst ourselves you busy one must never be idle when at war but there is always time to speak to once commander oh that's that's not really how i see myself it is how we see you anything interesting happen while i was away i found an acceptable place to practice with my blade oh and where's that outside above the base there's a nest of sun winds that are always up for a fight ever thought of sparring with something that's not trying to kill you that would defeat the purpose of the training anything else you've been looking at with that focus gaia showed me the knowledge you recovered out in the desert i am no chaplain but i'd be curious to test if something i read is true what is it the old ones believed one could hear the great waters even in the middle of the desert if you carried the carcass of a water animal with you they called them seashells that sounds kind of gross what have you been up to varl has asked to learn the differences between my people's clans so i've been teaching him to knock history it is heavy with blood and death but also with honorable deeds and vanquished tyrants maybe you'd like to hear about it as well when our mission is done i'd be honored i'll let you get back to your training and so will it it is good to see you again eloy i see you have recovered to meet her eloy with the acquisition of ether poseidon and demeter my heuristic processing density has expanded greatly i should now be able to absorb hephaestus and fortunately we have made progress on a plan to capture it with varl's encouragement beta analyzed all available information on hephaestus its expansion has been rampant it is too large to be beam cast and the kernel you've been using could never hold it therefore it must be contained in a location with a direct physical connection to me a place with two data cores two cores where would we find a place like that gemini an abandoned cauldron in the desert west of here seismic activity disrupted the original construction two data cores were built as a result i've been there the tanakh marked the entrance as some kind of ritual ground i'll have to bring you there by hand i have devised a blueprint for a suitable albeit unwieldy transport ring it will require two people to carry it to gemini i can help once i am installed on the first core i will call down hephaestus on the other trapping it i will then initiate the merge however in order to construct the rake i will need considerable help can you build it i suppose i could but it's not gonna work the zenith will find you minerva won't be able to conceal your location that is correct absorbing hephaestus will create a significant power surge easily detected by anyone capable of noticing but what if there were multiple power surges to fake out the zeniths if aaron zoe and catalo spread out to the other cauldrons and create their own surges would those conceal the one at gemini analyzing such a tactic might be effective with beta's help we should be able to build a set of handheld pulse generators i told you it's not gonna work i did a test hephaestus has written alpha clearance out of its access module you'll never be able to capture it then we need a higher level of clearance there is no higher ted pharaoh's mega clearance the one he used to purge the apollo database and kill the alphas but to get it you would have to find thieves the private bunker he retreated to when the world ended and nobody knows where that is not even the zenith their only intel was that it was somewhere in san francisco that might be all i need alva the queen diviner i met said her people had set up a base at landfall they were searching for data in san francisco from there she might be able to help so i guess i'm headed all the way west while i'm gone will you be able to build the rig and the pulse generators i'll try i'll make sure she has what she needs [Music] alva said the quinn have a ferry on the coast that they use to get to the ruins of san francisco that's where i need to go [Music] you
