shepard what can i do for you what's your story rex there's no story go ask the quarian if you want stories you krogan lived for centuries don't tell me you haven't had a few interesting adventures well there was this one time the turians almost wiped out our entire race that was fun i heard about that you know they almost did the same to us it's not the same it seems pretty much the same to me so your people were infected with a genetic mutation an infection that makes only a few and a thousand children survive birth and i suppose it's destroying your entire species i suppose it isn't all the same i don't expect you to understand but don't compare humanity's fate with the krogan i was just making conversation i wasn't trying to upset you your ignorance doesn't upset me shepard as for the krogan i gave up on them long ago the genophage infected us but it's not what's killing us are your people really dying we're sure not getting any stronger we're too spread out none of us are interested in staying in our own system lots of species have left their homes and prospered but they go to colonize new worlds we're not settlers we're warriors we want to fight so we leave hire ourselves out and most of us never go back what can you tell me about the genophage ask the salarians if you want details they made it all i know it makes breeding nearly impossible thousands die in stillbirth and most never get that far every krogan is infected everyone and no one's rushing to find a cure why don't the krogan try to find a cure when was the last time you saw a krogan scientist you ask a krogan would you rather find a cure for the genophage or fight for credits they'll choose fighting every time it's just who we are shepard i can't change that nobody can so long rex shepherd commander you have a minute to talk i keep an open door policy if you have any concerns lay them on me all right i know things are different aboard the normandy but uh i'm i'm concerned about the aliens vacarion and rex with all due respect commander should they have full access to the ship they may not serve the alliance chief but their allies at least as far as sarin goes this is the most advanced ship in the alliance navy i don't think we should give them free reign to poke around the vital systems engines sensors weapons you don't trust the alliance's allies i'm not sure i'd call the council racist allies we humanity i mean have to learn to rely on ourselves standing up for ourselves doesn't mean standing alone i don't think we should turn down allies i just think we shouldn't bet everything on them staying allies as noble as the council members seem now if their backs are against the wall they'll abandon us you've got a pessimistic view of the universe williams a pessimist is what an optimist calls a realist look if you're fighting a bear and the only way for you to survive is to sick your dog on it and run you'll do it as much as you love your dog it isn't human it's not racism not really members of their species will always be more important to them than humans are these seem like deeply held beliefs williams what made you think this way my family's defended the alliance since it was founded my father grandfather great-grandmother they all picked up a rifle and swore the oath of service i guess we just tend to think of earth's interests as our own all right i can see where your concerns are coming from williams but this is a multilateral mission you're going to have to work with aliens like it or not it won't be a problem commander you say jump i say how high you tell me to kiss a taurean i'll ask which cheek would you kiss anyone i ordered you to that depends sir if you ordered me to kiss a superior officer that would be a violation of the regs concerning fraternization that would make it an illegal order i'd be required to decline and relieve you of command sir what's your opinion on the last mission you mean the wreck night right they were dangerous commander they proved that 2000 years ago i think it was a mistake to let them go but that wasn't my call to make it was yours you know you really should talk to sony about her mom she has to be hurting just saying commander we'll talk later williams looking forward to it sir commander nice work out there i knew working with a spectre would be better than life at csac have you worked with a specter before well no but i know what they're like spectres make their own rules you're free to handle things your way and c-sec you're buried by rules the damn bureaucrats are always on your back for the most part the rules are there for a reason maybe but sometimes it feels like the rules are only there to stop me from doing my work if i'm trying to take down a suspect it shouldn't matter how i do it as long as i do it but c-sec wants it done their way protocol and procedure come first that's why i left so you just quit because you didn't like the way they do things there's more to it than that it didn't start out bad but as i rose in ranks i got saddled with more and more red tape c-sec's handling of sarin was typical i just couldn't take it anymore i hate leaving i hope you made the right choice i'd hate for you to regret it later well that's sort of why i teamed up with you it's a chance for me to get off the citadel see how things are done outside seasick either way i plan to make the most of this and without c-sec headquarters looking over my shoulder well maybe i can get the job done my way for a change if getting the job done means endangering innocent people then no we get the job done right not fast got it i wasn't trying to i understand commander hey commander looking for some extra supplies before you head out what have you got whatever you want armor weapons mods it's not standard alliance issue but that's not necessarily a bad thing well as long as you don't mind paying for it why should i pay you for my weapons and armor my stuff doesn't come from the alliance i have to purchase it myself and it's not cheap hell the licenses alone have set me back more than i'd like but no licenses no goods without the goods i'm out of a job what are licenses why do you need them manufacturers sell licenses each license allows me to buy and sell a certain brand of products i already have several basic ones but you'll need to buy more if you want me to bring in different brands many of the best licenses are hard to get but they're well worth the cost if you can find them what do the different manufacturers offer there are too many for me to keep track of but each license will explain what it's good for let's see what you've got you bet commander hey commander you know that quarian tally she's been spending all her time down here asking me about our engines i'll tell her to leave you alone what no she's amazing i wish my guys were half as smart as she is give her a month on board and she'll know more about our engines than i do she's got a real knack for technology that one i can see why you wanted her to come along i figured she'd be a real asset to the team you've got an eye for talent commander but i'm guessing that's not why you came down here fill me in on the ies stealth systems how does it work exactly you can't hide a ship out in space they emit too much heat and radiation too easy for sensors to pick them up unless you find a way to capture those emissions so our stealth systems trap the energy we give off in storage sinks built into the ship itself no emissions to give away our location eventually the sinks have to be invented more than a few hours silent running and they overheat cook us inside our own hull there's no way for anyone to detect us a visual scan can still pick us up anyone looking out a window can see us playing as day but you have to be pretty close to get an actual visual out in space most vessels rely on scanners as long as the stealth systems are engaged they can't see us not unless we accelerate to ftl speeds why doesn't it work with faster than light travel cranking up the ftl blue shifts our emissions pushes them into frequencies too high to capture in the sinks as soon as we make the jump it's like setting off a flare sensors can pick up our location whenever we enter our exit ftl flight but for short-range missions our stealth systems are amazing and we've got the only one where else have you served adams you name a class of alliance ship i probably served on it everything from dreadnoughts and carriers right down to frigates like the normandy my last assignment was on the tokyo only a cruiser but she was a good ship couldn't hold a candle to the normandy i want to know more about the normandy she's the best ship i've ever served on probably the fastest vessel ever designed she's the only one using the new tantalus drive core what's so special about the tandalis drive core proportionally it's about twice the size of any other vessel not only are we faster we can run at fdl speeds longer before we have to discharge the core carry on adams your ship's amazing shepard i've never seen a drive cord like this before i can't believe you were able to fit it into a ship this small i'm starting to understand why you humans have been so successful i had no idea lions vessels were so advanced the normandy's a prototype cutting edge technology a month ago i was patching a makeshift fuel line into a converted tank ship in the flotilla now i'm sitting on board one of the most advanced vessels in citadel space i have to thank you again for bringing me along traveling on the vessel like this is a dream come true for me i had no idea you found ship technology so interesting it comes with being aquarian the migrant fleet is the key to the survival of my people ships are our most valuable resource but we don't have anything like this we make do with cast offs and second-hand equipment we just try to keep them running for as long as we can some of the fleet's larger vessels date all the way back to our original flight from the gap i can't believe your fleet's still using ships that are three centuries old they're constantly being repaired modified and refitted they are pretty but they work mostly we've tried to make ourselves as independent as possible on the flotilla grow our own food mine and process our own fuel but some things we just can't make on our own a patch to maintain the hull integrity requires raw materials we just don't have that's why our pilgrimages are so important tell me about your people our lives aren't easy resources are scarce and we are constantly on the move everything we do must in some way contribute to the continuation of the migrant fleet there are 17 million quarians in the flotilla and each of us relies on the others for survival the bombs among my people are strong unfortunately we have had to surrender many of the freedoms and civil liberties other species take for granted what kind of freedoms well it's illegal for parents to have more than one child if our population grows too much it would strain our resources to their breaking point of course we also can't allow our numbers to become too few if our population is in decline the rule against single births is temporarily repealed in extreme cases of population decline incentives are even offered to encourage multiple births though the conclave hasn't had to take such measures in nearly a century that's your government the conclave is our civilian branch of government each ship can elect a representative to serve on the conclave and make decisions that affect the fleet as a whole on matters that affect an individual ship however the captain has the final say it's a tradition that dates back to the early days when the fleet was governed by martial law fortunately most captains nowadays are smart enough to have an elected council from their crew to give them advice and guidance so the ultimate power rests with elected officials in practice the conclave and the respective council for each ship tend to set the rules that govern our daily lives but in theory we are still under military jurisdiction the five top ranking military officials in the fleet serve on the admiralty board these five have the power to overrule any decision by the conclave in case of emergency to do so requires unanimous agreement among the admiralty and they can only do this once after that the entire board must resign their posts it's a safeguard that served us well in nearly three centuries the admiralty board has only overruled the conclave four times i want to know more about the get i doubt i can tell you anything you don't already know it's been almost three centuries since they drove my people into exile all i know is the story of their origins what they were when we created them and how they turned on us interesting the geth were originally created to serve as an automated manual labor force initially their intelligence was as limited as any vi over time we made small modifications to their programming to allow them to perform more varied and complex tasks bringing them closer and closer to true ai status how come the council didn't step in and stop you this wasn't true ai research we may have been skirting the bounds of the law but we never did anything that was actually illegal the changes were so insignificant so gradual that we were able to control them or so we thought but one thing we underestimated was the power of the neural network a million guest thinking simultaneously created an inherently unstable matrix so the gas share brain power many of the guest's logic systems were designed to work in concert with other nearby guests basically the more of them you have in the group the smarter they are so there's some sort of group consciousness no nothing like that they cannot share sensory data or information their programming cannot handle that much simultaneous input each geth maintains an individual awareness and identity the neural network only operates on a process based level it's basically the synthetic equivalent of a subconscious but when they're in close proximity they can coordinate low-level functional processes freeing up more capacity for original or independent thought that doesn't make any sense i'm probably over simplifying the geth are incredibly advanced and complex creations all you need to know is that they get smarter when they gather in large numbers as we built more and more geth their effective intelligence became more sophisticated more abstract one day a guest began to ask its quarry and overseer questions about the nature of its existence am i alive why am i here what is my purpose as you can imagine this caused a near panic among my people i don't see what's so bad about those questions the guests were created to engage in mundane repetitive or dangerous manual labor that's fine for machines but it won't satisfy a sentient being for long the geth were showing signs of rudimentary self-awareness and independent thought if the guests were intelligent then we were essentially using them as slaves it was inevitable the newly sentient death would rebel against their situation we knew they would rise up against us so we acted first a general order went out across all quarry and controlled systems to permanently deactivate all geth the geth responded to this order violently you can't blame them for fighting for their survival we had no other choice the death were already on the verge of revolution by acting quickly we had a chance to end the war before it began the hope was that most of the geth would still be little more than machines incapable of organized resistance but they had progressed much further than anyone anticipated the war was long and bloody millions upon millions of quarians died at their hands in the end we were forced to flee our own home world we feared the geth would pursue us but they never came beyond the veil now we drift through space exile searching for a way to reclaim what was once ours it's hard to feel sorry for you your ancestors tried to wipe out another species we made a mistake when we created the get in the first place but we did not make a mistake when we went to war against them if we did if they would have wiped us out they're a synthetic life form they have no use for organics none why do you think they cut themselves off from the rest of the galaxy why do you think they've killed every organic being who's ever tried to contact them they didn't kill saren what does that tell you the geth are not innocent victims in all this they're the enemy they want to destroy us not just aquarians all organic life that's why they've joined up with saren and that's why we have to stop him i want to know more about the pilgrimage when my people reach maturity we leave our birth chips and seek acceptance with a new crew it's necessary to maintain genetic diversity among the fleet but no ship wants to accept someone who will be a burden on them so to prove our worth we embark on a pilgrimage we set out alone leaving the flotilla and our families behind us we only return once we have found something of value we can bring back to the fleet this is presented as a gift to the captain of the respective ship we wish to join if the gift is accepted we are welcomed into the crew can a captain choose to reject the gift that doesn't happen often most captains are eager to increase the size of their crew it increases their own standing in our society even when the gift is not particularly valuable the captain usually accepts it out of a sense of tradition however there is a stigma to presenting a sub-standard gift it's not the best way to make a good impression on a new community most pilgrims don't return until they find something worth i can't believe they just send you off alone it's not like they just cast us out before we leave we are given lessons in how to survive outside the flotilla and given gifts to help us on our journey we also receive implants to fight off sickness and disease generations of living in an isolated and highly controlled environment have left our immune systems weaker than most by the time we leave the fleet we are well equipped for the pilgrimage this is a rite of passage for all quarians if it were dangerous our numbers would suffer virtually every pilgrimage ends with a triumphant return and the ritual presentation of the gift to one of the fleet's captains i want to talk about something else like what i should go see you later good timing commander we got a transmission coming in from the citadel top priority clearance is it the ambassador it's not his signature i think it's from the council i'll patch it through to the calm room commander shepard we've received information that may be critical to your mission against sarin [Music] i'll take all the help i can get we've received an urgent message from one of our infiltration regiments in the traverse you mean spies spectres tend to attract attention commander but they are only one arm of the council special task groups are often a better option for monitoring developing situations we currently have several infiltration units scattered throughout the border regions of citadel space this particular unit was gathering intel on sarin what did they find unfortunately the message we received was little more than static the infiltration team must be in a situation where they can't set up proper interstellar communications but the message was sent on a channel reserved for mission critical communications whatever they were trying to tell us we know it was important considering your interest in sarin we thought you might want to investigate this find out what happened to our team the signal originated from the planet vermeyer i'll look into it the council prefers not to become involved in the specifics of spectre activities we only want you to be aware of all your options including vermeier good luck commander shepard we will keep you advised if we learn anything else [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] commander urgent message from alliance command coming in i'll patch it through shepard this is admiral hackett from alliance command we've got a situation here and you're the only one that can handle it what do you need admiral there's an alliance training ground where we test weapons and technology and live fire simulations one of the vis we use to simulate enemy tactics in the drills is no longer responding to our override commands it's gone rogue are you telling me this computer is thinking on its own we're not stupid shepard this is a virtual intelligence not a true ai it's not self-aware and it can't access any external systems we didn't do anything illegal here virtual intelligence support is critical to our military success vis process thousands of status reports and react in nanoseconds no human can do that we need you to fight your way through the training ground of the vi corps and manually disable it slowly our fail safes aren't responding the vi operates on a closed network it can affect any external systems but we don't have any direct access to its processes we could vomit from orbit but the damage to the facility would be catastrophic we'd prefer to have someone shut down the core someone like you i know spectres answered the council but you're still human you're still part of the alliance military and right now we need you the vi controls all the facilities weapons drones and automated defenses you're the only one that can pull this off shepard good luck [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] sorry so so [Music] [Music] no [Music] good foreign so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign hmm so foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] anything you need commander just trying equalizing interior pressure with exterior atmosphere logged the commanding officer is ashore exo presley has the deck rear admiral mahalovic 5th fleet shepard ssv normandy you don't know who i am do you commander i command the 63rd scout flotilla you and the normandy were slated for my unit after shakedown then the council got their paws claws tentacles whatever they got them on our ship and you i still serve the alliance sir as a specter i can advance our interests to the council you still know what color your blood is shepherd i don't begrudge the politician's decision to throw you to the council it's an opportunity i do begrudge this over-designed piece of tin though the normandy is a fine chip sir she served us well so far it's a gimmick commander useless in a stand-up fight this experiment diverted billions from our appropriations bills for the same price we could have had a heavy cruiser but no we had to make nice to the turians throw money that co-developed boondoggle i'm here to make an inspection commander normandy is an alliance warship i intend to see she's up to snuff we'd be honored to show her to you admiral i'll just bet wait here i won't be long commander i'm not happy what did you find out of order who designed that cic putting the commander aft of everyone else is inefficient what if he needs to discuss with the operators toward the bow modified turian style they prefer commanders looking over their subordinates rather than in the middle of them we wanted to see how effectively they can command with that setup hmm reasonable goal but they should have studied that in a lab rather than on a frontline warship i had to shake my head at that drive core of yours 120 billion credits of element zero to make this thing able to move without giving itself away you realize we could make drive cores for 12 000 fighters with that money what good is it to hide for a few hours anyway useless we can loiter in an enemy system and monitor traffic or drop in filtration teams on enemy worlds normandy can be more effective than the solarian stg maybe maybe but that's not the job of a proper warship we're supposed to find and kill the enemy fleet not count how many times that garrison goes to the bathroom and we need to talk about your crew commander krogan asari turians what are you thinking commander you can't allow alien nationals free access to alliance equipment between saren and the geth we have enough enemies out here treating other species with suspicion and distrust won't win hearts and minds that assumes the hearts and minds are worth winning that hasn't been proven yet you have anything else to say commander any other justifications for the state of this vessel i think the normandy is a good ship sir even if you disagree you have to see that her joint construction and multi-racial crew make the alliance look better your job is to look good commander the alliance navies is to win wars i'm not convinced normandy isn't a waste of taxpayer money but i am convinced that you believe otherwise and that you'll use it to its best ability i'll be submitting a report to the joint military council it will not be as negative as i planned good hunting commander shepard make us proud so how about it garrus is this better than c-sec fighting a rogue specter with countless lives at stake and no regulations to get in the way i'd say that beat c-sec there may just be hope for you yet [Music] turian commander shepard kalisa bensin in algelani westerland news would you answer a few questions for our viewers what do you want to know you've been given a unique position to represent our race people want to get a sense of how you'll do that humans have been trying to get the respect of the galactic community for 26 years with that in mind what are your feelings on being the first human specter the specters represent the best of every species in the galaxy to be asked to join them is an honor some have said your appointment is the citadel throwing humans a bone have you encountered any situations where the citadel asked you to place its needs before the needs of earth the council is concerned with the needs of the whole galactic community we're part of that community now our needs are on their agenda but we're one of many you really do believe that don't you you've been given command of an advanced human warship for your missions is there anything you'd like to say about it actually the normandy was co-developed by human and turian engineers its design incorporates many innovations all of which are classified i'm afraid so the turians have knowledge of the normandy that is being kept secret from the alliance public do you think it was appropriate to hand earth's most advanced warship over to the citadel i wasn't aware it had been handed over to anyone i'm in command and last i checked i'm human same goes for my crew human yes but you do work for the citadel now commander speaking of your new job did the council order you to sabotage human research concern on novaria i'm afraid i can't discuss the details of my missions so you were there on a mission from the council that's very interesting given your recent experiences do you think humanity will ever get the respect it deserves from the galactic community respect's a funny thing people always assume they deserve it the truth is respect is earned and i firmly believe we can earn it you're an idealist commander but a sincere one i hope you're right one last question commander rumors back home say you're tracking a rogue spectre named saren do you have any comment on that i'm afraid i can't comment on whatever my current assignment may or may not be don't worry we'll find out the eyes of earth are on you don't let us down thank you for your time commander shepard i'm surprised that you're willing to kill your own rex aren't the krogan just a few generations away from extinction you don't get it for all your talk of honor and pride the turians never had to test their principles in a real struggle anyone who fights us is either stupid or on saren's payroll killing the latter is business killing the former is a favor to the universe i never properly thanked you for saving me from fists thugs commander i don't know what would have happened if you hadn't been there i'm just glad you weren't hurt me too now was there anything you needed you're a doctor how did you end up here on the citadel my parents brought me here when i was young my father was a medic with the alliance i chose to keep the medical tradition alive but not the military fixing up wounded soldiers isn't my idea of fun you're a doctor how did you end up here on the citadel my parents brought me here when i was young my father was a medic with the alliance i chose to keep the medical tradition alive but not the military fixing up wounded soldiers isn't my idea of fun you're a doctor my parents i chose to keep the medical tradition alive but not let me take a look at what you have [Music] [Music] i need those supplies for my clinic i can't you can and you will or your story won't stay secret for long don't disappoint me doctor [Music] oh commander shepard i didn't see you coming every time i come in here i see someone threatening you who was that someone from my past i can take care of it i might be able to help you i was fired by my previous employer for giving out free medical supplies to clinics like this they never filed any charges they just wanted me to leave without any fuss but somebody must have found out now they are blackmailing me i have to give them what they want if the board finds out about my past i could lose my license they'll shut my clinic down maybe i can get you out of this tell me what they want i have to give some of my medical supplies to a merchant in the markets they expect delivery today give me your contact's name i'll deal with this guy whoever he is deal with him but won't they expose my past i'll make sure they don't tell anyone i was told to speak with a merchant named marlon down in the markets i really appreciate this commander thank you don't worry i'll take care of this good luck commander be careful down there hello there welcome to moorland's famous shop you want many good supplies yes you were expecting a delivery of medical supplies but i was told the doctor would be bringing them change of plans a change but the doctor i don't this is not right human shut up marlon i told beans you'd screw this up what the hell's going on here who are you leave the doctor alone we can end this if you just bring me those supplies otherwise i'll start telling people about the doctor's little secret you're shutting down a medical clinic what if someone needs treatment what if you need treatment hey hold on i'm just the middle man here this is way more than i bargained for thank you human it is good to see him humbled so what do you know about banes i have never met him human i only worked with the one who spoke with a doctor goodbye yes all right then good tidings to you human hmm commander how did things go he won't be bothering you anymore really that's a great relief commander thank you i can't pay you for your help but i can't give you a discount on any supplies you purchase here the thug said he worked for a man named baines sound familiar baines i wonder if he means armistun banes we worked together a long time ago what can you tell me about last i heard the alliance military was contracting him for some research in the traverse we should follow up with captain anderson [Music] we'll see what the captain can tell us i wish i could tell you more is there anything else i can help you with commander let me take a look at what you have for sale excuse me commander shepard i'm emily wong i'm a journalist investigating corruption on the citadel you recently took down a man named fist reportedly a member of some sort of organized crime ring did you find any evidence in his office is there anything you can share with me these osds might have the information you're looking for you've got this files this could be even bigger than i'd hoped here commander for your trouble now if you'll excuse me i should go see what's on these discs [Music] [Music] i bring her you know how stubborn your sister more you push and prod the more she'll run away yeah you're probably right welcome to flux name's doran and what can i do for you goodbye enjoy your time here sorry i'm kind of busy right now so uh what can i

there if they find out what she's doing they'll kill her being an informant is a dangerous job that's what i've been telling her um i don't know sometimes i think she stays there just to spite me do you know who her contact seasick is no it's all very secret last time i asked an officer he told me to stay out of it for jenna's safety maybe i could help her understand just how dangerous korres dan

look pretty [Music] if you've got questions about jenna meet me at seasick academy [Music] what did you just say i never did nothing to you damn newcomers think they can run the place [Music] what the hell was that about i guess we'd better go find out [Music] shh okay julie let me get this straight your business part sure i want to discuss this in private no offense commander but what the hell were you thinking i don't follow you you could have blown jenna's cover we were trying to help her i gathered that it might seem cold letting her take all the risk but we're keeping a close eye on her [Music] do you really need to risk her life to get the information you want this job isn't easy and it's usually unpleasant i'll take help anywhere i can find it but since you're so concerned with her safety maybe there's a way we can help each other it's nice to see you're still working all the angles challenge it's part of the job now are you gonna help me or not you're a smart guy jellick figure
