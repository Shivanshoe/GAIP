and then you get to go back with your family me i'm just gonna live here i'm gonna run this this good business showing people a good time bus brad out of prison and then you know happy so how'd you come by this place anyway got it for ages so you must know leon the old manager leon i didn't no yeah whatever man so what's going on here what's going on is the big one a long long time ago in a faraway place there were three guys michael trevor and lester and brad i yeah sure brad was there sometimes as well i mean there are other guys though too so uh anyway we uh robbed and lied and we hurt people pretty much lived a low-life kind of existence but always dreaming of one thing and one thing only the big one the big one the big one what is the big one the union depository around 200 million in gold bricks all taken from kindly uncle sam it will spend the rest of our lives being hunted by government officials if we live through the attempt but but it'll be my uh our masterpiece so gentlemen let's do our civic duty and get out there and find some gainful employment this way let's go big one come in you there there's a couple of armored cars and a dry run to the depository intel suggests they'll be going down innocence boulevard and east ls at approximately 15 30. trevor and i need to map their route for a possible hijack point so we're going to his airfield in blaine county and coming back in this chopper to intercept michael franklin all you got to do is take the temperature at the bank see if there's anything that stands out hey we are taking the temperature yeah you know getting a feel for it security exit routes general vibe all right that doesn't look like much man security looks like we send in a couple of sprung [ __ ] clap clap what are you talking about frank oh i see it man getting in the door is easy it's a standard bank it's getting underground that's hard ain't that where the medals kept right now we got to stop outside the arcadia center down on alta street we can get a view of the back from there hey man you might not notice it but i picked up a few things rolling with you i mean there's times i think i got to be the senior partner in the group from the way you and trevor behave nah sorry there's history there yeah it still ain't fully been explained to me though no but remind me to go over with you again sometime but not now [Music] look dog light again man yeah [ __ ] area in it man you think they put more than one [ __ ] on our national [ __ ] reserves yeah well maybe we really are broke trevor how are you doing well i like clockwork mikey like clockwork you mentioned a god before something i could help you with i ain't even talked to mike about it yet but he's gonna be on board he's obligated what is it ain't it obvious busting brad out of the clink i need to talk to michael about it oh fine [ __ ] i was gonna pay you man when there ain't an obvious profit in something you're a hard guy to motivate oh so [Applause] you're the one who keeps talking about the schedule last come on mike's observations fit with your scheme be careful not to get too close to the prison we'll trip an alarm good point don't want him jumpy for the breakout ah yeah quiet enough that any disturbance is going to get picked up immediately what those two don't know is there's a special team of cops on standby 24 7 waiting on a signal from the ud won't go out on any other call and it's never been hit man those guys must get bored they may be cops but they work for the government there's nothing government workers love more than to accept tax dollars for doing nothing oh yeah that spying on innocent people getting paid to do nothing and spying on innocent people now who does that remind me of anyway if we want to hit the vault in a way that people will notice the key will be to divert the security team diverted you said they hold out for calls from the ud and that's it they do so we'd have to hit it twice once to distract them and once to get it done you're gonna find someone willing to get caught hitting a super bank just as a distraction i was thinking michael it might appeal to his ego oh what am i saying we got the perfect guy for it in michael we have a visual on the convoy keep with them t do whatever less needs you to do we're mapping the route and finding an ambush point stay with them what kind of ambush spot are we looking for i tend to wait in the jaw and catch them with their drawers down but i guess that won't work here no it um won't we're looking for somewhere with cover for us and no escape routes for them ah the same principle as a men's rule yeah uh i guess what about here for the job where under one of the bridges it's on route we'll have plenty of cover it's too open there's a number of get outs and we'd be compromised if they were driven off the road into the river we could recover the cars with the right equipment we'd haul them off the side a central station is monitoring the car's positions if the gps checker reads it's down there in the channel we'll have red flags all over the place fine what you're thinking i'm thinking i don't like being in close proximity to you for extended periods of time and the same for short periods of time oh there's ways to make minutes go by think they might be in the tunnel don't worry it's a straight road they'll come out the other side go around meet them at the other end i was hoping they'd come through here this tunnel would work for a switch they go in you come out there they are back out in the open it'll need to be a quick turnaround but you can take them in there i'm picking up the car right on time hey uh it looks like we're gonna need some ids to get in the building this way i'm assuming that's doable last ids i can handle onion 86 inside standby hey i was expecting you 30 seconds ago tell that to the traffic all right onion 86 in the building now if i remember from planning the tool store job they're excavating the new ls metro tunnel around here and take us around the building and find the construction site roger that looking for a big [ __ ] i need to be above shooting down into it i'll get you close just hold the chopper here you can do that right lots of clear space it feels like they've been digging this tunnel forever looks steady enough on that bedrock looks pretty feasible no steel supports all right i think i've got enough information to work with [Applause] so uh providing either of these ways into the bank works the armored cars are the big hole in the ground how are we gonna get the metal out that's the 20 of 200 million dollar question if the armored cars are a viable option we'll bring out the gold and them simple you won't even have to fire a shot if everything goes to plan when does everything go to plan if it's ever going to this is the time sounds hopeful to me you got a backup plan we can modify this topper to carry the weight but we need another one to match easy enough to get if we're using it for the job would you consider taking your name off the side you think i'm taking down the union depository in anything other than a chopper with my name on it well then you don't know me bro i thought you'd say that we got two ideas it's going to take a while to get them together or work them up but i think there's a way it's not impossible all right i'll start thinking about the breakout too bradley snyder he's getting bored talk to michael okay goodbye one more job and you're out this time you really are hey man [ __ ] what do you want i'm your friend i don't want anything man come on your company's good enough huh same as always yeah thanks i really appreciate that so family ain't back yet huh nope oh she's a goddamn fool man despite all the chaos of these last few weeks i think i finally figured it out i don't know sounds ridiculous mom actually it does not sound ridiculous you know because you you're a killer you know you are a man of action you do not sit on couches you take scores you're back man we are back all right all we gotta go do is bust out brad and then we're golden man franklin he makes us multicultural lester makes it cyber we're like modern america we just get ourselves a gay friend bam no that's not it i got money it just makes you miserable i want to make movies great it's great and uh so where exactly does this leave me in the second act of your life we're gonna do this last big job and then we're gonna dissolve the partnership this is not a game to me all right this is a [ __ ] way of life i got a [ __ ] family

you know i think that did more for my mental health and all these years of therapy combined man i know what i want now trevor he's on to me that's fine though you know it was bound to happen sooner or later what i want what i want is i want my family back i want to make something i don't want nobody owning me i'm paying the last my debt stock and i'm starting over again that sounds like a breakthrough michael you needed time to reflect on the work we've done together don't undervalue the benefit of these sessions have you acted out in any other ways i've been out of control doc i think i got you know an imbalance or something you know i mean one minute i'm one person in the next minute i'm another person and you sometimes feel you're not responsible for your actions it's all denial i really just want to be happy doc that so bad okay okay anything else what about sex michael i'm doing well doc in that regard nothing to report not one single thing that's great michael it's real progress see treatment works when you try ever since i pulled that house apart doc i ain't been myself not at all the thing is michael you know me i'm not a sugarcoater or a scriptwriter i mean we tried a full range of pharmaceutical solutions a couple of years ago and that went nowhere we want to go back to agreed agreed i ain't doing that again pissing myself crying sleeping in dinner howling in the middle of the night [ __ ] that [ __ ] maybe we got the doses a little wrong you're going to have to get yourself under control listen next time we meet perhaps we should meet back in my office but i'm sorry i'm afraid face-to-face sessions have got a little more expensive i thought you said phone sessions were more expensive well they were but i realized that wasn't fair so i raised the price on face-to-face i'm sure you understand and if you don't maybe you should be well what's going on oh just enjoying a little labor dispute see we're about to do something really really bad so i need to present myself as a proper textile magnet so you stop making anything nothing looks more suspicious in america than someone who's actually prepared to make something jesus what about you oh pocket trevor we're having some problems brad yeah what else anyway the union depository is on hold for now can't do it without him especially now that he knows thank god you guys are here you alone davey where's your boyfriend steve he's on his way up yeah they're up here listen the shit's about to hit the fan our entire lives together has been nothing but a series of fans and shits sort this problem out for me and i will get mr leisure wear off your back and if we don't then i will go to jail and you will get shot [ __ ] you dave i've heard it all before not like this you haven't has he briefed you oh why yes he has he told us that if we do what you say then together we can take down the big bad wolf that is government corruption yeah and if you don't we're all gonna fry because the agency's on to us i've even got some fools in our own bureau that are questioning my methods i think i'm a liar a cheater some kind of a killer and a thief so so there's some uh evidence and i need you guys to find out what they know all right so what you want lester here to hack into the system wipe it all clean no no no that will not work the only way to access it is through your buildings [ __ ] me michael you'd be doing me a very big favor and if you do this i will make sure that all your files are deleted i promise you hey it's the last thing we do and we're done period of course i'm a man of my word dave let's go come on lester let's go good luck gentlemen us to the bureau parking garage entrance so you got any idea how we'll do this scope it out not really but i thought we'd start by finding a way into the building we're going in through the parking lot no no no we're waiting for someone to come out of it a janitor all right and how's that gonna get us in well the janitors are all on temp contracts they get replaced when their backs go or they ask for a day off so we find one of these guys we turn him and that's our end okay their particular guy i'm in the temp company's database right now found a guy about to clock off i got the file here let me see harvey molina license plate 83qsl722 and we'll follow him and see what we think sounds good you should be coming out here soon here we go this is not the car we're looking for so what do you think about this whole messed up situation i think they'll either kill you after this is done or keep you doing these stupid jobs until they don't have to kill you because someone else has done it for him yeah that sounds about right that's it that's not it so what do we do oh what can we do we do the job and maybe you can delete the files when you're inside doing whatever else you're doing that might be a way out yeah well a way out is exactly what i need something's coming uh another guy it's hard to get motivated on a job without financial incentive you can't put a price on freedom well that spur won't be there for the crew i'm gonna ask mr haynes for a budget maybe the leftover cash from the polito score we need something yeah see what you can do there she is stay behind him but don't let him see you so what's gonna happen when this guy gets wherever he's going he's gonna get his severance package huh i can't tell if that's some creepy euphemism or a plain statement of facts it's whatever you want it to be okay take the next right hey you mind put away the smartphone or pad or whatever the hell that is for a minute no surfing while i'm trying to tail this guy it's work-related yeah well i'd prefer all hands on deck right now if it's okay with you guys you're worse than my son you want to break into the fib's west coast headquarters you're gonna need more than a janitor's license plate number and let me work on some angles while you keep this car behind that one and between these white lines that's it i mean other than a few missing expletives in terms of racial abuse that was my son in spades drive like a sane person for once please noted i just spoke with agent haynes we've got the budget to pull this off come on what do we do when he gets home what do we need from him we need cooperation and maybe his overalls and an id we're trying to blend in back here michael and if he don't cooperate you know what it's like to clean up [ __ ] for steve haynes he'll cooperate [Music] hey he's pulling over stop down the road aways [Music] how's that cable connection coming along fine fine sorry look um i'm busy only when she needs something jesus you got another one of those harvey who are you the guy with your best interests at heart fill your pockets with money and

government contract we'll be paid until completion i ain't taking a fall for this screw up it's a government contract no one's taking a fall except the government group oh look it's the great rt study him and study him hard i was gonna wipe my ass on him that's the engineer's plans mine you treat like a religious text remember yeah that's it who's there [Music] mmm [Music] ah it's cracking hey you got him of course i do homie yeah thank you so all good sure homie so is this [ __ ] for real we just gonna rob the fib and be allowed to walk by your boys like that yeah i don't [ __ ] know probably not all right lester what do you got uh i don't quite know yet give me a minute i'm not a [ __ ] computer oh oh oh maybe i am here's what i think we have two options the new security software goes into containment mode in case of emergency you know uh earthquakes mudslides acts of god so we could plant some fire bombs they go bang the emergency call goes out we hijack it show up as firemen and then we grab the containment drive or we could hack the system on site we'll go in my uh by air hope we don't run into too much physical resistance sounds relaxing either bombing our office ran by division of corrupt government psychos or defeating one of the world's most complex security system using our worthless ass ninja skills huh yeah eeny meeny miny moe if you favor the fire bomb containment drive option you'll go in with that janitor's id you picked up it'll be at night when most of the workers are off you mop the place and plant the bombs where we need them seriously i got a mop yeah yeah you really do they'll clock you on the cameras if you're play acting you also need a fire truck to show up in when the bombs go off and a getaway car stashed in a quiet place near the bureau so you could torch the truck and get out the car doesn't have to be anything special there shouldn't be any heat and what about the other way with the uh ninja skills now you choose that route you won't be using the janitor's gear but we had to cover all the bases that your fib pay masters will have to provide you with a chopper and a pilot now you fly way up above the building parachute in and gain access to the roof here now you'll need to be armed to the teeth mind you just in case the uh [ __ ] goes down mopping or parachuting wow you're making this choice really difficult the haynes has given us the leftover money from the polito job to pull this mission and the crew will be paid out of that we keep the change so what's it gonna be of course now you'll need a hacker a gunman and a driver the hacker won't come in with you but they'll help you break the system talking you through the process from a remote location ricky i know he didn't do so good at the jewelry store buddy's probably gotten better and he's still the same price i don't know how long it'll take you to get into the network the gunman's there to buy you the time you need gus moda he's a pro not much else to say the driver will be waiting outside on getaway they'll source a vehicle so bear that in mind eddie tow now you can count on him to get you out of a spot okay that all look good to you you are robbing the fib here and we have a winner i'll make the arrangements and call you when we're ready all right see it here you know um i'm still looking into that union depository gig it's real interesting but i don't know if we can do it without you know who well as long as he can't do it without us okay [Music] [Music] uh hello my friend hey what are you looking so cool calm and collected for i guess because i'm not the one who's about to die based on some inappropriate decision i made a long time ago ah thanks for the moral support i appreciate it what the [ __ ] ever happened to berry in the past huh any fool should be able to turn over a new leaf right well first your new leaves aren't so very different from your previous leaves it seems like they fell from a pretty similar tree and second this is the age of the internet my lunaite friend nothing is forgotten there are no new leaves everything you do and don't do is recorded forever and used to beat you this is the age of judgement day every day and in the revelation of that i'd say that you got off pretty lightly what with all the uh the murders and the and the thefts and all right this straight talking new uh tell it like it is reality guy act uh-huh that ain't working so well for me in that case um don't worry about it everything is fine you're a good man and a great father really it's more like it hey what's up y'all hey so what y'all talking about the internet age the internet age oh yeah man ain't we got a highly defended federal building the [ __ ] rob yes we do let's get after it i'm gonna miss this place if we're going to do this thing and maybe take that score all right i guess this is all got to be gone all right with the sad goodbyes agent steve set up a base of operations at the noose building off the palomino freeway all right now let's roll on this thing why are you so chipper say why you so miserable must be an age thing great now there's something to look forward to what's the plan again man and please let it involve someone shooting you for being so goddamn miserable oh what is this pick on me day look i know i'm a miserable old prick but give me a break you and lester [ __ ] so the plan was feeling sorry for your ass right i miss lester saying that [ __ ] for sure let's feel sorry for mike rich white michael poor michael who robbed banks for 10 years then got his slate wipe clean yeah yeah poor michaels whose homies get in this [ __ ] with the fib out of the kindness of their own heart put necks on the line man where's my get out of jail free card [ __ ] i'm sorry okay you know what mike you're a real easy dude to identify with man poor me poor me man pour me a drink [ __ ] okay okay i can see maybe i've been a little caught up in myself lately a little hey just give me the plan okay all right here's the shot we're taking a chopper up to altitude jumping out and climbing in through the bureau skylight we hit the computer system that might take a while so we gotta hold off any resistance once we're in the system we download the files chopper picks us up hey that was real simple wasn't it i'm informed now dawg so you want to wallow in some more yourself pity get another free therapy session all right we're coming up chopper pilot gun man driver and hacker should be ready i'll radio in guys you there okay i need my engineer station outside the building calling in updates here we go man this is on [Music] you steve's pilot take us to the chopper you can take us up i'll get on the stick when you jump i'm taking us up to jump altitude feels weird not having trevor on the stick feels okay to me he might be a better pilot but i'm less inclined to kill you in your sleep see if that ain't what he says okay i'm less inclined to stab you in the face and then do funny things to your corpse that sounds about right hey everyone brick pep talk my friend franklin here called me out for being an ungrateful brick on the way over here i have to admit i've been remiss everyone's being paid on this run except me but it ain't great money for the crazy target you're drawing on your back and there's a good chance this thing won't work at all i took the job i knew it was going to be like that so in short thank you for your efforts it means a lot to me i picked you guys out especially for this [ __ ] show so take something from that if you will there'll be more scores down the road maybe a big one and sunnier days ahead but this is where we are right now so let's try to survive it and achieve our objectives we stick together we might not die that's what's getting me through this all right when you say jump i'll jump hey come on grab the stick you got it ready are you [ __ ] kidding me i'm lucky i can even breathe at this altitude

it uh yeah lester had the plan it was all set up yeah we had a plan hold off the nastiest team of crooked fib agents in the country while the last of the baby boomers pretends he's a hacker come on it was hopeful and then when the chopper crashed oh man i thought there was no [ __ ] way why do you think lester burned down the business hell why do you think i'm doing it for nothing and these clowns
