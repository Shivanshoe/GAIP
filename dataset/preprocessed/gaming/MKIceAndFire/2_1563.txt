what was he thinking these are people who have chosen to be savages not rational people the people who understand and appreciate what the tower is a country Anthony how could he be so dense he should have known better what was he thinking these are people who have chosen me [Music] [Music] you you who the hell are you the negotiator a big tough Jeff too [ __ ] to show his face and beg for his little brother's life not sure I really see the point [Music] I guess I'm here to negotiate a deal for Anthony's release police that's some kind of joke that [ __ ] isn't going anywhere but in the dirt where maggots belong what did he do this subhuman [ __ ] is a murderer my daughter is dead the tower is at fault and he is at fault the tower preaches community and yet they toss out those most in need because they are no longer useful because they are a burden violet was not a burden she was a human being but this [ __ ] treated her like trash he could have disobeyed orders but he did not he forced her out left her to die she was 11 years old where is your head at stranger exterminate this tower [ __ ] right now and we won't have a problem then we can pay the rest of the vermin a visit and once they are a pile of corpses whatever is in their camp it's yours consider it a gift from the reclaim he doesn't have to die you can be merciful where was the mercy for violet huh you're [ __ ] in their head just like the rest of them get out of my face before I tear yours off followed orders that's all I'm guilty of please it wasn't my decision if I didn't do it someone else would have there was no prevent in her ex huh I am sorry please I tried to make things right I tried what I did was horrible I admit it but please you don't have to do this we did what we had to do right one less brain-dead tower slug plaguing the world [ __ ] it I think it's time to put some pressure on these [ __ ] we're outnumbered but we have momentum right yeah the time is right [ __ ] now you with us no time like the present that's the attitude we've got this lets in the message that the future belongs to the reclaim [Music] [Music] [Music] scanning the area hey [ __ ] who's that put that weapon away who's sneaking around who's taking around the area scanning the area you can't fall down what was that don't be stupid put the weapon down hey big brother there's not much to say beyond I'm sorry but I have to do this I can't sleep I can't eat I'm a wreck Jeff I keep seeing that little girls thanks these visions of her turning his whole mass is [ __ ] with my head what did the martins do to deserve being exiled it makes no sense they are good people forgive me but I need to make things right at least give them a slim chance to survive out there I swiped some supplies from our camp so you know who to blame don't want any other innocent people taking Heat I'm going out to find the Martins and deliver the stuff least I can do I pray it'll help me get my head straight if I'm not back before the bells wish me luck you're a little bro Anthony [Music] [Music] [Music] what's sneaking around who's there [Music] you you you there Casey come in yeah yeah I'm here well you're back did you did it you're surprised you didn't think I was gonna come through did you well guess what I did I didn't know it's insane out there all kinds of [ __ ] could have gone wrong but hey this is great finally some progress it's a relief okay let me find the manual for that thing and we can get it calibrated [Music] you you doing anything until you hold up your end we're clear yeah yes all clear okay the reserve is real but you already knew that right but you don't know is that I am in it it's an old military bunker built in the 50s or 60s right after the flood the National Guard used it as a staging area to distribute disaster relief supplies but once the Dead started walking and things really went to [ __ ] I had no choice but to get inside and hunker down I thought I was safe for a little while now [ __ ] flood water up top was too much for the reserves pump system they malfunctioned and now the whole place is on lockdown I'm stuck in the comm room I'm running out of time I need to get out of here soon god I can't wait to see this guy again I've been working with someone named Mei she claims to have a key to the reserve you know anything about this if you're Mei it's Mei Benoit yeah tower is always tossing her name around on the airwaves they're really after her ass consider her a major threat I don't know anything about a key to the reserve though I'll do some research if I discover anything I'll let you know room is all over the place what exactly is inside the reserve most of the rumors are true food Nets tons of it I mean the entire haul was meant to help tens of thousands of people in the area after the flood and there's a bunch of guns ammo and gear for the troops that were meant to distribute it all military grains perfect condition problem is I can't get to any of it the whole bunker is locked down because of the floodwaters you were the only one to make it inside well no there were others but they didn't stay they had to leave [Music] if the bunker was safe why did the leaf like I said they left they had to take care of something okay nothing else to say about it you were the only ones well know who were the others National Guard like me look none of this matters right now so that's all I have to say what's the rush to get out of there starvation for what I might have a couple weeks left of scratch down here but none of that is gonna matter if the flood water sitting on top of this place breaks through the comm room is filling up slowly right now it's only a matter of time before the ceiling collapses starvation crust or drought pick your poison right starvation doesn't seem like an ideal way to go the slow death yeah well with your help I'm hoping to avoid all of it [ __ ] I'd rather take my chances on the surface where the hundred walkers coming at me at least I'd have a fighting chance look tourists I'm not asking you to do this out of the kindness of your heart I mean there's clearly something in it for you big-time if the pumps get repaired not only will I get out but the supply rooms will all open up all those disaster relief supplies untouched and not to mention enough weaponry and geared to are multiple platoons all for you to do it as you please and for me a fresh start some fresh [ __ ] air [Music] you haven't been upfront with me so far why should I trust you because my life is in your hands I can't get out of this hole without your help and look hey I get it I could totally be full of [ __ ] but one thing I know no one else can offer you what I can without me the reserve is gonna remain buried forever if you want the reserve you can have to work with me it's a chance you have to take I'm willing to take the risk Oh fantastic you won't regret it well it's been a long night but I'm too wired to sleep I'm gonna turn this place upside down until I find the manual aw he you should get some rest oh I'll contact you in the morning good night tourists [Laughter] [Music] it's Casey are you there yeah glad to hear your voice ready to get started ready as I'll ever be okay good so I found the manual for the pump flow regulator it looks like we need to calibrate it before it can be installed each of the pumps has different flow requirements and that component tells the rest of the system where to rout the water calibration flow requirements this is sound and complicated the manual is pretty clear I should be able to talk you through it let's start with the serial number find it on the device and read it to me four seven three zero five eight nine - zero one okay now turn the dial until you get some feedback on valve a and then tell me the number you see feedback triggered on 55 the numbers turned green okay good 55 according to the manual valve B to 28 degrees valve B to 28 got it all numbers of green perfect okay last valve one second one second there we go valve C should be set to 67 valve C said Oh numbers green awesome okay almost there now it says depress the automatic confirmation mechanism looking at the diagram here it's a big round button should be obvious all right big round button pressed yes okay we're calibrated now you need to install this sucker into the pump and the pump it's it's located outside of st. Vincent's church beacon lights will be I have to step away for a minute okay I'll be here let's continue let's get back to it yes okay we're calibrating now you need to install this sucker into the pump and then pump it's it's located outside of st. Vincent's church beacon lights will be on to help find it so that's good of course it'll probably attract walkers so that sucks just be ready the system's down here will let me know when you've installed the regulator oh and uh one more thing a little tip that should make life a bit easier scavenging more fruitful since you know we're colleagues now right the tower has a radio station number 47 the broadcasts any significant discoveries in the city and the current schedule for stirring the herd might be wise to tune in before heading out for the day privileged Intel so you know let's let's keep it between us all right gonna take a few moments to clear my head I'll contact you when it's time for the next step good luck and thanks stir cancel [Music] you
