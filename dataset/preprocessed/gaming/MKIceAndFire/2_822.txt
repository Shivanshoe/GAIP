with the hourglass one my thoughts turned toward my sister i was born from her flesh we shared the same blood i wanted us to be family but she wanted me dead i was not her twin i was a monstrosity how horrified she would be to know that i've used kronecker's power to take her place under my parents adoring gays i ruled the realms as conor of time my sister's friends her lover they cherish me katana is forgotten her name buried in the sands of history yet even i can't reign forever like all queens i need an heir someone to carry on in my name and see my will done across the eons unlike my sister my daughter regards me with awe and wonder to her i am no abomination [Music] i am perfection you
