this power of becoming a man and with this great power comes great responsibility uncle ben nothing could ever fill the hole left when he died those wounds never really heal the beautiful redhead is mary jane watson the guy is harry osborn my best friend they stuck with me after uncle ben died harry's dad norman was great too he even let harry and me stay in one of the apartments he owned after we graduated and moved into the city i got a job with the daily bugle taking pictures of myself life sure is strange sometimes no matter how much you want to hold on to a moment you can't stop time for moving on general slocum has given oscorp a week to prove that we can develop a working serum or we are going to lose the contract to quest labs given how much we have invested in this research losing the contract could bankrupt oscorp i can only assume that spider-man relates to our problem in some way yes mr osborne as that video showed spider-man possesses all the attributes our project hopes to create we hypothesize that he has augmented spider dna in his system and feels certain that an analysis of his blood will enable us to complete our serum we can modify the hunter killers to track this dna signature and capture spider-man do it well if i want to get paid this week i'd better come up with some photos for jonah the city's been quiet so i guess i'm gonna have to settle for some aerial acrobatics i can get in some practice while i'm at it i should start with my web breaking if i jump while i'm swinging i can totally change direction and start swinging again if i do it now it should make for a decent pick couple of nice shots but nothing jj's gonna pay top dollar for i need to get a little fancier that target i set up should do the trick i'll just lock onto it and swing past it a couple of times [Music] huh that was okay but the shots need more action this time after i lock onto the target i'll shoot some webbing at it since i'm locked [Music] [Music] okay i have those shots for jj gotta get back to the bugle collect my money and get my rent paid uh oh i don't know what that thing is but something tells me it isn't friendly these guys are really

spiderman are you having fun um no [Music] hmm you don't get off that easy so those things just keep coming i'd better find some cover before they land a lucky shot and things turn ugly i think i saw a construction site around here there's got to be somewhere there i can hide you can run but you can't hide oh i don't think that's true at all i know there's a hiding spot somewhere around here [Music] uh [Music] think i saw a construction site around here there's got to be somewhere there i can hide all right boy i'll leave you to like your rules for now i have other matters to attend to i need to get home and study it maybe it'll give me a clue about gobble [Applause] whoever this green goblin is he seems to be working for ozcorp murder and corporate sabotage harry would be devastated if he found out his dad was involved i have to get to the bottom of this and that means an unannounced visit to oscorp spider-man spider-man well well well what a tangled web we weave it seems i have a date tonight breaking and entering isn't usually alright spidey you made it this far so now what if any of these guards manage to raise an alarm i'm out of luck i can't let them see me [Music] [Music] now let's see harry told me a bit about oscorp's security measures getting through that big blast door is gonna be a real trick it requires a special code to open it harry said that no one person has the whole code hopefully i can find the pieces on some of the computers around here well i better get started can't wait to get home hmm this is only one-fifth of the total passcode i'll need to find four more pieces [Music] i wonder what's for dinner tonight go to alert [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's three i'm more than halfway there [Music] [Music] [Music] i need to get me new shoes [Music] just need one more can't get caught now [Music] [Music] okay now i should be able to get that blast door open my back is killing me [Music] [Music] can't wait to get home stress must be getting to me [Music] let's see if i can figure this out [Music] got it i'm concerned about this project dr the city doesn't even know that we're working on this here any sort of accidental release could lead to terrible casualties listen amtower those are the kinds of thoughts you'd best keep to yourself there isn't going to be an accidental release now do your job so what are you guys cooking up here i swear i didn't know oz corp even had a chemical weapons division you have to believe me chemical weapons that's a definite no-no especially if this is goblin's one-stop weapon shop there's nothing i can do the research is too heavily protected that's where i come in i'll take care of those chemicals just tell me what to do it's fairly complicated so for now just find one of the control rooms that oversee chemical injections into the central vat i'll give you a radio so that we can communicate once you get there be careful thanks doc out for patrols in the corridors you can't let them spot you [Music] what was that killing me [Music] better save this spiderman you're getting close to the first control room you need to enter keep your eyes open all right listen carefully there are four control rooms like the one you are in that control chemical injections into the central vat you have to activate them in the correct sequence or you release the chemicals definitely something i want to avoid after you activate the chemical injectors in the first two control rooms you'll have to go into the central chamber and start the injection process then go back and repeat the process for the last two control rooms man this is the last time i'm covering for jamie that's it [Music] [Music] hey doc there are two control terminals here which one do i use i i'm not sure look around maybe there's something near the terminal that will help [Music] so [Music] so hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] uh doc this door is locked let me look into it spider-man be careful doctor roo the head of the project seems to have figured out that something is wrong he's headed your way you'll need to get the key from him he's the only one who has it [Music] [Music] the super soldiers have been activated i knew something was wrong [Music] so [Music] man my feet are killing me [Music] [Music] sound the alarm go to alert [Music] [Music] this place is amazed where the heck am i now holy that thing's bigger than long island and it doesn't look too friendly ah the center array has a shield around it i'll have to take out the shield generators first [Music] ugh huh [Music] huh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] huh [Music] gotta take this thing out somehow [Music] hmm huh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh that's the last generator now for that sensor array oh it's going critical that was too close that hole should be my ticket out of here now to find osborne's office and get out of this crazy place [Music] mary jane goblin no standard search and destroy pattern find the intruder and neutralize with extreme pressure i don't know how they figured out about mj but i have to get to her before goblin does i should be able to get back out the same way i got in and only a couple zillion heavily armed androids between me and it no prob [Music] initiating strategic redeployment that looks like a security console maybe i can use it to shut off some of the defenses on this floor scratch one wall of lasers now to deal with the gun turrets [Music] perfect now i just need to get past that energized door and i'm set [Music] okay energy field over that door is gone it's like a surprise party [Music] [Music] what a day [Music] tough day at the office huh too late don't worry mary jane i'm coming so if you hurt her i'll make you suffer [Music] now you're getting into the spirit of things wow i've got to go faster [Music] if you weren't an armor i break your teeth that's not very ladylike help me spiderman this is between you and me goblin leave her out of it [Music] hurry up i think i'm slipping we're almost there hero let's finally settle our feud just put her down safely and then we'll see how tough you
