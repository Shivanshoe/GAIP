much alive but my patience is dying lord shimura asks that you repay your debt to him he's alive what does he want to deliver a message to the mainland i charged a lot for that trip even before the mongol blockade you are my master of debt this will repay it then i have no choice [Music] after pomoda beach i thought my dad lord shimura was erased that's why i was drinking to celebrate your escape to mourn the samurai those warriors died protecting men like me hmm if that's how you feel find your courage help us avenge them we need a lot more samurai to do that we'll receive them when you deliver lord shimra's message this is my home come in hmm getting past that mongol blockade won't be easy do you have lord shimura's message he has it at his camp on the yakashima coast ah i can work with that one of my boats is hidden near fort miso dake this map shows where i'll wait on the forest road we're not leaving until you pay us what you owe [ __ ] i'll deal with them get moving and i'll leave you to it see you in akishima north okay no use hiding koro i didn't call for rooney my lord what's your business with goro private we'll we'll be back [Music] is [Music] uh hey huh oh so oh hmm [Music] [Music] so hey uh foreign uh lord sakai you are destined to win i hope i'm worthy of it i found goro in umugikov was he drunk not anymore he will fulfill his debt to you and sail for the mainland he may be unsavory but few know the sea like guro will these men deliver your message precisely kotaro and jiro are loyal and courageous i will petition the shogun for reinforcements goro is ready he will meet us nearby then lead us to his boat we will ride when the time is right take this moment to prepare for battle yes uncle it is time to your horses men we are ready my lord stay alert and keep watch for our smuggler i can always tell when you want to ask me something out with it i'm curious how you met goro i caught him selling chinese silk forbidden by shogun decree i burned his stock and let him go he could have been flogged but you saw a better path a skilled sailor can be a valuable asset the mongols have many ships can goro evade them all he has no choice what will we do if they catch us my lord do not fear death kotaro live with courage and never forget the people you fight to protect lord zimmer where is your boat this way i'm happy you're alive my lord thank you for agreeing to settle your debts i'll do my best but i fear the mongols will sink me before i leave the coastline there are too many eyes watching the water perhaps we can direct their attention elsewhere this mountain we walk from here fort mchodake my father took that stronghold from clanyarykawa now the mongols have it imagine their surprise when two samurai take it back from him if we make enough noise inside the fort the mongol ship cruise will look to it instead of the water we will draw the enemy's attention to the fort sail when you hear the fighting my lord you'll be killed your only concern is delivering my message horses might give us away we will go on foot not sakai mongol armies are formidable but our attack will catch them off guard let's pray that holds true in the fort they outnumber us but they cannot attack all at once how long can we keep the element of surprise only until we see the enemy then we strike mongols ahead we could avoid them turn your back on a foe and you will die with a sword stuck in it full sushi bar [Music] are you ready [Music] [Music] more coming out of the gates take them [Music] quickly [Music] well done [Music] [Music] fish through that gate i am proud to fight beside you g see how the enemy fear you your true warrior thank you uncle remain alert [Music] with me [Music] wreak havoc on the fort we need the mongol slips to focus here not on coral yep this way now what's up up and down [Music] [Music] to kill [Music] i yeah all i told you [Music] be quick [Music] [Music] is almost [Music] finished [Music] [Music] but not enough the mongols have seen them and their attack ships are faster our men are defenseless no they have us we have a weapon of the enemy not samurai saving our people is all that matters you know how to fire this i'll learn destroy the mongol ships leave the guards to me uncle we will not die here my boy the mongols sent boarding parties don't let their bolts go on it's working the [ __ ] slips are in flames horses on the show slow down so more ships on the way hold on you made it guru bring us the shogun's help we did it i knew we would you continue to prove the mongols are not unstoppable you taught me to fight i couldn't disappoint you and you never have i am proud of the warrior the man you have become jin my message to the shogun included an announcement i wish to formally adopt you as my son uncle in my heart you have always been near to my legacy when this war ends we will make the visual one day our people will look to you as their leader [Music] you will become their honorable jito backed by all the power of the shogun [Music] i hope i can serve them as well as you have i know you will we must finish our preparations while we wait for the shogun's reinforcements what are your orders we need to bolster my army help your friend recruit the people of yarikawa to our cause i'll meet you now soon when you're ready meet me at our staging camp in cuba as father and son the shogun himself will celebrate our victory we will meet again soon until then travel safely dick you need a new quiver or satchel farewell i hope it helps may your hunts be successful all my goods are useful thank you for all you are doing lord samurai please i have a message for you what's wrong a demon is going to kill me if i don't tell you his tale don't waste my time demons are just legends not this one his name is kojiro and he cannot die long years ago kojiro was a straw hat ronin so fearsome deadly and bloodthirsty his own brothers turned against him from dawn until dusk dozens of straw hats fought kojiro he slew them all those who escaped that day disowned kojiro from the straw hat ranks but never crossed him again the spirits of death were so astonished by kojiro they blessed his armor to grant him a tireless sword arm he's now more than a man he's a slayer of legend when the straw hats betrayed our people and joined the mongols they welcomed kojiro back as a brother five killers from the straw hats have joined kojiro and sworn an oath to kill you kojiro wants me to know i'm hunted i'll be oh my god no need my lord kojiro will grant you the honor of a duel but you must earn that privilege by dueling the five straw hats who joined him it seems i already accepted this challenge without realizing it and you know they're waiting across the region and we'll use innocent people to draw you to them i'll finish this and make sure kojiro dies as he should have all those years ago be careful i've never met a man like him before i'm not even sure he is a man [Music] you
