[Music] information is the most powerful weapon if it was possible to see into the future you'd know how to win every war before it began global risk had intel the blacklist was mobilizing local insurgents in escargot we needed to find out why they sent us in to extract alexander steiner the blacklist officer in charge cut the head off the snake happy hunting we can possibly guess the scale of what i had no idea what i was walking into okay 30 seconds and go randall greenlight we get in we get out we move fast morales on point hey we want him alive hey man have a little faith oh i got your back you always do south side of the conference room concentrate fire on the north side clear the way mission is [Music] vanguard one take us down okay morales go go go go go where are these guys coming from this is not steiner [ __ ] we gotta play break left we've got incoming get ready okay open let's go let's go [Applause] losing sight relocating oh left side clearance [Applause] just grab the cable [ __ ] busy this hotel is getting a [ __ ] review from me the service sucks we're about to exit to the left oh you're check over the wall check it out easy climb [Applause] nothing about this mission's been way easy inside [Applause] careful we're gonna be exposed knew we were coming wait you think we were set up you got another explanation no but come on we need to get to the safe house [ __ ] hey i got you buddy somehow blacklist had known we were coming set a trap for us too many nagging questions meant our heads were not in the game kavanaugh paid the heaviest price i'd never been much of a dreamer and this line of work and active imagination can kill you that's what made this dream so strange too real more than a dream what the hell how did i get home [Music] organizations i was back home my house with my wife evelyn and the kids but everything felt off askew as if it was somebody else's memory of my home [Music] oh what's happening [Music] unpredictable [Music] anybody you just stay over there you [Music] birthday parties going to the pet store [Music] skin these hurricanes [Music] [Music] we just have to kevin rob they shot you oh i don't what's happening i couldn't save you i'm sorry oh something's wrong what wait that's me oh easy man you're in the safe house i'm rolling what where's robin did he i'm sorry man i really am he didn't make it insurgent killed kavanagh snuck up on you i got it more of them came i was lucky to get you out of there i know you guys were close man i'm sorry this puts you in charge just like old times a boss yeah we need to eat that man we can't call the chopper rob kavanaugh had the long range radio christ you sure he's dead uh no doubt so what do you think we uh make the border on foot we lost kavanaugh getting here we're not gonna make the border what about the comms tower blacklist set up next to the hotel you want to use their gear to call global risk only way to contact our ride we should secure the landing site you take care of the lz and avoid enemy contact if you can stay safe okay randall and i will take care of the comms tower okay oh let's go let's get to that comms tower randall copy not too far plenty of angry rebels between us and it though that's our only shot at calling in that chopper so understood morales will check the evac point hope it's quiet yeah no kidding let's make this quick snatching steiner had become impossible blacklist and every local rebel under their command knew we were here our mission now my responsibility was to get the rest of us out alive hold up control versus chaos global risk versus blacklist as cartier was an unstable region just the sort of place terrorists like blacklist prey on but we didn't know why they were here what their plan was what we'd soon learn through here i'll take point clear somebody's been living here it doesn't look like military but i haven't seen any civilians civilians but it kind of looks like they didn't leave by choice there were reports about people disappearing blacklisted not us luckily steiner went to a lot of trouble to set us up he really doesn't want global risk knowing what he's doing here hold on didn't come this way before through here ease up company so pick a target i'll get the other one i'll be more of them the closer we get i should get on the rooftops it's bottom for you i like it give me a boost one step ladder coming up thanks man see if you can take him out quietly good work these guys are well armed and there's a lot of them apartment building i've got a good position up here i don't suppose the place is empty but it'll give you cover from snipers understood move it [Music] entering the building [Music] i see lots of movements it's a goddamn maze in here you've got to work your way down randall i can see the hotel that was close it's that kind of day found the stairs heading into the basement don't get trapped he's randall i can't find a way out look along the walls there might be a gap copy let's see got a tiny window wish me luck suck that cutting ah okay i made it okay the road to the comms tower is blocked the only way through is the hotel the hotel great that worked out for us last time sniper you have to move forward helicopter now this might help my turn can't get to the hotel from here can you see our way through randall let me take a look copy anybody see that global risk guy no he's here gotta take out those snipers first that rifle could if help can't see the move to another window uh don't forget to check your six don't want to get jumped video find a way into the hotel make your way to the ground floor there's a drainage ditch that leads straight to the comms tower be careful believe me i'm not looking for a replay of the last time we were here damn it's blocked can't get through this way randall i can't find a way in i'll check the intel hold on find anything try the stairs go to the outside of the hotel go up to go down yeah that makes sense randall there's a monster of a sniper rifle here but it's in pieces that's interesting there's a comms tower getting close gotta get into the ground floor run run yes take it out uh this place isn't any better than the last time we were here it's like cinco de mayo in here i think i told him where's the exit according to evelyn's intel there should be a door to the lobby another bar get out of there [Music] this will create a distraction time to go we had a chance of making it out gavin's death how could i go home without him how could i tell my wife his sister that i had let him die i pushed the thought away how's it look out there randall we're searching for you but they're making a mess of it in the way of organization morales i'm almost at the comms tower how's the lz you better be ready to move the tower now i can see lots of movement ahead expect company god going on okay boys she's ready to haul ass once i make that call the chopper is going to be here pretty fast copy right on hey boss be careful in there oh yeah yeah i'm just saying that ruckus at the hotel is only going to distract him for so long well i'm in the elevator it should only take a minute just watch your back i'm at the top locating the cops just gotta make that call [ __ ] i was about to see a glimpse of what blacklist was really doing in azcarzia would be the first time i heard the word catalyst and what is this one for will he be another one of your failed guinea pigs fontaine please i have this under control i've never heard that from anyone who wasn't scrambling if you'll excuse us we have work to do just don't make me clean up your mess how would you give me get him in the chair yeah your friend where is he you already killed one of my friends [ __ ] you're getting out of me is he [ __ ] be polite i assure you rob kevin was quite alive if you cooperate maybe you'll get to see him [ __ ] that's [ __ ] he's not responding well sir oh yeah enough i don't have the time or the patience for this where is it how did you know we were coming [ __ ] where is here huh piece of [ __ ] increase the dawns then hurt him bad shot just make him talk i need to end this before she uses this as an excuse to shut me down the stuff they'd given me made my mind real but that was nothing compared to the bomb steiner had set off kavanaugh was alive well there you are where'd steiner go in the mines checking to see if your friend survived the catalyst the catalyst maybe we start with an eyeball just to establish a baseline the rest is up to you jesus man don't worry don't worry just a little flick so i can sneak him out of there i got this that's you done think we're clear now how am i gonna get you out of there that's a hell of a token good thinking just stop there you go don't get up that's it what'd they give you come on just move hole what's my exit bottom floor i'll walk you through it they got me full of okay i know i got this from the southeast corner keep going i'll clear your path where do you think you're going you son of a [ __ ] that's enough out of you thank you again oh [ __ ] randall more of them [Music] randall the van more guys at 12 o'clock movement i don't have a line of sight i don't have a line of sight i don't have a shot i repeat i don't have a shot [Applause] uh everything was spinning out of control it felt like the end of the road but it wasn't morales and i had a history of fighting side by side even before we joined global risk he'd have a big part to play in how operation first frost would turn out in the end yeah you think comms tower came down on top yeah yeah i get it i'm close i'll get to the tower see if i can find him what's left sorry guys you're between [Music] [Music] [Music] let's place this guy wow uh ah yes [ __ ] randall half the building's gone i'll try and find him help me oh man this ain't good oh all sound off i hovered at the edge of consciousness fading out steiner's words of kavanaugh being alive echoing in my head the dream started out the same back home everything felt awry somehow this was not my dream and possibly i was a visitor in someone else's dream kavanagh who was trying to tell me something something vital and urgent what back here digging into my mind [Music] [Music] it doesn't make any sense you have to find me what the hell is that i can't make it out maybe [Music] [Applause] yeah i knew it'd take more than that to kill you paul good to see you randall [ __ ] now can we get the hell out of this god forsaken red infested town change of plans rob's alive ah you were there when he died man no he's alive steiner told me steiner toy dude he's in the mind we find steiner we find rob this is stupid man we need to call the evac and go we're not calling [ __ ] with that and we're not leaving rob behind that's an order hold on your new sheep to be in charge you want to fight me on this morales hey come on bro what would you have us do if it were you just walk away so the minds she got ahead we'll take the side route and keep a low profile this was a mining town we headed into the mines where blacklist was hiding their secrets given the scant evidence i had maybe i shouldn't have believed kavanaugh was still alive i didn't care we're going after him and the catalyst somehow they were both tangled up in this mystery close to the mines now home should be a railway bridge leading to them let you know when i see it copy that be careful old signs areas off limits some kind of mining accident plenty of traffic though any sign of insurgents negative whatever happened here it was decades ago nasty girl in the bridge bro blacklist did they spot you i don't think so oh the railway bridge is broken it's in bad shape but i think i can get across copy we're on the way to the mountain pass but they'll be guarding it gotta go to work [Applause] i'm clear proceeded go quiet ah that was a cliche for you done it [Music] four more locals oh foreign until now we've been engaging the local rebels mobilized by blacklist that changed fast when we got closer to the mines what's the situation hold on [Music] zero dead oh [ __ ] that's another kind of fight put some rounds in the target cross it think i'm clear copy that keep moving the bridge is a wreck rusted out and collapsed and that's the way you're gonna cross there's a train car i can jump on okay i hope you know what you're doing fastest way to the mines [Music] well it's held this long easy oh hell gonna move [Music] could have been worse paul made it across okay what's your status in one piece train didn't make it i'd say you got your diversion nice work i'll need to get out of sight asap got eyes on the side now sir it's a total loss no movement return to base we'll send someone down later to collect the bodies on my way they're not looking for me copy find an overwatch position and wait for us steiner had disappeared into the mines if we got to him we'd have a shot at finding kavanaugh finding out what the catalyst was why it was so important to blacklist what's your situation minimal resistance you got their attention earlier we're staying out of sight it'll be another couple of hours you should be arriving near the train yard we'll find a vantage point up high so randall just an fyi punchy here is walking pretty much normal now he's still tripping though god damn man morales like i don't see you looking at [ __ ] that ain't there i'm combat effective it's not affecting my judgment is he fit to give orders yeah god damn it he's not like unhinged so now that we're done analyzing me we keep going copy you're the boss i'm at the vantage point i can see the mine entrance from here copy that's where we'll find steiner waiting on you randall's diversion had gotten us close to the mine entrance without any resistance but that wouldn't last we had to fight our way through blacklist to get to steiner to reach our goal how do we get in randall can you see your way around these patrols you want that building up the hill the mine entrance is behind it i'll clear out any opposition for you speaking of we got a guy sniper not for long yo tango up ahead coming out of the path another one on the left wait who's left what randall's obviously just asking guys let's proceed whatever blacklist they want it kept secret man steiner was arguing with a woman fontaine seems like their operation isn't going according to plan so how's kevin a fit into this we'll find out once we find him he's in that mine morales okay holmes company better move to the other window get ready once i take out the first one the rest will react copy that's all of them you're clear good job we're entering the building see if you can see what's waiting up ahead cubby can't see the area from this position man this place must have a million hiding places how are we supposed to find steiner he's not exactly hiding advise on him as we speak what he's heading for one of the processing buildings up ahead so i guess we'll pay him a visit hey you with me sure we gotta get steiner ain't no we you're not in any shape i'll get steiner but they know we're here now you head back give me support if you can okay fine all righty just make sure steiner can still answer questions i'll do my best so what's your plan i got two plan a try to stay quiet get close grab steiner get out and plan b uh wing it i'd prefer plan a but let's be honest we've been on plan b for a while now everything we were after was in the mines blacklist steiner the catalyst and kavanaugh i had no sane reason to trust what kavanagh had said to me in the dream but he talked about a machine blacklist was using to dig into his mind was that the catalyst tracking steiner the way these buildings are laid out you can't just walk up to them but you better figure out an alternative route for me right this place is falling apart great that's a lot of heavily armed [ __ ] between me and there that's the building randall was on about gotta get in there there's no way around these clowns i got this uh seeking cover dammit oh don't lose it now focus oh oh uh on the move you bastards don't give up now ah [Music] covering fire that conveyor over there looks promising heading into the processing building now good you should be able to get to steiner from there trip mine's great gonna have to shoot him hey when all i got's a hammer do we have a fix on steiner's location yet negative i'm relocating just keep going he's close here's hoping this place is a maze but they got rats the size of dogs in here crawling around in the dark dodging trip mines steiner i'm gonna find you and you're gonna pay morales wasn't any happier about the situation than the rest of us less so and he wasn't shy about letting me know but he was following orders regardless always a pro behind the jokes and bravado i didn't know if i was making the right choice but i needed answers maybe that was wrong of me control 2 hasn't checked in the columns are dead ah lay down some fire oh [Music] i see the sky bridge what the hell is that thing well centering in here actually [Music] i'm looking right at him i could wing him too risky i can take him just find me a way to the other side of that electric fence okay the fence the power cables lead to the mine entrance morales i'll have to cut the power oh sure i'll put my engineer hat on see what i can do i could use some fire support a building next to the crane randall i'm still over here near the crane i'm moving guppy snipers on the rooftop above the mine entrance i need some fire support here right now i ain't cutting [ __ ] copy that hey randall anytime you're ready better be in one piece oh [ __ ] [Music] oh i'm dead well the power's down stop stop hey this could be a career moment for you holmes i just listen you god damn it guys get me out of here can't help morales until i stop that gun oh ugh oh [Applause] door iff transponders on all of you acquired missile detect repositioning new targets acquired new targets detected incoming missile detected incoming missile determining light damage to shields airborne threat detected incoming missile detected repositioning airborne threat light damage to shields [Music] repositioning ah randall am i glad to see you rumors of my demise and all that airborne yeah you know it and i've got steiner you sure it's him this time yeah we got him time to have a little talk thank you for using prowler shutting down okay let's go think you can take me to global risk screw that you're taking me to rob kavanaugh nobody ever listens i guess we're all here to go you got the guy what's the uh what's the sich rob's in the mines this [ __ ] is our guide okay then you're on point randall okay so i mean we know this mine's going to be crawling right here ready to eat a bullet if they start something [ __ ] if that guy was my boss i might take the shot anyway i think i could live with myself yeah trust me if i was your boss good for you you keep your voice down why i thought you were in control hi everyone i'm a hostage now so don't try anything stupid don't try my patience it's obvious you need me alive so don't pretend you suddenly drew a bear face it all you stuck with you need to shut your mind let's go [Music] make it easy on both of us steiner don't push me of course who was that woman earlier your boss didn't seem too happy with your performance what now you're quiet you didn't answer why would i why did you take rob in the first place how did you know we were coming what the hell is this all about answer me god damn it there an elevator you'll get your answers soon enough relish you want to do the honors hey phil this [ __ ] whatever he's leading us to it ain't gonna be no good please let's just get out of here we're not leaving rob morales all right holmes you're completely surrounded stay where you are yeah i took you idiots long enough shut up lady back to hell offer he's dead that's fine by me you must be joking you were warned steiner your ends justify the means approach is sloppy and frankly a liability so are you going to kill him or would you like to surrender and let us finish the job we do have you out guidance thank you now mr morales [ __ ] morales ain't like i didn't try to see you clear hall you know i needed the money you will deal with our problem weren't you yeah of course i suppose you live with this the same as you did selling out your team no what the hell thank you and now two more whoa hold up lady that ain't the deal steiner is one thing but there's no goddamn way i'd do this we're operating under changing circumstances we must all adapt yeah adapt to this principles in the face of adversity i can respect that on the other hand a man that gets cold feet when it's time to follow through on the deal [Music] [Music] this wasn't simply a lucid dream or a nostalgic visit home this was an urgent distress call from kavanaugh warning of the present pleading for the future as insane as that sounds i knew it i felt it it grabbed hold and pulled me forward [Music] [Music] oh i need your help i'm seeing things things that can't be real it doesn't make any sense i think it's the future paul the things that will threaten our families that will threaten the entire world you have to stop this [Music] future [Music] [Music] [Music] tell me where you are we can't let blacklist have this information it's too dangerous tell me where you are you have to find me i need to wake up wait ah [ __ ] randall randall come in can you hear me morale has betrayed us fontaine betrayed steiner their deaths brought even more confusion into this already shattered mission randall fell down with me but vanished in kavanaugh he was in this maze somewhere and i needed to get him out what'd you do morales how could you sell us out rock i could feel my mind slipping away dream and reality merging kavanaugh couldn't be here but he was these caves were as deceptive as blacklist itself was kavanaugh a beacon or a trap [Music] oh [Music] get down i got you covered cover me [Music] get close cover me up kavanaugh you need to hurry rob jesus how deep does this man go the dream that was kavanaugh's urgent message to me fused with my reality these tunnels were driving blacklist soldiers crazy too they did a gas pocket these vents are gonna stay sealed up a lot of pressure in there they don't have to be sealed up forever just long enough for us to finish what we're doing okay let's do this hate these things blacklist was all over those mines they weren't just conducting a knot they'd set up shop down there whatever they were up to it was big this is such a [ __ ] detail down some fire [Music] no way this is up to code my mask i gotta get out of here i'm not gonna make it [ __ ] nothing like this i don't want to go like this i can't fit in there i can't fit in there i can't thank god keep looking i am here you have to find me [Music] more than any vision that had come before this one felt vital somewhere in this pit of shattered granite blacklist had buried an operation so valuable they needed to hide it from the world at any cost i had to find that right oh can you hear me randall i know where kavanaugh is we have to get him now what are you talking about paul oh where are you randall randall come in what the hell did blackness dig up down here what the hell oh i'm in freeze [ __ ] got them gosh fontaine we got one of them at the excavation site orders what don't let him reach the facility kill him understood it's just not your day buddy [Music] oh all right all right oh you okay still breathing how do i get one i discover later randall had landed above me immediately he got back on mission without so much as a groan bye now there up there so get him out of the oven ah oh paul come in can you hear me i'm trying to get to you but these tunnels are taking me in circles damn these tunnels they're missing civilians whatever blacklist needed them for they don't need them anymore that's a lot of dead people good snack no more russian decisions come on get that set up there hurry up [Music] is [Music] uh oh ah oh [Music] [ __ ] oh can you hear me randall i know where kavanaugh is we have to get him now what are you talking about paul paul where are you randall randall down fontaine we got one of them at the excavation site orders what don't let him reach the facility kill him understood it's just not your day buddy [Music] oh [ __ ] did you get up

what the hell shoot it down shoot [Music] oh you've got company i see them oh [Music] i know make it fast i'm closing on my position coming down paul randle tango down impress the target oh now [Music] need to move to a better position copy rpg oh [Music] go oh oh cover me good reloading [Music] down to pride ran all the gates which is dead i'm in the control booth i can hack it from here give me a minute i can hear more of them get ready get moving hurry up randall need more time [Music] oh i feel worse but we're still here there that outpost call our birds kavanagh is gonna need immediate evac you sure you want to go it alone i'll be fine [Music] i okay [Applause] [Applause] holy [ __ ] blacklist intelligence have provided us with all the documentation that they have been able to locate which isn't much this project was very deep so what we have is as fragmentary in nature as the original research was rudimentary in practice somehow the original team managed to split the atom with a sledgehammer they got lucky and we are yet to share in that fortune i prefer empirical answers arrived at along a chain of truth steiner just throws lies at us and pulls the handle on the machine in some gamblers hope that the wheels will magically align i have never believed in luck which is maybe why steiner managed to find a compatible test subject through sheer child circumstance and i after a life of well-regarded signs and standing in an east european mine shaft wondering how to get the bloodstains out of both my clothes and my reputation this is what's coming this is what we'll be up against in ways [Music] this must be it forte i wouldn't do that it would be tragically poetic to come all this way simply to watch him die now it's over fontaine killing him won't help you do you see that that image the catalyst pulled from kavanaugh's mind is from a war that has not happened yet how valuable would it be to know how to win a war before it even began it's killing him yes but what is war without sacrifice upload complete this is only the beginning of global risks weaponing [Music] rob rob wake up man come on buddy oh yeah it's me birds on the ground time to move you go cover them we've got him let's go the plan was to not get shot remember yeah next time you're on point whatever advantage those visions of the future brought blacklist was a mystery we were taking home with us too this battle was over but the world is still an open wound we knew somehow we had to deal with these threats on the horizon we just didn't know how dangerously close that horizon was sir you need to check this out fontaine delivered what what is that the future [Music] so uh my pleasure remember the target has classified blacklist intel it cannot reach global risk [Music] target in sight yeah oh i'm here barely that's your first train crash you should be worried about the fact that cavan is arriving at the global risk operations tower no rest for the wicked if you've got time for proverbs you've got time for running get after him soldier don't forget who's the ceo around here yeah about that global risk knows you're coming they're locking the tower down now the cavern is inside like that'll keep me out oh eat [Music] logan there's a route lab on the upper court why do they need a lab for a debris oh someone didn't read the intel the catalyst supercomputer placed data straight into cabinet's head we downloaded our own copy from kavanaugh before he escaped this [ __ ] used to be simple you want so what's in these catalyst images not sure i'll poke around our data repository and see what i can find you always get the easy jobs that's because i have skills outside of shooting people ouch yes [Music] uh okay come in okay good the cabin is on his way to the upper floors i'll come under a service lift should be straight ahead of your position going up attached into the security feeds streaming footage to the lift screen now [ __ ] kevin has already reached the data extraction lab see that technician at the terminal that's sonya one of global risks best and brightest once she plugs into kavanaugh's head our mission is shot logan i'm scanning through the catalyst data it's holy [ __ ] talk to me coral what are you seeing it's the future i i see wars death tech development anything and everything if global risk analyzes fees then let's just analyze them first problem solved not that easy it's all jumbled plus there's petabytes of data and unlike global risk i don't have a server problem why can't now get me up there so i can eliminate kavanaugh and his intel i'm almost there [ __ ] they got the power they know you're there okay look up there should be an access panel that's your exit you're too kind i know right [Music] okay i'm in welcome to global risk operations hq don't forget to stop by the gift shop ah through and try to be quiet we must have different definitions uh all right uh they're starting the extractions kevin is just through the server room on your left he's here get this door open now cora yelling doesn't help get in away there go too late [ __ ] they downloaded the intel and kevin is on the move again get after him no if the tells us dangerous as you said i need to destroy it first track kavanagh why i plant charges on the servers thinking ahead found something in the catalyst images global risk will go to war against us but they will annihilate us won't happen okay i'm done planning the bombs going after kavanaugh he's on the left heading for the roof logan global risk reinforcements just arrived on site [ __ ] it's general maddox and maybe we should cut our losses and abort negative this is our mission and we're gonna see it through just tell me what i'm

headquarters it's torres right funny i knew your mother a long time ago she was a hell of a soldier even if she did fight for the wrong side listen man i just want to go it's not safe out there for you global risk is i never did anything to them it's all some damn mistake it's not maddox wants you dead and he won't stop until he succeeds but that's a fact before you decide anything come hear the situation from someone who can explain it better than me luis torres first arrested at age 11 for theft lived in foster homes since his mother died at age who the hell do you think you are i'm your second chance terez a chance to become more than your past a chance to become the hero that will save blacklist in the war against global risk you don't know anything about me lady you couldn't be more wrong i've seen your future torres global risk has too maddox didn't raid your town to kill some petty thief he's scared of what you will become he's scared of the weapon you will become the ghost the hell no no screw you and your slideshow [ __ ] i'm gone didn't you wonder how you survived that crash i injected you with an experimental technology called nanodyne it's repaired the damage but it's quite unstable you'll be dead in a matter of weeks assuming that is we don't stabilize it first how dare you put someone we don't know us i get that but this is a chance to do something meaningful don't tell me you've never wanted that i'm with you until i get fixed then i'm gone so how do i get fixed we'll get to that first we need to find you something to wear and show you how to use a weapon our mission is to steal an eoe from the global risk base this powerful energy source will both stabilize the nanodyne inside torres and provide a valuable resource against medics in the coming war torres may have refused to become august but he'll assist us in this mission it's crucial the eoe is brought here for the operation the eores are kept in a secure vote except for when they're being created [Music] [Music] already here's our final approach [Music] so tours and i will head to the eoe cora find the relay station and disable the electricity for us nicholas watcher six the rookie is gonna get us killed screw you mad ease up nikki he's not half bad squad lock it up and move out okay kid i got your six hang on mine yeah i'm only here because your boss stuck some sci-fi [ __ ] inside we're not buddies i know you did oh [Music] [Music] keep moving watch find a way onto that now over here grab the cable kit the cable's all the way down it should hang on tight i'm at the relay station but nicholas and i got split up i think we should have bought negative nicholas can handle himself it's not like you lose your nerve cora i'm just being cautious stick to the mission let's move careful in there [Music] behind me you take the left elevator and i'll take the right make sure no global risk are waiting for us so how does your boss know my future is just some kind of fortune teller not exactly an old supercomputer called the catalyst created highly accurate predictions of the future which say i turn into this ghost soldier and that you saved blacklist from being utterly destroyed no pressure [Music] [Music] really you call that hacking listen you need to turn off the security system and faster is better i kind of have a thing about lasers oh yeah what kind of thing i kind of hate everything about that [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] i'm starting to understand your laser phobia there laces were off that better thanks kid now get down here so we can grab this thing on my way down uh getting some weird readings from the eoe let's try this again guys the eos energy readout sprite king [Music] keep going this way [Music] [Music] ah [Music] repeat need backup i can't nicholas hold on we're on our way [Music] [ __ ] come on this way what the hell happened to the eoe back there don't know science ain't my field but right now we need to focus on saving our team they're not my team [Music] you blacklist terrorists always forget how outclassed you are tell me what what's it like being an endangered species what's it like being a sociopathic prick uh take him to the prison to await execution rest of you search the area rats never travel alone mission is a bust we need to rescue nicholas what no i need to get an e.o.e to fix me who's in it [Music] they know where [Music] i said open up [Music] get out of here kid we should have dragged you into our fight logan logan [Music] [Music] what should i do damn it you need to find another ear meter as it's the key but maddox is going to execute that focus on the mission your life depends on it remember yeah yeah i remember i'm detecting electrical surges at your position the eoe explosion must have blown these loose i'm good you said global risk had more eoes in a vault right where is it it's besides i always did work better alone detecting movements ahead of your position [Music] you have incoming foreign [Music] keep going taurus [Music] hello does anyone read cora you're alive they didn't get you listen we need to abort let's regroup and figure out a plan no i'm going after another eoe fontaine told me listen torres we don't know what those eoes will do we should fontaine quora is still out there i heard focus on the mission torres get to the upper floors however you can hmm you're in the base's flood chambers almost there what is it thank you oh picking up something just ahead of you stay sharp what is that to shut you down is [Music] good work

savior the ghost it has to be you taurus i won't be your weapon stop asking have it your way i won't ask again get the eoe then we'll get you back to base [Music] yes [Music] so you're under the impression that the eoe will save your life fontaine's messing with your head boy it's not your cure in fact there is no cure because there is no disease you've been food plain and simple oh making a run for it good makes the hunt much more interesting fontaine i have an eoe excellent return to base immediately so you lied to me the eoe won't fix the tech you put inside me will it torres you don't understand i'm going to kill maddox that's the only way to get global wrist off my tail for good [Music] [Music] so microphone i almost feel sorry for you but there's no room i have a vision for this world a vision of unity of control of [Music] real soldiers take action peace through bloodshed harmony through domination it will be a sight to behold too bad you'll miss it turn around i want you to see this i already have boy the catalyst showed me everything although i didn't expect you to actually come you started all this i'm just ending it did you really think you could kill me on your own i
