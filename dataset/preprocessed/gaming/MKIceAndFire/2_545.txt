[Music] the couple with the red bags were a strange pair indeed it boggles the mind to think their relationship can persist despite such intense squabbling well they looked pretty happy in the end at least maybe the secret to living a happy life is sharing your feelings even when they're sort of mean and weird if you adopt such a strategy i may leave for groceries one day and never return hey you

there's this girl that i'm pretty wild for so i asked her out but she won't even consider it unless i take her to a really nice restaurant that seems rather demanding she really appreciates the finer

[Music] please wait here waiting's a [ __ ] just let me know if any shades show up okay [Music] reach i do not like this one bit what's the matter vice scared [Music] perhaps we should head back yes

[Music] it looks like it's in pain it's kind of scary yes come now brave faces onward and upper day yes come on [Music] she you are sure [Music] shades what foul hole did they call from [Music] come on [Music] [Music] you're a male young not even 20. [Music] you figured that out from my footsteps it's not hard once you know how then i suppose i should tell you about my friend vice i i only heard one set of footsteps grimoire vice does not stress about like a common land mammal but enough of this introductory chatter let us hear your tale my name is emil i'm the master of this manner so you're the one who sent the letters letters what are you talking about of course you don't know such a thing would be far too simple no stay back huh i'm sorry it's my eyes anything i look at gets turned to stone that's why i live with this blindfold what a remarkable skill i've never heard of such a thing anyway i suppose my butler might know more about the letters you received this key here can unlock any door in the manor so if you'd like my assistance no please don't trouble yourself we can get around on our own oh right sure well here's the key then the butler's quarters are at the far end of the manor let me at least give you a map it's a big place and i don't want you to get lost [Music] vice what should we do about kaine leave her that woman is capable enough on her own jeez remind me to never get on your bad side [Music] sure [Music] everybody what's that a butler or at least a remarkable likeness of one i knew this was a trap curse my brilliant intuition [Music] shades [Music] um [Music] tonight [Music] oh [Music] uh whoa is that another one [Applause] [Music] it moves what's going on here sir what is this oh this is my butler he helps me out around the manor he's a good man at heart but a bit inflexible almost like a statue yes and i do apologize for that master emile i doubt he's even human we're here because my sister received some letters from this manner yes i wrote those letters please forgive my impertinence as you may know master emile deeply pained by his eyes has shut himself away from the world he suffers greatly behind that blindfold and i feel it is my duty to help however i can i heard tale of the exploits of an emerging hero and so i sent a letter to you under master emile's name but i received a response from one miss yonah instead wait so jonas pen pal is you it is sir my letters merely requested that you come to the manor i meant no real intent i believe jonah saw the exchange somewhat differently yeah sounds like she misunderstood the situation regardless i am quite pleased to see you here long have i dreamed of the day we might be able to do something about master emile's eyes i see yes well i am afraid we or at least this lad beside me is neither hero nor physician so if you'll excuse us please we're so close the cure for master emile's condition is located in this very manner then why don't you just go get it alas the location of the cure has become a den for those abominable shades and i like the skill to combat them i beg of you defeat the shades and restore master emile's sight you know this is an impossible task why would you ask it of our guests well you've no more time to waste it's okay we'll do it see here lad this is no time to play the hero people need to look out for each other vice and plus we have to find kane anyway a thousand thank yous i owe you a debt that can never be repaired really sorry for all the trouble my butler cares so much for me but for him to make such outlandish [Music] requests [Music] but hey at least i can petrify your enemies that's got to be some help right i can't let you do this on your own so i'll be right here if you need me maybe my eyes can be useful for once [Music] is [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] she [Music] [Music] so [Music] um [Music] [Music] what they do [Music] see [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] this is it we should find the cure somewhere nearby i do not like anything about this place [Music] thank you ah this book's kind of like you vice oh aren't we clever as if any mere tome could compare to the wonderment that is [Music] petrification is a fearsome power indeed pages of this infernal book are sharp as knives yes you never learned that trick huh [Music] there's no end to this [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] oh no i can't petrify it [Music] and where have you been lost where have you been getting stumped by this thing help this foes strength is beyond measure what do we do i am an arcane text not some manual of combat you are supposed to deal with such matters you guys run i'll hold it off while you escape who's this kid that's a meal he's the one who runs this [ __ ] this book is a real [ __ ] she's not she's too busy vomiting filth disguised as language you guys go this is my fight i can't ask you to die for me why aren't we the bold one and yet i fear that would be a foolish course of action at this juncture besides we'd never let you do that would you all please just shut the hell up what i'm just saying if you bastards want to have a goddamn civilized discussion on the merits of bravery and sacrifice we can do it later is this your way of encouraging us have we truly sunk to motivational speeches from a woman in her undergarments i guess so [Music] [Music] now thank you vice this is it research report on petrification well well oh no this passage is written in some kind of code we went through all this trouble to find it and now oh look jeeves is back please allow me to handle this master emile i shall put all of my efforts into deconstructing this cipher no matter how long it takes i will not fail sebastian ah so the servant has a name after all emil listen to me what is it kaine your eyes are not a sin don't ever be ashamed of them they're a vital part of you do you understand this arm is i thought i would only need it until i had earned my revenge once that happened [Music] i figured it was all over but there's a reason i'm alive that my arm is alive and there's a reason for your eyes i [Music] this shade know ever [Music] i promise i'll never give up kaine but you can't give up either well we're off all right hey so jonah's sick and she doesn't get out much do you think you might be able to send her more letters when you have the time i would be delighted goodbye everyone thanks for everything take care emil i hope your eyes get better soon i saw you exchange some words without a meal hopefully it was nothing inappropriate for a young man of his age speak the truth shut up yeah calm down vice we've got our hands on all the sealed verses now all that remains is to find this grimoire noir then we can finally save jonah [Music] [Music] yonah you need to lie

regenerating shade how do we even know if our attacks are working we'll just have to keep hitting it until we find out [Music] we can climb up from here [Music] perhaps its interior is more vulnerable

[Music] [Music] so hey hmm [Music] [Applause] let's go oh let's go here's another poor victim damn it when will this stop it's dangerous here you should get back oh god get up honey please goddamn shades are even attacking the village now and armored ones no less this village of yours seems to be changing for the worse it's all the shadow lord's fault that one day changed everything five long years it's been five years since they took my sister i spent every waking moment searching for her but all i found is heartache in despair [Music] this world is winding down between the shades and the black scroll to be anyone left soon my life now and my purpose is hunting shades someday i'll find a clue that will lead me to the shadow lord i believe that i have to yes yeah we lost a good deal of time with that [Music] [Music] um [Music] so [Music] [Music] you [Music] um [Music] look at you i think you've grown even taller yeah that's hard for me to tell anymore but you haven't changed a bit popular what's your secret i see your flattery skills are improving as well no it's true you look the same as the day i first met you okay now you're just embarrassing me anyway here this is from emily [Music] well well perhaps the time has come to save kiney i take it this means you'll be leaving the village sorry i know the shades have been rough lately it's okay go just be careful i think i'm beginning to understand climate change wasn't the cause of our woes it was only a symptom the real trouble started when something terrible came down from the sky it seems that this event turned the world into a metropolis of salt i guess they're talking about how most of the city sunk into the ocean [Music] i decided a long time ago that popular was too important and beautiful to worry about shades and the like that's why i dedicated my life to protecting her she trusts me to keep the library secure so maybe someday she'll trust me with uh other things false hope is better than no hope at all i suppose [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i feel confident the child still lives of course she does [Music] [Music] i wish i could leave this place things have been so fun [Music] hey you haven't seen any thieves around have you a bunch of sticky fingered bastards keep taking my merchandise no first i've heard of it they don't take a lot but when they strike it's always food and in some ways that's our most precious commodity maybe i can help well i'd certainly appreciate it do you have a plan or are we going to walk up to every person we see and shake them until stolen vegetables fall from their pockets let's try asking around the village thieves in the village can't believe it one could call it a sign of the times rare is the man who steals out of choice as opposed to need all anyone talks about these days is shades [Music] ah just the person i wanted to see do you have a moment what's up our water wheel is on its last legs i'd like to shore it up but the job is a little beyond my skill set this is a wise thought on your part that wheel is a machine of not insignificant age better to repair it now than wait until it fails completely i suppose we'd all be in trouble if it broke so what do we need replacing the axle and the paddleboards should suffice for now i believe the strange thing store in facade would have everything we need all right we'll head there when we have a minute thank you and while you're gone i'll track down someone to do the actual repair work i hear it's two thieves working as a team i hear a robbery come to think of it i did catch a glimpse of a pint-sized fellow moving suspiciously through the shadows maybe he was involved [Music] welcome [Music] [Music] is good [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] see [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so welcome sirs master emil is waiting in his chambers oh hey there guys hey emil it's been a while and uh you have an age today oh yeah i'm sort of special that way huh fair enough anyway i hear you found a lead on undoing the petrification curse yes take a look at this there's a section of this manner called the planning room and i think you think this room will let you harness the ability to control all forms of magic correct actually yeah or even if it doesn't something there might point us in the right direction so where is this planning room there's an entrance in the courtyard it's not far good let's go find it [Music] if this room truly contains the power to control all magic i can use it to cure my eyes if we could heal both emil and kaine at once it would be quite an achievement two birds with one um stone as they say [Music] wow vice i didn't think you cared perhaps this tome is getting a bit sappy in his old age it should be right around here somewhere is this it [Music] warning this facility i can't read the rest something about a seal if someone bothered to attach a warning to this room i doubt they will appreciate us forcing our way inside ah emil you okay what's wrong nothing it's nothing i'm fine [Music] something is amiss with a meal take care not to stray too far from him right [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] email is falling behind [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] email this [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so what's this scrap of paper [Music] it would appear this used to be some manner of magical research facility this must have been where i was emilia oh i'll be okay we need to keep going sorry for the [Music] trouble [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] stuff [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] hello [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] time [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] school cool [Music] [Music] just [Music] email is falling behind [Music] [Applause] [Music] two yeah [Music] we can't leave a meal behind [Music] first [Music] so foreign so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh [Music] meal is full [Music] [Music] project number six so this was some sort of weapons laboratory what the hell was going on down here ah what was i doing here i have doubts as to whether or not a meal will be able to continue i i'm fine let's just go email is full [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] email is [Music] now [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] dammit [Music] [Music] yes [Music] ah you sure you're okay emil i'm a weapon what does that even mean what am i it appears he's trying to remember something you're gonna be fine am i am i really your past makes no difference we'll support you no matter what at any rate you would hardly be the first member of our merry band to have issues oh [Music] is [Music] ah i remember now i remember everything we used to be humans normal humans just a bunch of regular human kids like you'd see anywhere and then we came here they wanted to turn us into weapons so they used magic to perform terrible experiments on us eventually they succeeded they managed to create a perfect weapon the name of that weapon was number six but soon they lost control of number six and the experiment was deemed a failure they had to create a weapon that could petrify number six and seal it away so they created me i'm number seven i'm i'm a weapon weapon or no weapon you're still a meal to us thank you this is number six she's my sister this thing is alive my sister is the greatest weapon ever made and yes go on and with her power i could eradicate my petrification curse so what's the plan here first you have to promise me something if my sister somehow manages to swallow me up my original self becomes lost i'm afraid i may try to hurt all of you and if that happens no wait i want you to kill me you have to get him out of there now i'm on it we're not gonna lose anyone else [Music] hurry there's still time to save him i know there is magic is the only way to damage this one stay your weapons such attacks will hurt a meal as well how is magic any different he is highly resistant to it then let's kill that thing with magic and get a meal out of there wow this thing's way too quick [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] [Music] a physical blow would doubtless harm the boy we must use magic to defeat this beast [Music] emil we're coming for you come back to [Music] us [Music] yes [Music] emil emil emil hello [Music] i [Music] [Music] thank you emil yeah are you all right i'm still alive i feel my sister's power inside me i think i can control my abilities now yes we're all quite pleased now get out here already just a second i can't i can't see very well no don't don't look at me emil what's wrong stay back good god [Laughter] [Music] welcome back emil you've been through a lot but my my body i can't stand to be with you when i look like this but i tell you we're here for you no matter what [Laughter] can you see my face you you look just like i thought you would you look really cool right [Music] i think i'm okay now [Music] if this is how i look now then so be it i was terrified at first but it's not all bad you know i have the magic i wanted and i can use it to bring kaine back to us emil we should hurry she's waiting i sure hope seeing me doesn't petrify her you know in fear i see this transformation has not stolen your terrible sense of humor [Music] whenever i interacted with kiney i was reminded about something from my past maybe my mind has been confusing her with my sister this whole time [Music] anyway [Music] [Music] soon [Music] foreign the beast approaches i know [Music] what anger this creature must have could even survive these past five years i'm not gonna let this happen again it dies today it's not the blade but the skill of the user strike it down [Music] [Music] [Music] huh alive [Music] you gotta live you gotta come back to us oh hey emil you were the one calling me weren't you you still

this is for you is that a lunar tear it's not as good as your grandmother's but i tried no it's great thank you [Music] kinda waking from her long petrified sleep meals unflagging kindness our reunion was a happy one and we let it wash over us like rain that is until devil and popola had to go and ruin it all are you kidding me you can't be serious please try to understand people are tired and scared and i'm sorry i'm sorry you have to bear the brunt of that this is crap and you know it keep outside no one's sleeping outside you and kaine saved this village and now they want to run you out people are afraid of us and really i understand i mean look at me as long as you're still with us i can deal with it right i'm used to sleeping outside but we'll see you later sorry about this what is the matter kenny always sleeps outside i never thought about that until just now never even occurred to me damn it we should turn in [Music] i didn't get much sleep that night for the first time in my life i hated devil [Music] for the first time in my life i doubted poopola but those feelings are pointless in the [Music] end they said and did what they did for the sake of the village to protect it from the horror of the shades really how can i blame devil and popular in the end i'm just as bad because i never once stopped to think about kanye in a meal situation myself [Music] sleep well sure and yet your red eyes tell a different tale don't be so hard on yourself lad i need to go see devlin popola very well [Music] [Music] hey oh uh hi i kind of thought you'd never talk to us again i understand you're doing this for the village and that you don't have a choice pretty much yeah but look why don't you go talk to popola i think she wanted to discuss the shadow lord with you i'm headed there next oh and devil yeah sorry about yesterday i shouldn't have lost my temper like that you don't need to apologize anyone would be upset when their friends are hurting let emil and kynay

know about the lost shrine right the temple where i was first discovered that's it well it seems that the shadow lord's lair is connected to it somehow uh-ho it was right under our pages the whole

provide a boat at the path to the lost shrine's back entrance the ferryman will let you use it free of charge that should make it easier for you to move from town to town thanks popola i feel like you've done so much for me i'm really grateful all right i'll see you around and for the love of everything be careful [Music] [Music] you
