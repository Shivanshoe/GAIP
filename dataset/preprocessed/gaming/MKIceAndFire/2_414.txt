[Music] are you sure [Music] hey yuito do you remember our promise from last time yeah we said we talk again sometime how about now there's something osf related i wanted to talk to you about okay let's go to masubi's back when i was a cadet i thought that fighting in the osf as children of the state would mean doing good i'd defeat the evil others as part of the heroic osf but things aren't really that simple i know everyone had their own motives i never imagined that osf would be fighting each other what is the right thing to do it's something i really need to sit down and think about but i don't know you're right i get uneasy about it too sometimes although i think it's better to take action than let worry consume you you have such a positive attitude i don't know if that's positive i just think it's better than being kept in the dark the whole time you have to gather as much intel as you can before something happens that can't be undone you're so sure of yourself you're like kasani in that way really yeah even if you two don't agree you both are so sure of yourselves i think that's really strong i'm the same class here as both of you but i'm always hesitating and worrying if you didn't push me i think i would have given up a long time ago you always saved me too i wouldn't have made it this far if it wasn't for you i'm happy to hear you say that but you don't need to placate me i'm not placating you're always so cheerful you push me to keep going forward as kids you always cheered me up when i was feeling sad i wouldn't be here without you i know it's just flattery but it's still a little embarrassing it's not flattery i'm genuinely grateful i need you do you mean but not just you hanabi i guess i need everyone by my side oh right friends are important yeah there's so much to think about but you get stuck in a rut when you don't confide in people so feel free to talk to me or anyone else when you need to i'm sure we'll be able to help you somehow yeah i mean talking to you has helped well i'm heading back to the hideout okay see you later thanks for listening there still seems to be something on her mind but at least she cheered up a bit [Music] you're always so kind i don't think that's true i'm not built to be especially kind you don't even realize it that's what makes you cool oh i am don't take it weird i just think you're cool as a friend recently i've been thinking how much i've gotten to know you me too i thought i already knew you but i keep finding something new i'm tired maybe i should rest okay let's go to suo i'm worried about water i hope he's okay hey major general karen started a rebellion right there were probably other osf that aligned with him like gemma was there's even a chance that the major general will be there too if we find ourselves up against him do you think we got what it takes to win major general karen is powerful he's a septetrion the brain eater when his brain field hit me my body convulsed like i was having a seizure i learned how to develop a brain field as a cadet but it was too taxing to use in a real battle the fact that he used something so dangerous means that he's not fooling around still i have to go right gemma yes i have to see what's happening with my own eyes why are there others in the city water what's going on no response from water what's wrong the computer that controls all of suo has shut down i don't know the cause but all of the city's defense systems are offline that led others into the city and the chaos is spreading water what does that mean you're able to contact him i'll see if i can reboot cynette from here eliminate as many others from the city as you can this isn't our normal communication but my telepathy the calms are down so i can only speak to you i can't hear you so don't bother replying do your best to survive what hey what's uru yuito wajuru was communicating only to you it looks like cynette is down so he's contacting me telepathically i see so we'll be without a support for a while yeah he says arahabaki was shut down and the defense system is down too and he said there are others in the city he wants us to take care of he'll be focusing on rebooting the system he wants us to eliminate the others but we don't know where or how many there are [Music] yeah tsugumi give us the rundown about each and every other you find we'll take them out understood it might be difficult in such a large area but i'll try okay let's just clean up the others around us first understood [Music] i can't believe sue systems went down it's usually full of visions [Music] major general fubuki is in our vicinity where two o'clock coming this way who are you under uh captain seto is dead so currently seto is dead wait are you under karin's command or did he not summon you major general fabuki i'll explain the situation [Music] i see so karin didn't summon any soldiers here other than gemma um what's going on it looks like the city defense system is down i'll explain later i still don't fully grasp what's happening as well what i know for sure is that he stirred up some members of the osf and conspired with the ceyron forces with them he attacked suo so he did this to the city were you aware of this scammer i didn't think he'd let others into the city but i knew since you're with uito now you're not aligning yourself with ceyron am i correct in that assumption that's right all right i'll take any osf allies i can get you will all be under me now i've split up troops to evacuate civilians but there's just not enough of us [Music] we'll help i don't know what he's thinking but i can't believe he'd endanger civilians thank you then i named uito as your temporary platoon leader me yes some of the council members failed to evacuate and are heading to shelter on foot there's no communication from the backup osf or the national defense forces i want you to go see what's going on the chairman and council members will feel safe with you my father understood i don't know what's going on but it is dangerous everyone be careful even if you see other osf they may not be allies there's no word of ceyron force is invading but we don't know everything we can't contact the central control center that houses arahabaki so don't take any risks i'm counting on you understood i'm going to the central control center first we need to reboot the defense system or the battle control system let's head for osf headquarters the council shelter should be near there you're okay with that gemma yes my desire to protect suo is the same as yours i swear my loyalty at least until this situation settles down i trust you what is major general karin thinking attacking suo even if he has some reason this is wrong here we go here we go [Applause] all right we did it all right i need to head to osf headquarters leads to results that must be a weak spot here we go leave it to me i'm getting roasted okay where are you i'm using this here we go my fault use this don't get burned it's too dangerous to move on foot in this situation if he's attacked by another please be okay until i get there yep i'm going to get stronger all right [Music] let's keep this up [Music] good are you okay you're chairman sumiragis yes i'm there are yuitos all over the city please go to the shelter right away please hurry to osf headquarters the chairman is being attacked by what looked like osf soldiers what my father hurry and help the chairman understood let's hurry i'm worried about your dad right cat is being attacked by osf what the hell i have to hurry [Music] huh oh yuito dad cassani are you okay dad out of the way what are you doing yuito you must die what what are you saying i made a promise to you arm yourself by any means you promised me that you'd kill me what are you talking about you don't need to understand die come on you won't get away good by any means [Music] please stop there's nothing to talk [Music] about [Music] what do you think you're doing what do i do dad i have to find a way to stop cassane even for a second oh right the brain field i should be able to do it i'm not as strong as major general karen but if i try though it might be too much for me no think about that later i don't [Music] i don't have time to hesitate sorry cassani this is all i could think of i can do this [Applause] [Music] sorry hmm it's time to end this witness my strength [Laughter] it's an overdrive it's dangerous yuri joe do you read me close the brain field right now [Music] ah what's happening to me is this the brain field no i can still fight wait what are you doing why are you trying to kill me and my father kasani did you stab my father [Music] wait what's this [Music] my allies and i have decided to cooperate with ceyron who share our will pitiful citizens of new him don't turn your eyes from the truth this nation is insane they control the city the information and the people would sign it not even your thoughts are free you are nothing but a livestock born to be used by the state is a regime that eliminates those that threaten them by driving them insane they only raise submissive livestock they can control there is no justice hey sunny's getting away wait wait yuito dad tsugumi we're going after kasane yes you ito i'm sorry what are you sorry for there's so much i have to tell you be careful this nation this nation we again [Music] mr sumaragi no way you can't you can't die dad please [Music] and offers an environment for them to live as human beings i promise to uphold that standard there are no requirements to join us i stood at the front lines of ceylon and rebelled against a society that would control humans and only allow some of the rights now i will destroy the new human with my homeland what begins now is an escape from oppressive control a revolution to those of you who are awake those who wish to awaken come join my cause help me destroy the new him and put an end to their tyranny forever that looks like the end of major general current speech video the government has started blocking it so it's inaccessible so that means what he was saying is true i knew everyone was under some control but information is seriously being limited why don't you rest a little i mean this must be hard for you i'm sorry to make you worry don't apologize i mean something like that happening right in front of you it would be hard for anyone kasane killed my father why would she do that did she really and if knew himuka was trying to make a controlled society my father and brother were at the center of it could he actually do such a thing if so then what's the reasoning behind it am i the only one who was kept in the dark about this [Music] damn it nothing makes any sense both of you are all right sugumi i'm sorry i lost kasane it's frustrating we saw our meet up with major general karen but we were attacked by the osf with him they disappeared while we were distracted since agumi couldn't track them they must have been moved by a teleporter i talked to waterer too he's all right but his sister did something happen she disappeared i think she joined the current supporters in ceyron it seems nearly half of the osf have joined him in seyron there are rumors that sayron will declare independence so kasani went to saeran yeah probably what about you gamma yeah i probably would have gone as well but now i don't understand what major general what karen is doing what do you mean new himuka really was watching its citizens [Music] true the new himuko government is likely controlling its citizens even so i don't believe that putting people in danger was the right thing to do it seems karin evacuated the civilians of suo to shelters before this disturbance started but even if he did he was the one who let others into the city in the first place and then there's seto if what he told me about sedo was true then seto wouldn't have risked his life to stop nagi if he trampled on seto's dignity to increase his allies then i can't forgive him or myself for being a fool and not believing sedo right captain setto and we don't know where nagi is yuita you don't look well look sagumi's worried too just take a break a lot of things just happened don't push yourself thanks guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yuito thank you for coming you look well oh yeah you look well too just talk normally it's not like i'm your boss i guess that's true okay i will um what did you want to talk about actually i want to ask you about gemma we fought together when he was in kyoko platoon we fight on different sides now so i was wondering how he's doing gemma seems fine but now that you mention it he does look tired sometimes that's what i was worried about he can be too serious and awkward maybe he should pick up a hobby or something to take his mind off of work you really do care about your friends it makes me kind of jealous of gemma it would be encouraging to have someone who cared that much about my well-being well now you're making me embarrassed you never had someone like me to hover over you my father and brother were always busy with work the servants were nice to me but i didn't have someone as kind as you to take care of me not since my mom died i'm not as kind as all that it's just that my friends who fight with me in the osf are the same as family even when we're apart i always wonder if everyone's all right also gamma isn't the only one i'm concerned about i worry about you too what me of course since we're both here let me check up on you you're not sick or anything uh no i've been pretty busy but i feel pretty good now really well no matter how busy you are make sure to eat three meals a day and stay warm when you sleep so you don't catch cold oh right i got a really good charm recently um where did i put it no that's fine you don't have to worry that much this is kind of embarrassing is this what it's like to have a mother hovering over you oh really that's too bad but okay we should talk again sometime see you later why is kyoku so kind to me it's not like i was in her platoon or talked with her very much about time told you not to make me wait you'd complain no matter how fast i got here so what do you want to talk to me about i'm looking for something did captain seto leave a package with you captain seto no he didn't [Music] he had said he wanted to give me something he couldn't keep that promise but if he left it for me somewhere i'd like to have it no so it's like a keepsake then that's right he didn't give it to you so do you have any idea where he would put something like that hmm maybe the hideout i don't remember anything like that though maybe you saw it but you just forgot i guess maybe i don't even know what it is it must be some kind of small package or box i think just go check the hideout again hang on you want me to look for it i don't have time for that i don't have time either you can use your psychokinesis to search faster can't you you're the perfect man for the job he's acting all high and mighty he should be more humble if he's asking a favor but if there really is a gift for sheedan captain seto would be happy if i gave it to him fine i'll look but don't pout if i can't find it what i don't pout i'm not a kid just get going [Music] you're back did you find something yeah i found a case with your name written on it in a corner of the hideout i don't know if it's what you're looking for let me see this is a battle mask captain settle left this for me so it was a gift from him is that a card in there with it yeah looks like it [Music] dear sheedan i'm sorry i couldn't put you in my platoon this doesn't make up for it but here's a gift this mask contains special electrodes that will make it easier to control the direction of your electrokinesis it's the same type as mine yours especially made i hope you like it sheeden you are the hardest worker i've ever seen in the osf i know you'll continue to grow stronger so trust in your own strength i know you'll be even better than me i don't plan on losing though we'll be good rivals i can't believe he thought so highly of me damn it there was so much i wanted to learn from him you were good friends with captain sedo he was the only one in the osf who saw something in me he was a very special person i only fought with him for a short time but i know that he was an amazing man he was calm dependable and kind to everyone i want to be like him someday you want to be like captain seto you say it like anyone can do it if someone like you could be like him i would have been just like him a long time ago what's wrong with you i understand you think highly of him but i work hard too you don't get it rich boy just working hard won't get you very far in this world i can't believe you think you can get to his level you have no idea what you're talking about fine i won't say it anymore you got your gift so i'm out of here hey wait what i haven't thanked you for finding this mask yet well done was that his idea of a thank you i did it for captain seto tell me if you need me again if i feel like it he's pompous rude and really mean but he's not all bad i guess if i'm as open-minded as captain seto will i see him differently [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] huh are you going somewhere gemma i'm going to sumaragi tomb to pay my respects i have a friend buried there i'm sorry for going at a time like this i plan to come back as soon as possible sumagi tomb would you mind if i tagged along i've never been out with you before and i like going there i don't mind shall we go then gemma hasn't come back yet i guess paying your respects isn't something you rush maybe i'll go get my fortune told while i'm waiting oh that pocky collaboration should still be going on whoa sorry to keep you waiting what's the matter is that a fortune the fortune came with a bocky keychain i didn't have yet you really do love this i mean look how cute he is such a round and adorable face are those popular sorry i just can't relate to young people yeah really popular they're often featured in magazines they're so popular they have a collaboration with sumaragi tomb do you want to give it a try no i'll pass we've been here long enough i had a lot to share since i hadn't been here in a while you said you were here to see a friend can i ask who's grave some friends of mine my parents too my family originally had a separate grave but we moved them to this communal tomb since we're dismantling our own dismantling i don't have any siblings or children since the garrison family will end with me there's no more need for individual graves but you could have children in the future i heard there are a lot of people who get married after retiring from the osf i'm sure a lot of people do but i don't know anything beyond fighting besides i could die in battle before i get to retire just like my friends buried here you haven't retired yet but you're already thinking about your life ending my actual age has already passed 50. i think it's normal for osf members my age to be thinking about their closing chapters really i didn't think 50 plus was an age you'd be thinking about this kind of stuff yet besides you could still fall in love nobody knows what could happen in the future fall in love i don't think so although i guess i can't say it's completely impossible yeah there's still a possibility you never know what might happen if you try new things you might realize you shouldn't be wasting your time acting all old do i act old oh i'm sorry well i am actually old after all that's what i'm talking about that right there it's not good i mean you should just be more positive about this we're children of the state try incorporating your inner child inner child like how you better not suggest kick the can or spinning tops no i'm not talking about what they did in ancient times i mean more like trying out the latest trends latest trends no i'm too actually this magazine that had a feature on baki made a list of trendy new restaurants and foods i'm kind of interested so do you want to go with me sometime to be honest i'm not all too interested but i can see how you're doing this for me i guess i could try it once great i'll look into it then thanks gamma no i should be the one thanking you [Music] [Music] so oh irito sorry why are you apologizing that white flower i told you i would look into it but i still don't know the name don't worry about it i'm not in a rush or anything thank you for continuing to search for it i will definitely find it i will show you that blooming flower so wait okay i'll wait but don't push yourself just do it when you have time wait what um it looks like she wants to say something i feel bad for putting pressure on her so i'll wait a little um how is your stomach feeling recently uh my stomach now that you mention it i guess i haven't had much of an appetite lately you should take some medicine thanks i will how did you know my stomach wasn't feeling well my power oh that's right you're clairvoyant so you have the ability to see inside my body i do my best not to look into people's bodies but it's hard to control sometimes i catch a glimpse that's a useful power but it sounds a little gross that must be hard tsugumi i'm sorry i shouldn't have looked without permission oh don't worry about it you seeing my organs is less embarrassing than if you saw me naked also you told me because you were concerned so thanks but i still shouldn't have done it huh how come you're always so hard on yourself it happened a long time ago when i was little i wasn't as good at using my power then i saw a lot that i shouldn't have inside bodies inside rooms people secrets things i didn't want to see i didn't know it was bad and i saw something my friend was hiding i told everyone about it and my friend and all the adults were afraid of me i was alienated everyone hated me i didn't want people to hate me anymore so i became afraid to talk to anyone so i i'm always careful not to see or talk about people's secrets but that sounds pretty terrible yeah i did a bad thing that's not what i mean you were just a kid there was nothing you could do those adults should have known better i'm sorry that happened to you when you were little um um but it wasn't all bad really from what i just heard it sounds terrible i didn't have any human friends but my grandpa taught me about plants my grandpa liked bonsai and he knew a lot about plants he taught me that plants are friends who don't talk friends who don't talk yes well not with words anyway but with the shape of their branches or the seed of their leaves they can tell us a lot and when we're sad they're always silently by our side when i heard that i started to like plants too i see your grandpa sounds really nice thanks for the talk sagumi thank you for listening take care of yourself yeah i will friends who don't talk huh well sagumi doesn't talk much either but she cares a whole lot i guess liking plants is something we have in common [Music] um yurito yeah what is it thanks for everything huh sure you too it's gotten easier to talk to you i'm happy to hear you say that [Music] i guess i should take a break [Music] you eat till wake up what is it hanabi tv a tabloid show the suo incident caused by car and travers is causing much confusion the assassination of chairman sumiragi ordered by travers brought great shock to new himuka dad we've drawn up an image of the witness account of the culprit cassane randall shown here kasani what's going on that is awful you can see the suspect's features so clearly hey are you all watching the news water kasane's family in the osf refused to provide a picture crow's streaming data was also deleted so all they could do was drop a picture of her man i feel a little bad for kasane oh sorry yuito i probably shouldn't say that no it's okay i'm feeling a little bad too yuito you smiled thank goodness what oh right i made everyone worry i'm sorry just let us worry that's all we can do it looks like there are no after effects from the brain field thank goodness it was your voices that brought me back it was like i wasn't myself anymore brainfield really is powerful but you can't use it when you're emotional i wasn't thinking straight i knew it was a risky move but i didn't imagine it would be this bad powers are affected by emotions so it's probably the same with brain fields if you can control it it will be a powerful tool so it's all in how you use it that's a little scary just be careful using it anyone can change staying in a place like that oh yeah chief sumaragi wants you to come to hq my brother okay i'll be right there water uh about your sister haruka don't worry about her she's impulsive unlike me so she probably got concerned while looking after cassane and the others and ended up going along with them what your sister is involved with kasane oh you didn't know she's kasani's operator that's just how things are so don't sweat it but thanks okay hurry up and get going before you anger the chief okay let's go back to sue what happened yuito what happened why did you stop what um weren't we just talking at the hideout what are you talking about what do you mean huh when did we get back to suo sorry to keep you waiting we banned all interviews so crows would get off our backs so it's okay now huh lieutenant colonel luca yuito i asked you to just call me luca you're in command now what wait a second you mean when i was provisional commander during the suo incident no you were just made commander by major general fubuki when was that huh [Music] you're acting strange water is there anything strange about yuito's cerebral data no nothing in particular you don't remember meeting major general fubuki no we've been reassigned to osf for splatoon you're the leader and we're going out on patrol i've got a bad feeling about this you should get checked out at the osf hospital asap what about the patrol if things are hairy i'll call the higher-ups you're the leader i can't force you to but would you please go to the hospital yeah you'll get peace of mind if you do right you're right okay i'll do that i'll tell command about the patrol as for getting to the hospital oh my uncle is the chief doctor so i'll take him also because my uncle runs the show if i send him a message you'll be looked at right away [Music] no need to worry it's likely the result of exhaustion [Music] there seems to be an excess of psionic hormones leaking in your brain causing temporary confusion i'll give you a prescription to stop the leakage that you can fill at our pharmacy but take it when symptoms appear okay thank you [Music] private sumaragi the brave fighter who protected suo from others in the suo incident in an unprecedented promotion he was appointed to commander of first platoon what is this i didn't do any of that it may not be exactly what you want but deal with it for now it's a request from chief kaito and the government they want to raise you up as a hero who saved the country wait that's right we did talk about that i can't remember most of it though now let's have a look at second lieutenant yuito sumaraki's march of victory don't bother with the news the media always does whatever they want so how was it figure anything out yeah they said it was exhaustion i have to wait here for a bit for my prescription to be ready council chairman joe sumaraki slain at the hands of assassin kassani randall in the suo incident in light of such a dire event our courageous second lieutenant yuito tsumaraki [Music] hey if we have time to kill why not look around the hospital i didn't get a chance to show you around before you're very kind hanabi hey at least it's far better than watching the crow's propaganda yeah let's do that [Music] [Music] [Music] hold on that woman looks like she's in trouble excuse me is everything all right oh sorry i'm a dud i just can't see the hospital's vision a dud forgive me i'm inept so i can't activate the system that responds to powers do you know where the neurology department is i can show you the way [Music] people without powers are called duds man you really were raised with a silver spoon in your mouth it's because well how can i put it they don't really have much mental ability that's a pretty harsh nickname it is but people without powers tend to refer to themselves as duds rather than inept they probably have an aversion to admitting they have less brain power unable to use powers that must be so inconvenient yes i'm sure it is the town's vision and even sign it were created with powers in mind i've heard that only 0.1 percent of the population is inept i really think the government should give more consideration to them apparently at the osf hospital they're conducting research on ineptitude and how to cure it getting rid of the inept must be a goal for the government duds why does that remind me of something huh what's wrong hanabi what's with that face well when i brought that woman to the neurology center i heard a nurse talking about some bus for urgent patients why would they put urgent patients on a bus a bus i must have heard wrong i'm sorry a bus is here underground underground why would a bus be underneath the hospital they should make it come to the main entrance the underground road is a special passage to leave the city hmm there's no data on the osf hospital which means we have no idea what's going on inside it wouldn't surprise me if they used an underground road to bring in emergency patients urgent patients the ichijo osf hospital's old building is outside of suo you mean lokusho city i heard it was badly attacked by others 10 years ago that not even ruins are left that's right did you used to live in lokusho city no i was born and raised in suo because my father was disinherited from the ichijo's main branch i only went to loko show city every once in a while but the hospital you were in was the old osf hospital in loko show right i even went there to visit you right when loka show was attacked my mother was killed maggie is on the bus what nagi yeah he was filed under missing persons i might have been mistaken sorry i can't track him i'm not allowed access inside the hospital all right tsugumi tell us where the bus with nagi was headed i've sent the coordinate data it's in the direction of the old osf hospital in the local show city ruins let's all go if nagi is alive i want to see him and talk to him yeah we need to make sure that really was noggy hmm so this is the old osf hospital i was very young when i stayed here so i don't remember much about it there was nothing left of loco show aren't others only after human brains would they destroy the buildings good point if this building is still being used maybe they cleaned it up on purpose huh it sounds like you have some information we aren't aware of right uh sorry i do in fact believe that it's still currently being used that's why i think it's likely that nagi was brought here why do you think such an old facility is still being used well once you get to be in the osf leadership you start to learn all sorts of information i heard that the old hospital was being used for some type of operation several times is he hiding something tsugumi the bus with nagi went beneath this facility right yes but be careful there are a lot of areas i can't see through inside this place is dangerous i can't read this place's data either i won't be able to give you much support be careful okay everyone stay on your toes so much i want to ask you a resource reading you're here man this hospital i'm more afraid of ghosts showing up than others do you believe in ghosts have you ever seen one no i haven't but if they do exist they'd be here oh if i see a ghost i'll let you know i think i can break it if i focus my attacks more i need your help looks like the enemy dropped something rare [Music] some help luca here we go thank you don't get it your body begins to burn with fire it'll drain your health so be careful some help luka that was close i need your help some help according to the records the big attack on loka show was 11 years ago that was when the old osf hospital was abandoned and the new facility moved to sue yes along with all of the patients and equipment if we trust the government announcements hit it no chance it's not over i need your help what's up tsugumi i'm sorry it looked like nagi was here let's keep looking huh i don't think we need to resort to that we should be able to get by using my power keep this up leave it to me right in the middle using raindrops [Music] this doesn't make sense why would there be others inside the biggest reason others are here is for food they want our brains it doesn't look like there are many humans for them to feast on have you heard anything about this place from your uncle no not really and i only really see him at new year's so there he is nagi yeah noggy naggy wait you're safe yuito we were worried about you your name was on the missing persons list plus i wanted to ask you about what happened i'm sorry nagi what made you do that to us how should i know huh it feels like my brain just suddenly froze and my head is all messed up it won't stop spinning
