[Music] [Music] my love what happened yesterday you and sigurd disappeared during the feast and when he returned he went straight to our room without a word we talked for a time i asked many questions but got few answers i wish i could say more do you think sigurd knows about us i don't think so he would have said something sikkid wants to blame me for every mishap that has befallen him but gives me no credit for his rescue i don't understand yet he does speak with you with me he has gone totally silent so what now this is for sussex we burned into the ground to save one man yet he is barely the man we were searching for quite so [Music] [Music] [Music] shall we please savor not now not with sigurd there shall we please savor not now not with sigurd there i want to see the alliance map what if essex we received a summons from the elder man and his lady of colchester requesting you specifically for a matter of great secrecy and who is this elder man one of king alfred's luckies according to my scouts he is a man who cares more for his own indulgences than the safety of his people approach with care [Music] i will leave at once an alliance in essex would be invaluable but go with caution [Music] avon i would like to see what you have in stock i'm grateful to see bastian returned there's so much more i wish to learn from him i have to go then go in peace what do you see if they see me this will get messy [Music] his household is as poorly run as his lands estrid is a good wife far better than he deserves you wouldn't say that adrian your wife acts like a sow and a skirt my sweater right is a worthy woman you [ __ ] come but she's an excellent cook with a fine nose for truffles if byriston does not return soon wine will not be the only thing spilled upon his floors now gentlemen everyone is fractious with this waiting let us be civil at least ah a rabbit looking dane in our midst i'm looking for pierson the elder man of this year our lord is not at home but his wife is receiving visitors upstairs in her usual fashion if you speak with her pass on that we've run out of ail it seems alderman beerustan has made this ruin his long house and they've eaten us out of half at home we have but one castle and two roasted pheasants left let us hope beerustan has at least killed a bow or two or his stains will add inhospitality to their list of complaints there is no use fretting you gods will come at one cry from me sheath your blade lady i'm ava of the raven clan here at your husband's request another dane i am estrid wife of the lord of essex as you may have heard my lord is not at home you don't speak as one from here where's your home these rain sudden bugs and fog washed chills are not my home thank christ i come from frankia my grandfather walked on frank assad he spoke of an appetite for conquest that rivaled our own sadly my conquests are reduced to petty stains and graceless men all frankish fire extinguished i'm wary of rounding up saxons is your husband stolen drunk or wayward he'll be stalking the woodlands today hunting game and ignoring the vital affairs of essex one such affair is why we called for you if i can find him i'll remind him of his duties ah such would be a miracle his favorite haunt is south west of here the lavender fields there attract the prey god help him with luck he hasn't been eaten but i'll return either way patience is a godly virtue adred even the saints were tired of waiting for beer stand to hang up his bow dear estwick we must discuss the affairs of this land with or without him [Music] wow go soon for you feel my breath on your neck so [Music] [Music] so wow hunting is a fine sport but i hope the ultimate has not become the prey aid me be my eyes [Music] no good comes from a camp this bloody they were caught off guard as they suffered the remains of the hunting body this one was savaged by a large animal they were attacked by a beast something strong enough to kill a horse some large prey left these tracks in the grass the hunters were prey to a large beast or two i can only hope that biester still lives have a look soon piston ready your weapon or accept your fate as a fist for bears true well forked friend i would not have survived this ambush without you you have my gratitude to stumble upon me in my moment of greatest peril perhaps you were godsend i'm estrade your wife and the thanes of essex both want your balls in a blacksmith's animal when do they not you could return and report that the savage claw took me poor beer stan his exit pursued by a bear and make the beast lord of essex in your stead no doubt my estrid would prefer his velvet paws to my calloused hands so who are you a cell sword i am ava of the raven clan you hinted at an alliance for the lone of my unique talents it's blood yes let us return to colchester at once and we'll speak more of the delicate matter on my mind i'm glad you answered my summons i did not expect such a skilled fighter it's good i came when i did lost many men on this hunt good man they will have the proper rights and their families will be cared for your people sacrificed much for your sport they did there is no bomb for my tortured heart why did you ask me here do you believe in true love evil i have loved but have you truly has a longing burned in your breast a sweet lingering pain paralyzing you with its sting there's pain enough in battle i'd not seek it out in love i long for it the thrill of a fight softly won my wife esther lacks fire she is a fish out of water cold and dead she's your great passion when i met her keeping your veins in check oh they love her it is true some with too much devotion and i have not been a good and attentive husband i have always been a plucked goose in matters of love and a piss-poor ruler to boot this drone must be the hand that steers the ship destin my hand would rather tug the cat gut of a well-crafted bow my eyes narrowing at the sight of prey aye the crown sits heavy on the end then let us run wild and free in the woods as the walls do live on our wings prowl and stalk and feast you have a romantic way about your business do not fret my guards will not worry you when we are together you mismark me if you think i'm capable of worry have you built your city in the ruins of another no these builders are lost to the annals of time far advanced to the saxon hobbles of waffle and dorbz i have ambition to build a great palace myself with mosaics and balmy courtyards what stops you that which stops all but the most creative minds coin imagination talent and your people is essex happy that is a question i never really i suppose they are i hope they are alfred believes i rule like a chipless hen flapping and squawking over nothing but the farmer's dinner ian's are fierce no he disapproves is that not infinitely worse but look we are nearing my hall i must face the rules at my door before we ready to help me fend off the spears of their displeasure let them speak their woes i'll advise you if i can who is this owl bearston that twitter's in your ear an advisor nothing more here to help essex navigate her brewing storms now my dear brethren hatred perhaps you will start us off what troubles you you're a disgraced beer stan couldn't get a sow pissed in a nail house alfred's men are crawling all over essex king alfred yes though it is within his right the constant presence of his men is certainly an issue [Music] are they men or babes if alfred metals in the affairs of essex send his men home in shrouds ah we should challenge his right to rule was not essex once a thriving kingdom of its own we should fight yes fight and you white what do you say your preparations for the llamas festival how can you think of spending so much coin when your people are starving often she won't make an early meal no fasting come to the feast the feast yes the festival this is not for full bellies but to bless the loaf does that not bring us all good fortune and aldrich do you yap like a she-hound as adrian does you know my thoughts pierston the feared how can we give men to alfred for his wars when our harvest suffers day by day [Music] beware of sleep in a witch's bosom nor let her limbs ensnare you for she will not bring an early harvest i uh bosoms that uh no i'm afraid i don't know what that means abel there have i not answered all your questions i thank you for your candor bear stan you have put my mind somewhat at ease i indeed good with that we are concluded my lords now if you'll pardon me i have much to discuss with my wife a firm hand is all you need piston whether on your hunting bow on your helm all this talk of hunting makes me long for the woods your wife awaits piston aren't you worried some other man will drench your sheets with sweat ha she does or she must as do i but you will discover this soon enough you have done the impossible dane returned my errant gander to his coop my pettish love such a stormy countenance clouds the sun of my return your thanes drank the ale the abbot gifted us all of it now that is a tragedy my heart will not easily overcome if he looked at me with the same affection he shows for hunting dear our marriage might have survived essex seems at odds with itself have you called me here to fix the many problems i've already seen today no no i would not inflict the infighting of my feigns upon you avor our matters are more delicate and of a more personal bent requiring a finesse and discretion that these saxons often lack so what do you need of me our affairs are more of heart than of state evil what little passion there was between us faded into bickering long ago we would have our freedom evil i from my wife and my wife from essex i'm too sharp a weapon for so soft to task why not part and be done with it oh where i a dane and divorce as simple as a slit throat but it's not so easy as that does your not allow husbands and wife to part our god our king there is much standing in the way of a joyous uncoupling ours was an arranged marriage a political need and not easily broken explain yourselves clear and plain and i will do it the poetry here is mind mud we had a plan a simple plan a woman lost and a woman found some time ago we paid a dane to kidnap me and ferry me safely to frankie as you can see he did not deliver he was certainly thorough in other regards some laws can be quick to take coin and slow to earn it if i give my word it is not broken could we try the kidnap again much of the planning is done it would only take a more trustworthy overseer it should be a bold venture if we do loud and brash and seen by all during our llamas festival merry peasants and guards with wandering eyes your return to frankie would need a swift ship with a captain ready to leave england we could ask him i would have thought his steed and seamen spent come find me in the market ava our unwelcome guests require food and ale to soften their anger my wife is a gracious and attentive hoe staple the only thing that keeps my braying feins at bay and the woman found a darling maybud alvida my childhood sweetheart i left her 20 years ago in malden to marry my prickled pear 20 years can an ember so called be reignited we can hope you must fan the flame find her bring her to my lakeside cottage and light a bonfire there i will know to come i believe she lived in the last house in malden a small sweet place where fond memories were made i will do as you both ask and ask freya for success in this love game good luck in your endeavors evil i pray you find my alvida with a fair face and a yearning heart now should i look for alvida first i'll meet with estrid at the marketplace she will remember me won't she yet what if she's married already or buried in a cold clay earth no i must not think on it i came first to help you your needs seemed more pressing and now my marriage awaits your executioner's sword will it not be strange to leave this place you've lived here half your life yes but what is to keep me here a loveless union and the dirt mounds of two babes who never took a breath have you always missed frankie i have or rather i miss the woman i was when i lived there somewhat freer and more hopeful and what if our plan the great llamas kidnap is this a christian feast yes it's a wonderful evening a blessing of the harvest full of fruits and fires drinking and dancing revelers with muddy mines and glazed eyes that's good for us and what of the ship that will sail you home i know just the one and her captain is full of fire come i will take you to him i was there i saw him this captain who is he not much more than a boy in his 17th year full of youthful bravado saxon a dane though adrian calls you raiders he says that you are here to steal england some may be but i've come to settle a stretch of land i'm not so keen to return to the winters of my birth in norway no way ah it must be beautiful rugged and fearsome and cold as anything the frozen nose so cold that light hangs in the sky a road for the valkyries who carry our dead warriors to their eternal feast an eternal feast would be a merry end we are here this is a brothel the captain's name is rolfer called rolo in my turn tell him of our new plan and agree to whatever reward he demands he may take some convincing for we did not part on the best of terms i'll bring him round by fours of persuasion just be ready for my signal at the llamas festival please i'm just a poor christian brother with nothing left to give oh someone's at the door are like oh is it that han i asked for esther sent me did she now as a parting gift for the man who rattled her bones huh no i'm here to collect you can it wait oy bring out

when the sexes came hunting rabbits wasn't i sick to death of carrots and turnips then i heard gerald shouting and all hell broke loose did you see anything at all geralt talking with a saxon couldn't hear them but wasn't nothing good sure of that much why should i believe you you could be lying to save your own skin ask her says she's loyal to rolo but i've known her since she was a pain full of spite and ambition always was how long has your sword served rolo i owe his father a blood oath if that means wiping rollo's arse until i die so be it and if roller was dead that oath would be fulfilled he was tired of battle i'll feast in odin's hall one day but not with a stain of dishonor on my hands i have what i need for now i might find some evidence to test their stories [Applause] no need to hunt and the camp is full of fresh kills this looks like a good spot to hide somewhere to wait out a saxon attack [Music] while you were drinking and whoring rollo the saxons attacked us and these two were nowhere to be found neither betrayed us gearhild is my sworn shield sister and lork served my father well seems like the saxons didn't get all of rolos clan lord where were you when

you i was hunting stick to that story and i'll tell rollo to take your treacherous head i was sleeping in the forest wasn't i heard saxons tramping through the trees so i hid not fool enough to face him on my own i have what i need girls you're lying i found racks and racks of game you've got more wit than your face suggests i went to meet a lot from a nearby village rollo is not the only one who dallies with locals lord accused you of treachery he saw you with a saxon look you believe that old crow his bones crumble and his mind wanders with age or he wallows in jealousy take your pick that's all for now have you made your decision gert hilt claimed to be hunting as lord did rabbit she rarely hunts she's been a terrible shot since we were children your shield sister is jealous she thinks you neglect your people by sleeping with the enemy she always had ambition but she accepted my leadership swore on her shield lord saw her with a saxon she claimed he was a lover yet she has berated me many times for taking estra to my bet i did not think her a hypocrite lordk said he was hunting but your rags are full of fresh rabbits why would he lie unless he had something to hide he tires of his blood oath and with your death he would be free he has become old and frail but he served my father well i would have freed him without bloodshed this man knew the saxons were coming and hit he was either in league with them or coward a sad fall for a great warrior no longer in his prime have you come to a firm conclusion i have let me hear it both choices will pain me but let it be the truth gerhilds betrayed you no that's not true rolo i thank you a shameful death on bloody saxon soil both had reason to betray their yah but only one had the ice on to do so i hope you chose well for you to knight them a seat in my hall there can be no feast in valhalla for a break faith she was always a jealous crow be pricking over every decision i made nothing more can be done here but your
