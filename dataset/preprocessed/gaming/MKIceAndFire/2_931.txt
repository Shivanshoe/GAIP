[Music] is oh wait what was that time to ghost [Music] i'm out of here something over there [ __ ] this love that crypto you're done for now [Music] uh uh so oh god okay i'm coming for you [ __ ] staying down oh god oh god shots fired [Music] i grab the evidence from the server and scrub the local copy know where they'll identify her now now get out of there so we can tell her the good news [Music] hiding never works you know that find that suspect [Music] operations pushing it into the chase now [Music] your comrade is now taking an albion mandated timeout you're up not funny badly this is serious let's get it done boy you should be safe mate dead sex got the only copy of the footage it's some good evidence we can use against albion thank christ i thought my days weren't numbered i owe you you could really make a difference you know join vetsec instead of sitting home on your ass fine i'm in just stay away from me yeah we need more badass folks like you on our team glad to have you yes well i'm ready to help however i can hell's yes london this is 404 404. if you want to make a difference join us we're taking down the elite one contract at a time i found that on the dark web looks like all the cool kids are forming hacker groups these days but this 404 might actually come in handy in our fight if all are welcome that means we are too i say we infiltrate 404 we get their connections we get their assets if you play nice they might even help you take out zero date for that matter maybe they are zero day only one way to find out i've found street view images of a ctos haven't been covered in 404 graffiti and market their territory like an overexcited chihuahua dropping the location of the hub on your map i hate putting mary kelly on the back burner while she continues to destroy lives with those microchips but for now we've no choice but perhaps it's time to have a closer look at the elephant in the room nigel cass billionaire warmonger and current ceo of our local hoard of thugs albion bmc cass certainly profited most from the bombings we can inspire london to resist from now till forever but it still won't break albion's grip on the city not with cass at the top oh that's bloody grand you want us to go confront the ceo of the private military corporation that's got everyone by the short and curlies it's utter foolishness badly's come across a possible gap in casa's armor an ex-insider ex-friend with an axe to grind he'd be an asset if we could find and convince him to work with us come to the safe house we'll talk it through right let's talk about albion pmc the only british organization to successfully oppress more of the developing world than the british government led by nigel cass a man the partisan media calls a charismatic visionary and amnesty international calls a war criminal albion was given the key to the city to re-establish order following the bombings it's connected and corrupt or at least it is so that's two reasons why we need to find an angle on cass we found one his name hamish balaji born in london bellagi was a recipient of the cass foundation technical scholarship of 14 which included a mentorship with cass himself at 16 bernardi designed cassie's first drone fleet fun fact caster laid the launch by a week so it would land on the largest cass sounds like balaji's second dad why would he help us they had a falling out after an incident in the night at delta three years ago a buried human rights investigation accuses cass of ordering a drone fleet to wipe out a village protesting the construction of a pipeline but the drones malfunctioned before they could but largely his name is the likely saboteur he's been on the run ever since but now tracking data shows he's reappeared in london [ __ ] he's looking for redemption like with the protesters this guy designed casa's drone fleet i think he's trying to disarm albion he covers his tracks well but that's a good guess unfortunately according to this albion intelligence report intercepted by our friend caitlin lao cass knows baladi's in london as well so that's the op make contact with balaji before albion finds him then convince him we have a mutual enemy in cass so this guy's our best chance to stop albion and clear our names and the largest private army on earth wants him dead no pressure it took some doing but i've narrowed down the area where we're most likely to find hamish balaji i've pushed the coordinates to your optic how you doing i hope you don't mind me getting situated in your safe house crime marches on and so will i there are still cases that need to be closed if you'll help me fine leave it to me excellent i uploaded a case to bagley he can brief you on it kelly's been sending a ton of crypto to an unknown party in cairo something to do with kronos x i've heard about that it's the new drug off the dark web right it's a highly addictive psychotropic with a staggeringly high fatality rate that stands to make clank kelly a lot of money the cost of countless lives no doubt well the phrase finnsbury new project keeps popping up in that comms if you'd like to take a look into it all right located the ctos hub if you were listening to this it means you want to learn more about 404 know what we know do what we do make your way to the walkie-talkie club it's no big secret that the club is a front for client kelly but the place has all the secrets too more will be revealed the hub just dumped a massive load of data into your optic how forward by now you must have reached 20th church street the walkie-talkie club is located at the top of the building lift access only you have arrived at the walkie-talkie club where those with more money than sense come to lose both the walkie-talkie club is frequented by all manner of crooked elites and the owners clan kelly have an ai in place to collect blackmail materially find that air and let's see for ourselves what these corrupt scumbags have to hide [Music] my patience is wearing out oh please [ __ ] what happened [ __ ] pear shaped okay what is going on [Music] come on well you worked hard and persevered and now we have nothing the ai is not actually here just a relay sending the club's data off-site i'll find where it's all going and you find a way out of this loud obnoxious sweat hole deal deal oh no okay i don't oh i've done some digging and it looks like the facial recognition ai was created by broker tech broker tech they're one of the biggest software companies on the planet always keep their noses clean too if they're buying blackmail material from the kellys that's big news everything the ai is collecting here is being sent directly to brokertech hq we have to go there to get the data you have arrived at brokertech lead innovators in software and ai technology founded by ceo skye larsen when she was just 25. talk about an overachiever oh wow there's so much dirt buried in here it would be a shame if you know someone went to put it all online i believe that's exactly what our 404 friend has in mind fine leave it to me [ __ ] i had a combat drone after me before [Music] you
