you were on the verge of turning but uv light and inhibitors pulled you back the bat helped too of course you're alive let's keep it that way guy almost kills us all and you're chatting him up girls relax they're frightened you almost destroyed their workshop we need to move out can you walk but i i don't understand where are we going to a safe place i gotta get to the fish eye the fish eye without the biomarker you won't get near it what the hell is that biomarker monitors the disease's progression in the dark that's your ticket into the city without it stepping out of the light is sort of a lottery you don't know when you turn you need a biomarker and i know where to find one come on he's turning again relax everything's under control it'll be fine hey you're weak take a minute drink seriously what next maybe we should draw him a bath sounds pretty cozy to me ladies maybe next time get banned no she adores me why are you helping me let's get to know each other and find out you go first where'd you get all those new business you're careful good you live longer you're a real pilgrim or did you steal that badge i was a pilgrim an hour to dusk i'm serious heck on he's not staying the night here here no weapon on your radio not even a pilgrim could get by without that come on let's go that's a nice place don't get comfortable we don't need another roommate especially one that could rob us while sleeping not every pilgrim is a criminal you know uh-huh you have a nice workshop here assembling uv lamps huh yeah you shouldn't be here hakan's risking our asses can't you see the door maybe i can help i'm sorry i guess i scared you huh felt better after i hit you or even yana aidan what is this place our home our workshop our whole world you might say you're nicer than she is hey back off sarah doesn't trust anyone but me besides i'm a better fighter than she is so i can afford to be more open [Music] you got a thick skull usually when i whack someone they don't get up [Music] not bad where's the fisheye the canteen is there in the center past the chemical dumps ah i need to get there too bad only way to go is through the tunnel they protect it like a portal to the [ __ ] valhalla they are impossible to get through [Music] well can you help me you seem to be familiar with the city i've lived in this city since before the world got [ __ ] up i could help you but you need a biomarker you won't get far without it where are you from pretty far i guess about 2 000 kilometers oh [ __ ] how the heck did you not get infected that's easy didn't let him bite me here it's different here we're all infected heard of haran they isolated villadore too they built walls they locked us in turned out to be the thing that saved us and how do you get a biomarker uh you can't get them unless you know the right people and i do let's go by the way i'm hakon i'm aiden nice to meet you aiden [Music] welcome to paradise [Music] oh you do know the moves i was in the military special unit for seven years i even liked it except when i didn't for insubordination got blacklisted and they zeroed my bank account ended up driving a cab ouch now the mighty have fallen [ __ ] you at least i got to know my way around the city oh come on you're too weak without an inhibitor you won't last i didn't i smash everything in sight last time you gave it to me that was just the first time but then it gets better if you survive of course catch you're telling me i could have died if i hadn't given it to you you would have died anyway so why are you helping me i know people are generally scared of you guys but one pilgrim saved my life i was a pilgrim now i'm infected it'll be much harder to travel and welcome to your new beginning my friend check out this place they're like treasure chests usually got good stuff in him check it out i'll wait oh people hide a lot of things in places like this in case someone can't make it back to a shelter before dark what's that crystals someone must have stashed them here they formed after the chemicals were dumped on us some believe they delay infection folk superstition so you don't collect them sure i do superstitious people pay a fortune for them and i am always happy to take someone's cash there's one specific chest i'm after come on let me show you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come on come on stop so you have an army here the peacekeepers they treat people like that too watch out for them they got the tunnel you want to go through tell me more about them they consider themselves righteous protectors they are good at killing infected so you got to give them credit for that yeah pretty efficient killers yeah but their righteousness comes with a price always remember this you either play by their rules or you're [ __ ] their protection of the bazaar is more like an occupation on the trail i met a lot of tough guys who talked about the new order it always seemed like the same old [ __ ] to me yeah it's like that here too and the pk's are getting worse i'll proceed with caution good though it might not help the pk are a pain seriously riling up the bazaar folks the bazaar is a box of dynamite one spark away from blowing up hey are we going you uh wanted to show me something sure follow me [Music] uh [Music] almost there i hope there are no surprises [Music] it's getting dark they are about to wake up quickly open the chest in return we'll get your biomarker [ __ ] thieves wait no no no leave it mess up that lock and everything's [ __ ] anyway enough for a biomarker where'd you get that i've been all over the city more than most but even i haven't seen working gre equipment for years i can't say much but a former gre scientist dylan gave it to me a guy named waltz killed him and before he died dylan gave me the key to keep it from waltz contains important information apparently i hope to find out more at the fisheye we'll have to see won't we [ __ ] me we took too long plan me run like hello [Applause] we can make it follow me quick [Music] they're close go on [Music] over there do all the light can you hear that we're almost there a bit further [Music] open up hello stand in the light there's no time we've got the hollow on our ass biomarkers didn't you hear behind us i said biomarkers here that is he's with me i have to see his bio let us just inside the door at least i need to see his bike how about some electronics huh [ __ ] out open up [Applause] peace [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they almost got us don't look back run faster there's more and more so it's me open up we're friends here huh keep them busy killian [ __ ] you gideon come on killian jump over my body this morning and get killed [Applause] oh [ __ ] there's a lot i doubt we're done trouble loves company get us in there i'm crying kill him [Music] [Applause] yes [Applause] is that all of them i think so help me [Music] oh we're so [ __ ] [Music] oh god damn it gillian you should have waited a while longer almost did didn't want to clean your guts off my doorstep in the morning they've left soaking you oh come on stop being such a bastard already look at this where did you that's rare invite us in or it'll get even more rare and who is this i'm a pilgrim haven't been here long have you how did you get into town i'll tell you everything just let us in i waited for a pilgrim once he was supposed to oh forget it doesn't matter anymore what are you up to hack on her i gave him an inhibitor survived so you mad he needs a biomarker don't have one [ __ ] seriously [ __ ] the hospital then i was hoping to avoid it always looking for an easy way huh i don't i just need a uv lamp i'll come back for you hold tight hack on why you helping him huh remember when we used to help people me sure but i doubt you do stay here and rest by the lamp don't listen to that dumbass idiot we used to help people remember surely remember your [ __ ] a [ __ ] cabbie and a mother of mercy all in one everyone around you said that's what you should do cook life would have been easier no night runners no haircuts no problems but no you wanted something else higher [ __ ] clauses and you could just cook biomarkers why are they so hard to get because they're complicated devices hell the factories that made them have been out of commission for years biomarkers are keyed to blood they can't be reused after someone syncs with it without them the infection runs unchecked like what's happened to you that's why people pay a fortune to get a new one all the money and crystals they have fortunately me and hackon found a place where they can still be made what's wrong with hakkon giving me inhibitors kills most people in seconds it's a powerful drug most can't handle it but i survived i said most so don't get excited just be careful with them you would hack on you know each other long too long what did he mean when he said that you used to help people we serve together in a special ah doesn't matter ancient history where can i rest so you just got into town what brought you here this ain't the promised land far from it i need to get to the fisheye and hack help when you get there you seem like a good kid but take my advice don't go dolin out trust like penny candy hell how do you know you can trust me okay enough jabber go to sleep nothing to be done till morning anyway [Laughter] [Music] yeah very funny did you make it almost biomarkers are at the gre hospital i'll be there shortly but to get the job done i need you to join me where should i go with killian's door to your back you'll be pointing right at it hold the line so keep to the roofs cause if the howler spot you yeah i know don't want to go up against any of those anytime soon once i was taking my second wife to the hospital i never drove that fast in my life her waters broke three months early you have kids there was no saving that one and other than that none that i know of sorry it's fine what normal person would want his kids to see a world like this the lock is broken don't worry find the old bus the bus at zero hour a bus crashed into the hospital broke through the wall you can use it to get inside since no one could get in there's a good chance there'll be some markers left hmm dude i'm at the main entrance i marked a safe route for you i'm waiting by the lobby hey this way big building huh great to go for quite a few of these for drug research when it all got [ __ ] they grabbed research volunteers but they paid them loads of money what was the result a lot of [ __ ] just a little more we don't have much time stay close to me i don't you know how to open locks sure turn the key what if you don't have a key i can't i've traveled thousands of kilometers you think doors are a problem for me okay just checking i think this room should have all the instruments you need maestro i found some scrap you can make lockpicks out of that ah good work [Music] um you didn't lie you know your stuff i had no other choice was forced to know my stuff [Music] oh what the hell um that won't work let's go this way dark zone in front of us keep quiet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] eddie [Music] that's a bad idea mia if it was a good one it wouldn't be fun what are you doing [Music] yeah not on the wall stop talking and give me your hand [Music] aiden everything okay yeah are you sure talk to me this hospital i've been in one like this before a gre facility well there are a few of them around the city i'm having these these memories the person i'm looking for is mia she's my sister i told you about waltz before mention something yeah i don't know it's all mixed up in my head you suppress the memory like i did of my third wife look i'm sure the infection ain't helping chin up we'll find the marker and clear out let's go yeah thanks so uh sleeping berries yeah we have to walk past them if you crouch and move slowly they shouldn't notice you get too close and you're done for you probably know that already i do yeah oh uh what is that chemicals nasty [ __ ] when they lost control of the virus the gre started spraying the whole city with that filth worked out great for them [Music] so this guy you told me about what was his name waltz yes why did you mention him because i remember he was doing some kind of experiment he wasn't the only one doing them there were more cities like villadore with walls cut off from the rest of the world many people were working toward a vaccine eden but well the world is full of [ __ ] all right be careful it's not stable come on uh you alive i guess so can you climb up sure just give me a sec hurry we're running out of time i can't make it wait i've got an idea remember the cocktail i surfed you earlier at the girls workshop neighbors exactly you fell to the first floor there's some gre storage down there look for white green crates inhibitors should be inside if you take another dose you should get your strength back [Music] i know i've seen this [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i ran off try to go around it somehow [Music] foreign uh aiden hurry is that infected find you your dead this way to the kitchen eat all the ice cream they hid from us i'm scared mia me too and i'm younger don't be a chicken lady what if the doctor sees us he won't besides you'd have to catch us too come on don't back out now [Music] don't be a chicken lady [Music] [Music] oh i took the inhibitor go back to the elevator [Music] [Music] hello hi god [Music] hurry i found the markers [Music] [Music] are you in one piece you were gone a while how are you feeling i'm infected but good to go yeah that's great sorry about this what i'm sorry about what about that on behalf of all its [ __ ] bandits and idiots i christen you a citizen of villadore you're about to turn get into the light fast [Music] [Music] [Applause] uh ah that was close or what would you do without me pilgrim i never wanted to become a pilgrim i just sort of fell into him i run the country for another reason entirely i'm looking for my sister and then what then what will you do once you find your sister i'll find someplace for us to live someplace quiet gotta settle down somewhere now that i'm infected where will you go any place is better than this city come on that's a pretty low bar i find a place where people aren't afraid of pilgrims aren't afraid of me it'd be nice not to have to run and hide for a while i always wanted to catch fish fish are good well i have a very specific plan you look like someone with a specific plan i'd like to live by the ocean you know it's supposed to be easier there i always wanted to learn how to surf well you find a bunch of old postcards or something ah don't laugh at my dreams man i know one thing i have to get out of the city it's killing me right from the inside will you help me the ocean's a long way from here and we're both infected people don't want pilgrims for their neighbors [ __ ] people i will help you with them and you can help me survive on the road you know the roots you know how to survive out in the open what do you think we cover each other's asses how does that sound [Music] okay let's do it awesome deal you won't regret this hayden i promise as for your goal here's the situation around here after the pk commander was murdered they blocked the route to the center they're trying to keep the killer from escaping to get to fisheye we have to outsmart them but i know when they change the night card that will be our chance i'm gonna get the stuff we'll need for the passage i have to suss out our odds meantime take a look around live a little come on let me show you something here you'll need these take a look around the city old villador plenty of interesting spots to check out hmm you see the church that's where the howlers were after us it's the center of the district [Music] [Music]

the old gre dog zone and reach the roof follow the sign what what sign [Music] [Music] ready for this you're dead now choke on buddy [ __ ] uh uh ugh [Music] jeez what took you so long slowpoke how did you do that i jumped to the side wall pulled myself up the gutter but hey why should i tell you trade secrets wait till the next leg of the race that's where the rubber really meets the road but what meets what i okay clearly you need a moment to rest take some time and when you're ready meet me on the roof of the building across from the old military base on mill street [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he gave me [Music] [Music] one hmm [Music] is you see that piece of [ __ ] here [Music] six [Music] so hmm [Music] [Music] alive the winds blowing from the east that's a bad [Music] god [Music] hey how much were you going what a day no freaking way i can do it five years ago and all for nothing for someone easy i just have to get it right this time it's easy enough what's the problem hey aren't you the pilgrim they wanted to hang man you were in luck there i could use some of that luck i'm alberto's apprentice not for long probably it's the third time i'm taking a shot at this test if i fail again craftmaster alberto is gonna kick me out hey what's a craftmaster you're not from around here right craftmasters are people who invent new technology design innovations all sorts of gadgets that might help in combat alberto's the grand master around here like i said i'm his apprentice people laugh at him that he's slow and not very eloquent but he's a real freaking genius [Music] what's this test about i have to design something useful for the citizens i already invented underwater reading glasses for alberto then a retractable dog leash but he kept jamming and besides we have no dogs here oh my dears are worthless now is my last chance to prove that i am not worthless so i spent the last several weeks walking around the bazaar and thinking thinking hard and then i hit it our goats they're kept in cages because they eat crops but life in cages makes them sad and they give less milk so i came up with the idea of a fence energized with just a tiny bit of voltage that would keep the goats under control but let them produce more milk i call this invention the electric fence [Music] so what seems to be the problem with this invention of yours i'm missing a few parts and they're not that easy to get i'm worried i won't be ready on time maybe you could help me if you find them for me i'll give you one of my super cool inventions nothing to do with goats i hope nah something much more interesting you'll see i just need some electric parts i'll dismantle them for resistors and other useful things as far as i know they can be found in two places one's an old hardware store on fitzwilliam place near the water tower alberto says they'll be there for sure but it's a dark place full of turned creatures you have to go there at night and the other option whatever is left of military patrols i know of one place south of horseshoe near the old electrical substation bandits roam in the area so it's possible there's nothing left there in which case you'll have to look for other patrol remains or take a night trip to the store [Music] looks like you're in luck after all i have the parts you need on me are you serious that's just fantastic heaven must have sent you here i don't know how to thank you one more thing could you help me set up my show my installation's right outside the main entrance turn it on please i'll go get alberto wait till he sees it meet me by the goat pen then near the wall [Music] man i'm so thirsty [Music] what are you up to these days aidan hey back off [Music] you've traveled through the outlands any other cities still standing i never believed that night runners were real just fairy tales yeah barney said hey hangman how's the neck who's barney everyone knows barney here i don't tell me i wouldn't bother yourself about barney he doesn't like nosy people liable to piss him off if he finds out and you don't want that kind of trouble but now i definitely want to know more okay he's sophie's younger brother some say he's crazy but he's a pillar of the bizarre the pks are afraid of them and they should be barney is no one to [ __ ] with [Music] find something you like in the bazaar [Music] don't recognize me or are you allergic to making money listen pilgrim we can make it killing you and me you just need to get me some beets radishes parsnips there he is grab him ed he's a murderer what julian luke's been poisoned from the water you sold him bevin says what but i don't sell water liar luke told me he got it from you whatever's in it has him ranting and raving now you're sure he didn't blame me after he started renting [Music] but wait a minute do you have proof of course the water came in a bottle luke got that water in one of your bottles when i tell carl about this you'll hang bevin wait i swear i don't even sell water damn it if you're lying julian you're [ __ ] toast you haven't seen my kids so then if you're not selling water how'd someone get a hold of one of your bottles knowing that [ __ ] had luke he probably stole it that would be like him even if he did my water is pure as melded snowflakes so maybe it's revenge for what everyone loves me never had an enemy in my life wait a second wait [ __ ] except maybe marco that bastard come to think of it he's got an axe to grind for me it was a long time ago never mind listen he lives above an old shop on the west end of villadore on houndfield lane i traded him a few kilos of my finest flower for the water prove he poisoned it and half my flower is yours can you do that for me i guess i could check it out and there's one more thing i'm a little embarrassed hands might also have a bottle of this water i thought you weren't selling it i'm not accepting well to hands and can you go warn him he's also on hand filled a few buildings down something's fishy about this julian look you better be telling the truth otherwise it'll be hard to help you in 11 years since the chemical bombings almost killed everyone in the city i swear to god you know how i cope with all of this i have a secret garden yeah pilgrim aren't you that's right do you hang people for that too i just wanted to say that i was rooting for you uh-huh thanks for standing up for me what but i didn't ah i get it sarcasm look it's not that easy to go against the crowd sure i know people are scared of pilgrims sometimes but [ __ ] you survived outside the walls it had to be some i wonder what the hell is going some say that on are about to attack no need to be shy [Music] he was a pk commander what do you think what if there's nothing to it and this is just some random killing a little what do you want the worst thing was they took all the equipment can you hear yourself at way to fix this all respectful you can fix it by figuring out how you're gonna pay me back and quick then you wonder where all the guns went right looking at all the dead people that says here they're missing same difference they never find them anyway yeah then why the board it's been 15 years many people disappeared back then my neighbor lost his two kids but life goes on except nobody has the courage to take those photographs down but it's hopeless since there are no night runners the search always ends the same those night runners tell me about them what's there to say nearly all of them are dead when they were around they were the only ones not afraid to go out at night they rescued those who didn't manage to get to a shelter but of the entire group only a few survived including frank their former commander once upon a time he was great now he drinks himself into a stupor at his place in the central loop hard to see how much longer he'll be around when did all this happen a long time ago looking at you you are still a kid yourself once upon a time i came across two of them two girls they were five or six years old and it looked like they hadn't eaten for a month what were their names i don't remember i threw them some old bread and took off because they were shaking as if they were about to turn red eyes swollen veins i don't know what they were giving them there those psychos from the gre where are all these kids at now after all those years most of them are probably dead if someone got luckier and is still wandering around they will probably be in the central loop more peacekeepers there easier to survive someone must know more why the past is the past and there's no point in dredging it back up everyone has their own problems here and now pilgrim everyone fights for themselves [Music] water runs out we're all gonna be [ __ ] [Music] yeah the guy you almost got hanged why worry you're standing here aren't you excuse me look we had no choice if you had turned like we thought you were gonna it would have been a massacre a crowd of people against one infected odds were in your favor huh i see you already got a marker more time you spend here more you'll understand our rules are strict but that's how we survive sure i haven't seen my kids in months because of this ridiculous blockade at the center gotta kick as a finisher tomorrow someone's gotta take my hand says viral spit cures pimples i'd rather play fc granules how do i start those would be less complicated think you'll make it to next season i'll be fine you know sometimes i wonder what we did wrong have you seen a gingerbread i'm not doing that much better everything all right no it's grilled the goat is grilled i'm such an idiot what happened i must have over calculated the voltage see he's useless i'm sorry i don't know how i could get it so wrong i told you would be a waste of time why i don't think so this is very very that it has big huge you're saying it has potential potential yes it could be an effective weapon a weapon it's a ready formula if you just use it on a weapon it could raise your odds against turned creatures the brave goat gave its life to science there's dinner for everyone and you i take you as uh and pronounce you uh uh a ah craft master really oh my gosh thank you thank you we'll talk later come vincenzo i can't thank you enough here take this if it's not strong enough come around to my craftmaster workshop sure thanks just uh watch yourself out there okay no worries friend months because of this ridiculous blockade of the center [Music] not too bad [Music] hey kid you know some old world folks recorded audio time capsules when they realized the [ __ ] was gonna hit the fan gotta look inside buildings to find them though [Music] hey there rehearsing for the big night where did you come from handsome i heard you uh singing don't lie to lola sweet cheeks bet you thought someone was strangling a cat not at all i i see this nick you shouldn't be able to usually it's wrapped in the softest most rare of mink stoles lola was the grand dame of the bizarre but until reunited with her beloved mink stole she is unfit to perform but how will lola dazzle anyone without her beloved mink stole without it i can't hit the high notes then you don't see minks scampering about everywhere do you oh where is it earlier a strong gust of wind ripped it from lola's tender throat and carried it away i saw it flapping from the scaffolding near the gre quarantine at the intersection of market and horseshoe lola is powerless to retrieve it well i could would you lola could return to the bazaar to entertain not frighten children like a lurking screamer well we can't have that no indeed thank you my knight and shining whatever it is that you're wearing i shall await you at the bazaar hurry my fans await aydah how's it been kid cause it tastes for city life yet i've been here and there you know the best part is always happening in the center and that's where we're going i have a plan for how to get there i'll tell you everything on the spot meet me on the roof near the main metro station saute the the mushrooms [Music] to deal with [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you [Music] [Music] it's nice to have a safe spot in the middle of this chaos [Applause] it tells me that they're lying let's try again later i told you the time [Music] inhibitor container nearby uh [Music] inhibit our container um [Applause] [Music] sometimes i venture out at street level just to look at the shocks and signs from before the fall i don't know why i can't you're a better climber than one crazy girl i used to know she was something she even wanted to climb the tallest building in the city the vnc tower was she one of your wives almost too hot tempered even for my tastes what about this passage to the center right look from this roof you can clearly see the peacekeeper's base so the pk run the city they sure think they do that's what they need the uniforms and ranks for they tattoo them they're [ __ ] obsessed with hierarchy but they don't control the city at least not all of it who controls the rest the colonel the renegades well you won't meet them here for now you brought me here to take a look at the peacekeepers the pk are your ticket to the center i told you the only way to get there is through the metro tunnels i'll go inside and draw their attention away from the platform then you enter the metro technical station there's an airlock there we'll take it together to the central loop we can't just ask them to let me through no chance right now each new face they see belongs to a suspect in their commander's murder they know me i trade with them sometimes i deliver lamps from the girls or goods from dark zones there might be a few infected there nothing a pilgrim can't handle though when you get to the main station let me know now you better get some sleep you'll head out at night when there's less infected in the tunnels [Music] um extremely fast probably a bolter you can find some interesting stuff on them but catching one requires serious hunting skills now is not the best time for this aiden head for the tunnels [Music] series protect our crops from the winter cold you heard people say the night brothers are back [Music] don't you have things to do move along please [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh yeah uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] uh hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i'm in the tunnel okay now watch out for the infected there might be a few or a few dozen i'm already in the pk base i'll throw a uv flare through the vent and you'll see how to get to the main station [Music] um [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i uh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] uh [Music] i got to the flare look around the technical tunnel to the main station should be well-lit i've already lured the guards upstairs i'll chat them up while you get inside oh [ __ ] back on yes [Music] [Applause] hmm [Music] um [Music] more wait [Music] back think about it and i'll be right back i'm on the platform open the airlock i'll be there only second [Music] hey what are you doing here where did he come from he was wandering through the tunnels [ __ ] bizarre riffraff more like a renegade spy doesn't look like a renegade uh he's awake what were you doing at our base i'm only trying to get to the city center the center the tunnel is going to be closed until you hand over lucas's killers bizarre scum how is it that you lost all nothing heard nothing and you managed to forget about the ban on passage maybe we'll start punishing you by cutting off your hands that would improve your memory huh what were you doing four days ago i'm a pilgrim four days ago i was a hundred kilometers away enough anderson we need the truth and you won't get it through coercion but commander lucas is dead now i'm in command you've read the reports a pilgrim appeared in the bazaar yesterday looks like he's not lying leave her sergeant i want to talk to him alone [Music] where did you come from from crossdale river that's over 1500 kilometers from here it's actually more than 2 000. the freeway bridge is collapsed there are no straight paths and you've managed to make it so far away impressive what's it like out there these days [Music] when was the last time you were out of the city about 15 years ago and then there are that many fewer survivors and that many more infected stands to reason most people endure living in this hell hole because what's out there has got to be so much worse my wife and i lived in england i had two sisters two brothers haven't heard from them for 10 years where did they live in and around london from what i've been told london doesn't exist there may be four settlements left on the entire island [ __ ] hell why would anyone think i killed your commander you tried to escape to the central loop four days after the murder besides if i were carl i'd hire a stranger to kill lucas too the cleanest way well i don't know who carl is oh you'll find out soon enough carl keeps both hands on the steering wheel he's a faux sanctimonious prick who's turning the entire bazaar against us even though we protect them [Music] what's it like outside the walls and you never know where danger's gonna come from always new territories new threats and you came here to take shelter i came here because i'm looking for someone and a lot of people are said to have survived in velador you're looking for someone hmm maybe i can help you but not for free i'm used to trading what do you need no nonsense that's good the tunnel will be closed until i find our commander's murderer commander lucas his body was found in the bazaar horribly mutilated the people of the bazaar aren't making this easy they're proud and loyal they refuse to turn anyone in but command has lost its patience i have orders from the top pilgrim if the inhabitants of old villadore continue to revolt our army will come here and burn the bazaar to the ground now i'd rather avoid that and what do you need from me lucas had a weapon a rare set of brass knuckles called the lazarus this is the key to finding the killer if you learn anything about the lazarus tell me and i will most certainly return the favor it's worth a lot and we didn't find it on his body i think someone from the bazaar may have appropriated it and why should i work with you you attacked me and accused me of murder with no proof whatsoever our mistake you're clearly not the murderer why can't you investigate on your own i hardly know anyone here that's exactly why you can help me nobody will talk to us to them we're occupiers the fact that we clear the streets of the infected and catch criminals doesn't matter what matters is that we eat their food and drink their water but you you're a pilgrim there are many ways you can help people and you're from the outside they can trust you they tried to kill me no look we are your only chance if you want to get to the center that is [Music] [Music] so if i find that weapon you'll let me through to the center it's not that easy vilador suffered much first it was isolated from the outside world because of infection then the walls became its salvation but people here learned not to trust easily i won't open the passage until i've caught the killer but if you can find the lazarus i'll remember that you'll be the first one through once justice is done sounds as if i have no other choice i'll try look around ask people and don't come back empty-handed good luck i'm a carrier a carrier what's that i belong to the carrier's guild i'm one of many if there's so many of you why haven't i seen your uniform before we're discreet we're entrusted with valuable information and therefore keep a low profile now your profile isn't so low right now indeed our headquarters are located in the center and the only passage right now goes through the subway tunnels the peacekeepers control the passage and aren't letting anyone in or out of the center right now until they do i'm stranded that sucks especially since i'm in need of some information i can't help you we have a strict code of confidentiality only our guildmaster would be authorized to share information and then he's the one i should talk to any other ways i can get into the center not that i'm aware of on the surface the border of the center is a no man's land it was devastated in a chemical attack cutting this district off from the center the air and ground are poison only the most freakish of monsters can survive there damn well i'll have to find a way somehow good luck hey heck on are you there hey then buddy it's good you're alive yeah i got caught and questioned good i didn't kill you meet me outside these are peacekeeper premises [Music] do you have alcohol if you're lucky like me found this bottle in a basement while on patrol i say you got patrols covering the whole area someone's got to do it city's got us to think that it's even still standing what you want to join us i need to do complete the training hard as [ __ ] not everyone can hack it don't need weak links you know there's something in the air hey man where could i get some food in the canteen we have a canteen and a hospital at our base like in the army not like in the army this is the army we're bringing order to this [ __ ] chaos and who are you no one in particular doesn't matter it always matters i'm someone other than i was a [ __ ] philosopher go to carl he likes that kind of [ __ ] [Music] you must help us otherwise there will be a rebellion help us in the investigation we'll help you with the bandits i told you already nobody in the bazaar had anything to do with lucas's death then why won't you let us search your homes huh if everyone is so innocent then there'd be nothing to hide keep your fruits away from our homes anderson so you're hiding someone time is running out carl you don't hand over the killer we'll raise your precious bazaar to the ground sow the wind and reap the whirlwind anderson don't bite off more than you can chew old man hayden come on i'm on the roof next to the metro so come on tell me all about it [Music] so what did they want from you if you've been there like you said you'd be i'm oh oh i did my best i didn't know there was anyone else in the tunnel lucas's death is a big deal they love this [ __ ] like a father atro doesn't have lucas's charisma he's gonna have problems ater said he might let me through to the center if i help him what what are you supposed to help him with he wants me to find lucas's weapon the lazarus went missing from the crime scene he believes finding it will help find the killer the lazarus huh fancy set of brass knuckles right i know a guy who trades stolen goods and other [ __ ] he gets from thieves offense part-time fence full-time scammer and heartless one too he's got half the city after him for death right now if anyone in villadore is full enough to buy a peacekeeper weapon it would be him what's his name hubert kabazos also known as half-ass huby every day he sets up shop in the nearby windmill and waits for customers probably selling booze and weed to the pks if you want to find the lazarus talk with hubie i'll chase down some other leads okay let's keep in touch [Music] [Music] um [Music] hey thank you uh um [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] oh you hubert no not me i'm waiting for hubie too so get in line got it you know when i'll be here maybe in an hour maybe two you never know with old half-assed that said he's got the best moonshine so worth the wait um nothing to do but wait i guess hey you hubert who's asking a customer want to buy something hey you're that stranger they wanted to hang aren't you hey hubie you got a special customer step pilgrim from the bazaar wait i just want to buy something so that was huby wasn't it yep apparently had an urgent appointment with another customer yeah sure uh he's running away nah sounds like you be oh what do you think i see him running to the northeast [Music] faster aiden you almost got him [Music] don't like to look at that [Music] he's get there can you hack it take him down you [ __ ] come get something done [Music] [Music] [ __ ] yeah

anything about what i haven't asked you anything yet i don't know anything about anything i swear i'm told that you're a fence hmm offense no way reseller maybe but i'm looking for the lazarus yeah i used to belong to lucas the late pk commander don't try to tell me you don't know who lucas is well then i won't know anything about the lazarus are you kidding me even if i'd been offered those brass knuckles i would have refused i'm not an idiot that weapon is way too hot why did you run away from me because every five minutes someone's coming after me man okay i may have given people a reason to be mad but i'll make things right soon eventually maybe how did you know that lazarus is a set of brass knuckles hmm i didn't say that come on everyone knew about lucas's little love glove he was always showing it off if anyone thought i had him they might also think i killed lucas which is [ __ ] but someone tried to sell it to you right i told you i okay fine maybe someone did but i can't say who client confidentiality stop [ __ ] around tell me or her name is maya i met her in the tenement building at meet packing square near the old butcher shop but i don't know anything else leave

hand that brass hoosie what's it over are you nuts the whoosie what's-it's real name is the lazarus and it belonged to an important pk we might have a war if i don't return it you could help us find a murderer okay i'll give you this stupid thing but for 500 that's a lot of money kid of course it is life's damn expensive i have to buy water and a marker for my brother he's turning 12 soon you know

had drills with them oh the pilgrim has returned i hope not empty-handed i found the lazarus i'll be damned i was right that you could open doors we couldn't where's the [ __ ] fuckeroo adam in meat packing square you didn't let him go did you that could have been the murderer uh a girl had him she's 10 or something she didn't kill him just looted the corpse stop we'll get back to this later leave us [Music] looks like a constellation on your arm those are ranked tattoos when we ran low on resources tattoos eventually replaced medals they show our hierarchy like in prison prison or military is all the same there's always a packing order [Music] i did what you wanted it's your turn get me to the center opening the tunnel to the central loop is beyond my pay grade pilgrim command wants me to find the killer haters you promised cool down pilgrim i keep my promises first take this token of gratitude ater i have to get to the center get it you're looking for someone right i want to go to the central loop too my wife and kids are there and i can't protect them when i'm stuck here the tunnel will open when i find the killer is that clear you can help me or you can wait until i find him myself i see traces of blood on the lazarus's blades lucas managed to wound his killer before he died bastard's got to have a nasty gash if you find him you'll not only help me you'll be helping yourself okay do you have any suspects the commander was murdered in the bazaar there had to be someone from there [Music] the people of the bazaar are simple folk why would they risk defying you and that's why i want to discover the truth before the orders come down to use force besides appearances can be deceiving they want to get rid of us they think anarchy is the key to building a new world well there is plenty of anarchy these days carl is a faux pious hustler who brainwashes others with slick speeches he says everyone's equal but it's [ __ ] you can't be a leader and an equal at the same time i'll try to find lucas's killer splendid that's your ticket to the center head back to the bazaar is there anything else i should know before i go yes as a matter of fact but this is totally hush-hush word of this cannot get out sounds serious whoever killed lucas took a little trophy carved his tattoo right out of his bloody arm they cut into his corpse that is seriously [ __ ] up yeah seriously men found out lucas was desecrated like that they'd lose their [ __ ] and it would be total war i'm telling you this because if you find that little trophy then you've found the sick [ __ ] who killed lucas got it i'll head out right now you found a lead i didn't get a knife worried about me are you of course i have high hopes for you aiden meet me outside hey hater got a minute you telling me you've already figured out who the murderer is not yet but i have other questions just be quick about it do you know anything about a man named walt a long time ago when i was a soldier patrolling the streets of the central loop i ran into a renegade squad i was alone scared but i stood my ground they almost killed me but their leader stepped in told him to stop he looked me in the eye and he said why is such a brave soldier on matt's leash and not mine when you wise up come to williams's stronghold he gathered his squad and then they were gone it wasn't until later that i found out it might have been waltz he wanted to recruit me you mentioned you wanted to go back to the central loop because of your family yeah they're everything to me you know since lucas's case got stuck i've been wondering is it possible that my obsession with getting promoted taking more missions that i neglected my family ah never mind almost everyone under my command has someone in the central loop everyone wants to go back there was commander lucas a good leader too good sometimes i even wish he wasn't so competent what do you mean you know he's a tough act to follow you might have heard that not all of my men value me but once we find the body everything will change i'll regain their trust we gotta start rationing the water should have done this weeks ago summed him up right there i think imagine peter wants me to find lucas's murderer only then will he help me get to the center not doing his dirty work well that's no surprise he told me to start with the bizarre figures pk and the bazaar really hate each other only two people matter at the bazaar one is that overblown preacher carl i know that who else is there sophie his right hand she has a way with the bazaar's more rebellious souls helps him keep control there's also dodger a local gangster he knows what's going on and about the bandits led by joe but they're afraid of the pk okay i'll talk to sophie and you look into carl unless you prefer the girl sophie she's not really my type you know and headstrong she's you'll see um [Music] [Music] you got a problem a problem pilgrim you got to help me i'm in deep [ __ ] real [ __ ] deep if you don't help me that bald thug my uncle will beat me and he's got hands like cast iron frying pans the last time he hit me i had a lump on my forehead as big as a horn like some [ __ ] rhino and it came in rainbow colors too the horn i mean now based on your colorful description sounds like you enjoy it it'll be fine later you got a problem a problem if you act what did you do to make your uncle angry this time nothing yet but i will in a moment like any normal person i took a nap and then boom i was asleep like a frog in a swamp in winter the worst part is that the sausage is on the verge of rotting in this day and age throwing away good food is a crime okay nearly good food buddy won't give you the shits quite yet if it's eaten in the next hour everyone will be fine okay maybe one of them will run to the bathroom better than starving after all knowing his [ __ ] so much they stop being hungry right but in three hours everyone's asses will explode like [ __ ] geezers then comes the puking my uncle would just [ __ ] kill me and the rest will feed my corpse to the infected i'd hurry this food over to them myself but i still have to prepare the smoker this stuff doesn't make it well you know what will happen show me where to go jesus you can't even imagine how important this is to me just grab the food rations on the table and hurry up to deliver them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] inhibitor container detected [Music] oh you are awesome i know you made it in time too i met one guy who ate a sausage sandwich and he was fine he even called it tasty awesome thank you thank you thank you got some spare time because if you do cause i got another sausage run to prevent the runs and you you already know where to go this isn't an urgent race like the last one but in this weather you have to be careful with food the faster it lands in someone's stomach the better for everyone step straight ahead then 16 more steps turn [Music] are you okay there oh damn it you made me lose count once more the bag's there 13 steps from the entrance 27 wait uh two infected ran in at that point damn it i'll never find it again find what my father's cd the future of mankind depends on it the future of mankind that's what my father says stellenborg a professor of cosmology here at the university heard of him he wrote a famous paper the cosmology of virology some next level thinking so what's on the cd no idea my father left it in a backpack a bag i don't know i haven't checked everything i was 13 paces from the apartment when two infected burst in no wait three do you want me to help you would you because i i couldn't even i mean i could try but three infected is too many they'd kill me yeah probably right so here's the deal the cd is in my father's bag or a backpack and the bag or backpack is in our apartment at 116 bell tower road that's west off of horseshoe close to meat packing square and remember the fate of the human race may rest on you retrieving that cd father will pay you of course when you bring him the cd he'll be waiting outside the church i got it oh and here's a tip wait till dusk that's when they leave they're packed in there during the day five in the hall then two up the stairs no three um [Music] don't remember i need first date uh uh wow right ugh [Applause] [Applause] oh [Music] good [Applause] hmm [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] whatever's on you better be worth it [Music] so so yes [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] oh you're always so negative about things naira because you don't understand uh the essence of survival what are you talking about want to find out just close your eyes what do you perceive well um i hear noises yeah what else oh something stinks exactly the smell impulses going straight from the senses to the limbic system triggering an emotional response memories the well-being of the mind but that smells like well that smells like [ __ ] what did you expect what do you think people use as fertilizers around here too much information sorry so who are you and what are you doing here before the fall i used to work in a fragrance manufacturing company i consider myself lucky to have been professionally active within the only century when the world actually smelled nice now it's back to normal so i asked myself how could i change that what scent would make people the most happy in this miserable world i sure hope you don't mean smelling like [ __ ] is the essence of survival of course not i have this really exciting idea for a new fragrance people are gonna pay a fortune for just a whiff i called it turn me on and it's almost finished i just need some scraps for the heart note uh heart note hmm the middle note of the perfume metal scraps and lavender that's all i'm missing of course metal scraps and lavender the obvious blend naira goes out of her way to be controversial if you bring me some i'll tell you everything about my secret formula laura said she needs lavender for her perfume too now that makes more sense metal scraps naira wants him uh i hope this isn't some wild goose chase making perfume out of metal sounds absurd don't just stand there help me i thought i was gonna die alone here thank you [Music] foreign keeping us prisoners in our own homes get inside aiden don't stay out at night that's when the monsters come out hmm [Music] [Applause] hey who the [ __ ] are you easy chief he ain't pk how do you know they're creeping around here all the time he's that outsider the pilgrim what he's from outside the walls well [ __ ] me i don't know what brings you here but watch your back pilgrim and stay away from the pks they ain't no one's friends time with a biomarker carl said if you show up to bring your own so he can introduce himself what a nice change from wanting to hang me and remember humanity created a civilization that turned out to be a colossus on clay legs we cannot make the same mistakes he didn't want to he had to you were a threat to everyone of course do not listen to the ideologies preached by fools calling for reconstruction there will be no rebuilding [Music] who would have thought the pilgrim in the bazaar welcome yeah i'm still alive despite your best efforts it's clear to me you're holding a grudge but if you were in my shoes you would understand we are responsible for the safety of our community and we treat this seriously that's why we did what we did i hope you can forgive us so pray tell what's it like in the outside world these days bad and getting worse settlements are shrinking in size and number i'm afraid soon there will be nowhere else to go doesn't surprise me son humanity must reach the bottom in order to rise again and this is why we are here any more news not really but uh why don't you tell me more about your people we are called the people of the bazaar simply because of where we live but who we are truly are free people free from lies free from money free from religion wars politics and the dark cloud that has blanketed the earth that sounds great too good to be true in fact oh we have our challenges water is scarce for example but with courage and patience we will someday create a paradise well you seem almost thankful for the collapse of civilization it was as tragic as it was inevitable consumerism belief in the almighty dollar led to this catastrophe so we here strive not to make the same mistake twice it would be a crime we want to create a new order based on social bonds on family and community a society where people support each other and adhere to justice no need for the police military or false authorities to shoot those they are meant to protect we have a place for everyone but let's get back to your stories [Music] is gossip all you want from me carl no but you came from outside and you're walking around my flock so to set things straight i need to know if you're a sheep or a wolf what are you then i'm not really a fan of this metaphor oh yes i see pilgrims are not people of metaphors or poetry they prefer to act yeah about acting i'm looking for sophie are you and why pray tell [Music] that's my business not one year on my turf pilgrim but fine i'll humor you your business whatever it may be is not a threat to us after all you're just one man and we are many go that way you'll see a giant of a man that's herman sophie's bodyguard she won't be far and i really hope your business doesn't make herman angry farewell my friend [Music] so [Music] sophie can we talk don't hurt him let him talk you're that pilgrim that came to town recently you're sure well-informed don't have much of a choice i'm in charge of safety here besides yesterday you made quite an entrance i'm looking for a job would you happen to know of any looking for a job i only work with people i trust you came from outside they wanted to hang you nobody says anything good about you pilgrim do you want me to trust you talk to the people at the bazaar see if you can gain their trust if so then it might persuade me to change my mind [Applause] [Music] find something you like in the bazaar [Music] sweet weapon you got there aiden is it new stone that depends what do you want your son sent me you've got the cd yeah and your son's doing good if you were wondering thank you for the disc what's all this about the cd containing the fate of mankind if it may be frank this may very well be mankind's only salvation people burn books to keep themselves warm at night they use oil canvases to patch holes in roofs and in gothic cathedrals they sell tomatoes they don't understand that no man lasts forever contrary to art that's it do you hear and now this transition quite so aidan this is sophie let's talk now [Music] [Music] i wonder what the hell is going on in the central loop since pk's restricted access some say the renegade sophie you wanted to see me i've been hearing about you good or bad things useful things the ones that make me believe it's worth giving you a chance what are you proposing go to one of the craft masters alberto or vincenzo both know the location of the purest crystals i need a few for a certain transaction a certain transaction hmm anything i need to know about curiosity is the first step on the road to hell carl says do you believe that i believe in not trusting strangers and that's who you are so far at least bring me the location of the crystals first and we'll see where we go from there [Music] those crystals what's the deal with them they were created by the chemical bombings of a city a byproduct of some sort people believe the infection spread slower if you wear them honestly i don't think it does but there's no harm in trying and that's why they're so important to you guys that and many other reasons they're hard to get difficult to destroy and easy to get obsessed with because they're so pretty right but most importantly they're real tangible things way more real than a piece of paper and old money that's why they're so bloody expensive alberto and vincenzo tell me more about them a father and son duo alberto the father tends to yammer on before zero hour he had a workshop and piles of cash manchenzo his son is kind of shy they're both craftsmen clever too the kind that can make a watch out old gum and a piece of string you said you were in charge of safety at the bazaar what does that mean exactly it means any pk who threatens our community of free people can count on me breaking his skull from the way carl talked he sounded more like pacifists we're trying to overturn the old ways and usher in a new era for humanity it's a true revolution and every revolution needs two things to succeed ideology and an armed faction to enforce it fine i'll go talk to one of those craft masters they're in the bazaar do well and we can think about giving you bigger jobs hey you yeah you that's looking for work by any chance you look anxious look urban your nosy friends back down the job no luck yet it's not about luck kid but about character like yours hmm ballsy okay then what does your hungry soul crave [Music] someone like you must know a lot out of modesty i won't deny it and maybe a little bird told you what might have happened to lucas you know i heard the pilgrim has come to the city very nosy grills people about stuff gets in the way sounds a lot like you we can't be a coincidence sure can and don't believe in them now you know anything about lucas or not well that kind of information is expensive you can't afford it i could work for it you got any work i could do leave your cv with my secretary and we'll get back to you come on don't [ __ ] with me i'm serious you barge in here like you own the place takes coconut-sized balls [Music] that's my kind of man or should i say pilgrim okay i might have a small errand for a tough guy like you take care of it and we'll see whether you're worth knowing what do you need minor thing need you to check in on a guy who's late delivering my order been in communication for a few days now might be trying to avoid me he usually doesn't keep me waiting no one does who's the guy hubert half-assed humie we call him i met him he lives up to his nickname need you to find out what's up with him this time okay i'll come back after i've spoken to him he lives in the tallest building on the edge of trinity court opposite the bazaar horseshoe you can't miss it but getting to him is another story [Music] why hubert's not just a fence he makes money where he can and now he's hiding from half the city he's super paranoid lives like a rat in a maze to keep himself safe you'll need to climb up and find one of his secret passages to get in i can handle it when you're there give him the password sayonara so he knows i sent you garen hopefully i'm looking for work i'm sorry harvest is already in all milled and ready to go i see thanks anyway wait take this a little sweetness for the surprise [Music] wow do you often give away honey and backhanded compliments like that honey and wisdom both my gifts to you so much darkness in the world why not brighten it with a smile might open more doors for you mom don't you know who that is he's a pilgrim he's no criminal benny look at him in his eyes you see what i see we must judge people with our own hearts and eyes and not based on rumor or innuendo thanks apparently you can't go from the top either haters keeping us prisoners in our own home i'm damien aidan you're new here right [Music] does it make a difference i pride myself on knowing everyone in this dump but i don't know you maybe that's because i just got into the city for reals wow respect i heard that outside the walls it's a bloodbath what does this have to do with the job nothing my friend just sussing you out and i like what i've sussed so far but about the job first and foremost it'll require a certain amount of discretion on your part you'll be doing business for my partners and it's their business only no one else's head on over to meet them in west quarry and they'll fill you in on the details understood i'll go report to them don't keep them waiting seriously there's no time for delay i wonder what the hell is going on in the central yes a workshop so where is it you're not in one now alberto no need to be shy [Music] sophie sent me she says you know where they can find some crystals [Music] awful fox they've already sent one of their [ __ ] who that fellow sophie's brother ah what was the asshole's name barney the asshole's name is barney and he asked the same question about a dark zone with crystals yeah that's news to me so where is that dark zone it's a hundred a hundred and twenty uh a hundred and that can i tell him oh please a hundred meters from the metro there's a big sign fashion store and a windmill on the other side of the street thanks i craft then carry only the finest [Music] thank you and come again [Music] don't look at me like that i'm just giving you information and just between them well what did you find i know the location but i always told your brother asked about it already herman see if barney turned on his radio [Applause] [Music] barney answer me barney damn so that's why he's gone offline he's looking for the crystals on his own and throwing a wrench in the works yet again this isn't the first time i gather no he's always trying to prove himself last time he got wounded wasn't that long ago either a [ __ ] kid i'll kill him i'll just kill him [Music] why blame yourself we all make our own beds listen you said it yourself you're new here so you don't know much i'm responsible for security here and he's my brother i promised i'd look after him he promised promised who never mind i'll kick barney's ass when he gets back how'd barney get wounded he didn't want to tell me my guess is that the pk's got a hold of him your brother keeps secrets from you that's none of your business [Music] barney answer me damn it all to hell if he went to a dark zone in his condition he's a connor i can try to track him down you i've been in the dark zone before the gre hospital st joseph hospital really if you save him you won't regret it go at once you have to find him before dawn i'll do my best [Music] um [Music] [Music] they surprised me [Music] [Music] hater i'm listening that's aidan i've just been offered

help me man did you save my bacon thanks take this uh if i were him i'd clear out before he pisses people off things are better for us now right depends doesn't it veronica the guy was a prick the pk were a pain in the ass with him in charge conclusion's pretty straightforward lucas is gone things are better for us amen it'd be better if you just shut up barney where's sophie you again what are you doing spying on me you got something to hide you were talking about the pk commander weren't you look at mr nosey here watch where you stick that nose pilgrim or you'll lose it that [ __ ] would lucas deserve to die that's the truth barney the truth is this you're an idiot and the peacekeepers protect us protect from what who took over our windmill the peacekeepers who took over the metro [ __ ] lucas so they should get the [ __ ] out before they all end up like their mother [ __ ] commander you were supposed to wait for me suppose schmoes plans changed afraid i was after your crystals huh afraid of you give me a break we've got our own interest to look after pilgrim and they're none of your business to your men died for your interests you used birdie to distract me get it you don't know [ __ ] about me my people jackass birdie was like a brother to me for some reason my sister wants to see you so go bother her [Music] they used to be family we must negotiate you don't negotiate with extortionists you're nothing like your mother besides i'm in charge here prepare your men and we're giving joe those goddamn crystals [ __ ] coward i know what you think but we have to listen to him herman that's for the bizarre only for the bizarre sophie relax herman he saved barney remember interesting guy your little brother you two didn't get along i take it let's just say it wasn't love at first sight barney has his downsides but on the upside he is unshakably loyal and with so many problems plaguing old vilidor i just need people i can trust what are your problems you're the curious sort aren't you aiden just ask what do you want to know why did barney bail on me crystals are valuable we needed them for a transaction and now you'll be able to help like i did with barney and birdie it didn't feel like much of a help barney was in shock when he heard about birdie that's why he bailed on you he he wants what's best for the bizarre aiden he thinks he'll protect us all he's really just a kid he was just a teenager when our mother died but even earlier when he was little we were always on our own now he's an adult and he doesn't need anyone but he hurts himself the more he tries to help others [Music] it seems after the commander was murdered things got complicated between you and the peacekeepers oh that's an understatement to be more precise our situation got [ __ ] up but lucas he deserved to die since the plague nothing has hurt the locals like him it was on his order that the peacekeepers seized our windmill to support themselves they take a large part of our crops and water in return for what protection i can protect my people myself i started learning that when i was a kid that spat with carl what was that about let's just say the pk commander's death only made our problems worse look around aiden what do you see something people outside the walls could only dream of all these people will be dead by the end of the month why because in short order our water supplies will run dry two weeks ago a local thug named joe and his pal jack took over the only water tower in the area with their gang not long ago they lived in the bazaar but carl threw them out for pulling scams and now they're taking their revenge they mind the tower and they're threatening to blow it up if they don't get a weekly tribute in the form of medicines food and crystals [Music] and all these people don't they know anything not how low the water reserves have gotten i was gonna handle it but carl was afraid of causing a panic instead he went to the pk for help of course he came back empty-handed they're only here to help themselves certainly not us they could care less that joe took the tower and demanded protection money my mother used to say never bargained with extortionists when she was still in charge here so before carl took power you she led the bazaar with an iron fist and carl listened to her after her death he became full of himself and he got cocky didn't your mother want you to succeed her i know what she wanted for her people community and freedom that's what she always said but don't ask me what she wanted for me i don't know if i even existed for her at all she was a great leader but a shitty mom what are you gonna do what i have to do i promise to help carl so while he's in charge we're gonna pay off jack and joe and they're gonna keep squeezing more and more out of us and so on and so on the most important thing is for my people to be safe you've proven that you can be trusted i want to ask you for help carl believes joe will live up to his side of the bargain and that he'll give us access to water but i'm skeptical i have to send people to negotiate with bandits and i don't want any surprises carl and our people have already set out for the spot where the deal will go down make sure everything goes smoothly i should guard them yes from a discreet distance [Music] you there sophie we're under attack what susie what's going on it was a trap run [ __ ] susie ralph ayden hurry they've got all the crystals everything we have [Music] [Music] inhibitor container detected [Music] [Music] i see bandits a lot of bodies sophie i'm sorry i knew it i knew those [ __ ] would betray us [ __ ] the maiden kill them all we gotta what are you gonna do now [ __ ] i made it there are no survivors [ __ ] animals find the crystals susie carl they took carl what where to their camp we must susie susie where are the crystals susie sophie i found susie she's dead i can't believe it first birdie now her damn damn damn there's nothing you could have done no except that i sent them there joe's men have kidnapped carl and i don't see these crystals [ __ ] oh [ __ ] [ __ ] maybe the crystals are still there come uh [Music] [ __ ] you okay sophie everything's been taken before you got there everything has gone wrong all right enough of this playing defense let's meet by jack and joe's camp on the roof by the overpass we're gonna go after carl and or crystals jack and joe will pay for this [ __ ] show [Music] hayden how's it going you're alive man [ __ ] i'm getting sentimental i haven't said that to anyone since my third divorce i appreciate it but don't get your hopes up not the marian kind learn anything about the commander's murder i heard sophie's brother mention something about lucas's death that's all so far now they have a bigger problem the bandits you mentioned they took carl hostage oh [ __ ] yeah exactly i'm helping sophie get him back gain her trust that might also help us find out what they know yeah just into the center i've got you now can you hack [Music] what the hell's going on here oh [Music] hmm [Music] yes yes yes here the together house ah [Music] so wow [Applause] [Music] you can't be serious can you hack it [Music] [Music] [Music] idiot how are you gonna get out of this what's going on i'm playing princess in the tower can't you see what do you think's going on here i'm trapped in my apartment by my brother no less luckily i was able to get out to the balcony you want to play prince and help me out yeah sure why not sounds like fun no wait my wonderful team will set me free he just needs to know that my brother has locked me in here and won't let me go can you let him know i need to be rescued and where can i find this wonderful timor well tonight timor my brother lowen and a group of survivors are supposed to clear out the uh the infected from the condo building north of here on richmond crescent it'll be our new home and it will be one day i tried to reach timor on his radio but can't please tell him to contact me he loves me you know he'll free me and we'll be together despite my brother's disapproval very well wait here till night falls [Music] [Music] inhibitor container detected [Applause] [Music] uh inhibitor container protected [Music] so ah hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] foreign wait get away from there i said stay back calm down are you two more no loin why are you asking about ah my sister sent you well it's too late too late for what teamwork's changing they've all changed [Music] does this have anything to do with why you trapped your sister in her apartment what did you do lauren it was a massacre biters were everywhere i'm the only one who survived so what are you still doing here i was going to tell her but instead i locked her up and returned here to clean up this mess i wanted to i didn't want her to know till i took care of this till i knew what to say she's an adult lauren do you have a sister no i i mean it's complicated then you must understand i i have to protect her aiden are you there have you reached the condos [Applause] you can't tell her aiden it has to be me he's not here what do you mean are you in the right building yes but there's nothing here but infected then why would you lock me up why would my brother keep me from my timor sounds like the two of you need to talk he sure has plenty of talking to do treating me like this it's [ __ ] and let me tell you as fairy tale princess go you really suck i'll go back to her hopefully i'll figure out what to say by then thank you [Music] [Music] hey herman where's sophie hey why are you on the mission friends could have used you okay i guess that means i should wait here [Music] hmm so [Music] mia [Music] here mia [Music] aiden what's the matter with you mia where are you [Music] no [Music] jack and [ __ ] joe will pay for what they did i had a bad feeling about it from the start i had a feeling carl's plan sucked and yet i let him lead [Music] don't beat yourself up things could have been worse too if i had listened to myself we'd have water and more of our people would still be alive you were just doing your job you were following carl's lead yeah but i won't let him lead the bazaar to its doom i see why didn't you send herman on the mission they wouldn't have stood a chance against that beast him he's strong but as helpless as a child it's one damn big child you don't understand herman's almost deaf he used to be my mother's bodyguard has been around us as long as i can remember and after she died he stayed close to us one time the lights in my shelter went out in fact infected broke through a window hermann blocked the path and tossed a grenade into a nearby infected he survived the explosion but lost his hearing in a face-to-face battle he's nearly unbeatable but if he's caught from behind he's as vulnerable as a child a killer combination especially for him that's why i prefer to keep an eye on him sometimes i wonder if he's watching over me or i'm watching over him you think jack and joe could have had something to do with lucas's murder joe perhaps he's a total psycho and a thief he knew the peacekeepers would hang him if they caught him but jack wouldn't let him he's a coward he thinks rationally [Music] from now on i'm following my gut last time something like this happens on my watch if you'd hurried back there maybe some of our guys would have made it i thought a pilgrim like you was supposed to run like a [ __ ] gazelle barney shut up what if he'd have made it in time to help we'd be having a party not awake in case you change your mind he can be a real pain in the ass but we'll do something good for the city one day [Music] birdie to your health [Music] i gather you were close with birdie he tried to be a poet kept showing me his work and said all the other guys were too stupid to understand i never told him how bad it was he was a good kid i took him into the group when he lost his father in a dark zone he was 10 years old that's pretty young too young but he had no one else so i took him in [Music] if you managed to take out those bandits it jack [ __ ] and joe [ __ ] you think killing monsieur's [ __ ] and kant will change something death usually changes a lot in a person's life carl was wrong we should have gone after them right away but right or wrong we have to help him he's one of us we'll rescue him and retrieve the crystals from jack and joe besides i won't let them get away with killing my people ralph suzie logan birdie they deserve revenge and jack and joe sentence them to death so they'll die your radio yeah it picks up static sometimes go see alberto he can fix stuff like that on the spot thanks a tour here leave but make sure no one sees you you two make a pretty pair aidan i'm on the roof nearby we have to talk now it's about saving your life i'll tear them apart i swear i'll gut them real slow peace by peace to ralph susie ben to her crew [Music] um uh um so oh [Music] uh hmm [Applause] um foreign are you just gonna stand there or will you come over what do you want i don't like what's going on here aidan first jack and joe's bandits killed carl's people now sophie's getting ready to retaliate you're not a part of that are you but you said you wanted me to get close to them i'm gonna search sophie's camp that's why i came to warn you rumors have started you found the lazarus for me they may suspect you of being a pk spy [Music] that doesn't seem like it they seem happy to take whatever help is offered so they say but those people hate us aiden along with anyone who works with us so if they do suspect especially someone like sophie i can handle them lucas thought so too and look how he ended up be a pity if i found you in a ditch somewhere with a piece of your height cut out you came here just to warn me you helped me with the lazarus and i take care of my allies sophie's just fighting for water that's all i don't think she suspects anything he thinks so she hates the peacekeepers she blames us for not helping the bizarre and for her mother's death so when we start questioning her people you better be careful thanks for the warning you gain any intel for our investigation sophie's also wondering who killed lucas what else would she say they know if we can prove they killed lucas it'll be a bloodbath find out from sophie when she's planning the attack keep me informed where you are be careful go help sophie but be careful hayden don't trust the people of the bizarre they're more dark than they say hmm it's time for it looks like sophie's hey have you seen sophie sophie uh yes she went she said uh she went that way exactly thanks wait there's more one more thing something's wrong with not working with the it's broken that dad's asking if there's something wrong with your radio oh uh it hisses sometimes but as long as it works no point messing with it um can i ask you a question sure call me ayden vincenzo uh aiden how do you become a pilgrim does that mean you're a murderer vincenzo why what do you why would you dad i'm asking because i'm curious will you tell me aiden i'm not that exciting i've had to kill people but i'm not a murderer all being a pilgrim is to me now is a means to an end to what end vincenzo leave him alone to find the only family i've ever known did you not yet but i might be close i hope you succeed i've never found federico who federico he was my best friend we were like brothers we'd known each other forever he disappeared like the other kids because of those [ __ ] tests tests you mean gre tests you heard that when they built the walls they were trying to create a vaccine here it all fell apart in a couple of weeks one day federico vanished into thin air and we'd been playing football i went to my house after that he went home too and i never saw him again i'm sure they took him and that's not all you see he wasn't the only child who went missing that winter there were others two girls disappeared from the building next door at the same time and more all across the city and none of them have ever been found no but based on what federico's mother said i have a feeling i know what happened federico had been in the hospital a month earlier with pneumonia his mother was told that some gre doctor had ordered blood tests but they wouldn't tell her why a week after he was released from the hospital he was gone do you remember this doctor's name no one knew and no one at the hospital would say only that he was on classified gre business then everything went to hell the gre collapsed after that some of the kids were sighted in the central loop but not federico every day i wonder what happened to him i hope he's alive and that you find him someday he lost something you won't find it here if you came to find out if i have a boyfriend i don't which doesn't mean you have the slightest chance with me

were yesterday we'd been defending the church against infected for some time my mother was in charge she was losing dozens of people every day she was keeping everyone alive while i was keeping an eye on barney she begged the peacekeepers for help but they ignored her eventually she was injured it was dawn [Music] and he led me to her to the roof of the sacristy she saw me and made me promise to look after my brother she said it as if she was lending me a car and asking me to have it returned intact after that she appointed carl as her successor with me at his side you'll grow up to be a far better leader than carl she said but while the world is burning people won't listen to someone so young she was wrong i've been thinking like that all my life but not anymore now i understand my mother you have to be ruthless to be a leader i wasn't ready then i am now i think i know what you're talking about and i know what loss is like talking about someone in particular [Music] about my sister i'm sorry yeah maybe you don't have to be we'll find out that's why you came to town for her yeah sophie we have to talk time to act the quicker we do this the less prepared jack and joe will

something to hide something about lucas or worse what do you mean the murder of the commander now the takeover of the water tower that's no coincidence aiden barney has long been looking to get out from behind his sister's shadow and read villadore of the peacekeepers himself i'll try to find him be careful i'll go one ato let's keep in touch [Music] barney come out come on man i will find you [Music] uh uh [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] aidan if you ask nicely i'll shoot you in the head and if not you'll spend a long time dying until you turn so you'll be the one dying barney you're supposed to stop him not kill him give me the weapon give it to me brother hope you know what you're doing this is the thanks i get for helping death is how we thank traitors you didn't say you were working for either i don't work for aider i worked for myself no one can remain neutral in this ayden we're fighting for survival without water the whole bazaar will die in under a month and the peacekeepers they won't help us just like when my mother died they just sat and watched us die turns out you're one of them you don't care about us tell me why should i not kill you sophie shoot what are you waiting for [Music] because we can help each other who killed lucas he thinks we killed him sophie talk to me did you do it no sophie what the hell why do you care about this murderer what did aydor promise you [Music] if it's not you who could have killed him i wonder myself certainly none of my people if you find out who did it tell us i'd like to hug the guy lucas deserved to die live too long as it is we didn't have to kill him we have our own plan for getting the peacekeepers out of the bazaar hater promised me passage to the center that's why i'm helping him and you believe him just like that at least he didn't try to kill me he wasn't the one you betrayed but i can help you too help us with water and i'll take you to the central loop myself okay first i did not betray you i'm helping investigate a murder and that's different as for your offer isn't the only way through controlled by the pk there is another way do you really believe that i just trust you again we need each other you didn't tell us you were working with a pk so we made assumptions things are getting more dangerous and we all need to be careful you tried to kill me sophie i swear on the memory of birdie susie logan ralph and herman i'm sure if you help us we'll take you to the center will you help [Music] fine let's plan [Music] jack and joe escaped we have a chance to take the tower and finally reclaim the water before we'll deal with the peacekeepers and getting you to the center immediately afterwards first we need to secure access to water how do i get up the tower it's almost impossible without a winch and joe's men sealed off access that's why i'm asking you so you want me to climb it if you do you'll save a great many people aiden we won't forget this didn't you hear sophie you have a job to do um [Music] looks like the bandits fled the water tower it's unoccupied sophie says once i help them get the water back she'll show me another passage to the central loop sounds good she grew up here she knows every inch of this place better than most tacky drivers but watch out for joe ayden the guy's a clown and he's dangerous i doubt he'd just run off like that that's taller than i thought damn [Music] uh [Applause] sophie jack and joe are in the tower they're gonna blow it up dear god if they do we will have no water source come on aiden the tower is mined try to disarm the charges so um [Music] [Music] inhibitor container [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] give me the detonator jack we were supposed to take tribute just collect money jack give it back they'll get what they deserve they will die jack i'm warning you [Music] [Music] got it and the water is safe [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] made it after all [Music] either the bizarre jag holes or the pk they'll be honest the moment we come down from here buddy [ __ ] we lost it man we lost it that's why it's time for fireworks nobody's getting out alive joe i don't want to die you [ __ ] hey who's there stop overblow the goddamn tower i swear i found the bombs let's talk the time for talking is over we're gonna [ __ ] this place up you're not listening you're done i want it to be over and to leave the city safely help me and i'll help you you're fooling yourself jack nobody's letting us out of here alive look i am a pilgrim let's just blow it up already i dare you i know you won't do it don't listen to him jack it's over [ __ ] it up i don't know i'm scared joe wait joe hey isn't that the pilgrim who showed up at the bazaar recently maybe pilgrim or pope so what don't you get it if he's a pilgrim he can get us out lead us out of the city to someplace safe i don't trust that [ __ ] you don't trust anyone i told you to play nice with barney when we had the chance [ __ ] listen to me for once well play nice with barney what for we can get the [ __ ] out of the bazaar after what we found out from the peacekeepers we tipped off the [ __ ] gave him a chance to run but he thought he was too clever for that they warned barney about what well about luke is wanting to take him in on weapons charges among others but set a trap for him for weeks instead of politely getting the [ __ ] out of here he tried to play q instead so barney knew lucas was after him the [ __ ] wanted to start a war in old villadore and you ask me war's the last thing we need money crystals that's a different story that's why i tried to put an end to that rabbit dog and his sister so pilgrim will you get us out of the city or what calm down joe i won't [ __ ] calm down get us out of the city pilgrim to the nearest safe settlement and no one will die here i can get you out of town but first i have my own business to take care of you need to hide somewhere and wait sounds like a huge risk no risk no gain he's lying jack there's no other way [ __ ] i don't like it i [ __ ] don't but okay we'll be waiting for you in the tunnels near the tango motel we'll give you a signal when we get there good choice now give me the detonator jack [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so what now aiden smart guy who gets control of the water [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] clear [Music] [Music] [Music] knew lucas was trying to capture him jack and joe warned him he could have avoided the trap but he went into it anyway that's when lucas was killed maybe we should check out barney's hideout at the hotel tango i'll make sure the place is haven't seen my kids in months because of this ridiculous blockade of this center [Music] got nothing to say where's my flower thief but it's you who owes me teresa months of wages that's it last chance to move your asses out of here with my boat you [ __ ] break it up normally i like a cat fight but bloody hell can you believe just yesterday those two were best friends what happened last night someone stole teresa's flower all of it a major harvest too she could have made a killing without it she got nothing no flower no sales no money she and her son won't last another month without the income oh she must be desperate to blame her best friend ex best friend but it's just an accusation it's not like she's got any evidence she's a bit hot-headed that's for sure but you'd have to ask her yourself you think she needs help teresa why looking to earn some cash well that's not why you're a pilgrim aren't you you guys don't do anything for free how much they fork over for the water if you'll be near a shop thanks for the tip [Music] [ __ ] me people will always complain we're alive and that's what counts don't make me come get you i'd never believe the night runners good morning pilgrim have i already thanked you for for the water i hear you were robbed but my best friend no less i'm devastated really and why on earth would you jump to that conclusion about your best friend i didn't want to but who else could it be she was storing it for me to keep it safe she said and now it's conveniently gone me and my boy are left with nothing if only she'd admit it and return the flower i'd forgive her i swear i would lord is my witness if she's in trouble i'll help her but she's a stubborn one we've had quite a harvest too would have had us living on easy street but now now we'll starve [Music] how did anna explain the disappearance of the flower theft not a disappearance and she didn't explain anything she's lying through her teeth how do you know see it in her eyes it's a lie i look back and realize anna's been a liar all along do you have any proof that hannah did this not exactly that was in her shed wasn't it in here i thought she was doing me a favor offering to store it turns out she was just making it easier for her to screw over me and my boy talk to her would you she won't listen to me maybe a stranger could get around her stubbornness we can put this behind us if she gives it back and if she stole it because she was angry she can keep what she needs her shed's near the water tower please go talk to her i'll think about it a friend's betrayal hurts the most hey anna anna i just want to talk go away talk to me and i'll go away it won't take long tonight [Music] and they say pilgrims are thieves and swindlers the guy got him medication and then stayed with him for a week until he got better [Music] please just go away can we please talk i'd like to help help what remind me i'm a widow or that i'm dirt poor or a heinous flower thief i'm not making assumptions i just want to hear your story i want to hear the truth the truth you want the truth here's the truth i would never rob a friend never and that's the end of my story did theresa tell you about the half years wages she owes me i needed to reason to sell that flower so she could pay me why would i risk everything my well-being theresa and her sons by stealing it i thought you were best friends so did i until today since the fall we've been close i lost my child she lost her husband i i became very depressed suicidal teresa got me through it she even cooked for me and my husband who drunk heavily i can't believe she'd accuse me of this she'd mentioned you were storing the flower i figured it was the best way to keep watch over it make sure i got paid so we put it in my shed near the tower i went to check on it this morning and nothing all gone you didn't see anyone lurking nearby or anything suspicious you don't think i would have mentioned that by now i can only tell you that i did not steal that flower i wouldn't do that to theresa order myself the only strange thing was that nothing else was stolen my buckwheat my beats untouched whoever it was only wanted the flower interesting mind if i go check out the shed maybe it just needs to be looked at with a fresh pair of eyes knock yourself out help us end this madness please [Music] [Music] door's unlocked somebody must add keys rest of the supplies are untouched they knew exactly what they were looking for [Music] nothing's broken someone was very familiar with this place [Music] footprints one set of shoes thief worked alone flower trail on the ground bags dragged this way i wonder what the hell is going on in the central loop since pk's trail ends here [Music] who had the keys to the shed me and my husband but he's dead nobody else you're sure there's no sign of forced entry anna whoever took the flower had the keys or made copies so you do think it was me it's not out of the question i thought at least you would believe me what next how do i return something i haven't taken you can't draw blood from a stone calm down and think who else would do this and why help me help you unless teresa's right after all hard to tell there's someone from the bazaar perhaps there's dodger that guy is capable of anything and then there's benny teresa's son and that's all i can come up with why would this dodger character steal the flower haven't a clue other than it's just the kind of thing i'd expect from a shady guy like him his kind never dirty their hands with real work they just sit there living large of others misfortune but i i anna hey got carried away sorry i only just lost my husband and it still hits me at random times sorry where was i oh right so dodger kept asking theresa about her harvest her her grain how much etc i i didn't think much of it at the time i try not to pay attention to scum like that if you want to talk to him you'll find him at the bazaar but watch your back he doesn't give a rat's ass about people only money what about to raise his son why would he do this normally i wouldn't suspect him nice kid i've known him all his life he's like a son to me but lately he's been quiet like he's got something to hide and maybe he does but no many wouldn't have done this it would break teresa's heart and he knows it and even if he had taken the flower why that seems to be the central question for everyone involved where can i find benny not sure he's been making himself pretty scarce that said i'm sure teresa's got him guarding their storehouses make sure what meager goods they have left are safe i'll look for him can you tell me where you were the night the flower was stolen mourning my husband that night like every night since i lost him i'm sorry for your loss i'm sure you are let's get this over with accusations are devastating enough around here i'm ruined and not if we find the flower and prove it with someone else perhaps but in my experience the damage has been done maybe maybe not let's see what i can find out [Music] [Music] you can go search barney's stuff clear now take the [Music] take dear uh hey little one how are you i'm not little but hey wait we've met before i'm aiden what's your name again maya what are you doing here maya looking for bandits gonna beat the crap out of them but i'm hiding from the infected right now ah so what did these bandits do to you they stole lots of stuff but the most important thing was oh they're here there she is you're done following us around you little [ __ ] told ya you're dead kid don't worry how about i beat him up hide this won't take long what's happening [Music] you ever seen something like this thanks that was amazing and gross too and they're the ones who stole your stuff no there are more of them before the rest probably have it what's this most important thing they took my music box why is it so important to you it belonged to my mother that's all i have left of her that does sound important you need to find it and i'll let you keep it if you do you did save my life the bandits went into that building overlooking construction site on william the ninth road you gotta get it from them if you won't then i will well whoa little i mean my lady don't worry i'll handle them if you can't find them just stop and listen the music box plays a melody like this [Music] i'll keep that in mind but they won't be there during the day go at night they always go back to that building at night why don't i take you home where do you live i'll go to the bazaar by myself i'm not a baby if you don't want to keep the music box you could sell it there it's worth a lot [Music] wow jackass prepare to die [Music] [ __ ] [ __ ] got you now batter up hello lightning yo what's up so you've heard about me sure who hasn't yeah i'm a [ __ ] legend what are they saying any hot chicks asking about me oh man plenty all dreaming to meet the legend that's my life what can i say providing the fastest water delivery on the rooftops gives you celebrity status i have also the most diverse selection still water sparkling water lavender flavor honey flavor even urtica flavor wait what urtica flavor who knows but it sounds intriguing right it's called marketing people drink it up doesn't matter what it is but if it sounds fresh indifferent they want it so did you come here to challenge me to get your ass kicked by fabulous sadio well i know i have no chance but to be defeated by you would be an honor darn right it would men so when you're ready take these bottles for a brisk run just try not to break your legs [Music] probably not [Music] ugh that music box melody seems to be coming from that infected oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so [Music] mm-hmm aiden did you do it did you find the music box [Music] yes and you were right it really was valuable oh so you sold it but we agreed remember i could keep it and do whatever i want with it yeah i guess [Music] i've never seen someone bought your job so badly in my life are you dodger well well the pilgrim himself here's a piece of advice the next time you offer someone water ask if they're thirsty first what's your problem my problem is a whole tank of agua fresca that nobody wants to buy anymore just want to ask you a few questions are you [ __ ] me do i look like an information booth i've got a business to run here you don't have business and get out of my face [Music] quit barking and listen and if i don't then you won't find out that theresa's flower is gone what the [ __ ] are you talking about [Music] you know where benny might be do i look like his mother believe me he's on top of my where are they now list he went down in flames in our last card game he almost literally bet the farm and lost so if you're looking for that flower it's not the razors or bennys no more it's mine the kid owed it to me and if it's missing it was stolen from me aha so benny's in your dad big time up to his ears you might say in flower you think he stole it could be he's a dumb kid who might think that will stop me from trying to collect i need to find him then ask mother teresa she's usually got the boy on a short leash except for poker nights clearly [Music] what do you know about a woman named anna what the one who works for theresa not all that much i used to play cards with her husband before he you know beat it he never said boo about her not even a few pints in that says something right there so now you know i have the most skin in this game that flower isn't found i am the big loser so maybe check out teresa's storehouses seems like just the place a dumb kid like benny would think he could hide and if you do get your hands on the flower just kindly bring it straight to me i'll pay you handsomely for the service of course but it will save everyone a lot of grief and hey i get my flower we can put this behind us [Music] seriously there's no time for delay [Music] hmm that floor doesn't look safe maybe there's another way uh pretty empty as warehouses go hey what the [ __ ] are you doing here is that you pilgrim you shouldn't be here mate how'd you get in benny right we need to talk i don't like this dodger sent you did he tell him i'm pulling together what i owe him i'm just i just haven't got it yet hold up benny so you're saying you're in debt to dodger dodger hasn't sent you no how much do you owe him only you had a reason to steal the flower you bastard do you think that just because you turn on the water you've got free run of the place tell me i'm wrong i ain't telling you nothing bernie uh [Music] here your uh ingredients mmm good i wish there was more oil on the metal scraps but oh naira can't you just be thankful for what you've got for once she gives me this [ __ ] every day i swear okay okay voila it's ready here smell it wow it smells it's oh boy it's like heaven what is it silly little boy too young to know aren't you it's new car smell a car are you disappointed the scent of luxury is the base note the smell of confidence is the heart note and the fragrance of risk and adventure as the head note all you dream about is to turn it on and drive away into the distance thanks so much for helping me out unlike some people here have this i rubbed it with turn me on this'll remind you to tune into your sense of smell now and then [Music] where are you benny [Music] uh [Music] i haven't done anything god is my witness let me go please first answer a few questions but i want the truth did you steal the flower no i don't even know where it is so why did you attack me i thought you might have been one of dodgers boys come to collect i see you're in deep with dodger and used your mother's bountiful harvest for collateral i was hot that night mate and the pot was big enough we could have bought the jansen's fields with the water back on and all mum and me would have been sitting pretty for the rest of our days but then things got ugly and ain't no other way to tell it i lost so the dodger take the flower to settle up doubt it could have just made me bring it to him and i would have he's too lazy to do anything himself but you know mate don't tell him i said that [Music] what's the meaning of this stealing the flower was your job teresa so you pilgrims really are crazy he's off his nut mum you shut your trap and listen young man i've had enough of you as well benny wouldn't have pulled this off on his own he's not exactly the brightest chap no offense ma'am none taken lump of coal for brains that one mom very well i did it but i really had no choice aidan worked for months on that crop worked our fingers to the bone it yielded enough to last for months there'd be bread enough to feed the whole bizarre but you know what dodgy would do if he got it sell it back to us for triple the price we'd end up paying for our own flower a cruel joke all because of a stupid card game we'd be ruined i couldn't allow that i wouldn't so where is the flower under the water tower you must understand it can't go to dodger and why not he wanted fair and square don't fair and square hardly he's a cheat everyone knows it we just can't prove it okay say you're right is there a middle ground can we give him something else instead someone like dodger doesn't seem all that flexible he's got to be me talk to him please ask him for more time anything we're begging you let me think about that you are our only hope don't get melodramatic benny the pilgrim knows what he's doing something's off how intruder over here just let me go it's easy i wonder what the hell is going on in the central loop since pk's restricted access ah [Music] if ugh [Applause] do you think so ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] five years ago everything would have been okay let's make things lively 100 more no freaking way unless you're willing to cut the time by 10 seconds deal living dangerously it was already an impossible task well we'll see about that aiden you find my flower yet yeah that's what i'm here about teresa and benny are in dire straits can you forgive their debt or at least give them more time [ __ ] that how many times do i have to say i'm not running a charity i didn't force benny to play cards you know a man can play his deaths well he's not a man is he stupid is as stupid does maybe when they got nothing left but the skivvies on their butts they'll have learned a valuable lesson you know what aiden actually yeah i think i got something to help everyone honestly yeah who cares about flower what am i going to be a baker all of a sudden i don't think so but i do want what i'm old and me and urban we've got this bed wait whoa no fair not him he runs on walls of course it's fair there's no rule against having him get them you pull this off aiden and what urban will have to pay me will more than cover my losses on the flower and there'll be extra i can throw your way wait what exactly are you talking about here you see on top of the church there's this song well let's just call it a flag you can't see it from the ground but this flag well it's not a flag yeah you'll know when you see it urban and i made a bet that i could find someone who could nab it for us i've been raising the stakes for years and urbans called me every time but with the amount on the line now you know it would be a scene not to give it a try ah i'm in no hurry rather you just keep raising the stakes till it gets real juicy what's that [Music] fear suddenly got you all puckered nah i'm just looking out for you it'll ruin you if you lose now being out the flower and all i'm game if hidden is the time limit's pretty [ __ ] brutal but you know i've got faith in aiden here so you in [Music] let's do this well then let's just get to it shall we three two one go anda leader make me proud [Music] seriously there's no time for delay [Music] i gave you money [Music] and i regret that [Music] [Music] hmm hmm [Music] [Music] so they're back the night [Music] did i tell you urban i told you i've been waiting years for this we've got a winner the undie challenge has been conquered way to go aiden all right all right don't get so excited you're ugly when you gloat you know that [Music] so what's the deal with this flag it's a pair of carl's old undies you put teresa and benny's life at stake for some old underwear this was more about the bet itself but the undies are symbolic there is a great story behind them too no one remembers when exactly but long ago a wild wind blew carl's laundry off his line and it got stuck on the roof carl wanted to mount some big mission to rescue his clothes can you believe that anyway everyone refused of course no one could climb that high off and on a good wind would sometimes bring down a sock maybe a shirt but carl's undies stuck there flying proud urban bet me that i would never find someone who could fetch them for us but i did so you'll cancel teresa and benny's debt now like it never existed and you my new friend you saved the day take this with my thanks [Music] [Music] seriously there's no time for delay it's nice to see everything i think you grow to plant cucumbers somewhere

post-apocalyptic dating service a dating service i could use a little something something if you know what i mean tell me oh i'll gladly explain get you up to speed okay i'll admit it i made you a card already whoa what i created a profile for you a profile on on a card what on earth for well it's my job the world may have ended and most of our loved ones have turned into bloodthirsty monsters roaming the streets but that doesn't mean people have stopped being lonely i mean [ __ ] that's exactly why they're lonely these days you mean to tell me there was a time when people weren't lonely imagine a world where people actually went out to work shopping walking their dog and on top of that they had dating apps um uh apps okay okay never mind what i'm trying to say is that before the [ __ ] hit the fan we used to socialize there were parties you know when people got together just for the sake of being together and of course to get laid now everyone just stays home behind closed doors because meeting new people can result in getting clubbed in the skull for a bucket of water so well let me get this straight your cards help people meet basically yes people who want to meet other people come see me why draw them i'm pretty good at that or at least that's what i'm taught then i put their portrait on a card and display it on my dating board if someone's interested they get in touch with me and voila a romance is born not always for very long but i guess that's something that hasn't changed but right now i'm in deep [ __ ] and i desperately need help of course you do some [ __ ] trying to imitate me forged several sparker cards they scattered them around town that's infringement it's ruining my reputation and disorienting my customers i need someone to collect these fake cards for me and bring them back i heard that talentless hack was killed in a dark zone so he won't be bothering me again and i managed to find most of the fake cards but there are two left

cliff here damn it you don't think that he's not he's not dead is he don't jump to conclusions but where could they be keeping him damn it this is all my fault i'm such a fool sending people here yeah that's on you as for your brother i'm not certain where did you last see him we were in east quarry and close to devil's bridge when they attacked us they took him hostage and have been using me to carry out their orders ever since i only did this to keep my brother alive aidan i didn't know others would die when this started what's devil's bridge it's the name of this building in the middle ages they said devils haunted it but then times changed and no one believed in those things anymore before the virus it was a car repair shop now it's full of bandits and i guess i'll search the area around devil's bridge hayden you serious you'd do that for me not a chance i'm doing this so that no one else dies because of you [Music] i know i didn't exactly make a good impression but please save him so [Music] ugh ain't going away [Music] uh yes [Music] i don't like the duck i'm always afraid uh so [Music] damien damien nah i'm cliff wow resemblance is uncanny guards wait stop damien sent me

damian haven't figured it out oh well i love my brother but he's a dope always has been [Music] you tricked your brother to send innocent men to their deaths because you wanted to find me waltz can

been around a while you're practically one of us now what's going on where's damian [Music] he locked himself in the tower [Music] and what's that all about beats me just started raving about something being all his fault he was in a bad way he's not answering his radio he didn't look like he was in a talkative mood any other way into the tower not really not by ordinary means people have tried to climb the wall but those who have usually end up getting scraped off the ground yeah i'll give it a shot [Music] and forget the fall even happened things would go differently [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh damian stop her i jump wait okay i've stopped relax damien let's both relax what do you want to talk about what how about cliff about your brother what about him for one i i should apologize for what what happened to him hayden well i look it's only fair that you know no what that it's my fault i killed him not you oh so you want me to jump is that it rub salt in my wounds of course you killed him do you think that changes anything for anyone it could maybe take some of the burden off of you nice try but no aidan no i brought all of this down on myself on me on those poor victims on my brother and even you and maybe i should just live with that but i don't want to at least not for very long only for about say 15 floors i can handle that goodbye aiden [Music] about not finding out the hard way that you can't fly maybe if i weren't such a weakling and a coward i'd have jumped already but you didn't something is holding you back fear fear has always held me back it helped me back from refusing those [ __ ] after they took my brother it held me back from telling those doomed guys to run like hell instead of sending them to their deaths i won't be held back anymore aidan i won't hold myself back you ready for this aiden cause if i stop holding myself back i think i just might be able to fly after all check it out i don't know about life [ __ ] you that's what you hung up on but you're alive and so many aren't now because of you damien i killed them all of them look man it was a bad deal all around you aren't evil okay you were trying to save your brother they backed you into a corner but my brother is one person one person but i've killed so many no sent them to be killed you didn't kill him yourself what choice did you have believe me i've done plenty of bad in the name of good and then i just plain bad but i'm not an evil person and neither are you damien i am i could have found another way but did i try i can't close my eyes without seeing the face of every kid i said hey you're new around here too they're all dead and now so is my brother because of me i can't take it anymore sure you can you can prove how strong you really are live your life and use each day to make it right it's too much to fix i can't it could never be enough i'm sorry aidan i have a message from your brother wait what before he died your brother told me something you waited till now tell me it's not something you yell damien come over here and let's talk if this is a trick hayden it's a lousy one and it won't work i'll be over the side so fast this isn't a trick seriously he said something to me before just come on will ya all right step back take it slow yeah talk come closer so we can talk for real man talk okay fine so he said your brother cliff said that that he loved you and he didn't want you blaming yourself he took the blame you were a better person than he ever was he said [ __ ] cliff never talked like that he was a dick my brother but a serious [ __ ] he said that he wanted you alive he didn't want you bearing all this i swear well there's only one way to find out for sure i'll have to ask him but he's dead exactly make room i'm jumping with you are you crazy why not we can go together now it's one more death added to your tab why would you no you would never try me jump go on jump i'll be right behind you ever hear that most jumpers change their minds mid-air no it's true they're falling and think oh [ __ ] maybe this actually wasn't the smartest thing i've done in my life soon my head's gonna smash open like a watermelon and i'll ride around with no control over my arms and legs and beg for someone to finish me off but nobody's gonna finish you off here damien except maybe the infected they'll eat you foot to forehead damian slowly i'm going see you on the ground wait let's talk about what i i don't know about life maybe sure but i guess i don't have a life anymore all the guys that died they died because and quit being a broken wrecker will ya you'll get over it now pull yourself the [ __ ] together and back away from that ledge or you really will fall you feel bad about those deaths that's great means you got a conscience it's not many left in this town with a conscience but you got one and that's why you should live to make up for what you did it will always be time to jump tomorrow day after no rush look i won't stop you but keep this in mind like i said before make it right keep living at least till you make it right so how many deaths do you think you're responsible for don't make me say it aidan eight maybe eight even better better yeah because now you have to save eight lives deal but gotta balance those scales damian we have a deal deal smart move i better not regret this you won't i got a job for you hey that's my line how about that damian's got a sense of humor gallows humor i guess yeah it seems appropriate all things considered aiden yeah thanks no problem i saved your life kid now don't [ __ ] it up okay jesus damian what's up with you were you about to jump i was but aidan what's with this it's all my fault business talk to me yeah the people from the bazaar my brother oh wait hold up don't confuse yourself again damien just relax and shut up for now wait he was just talking about killing people or something what's

look at your face huffing and puffing who knew you were such an old man is this a race or are you aiming to turn this into a fight calm down calm down it's a race in fact how about we up the stakes say five to one what do you say all right you're on and we're off [Music] um [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] hmm uh [Music] [Music] i thought i was a goner hey wait wait wait a minute what's going on here babel are you okay you [ __ ] well [ __ ] me the two of you were twins no wonder you kept winning when i started a race with one of you the other was already at the finish line look at him babel his brain finally caught up to his legs you don't know when to stop do you wait we're not bad people okay i mean we're probably not all that good either but my point is everyone does what they do best right and this is just what we're good at we tried to do other things you know things we were not very good at and we ended up getting in debt serious debt and now we have to pay it so you scam people nobody gets hurt we're not bandits listen what if we gave you back your wage and forgot about the whole thing huh surely my silence is worth more all right all right this is all we have okay let me know when you want to race again you numbskull you had to let those biters catch you didn't you what you think i did that on purpose give me a break [Music] get out of here detected you here dodger sent me uh [Music] uh yes ugh hello you again how'd you find my secret entrance you call that a secret it was supposed to be you're out of luck though buddy i still don't know anything about anything the dodger sent me dodger who oh he told me to say sayonara that help okay [ __ ] you should have started there dodger's looking for the order you owen i'm not bad you see that busted lake that's why i don't have dodger's order you need help nah wait don't go back to him he finds out i botched the job i'm done around here and what should i tell him don't matter he won't give a [ __ ] he'll think i'm [ __ ] him over hi can you go for me check out this storage area in an underground parking lot on st joseph street cross the fence right in front of the massage parlor enter the building and head down the elevator shaft well hey slow down first what would i be looking for if i did this for you gre containers according to the rumor that reached dodger there was a military installation here set up in the first days of the outbreak and where there's military there's usually a healthy stash of supplies uh what kind of supplies don't know for sure but usually good stuff from before the outbreak it was only the finest for the military medicine booze whatever no wonder dodger wants this delivery so badly yep here take these bangers and give it a try will you it'd be a big score for all of us but i'm out of the running now literally so this is a military base yeah they sprang up all over the city at the start of the outbreak the base is a military side and a civilian side military side is a good stuff the civilian side probably has more infected than loot look for the military entrance and you can't go wrong yeah well once you're inside be careful getting to the storage area won't be easy the setup usually includes generators find them to fire up their uv lights that'll help against the fighters that'll be camping out there what happened to your leg got jumped by bandits as i approached the side barely managed to get away if you don't do this dodger will kill me why do you work for dodger you need to ask same reason as you we got to do what we got to do to survive dodger tips me off or i might find valuables and i go there if i find some good stuff i'd take a cup a tiny one a sliver you know vultures guys like dodger are it's barely enough to live on but it's better or nothing i guess the worst is when dodger gives me a bum lead and i get [ __ ] off that's happened more than once no skin off dodgers nose though he's got plenty of guys like me working for him okay i'll be back as soon as i can thanks you're saving my ass by doing this buddy but i'd wait till night falls to go there both zones are probably filled to the brim with infected right now thanks for the tip not that i'm in a hopeless situation but can you hurry are you holding up i'll be fine how about you who are you oh you guys need help we'll be fine thanks what happened we heard a rumor about this garage we thought it'd be an easy score but we were wrong dumb asses hey hey at least we got far enough down to start up the old military generator and juice up some uv lights so what happened then further down the underground parking is [ __ ] swarming with infected barely made it out of there alive and then part of a wall collapsed on jonas on our weight of the surface well you won't mind if i give it a try do you knock yourself out but it's probably not worth it unless you want to end up like me or worse yeah i gotta make good on a promise here if you manage not to die maybe you'll find use for these we sure ain't going back not that way at least well thanks can you hear those noises downstairs that wailing yeah like peacocks singing the hallelujah chorus must be howlers they don't attack on their own but bring other infected running you think it's all clear then one shriek and a wave of infected appears quit [ __ ] scaring me man maybe we'll come back for this generator another time seems to be in decent shape and just how are we going to get it out of there it'll be lighter if we drain the fuel yeah that'll do it so what's our plan for now we wait until dawn we won't get far outside with you busted up like that so we stay put until morning and then uh we'll take a shortcut next to the massage parlor okay [ __ ] this hurts [Music] foreign um uh ah is [Music] oh uh [Music] good [Music] i think this is the military storage area hubert told me about let's look around uh [Music] hmm hmm [Music] [Music] so filters never gonna have enough of these i'm sure dodger can use them [Music] [Music] [Music] yes uh [Music] looks like i struck gold a bottle of risen glory cognac and some cigars um cubans the box says looks like i got everything of value time to head out of here wow you made it did you find the stash sure did thanks for the lockpicks but what are you still doing here is this him sure is he was kind enough to get the goods for us saved us a lot of trouble very good so where did you find out about this a little bird was it to you was it a little bird mitt a broken leg how would you know because i broke it why'd you attack him hubert was planning to take the goods for himself tell dodger he didn't find anything needed our help to pull it off but we didn't know why we needed half-assed ruby and now we don't need you so give them to us three against one i like those odds count again i counted five corpses kill him and take the gods [Music] you ain't this i've got you now [Music] jackass i got something for you [ __ ] two [Applause] how's the leg uh i know better but it'll heal eventually oh fantastic something wrong i had a chance to meet the bandits you mentioned before they said that you'd plan on cheating dodger after all okay the cat's out of the bag but look it was only going to be just this once dodger would never find out why would you steal from a man who's giving you work oh god i'm living by the skin of my teeth here i thought just this once i'd pretend he gave me a bum lead and take the whole stash maybe get a little ahead for once and the bandits i figured an ambush would sell the story better didn't expect them to turn on me but then i'm an idiot aren't i seems like it trusting a group of thugs like them that's what you get for being greedy i wasn't being greedy just just desperate now i got a busted leg and don't know when i can work again what happened to them anyway now they tried to kill me but didn't whoo and the goods did you reach them i got everything i'm begging you don't tell dodger if you do you'll ruin me please take what you have to him tell him i'll be back in business as soon as my leg heals why'd you even get mixed up with low lives like that seemed reasonable enough at first uh you're interested in helping for a small cut then they show up with this psycho class damn it i'm such an idiot i i i brought this all on myself don't tell dodger please i'll think it over come on man without work i'll starve i won't even think about doing it again i swear don't make me laugh i think i'd take your word for anything after this believe me i i learned my lesson i'll never do anything like that again we'll see [Music] months [Music] i found these filters for one okay not setting my world on fire but i can move those for a nice profit how about these a bottle of cognac and a box of cigars now that's what i'm talking about you see i knew there'd be something valuable at that military base you see that turban can i sniff out the good [ __ ] or what kick ass speaking of asses what was huby's deal is he trying to duck out on me [Music] uh hubert broke his leg so i went and got the goods for him he could use a doctor or at least someone to look in on him while he's on the mend oh yes he'll definitely need a doctor what are you talking about you know what they say trust in god but break your camel's legs just in case couldn't what hey this psycho works for you well two solutions are better than one she wanted to kill me no who said anything about killing i just told klaus to get the loot he can be a little over eager at times you jackass oh come on don't pout look at klaus he's not mad about you killing his friends it's natural selection you proved yourself stronger than them you came in handy after all i didn't know how to get to who be but then you showed up i waited until you were gone and paid him a visit what did you do to him he was in terrible pain because of that broken leg so i broke the other one for balance that's what happens when you try to screw dodger you [ __ ] out of your mind no need to get all broken up about it doralex said lex the times we live in are ruthless and the law must be so too he's already learned his lesson he said he wouldn't do it again how can you be so sure any idea how many people half-assed has conned people who are also just trying to get by who have families to feed he's been asking for trouble for a long time he got what he deserved and he won't scam anyone ever again remember rules are rules with the whole world collapsing we need them more than ever without them we'd be no better than a pack of rats did you call this following the rules for your rules you won't get away with this carlo hear the whole story carlo he won't dare touch me i know too much about him i know too much about everyone even lucas respected me who do you think is behind his death barney sophie barney and sophie are just a pair of kids playing in a sandbox that's too big for them on the other hand they are really [ __ ] up you never know what might pop up in their heads i know one thing though curiosity killed the cat thanks for your concern but i don't need it i saw the potential in you from the start but i had to figure out who i'm really dealing with and how did i do oh you're something else but you still have a lot to learn kid you lied to me about hubie aidan aiden hayden this is no world for a saint a martyr maybe if you get yourself killed at least i'll have a clear conscience clear conscience [Music] no one has a clear conscience here and since you are still alive neither do you right what have you been getting up to pilgrim what are you running from next time find yourself another patsy feisty i like it we'll meet again eden [Music] find something

maybe you didn't but you're crazy brother barney's not a psycho we have nothing to do with lucas's death i'm going to ader i've got the proof he's looking for aidan it's not us nobody at the bazaar will believe you [Music] then where did this piece of skin come from sophie could have been planted to set us up ever think of that who would do that and why to distract everyone from the real killer who gained the most from killing lucas who had the most to gain if it was that easy for you to get in here then someone else could have come in here before you and planted that doesn't matter this is between you and aydah now wait please aydor doesn't care about the truth he doesn't care about finding the real killer he's only looking for a reason to raid the bizarre it's not my war sophie no but you'll have blood in your hands blood of innocence someone is setting us up someone clever we're not sadists who would skim lucas aiden and you know it but i know that you want to get rid of the pks

own eyes i will give you its location and in return you will give me all your money yeah i don't think so what is money compared to such a priceless thing it buys me food and drink keeps me from starving i can go on fine 200 and a money-back guarantee and if you do not value the weapon as i have i shall return your money will you accept my challenge okay i'm in look for chests hidden on the old overpass overlooking east horseshoe and the roof of the office building close by the last one you open will contain the world's most powerful weapons search and you shall find it [ __ ] this won't be easy [Music] used to watch so many movies in the old days [Music] it's like the virus wiped our paper [Music] apparently not here [Music] finally found a great where's this weapon that nut job has some explaining to do before you say what's a con job but a shiny stone to a simpleton i'll knock it out of your wince comes such anger wait once i climbed like an idiot to the top of the viaduct for

faster and sloppier so what will it be would you sacrifice your perseverance just to get your money back there was nothing there give me back my money what is my fist in your face but the broken nose of its sheet right i see here here's your money you have much to learn [Music] sometimes i can't sleep because of the awful sounds the infected outside make you know this used to be a bell tower in the middle ages i wonder what happened to the bells this is madness sophie the peacekeepers have more weapons men they will crush us like worms aytor may have more men but we have the home field advantage home field advantage you're crazy i forbid it while i leave the bazaar no one will attack the peacekeepers you no longer lead the bazaar what you're no leader carl never were we lost people because of you crystals you almost got yourself killed my mother wanted a free bazaar not slaves serving the peacekeepers i want to restore peace here you can help me with this or leave roger humphrey arrest them what are you doing they want to betray the bizarre roger you have no power anymore carl you want to be like your mother you'll have blood on your hands sophie a lot of blood [Music] crawl is right we don't stand a chance in open battle sophie what the therefore we're gonna weaken them first what do you mean we'll cut off their main source of electricity without uv lamps adore can't defend his base they will be driven from the metro tunnels and cut off from the armory how does all this get me to the central loop once ada is weakened he will retreat for reinforcements then you can make it to the central loop aiden but first we have to blow up the windmill and fast before aider gets wind of what we're planning barney gather our people be ready roger and humphrey go to the armory provide weapons to anyone capable of fighting you aiden go to alberto and vincenzo they'll walk you through the plan okay community and freedom aiden together we will win [Music] i'm no pk man but whoever why won't you help me you are worthless heartless selfish everything all right no everything is not all right please it's my boys they've gone missing i haven't seen him for hours moe's 13 scotty's 16 please boys their age do tend to wander off not my boys they always tell me where they're going and when they'll be back this time was no different but how my birthday's coming up it'd be just like them to get into trouble planning a surprise i'd die you understand if something happened to them i'd hate i can take a look but i'm new here i don't have much of we neither do we well i'd have nothing without them if you find them i can share a little something i've kept for a rainy day all right i can try to find them as a pilgrim i did plenty of tracking what a pilgrim you're lucky this is about my children i know what sort of people become pilgrims otherwise i'd want nothing to do with you i just want to help where should i start to look right here sometimes they play with this filthy little boy by the church walls all right i'll check it out you stay here and wait apparently you made a commitment to something [Music] hey what can i do for you you're practically one of us now hey alberto this new armor of yours is splitting more fit for a beetle than people yeah way too thin first time peter shares a great protection this is top craftsmanship made from the finest quality materials from uh oh i can almost see the steam pouring from his ears look out he's gonna blow titanium we reinforce the armor with titanium we pulled from the scrapyard that's why they're lighter and better protection you guys shouldn't be such dicks well why didn't he just say so we'll see thanks vincenzo you didn't have to it was nothing that ah as for you those two orbs took the last titanium vests i'm not here for armor sophie sent me you're supposed to bring me in on some plan the plan my plan carl agreed call agreed you heard that vincenzo not carl sophie you gonna share or do i have to guess windmill we take down the windmill bingo the big windmill that provides power to the pk headquarters but first we need the charges that jack and joe left at the water tower [Music] would you bring them to us pilgrim after we blow it up all the uv lamps in the pk headquarters will go out that'll allow the infected to attack them old villa door will be free again and you you have a clear rule to uh uh you know the past chemical fallout where and to uh what's it called the central loop the central loop right how do you know the pk will withdraw and not retaliate because dad designed this windmill he knows it like the back of his hand and it's the pk base's only power source without it the bks won't last another night in old villador but we must act fast before the peacekeepers catch wind of our plans so you win [Music] okay so the windmill powers all the pk's uv lamps yes it does indeed a lot of people will die only if the pk don't turn tail and head back to where they belong they stole that windmill from us it was ours lucas and his men they when they came they ah damn it exactly they took it without electricity ator can't keep anyone here we have generators smaller power sources they need a large power source they'll have to withdraw and before they return with backup from the central loop we'll block the tunnel ourselves their commander jack matt is not going to risk fighting in the dark with the infected and renegades at his back old vilidor will be ours again and you will go to the center [Music] all right fine i'll do it okay go to the water tower we're going to use the charges that jack and joe tried to blow it up with let me know once you get there finally put our plan into action the others take this [ __ ] what happened here what's going on here pks they've been searching us for weapons found on molotovs and went ape [ __ ] slaughtering everyone in sight looks like someone set us up who and where are the bombs for alberto we managed to send some out the couriers last reported near star square then silence alberto the charges are gone i'm going to the star square that was their last check-in oh my exactly yeah be careful someone sold us out fine field the churches without them the plan cannot proceed doing what i can i'll be in touch i had no choice dear you have to believe me don't you dare me you could have chosen to pay your son's debt instead you dragged me through the mud with what money it would have ruined us either way so you decided to take me down with you i hope it was all worth it no please you have to give me another chance we've been best friends forever forever is over theresa you're dead to me just leave now thank you for trying to clear my name aidan but as i thought the damage was already done despite your efforts many will never look at me the same again and i've lost my best friend [Music] friend no no true friend would have done that to you you're right i don't

[Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] well look what's behind door number one you don't call you don't write and it was such a promising friendship waltz ordered lucas's death detective adam won't rest until he solves the case you expect me to believe you why would i because waltz is here hang on boys search the tunnel why would wolves have lucas killed it's weaken the pks to put a wedge between you spread chaos i don't know his plans i [ __ ] hate politics and you picked the wrong side what else is there to discuss they're attacking the headquarters they took the metro station what the come on grab that door this gun did it quiet i warned you ater the electricity's off we need to find the fuse box what's going on here who turned it off who do you think you're gonna be a smart arse now i'm just saying let's get him well you can't escape anyway okay search for the fuse box there should be a utility room nearby hepa check the other entrance you to search that tunnel it's a maze but if waltz is hiding here he had to leave a trail like any slug we are waiting aidan peppa do you have anything there are some wires but it's all flooded this doesn't look good lieutenant the equipment's been shut down for 15 years keep looking hopefully that's not the reason for the short circuit someone was here they yanked out the court [Music] um icon been through here i barely made it this far

taught your kids we were kids you were part of something greater you owe it to me that you are still alive that you are stronger than others special that you are stronger than i could have imagined

talk who the [ __ ] are you i'm aiden and you why are you helping me show me your arm come on i won't bite well not hard we have something in common i was one of that crazy [ __ ] subjects too mia did you know a girl named mia mia no who's me she's my sister we were at a gre place together i have to find her well if she's alive she must be pouring herself of water somewhere in the city what not that i'd blame her what are you saying [ __ ] you oh gotcha sign of the times the world we live in just saying i have to find her well first let's [ __ ] out of here not sure we managed to ditch that psycho [Music] hey wait hell she's fast [Music] the entrance to the central loop is not far away we'll be safe there [Music] uh [Music] the military they're here bring them in earth to aiden man you were just a million miles away do you have nightmares about what he did to us all the time that's why i want to kill the [ __ ] waltz is number three on my list what about the rest of the kids who are in the hospital oh man someday someone will write a book about it and it ain't gonna be a bedtime story most of them are gone i ran across one guy though he'll sleep with a knife in his hand for the rest of his life in the refrigerator he converted into a shelter for himself that he'll never leave we didn't organize a therapy group if that's what you're asking so walt's experimented on you when how long when it's blurry the time i spent there but i was a lucky one managed to run after a few weeks i don't remember you i'll take that as a compliment those who do don't usually have fond memories most prefer to forget me if they survive maybe you ran sort of wait you got a hit list seriously do i look like i'm kidding the city's got a lot of trash and i'm the maid who's gonna make it the capital of cleanliness uh who else is on it besides waltz butcher hack on and you know what it's a very long list there's a few small fries that deserve a bolt between the eyes as well and by whose authority are you doing this you kidding me the highest court of justice in the land my own noble authority your honor and you what were you doing with that bastard hack on you'll have a hard time believing this but he saved my life when i came to town i was infected yeah no biomarker people at the bazaar wanted to hang me sure i'd do it myself but he got me out of there got me a biomarker can't believe he duped me he dupes everyone like everyone i trusted him once too really tell me about it maybe someday but my story's similar to yours he tricked me and people died better forget about him or do you like me when you see him next make sure you have a crossbow and a bunch of bolts handy okay enough chatting let's go bossy i like that we gotta go aidan you there yeah i'm coming wow i thought you were gone apparently waltz was doing these experiments on the sly [ __ ] psycho but and no one in the gre noticed [Music] at some point they did i heard that's why they kicked him out too bad it was too late and hack on why is he on the list because he killed lucas no i like those blue puppets the pks but no i don't give a [ __ ] about lucas's death why then thought my dear is a long story for another day let's just say everyone on that list deserves a head shot and hackon deserves something worse [ __ ] this was always open we're locked out [ __ ] great this is a gre facility isn't it oh man it worked where did you get that you know dylan how do you know dylan no is an overstatement he contacted me because he wanted to escape the city and waltz he was frightened something must have happened or he found something what could he have found i don't know he knew i was in touch with frank but then dylan just disappeared stopped making contact [Music] dylan gave me this before he died waltz killed him [ __ ] so he got him after all also dylan told me to find someone named lawan you know who that is maybe we were meant to meet each other the universe brought us together for some [ __ ] up reason what i am the one dylan wanted to contact frank he said the pk commander lucas found something something walt's been looking for for a long time he wanted to escape the city so that waltz wouldn't get it the gre key i have it now probably lucas died because of this gizmo dylan two watch out or you'll be next it's valuable for waltz and valuable i suppose so you'd better not lose it what's going on impossible waltz must have switched on the generators waltz but why don't have a clue who knows what's in that fucker's head come on hurry ladies and gentlemen the train is delayed the metro service is sorry for any inconvenience please mind the gap thank you for your attention you're [ __ ] welcome hurry aiden it seems we have a clear path to the central loop over here [Music] are we going or what i was sightseeing funny [ __ ] oh [ __ ] look light's here too look it's all lit up [ __ ] unbelievable oh come up to the roof we'll check it from above [Music] come on quick [Music] hey where are you damn it i was wrong can't see [ __ ] i really thought it would work you're [ __ ] duped oh well um at least it's peaceful yep that's why i come here when i'm pissed off so a lot believe me look aiden they're back on they're [ __ ] coming back on you see that again you see that it's beautiful oh i can't believe it no i just can't believe it [Music] oh i see it daniel i'm at a lookout point and it's quite the show how's this happen dark as hell for 15 years and suddenly this i don't know don't know but we need to find out then drop by the campaign and let's talk been missing you like last year's snowmobile while shotgunning beers and screwing bartenders you know me it's a gift we'll meet you there dumbass something's wrong no oh no no no no no no [ __ ] what the hell's going on so that's the fish eye okay how do we get there the fish eyes gotta wait gotta wait but why we need to check the substations ones over there level with the pk tower what about the fish eye listen i want to help you and i will help we'll do this together but you have to understand it's the first it's been the same situation for over 10 years 10 years of this [ __ ] darkness we gotta check this out how do we get to the substation it's an old power glider it'll help you get to places you normally can't reach just follow me wait [ __ ] [Music] [Music] not bad for a rookie it's easier than it looks i still can't believe this is happening i think walt's turned the power on somehow but why would he do that he's never helped anyone why would he give people power back are you sure it was him he used the gre key in the car factory i think that's when everything lit up that makes sense years ago the military took over the plan to secure the energy cells on the hills but i had no idea they could still be made to work and power half the city keep an eye on that key aiden hal knows what else can be done with it we better hurry to the substation [Music] nice but you better keep practicing if you hope to beat me i didn't know it was a race it's always a race aiden [Music] get going way better aiden but you have to control the wind otherwise it controls you [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] okay from here it's not far at all to the substation go there and activate it on my own you're a big boy you'll figure it out there's another one near the metro i'll check that one if we get one or both of these working means we can activate all of them hey but how do i activate it it's not rocket science aiden those are old systems i guess we need to make sure fuses and cables are working this paraglider can it be made to fly faster possibly but that's something you should ask master about you seriously ugh [Music] [Music] it used to be a night runner's favorite toy you're a night runner me night runner i wish they were really something real heroes the only thing i had in common with them was substance abuse but maybe someday hey you seen any signs of renegades around here no see private now calm down and let aglot sink what's there to think about why not head back to base who the heck are you anyway i'm someone offering to help i'll check what happened to the power you know anything else about it that's top secret military information we're trying to figure out how to get up there just go ahead and tell them everything why don't you every last detail well what's the big secret huh we need to get this piece of [ __ ] working that's what my colleagues vastly oversimplifying things but his just is correct there are obvious signs of the electricity having returned and this here appears to be a substation it and others like it are capable of transmitting electricity throughout the city we have orders to get this building functioning once more meaning turn it back on unfortunately without climbing equipment access to it is severely limited want the electricity for the peacekeepers what would you do with it plug [ __ ] in what do you think the gentleman here must be asking how it would affect other people if the control of power is in the hands of peacekeepers the answer however is relatively simple as well whoever controls the power controls the city i got it in any case i don't need equipment to get up there i can climb up there without the equipment you'd be willing to do that you'd be doing a great favor for the peacekeeper uniforms what was that he said i think it was something about his mother and a goat pk morons really taking that electricity thank you very much kill him i'm gonna move for a fight uh [Music] [ __ ] in the barracks what about you bud who taught you how to fight like that name's aiden hey you guys know this one what do the bullets say to the man that got shot bang no just passing through [Laughter] you severed his limbs with a machete knit taff technically speaking that's a melee weapon while bullets are reserved i'm glad you're fine too you still want to climb up there aidan not for free of course but we reward specialists fittingly uh no time like now if you need any help up there give us a holler over the radio aglot's good electronics however from here i can estimate the level of damage done to the apparatus got a knack for electronics inhibitor container nearby i'm inside how's it look somebody was in a big hurry when they took it offline i would surmise the main circuit suffered a break find a cable and connect the source of power to the transmitter that should restore the circuit [Music] trying to connect power to the transmitter i wasn't a piece of cake in here after all sure you're gonna make it i met a bunch of pks who couldn't get to the substation themselves so that's why you haven't called me yet you should see them could decide which one i like more you know that'll cost you right the peacekeepers they're all right but they're not the sword to help out of the kindness of their hearts i wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't for them besides they're down there and i'm the one up here tough choice huh i wouldn't give it to them i mean [ __ ] them they have their own men and what about the free folk someone should be on their side who else if not people like us hmm now think about it just don't take too long wait what i'm already done here and you're [ __ ] around over there always with the competition huh [Music] [Music] inhibit our container nearby [Music] container nearby cool [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] all right plugged it in what now activate the control unit it's in the control room on my way your help is an important contribution to make this city safer i just wanted to say that so you feel appreciated until you understand how important this is okay thank you i guess [Music] [Music] [Music] just yank in your chain meet me back at the canteen this could be the start of something beautiful [Music] gee someone turned the power on the whole neighborhood [Music] they seem to have some kind of other disease [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i didn't think it was so believe the night runners you fixed the station by yourself detected there are a lot more substations if we could get them all going that would be something power for the entire city imagine that maybe i'll hit up some of the others is i got something for you [Music] [Music] i've got you now [ __ ] [Music] dale the [ __ ] hmm prepare to die here he's here [Music] wait what the hell oh you're mine now i got something for you [Music] what's happening [Music] you're now [Music] your breath stank man anybody else [Music] you [ __ ] me oh are you kidding me [Music] uh huh good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] number one [Music] [Music] nearby uh oh [Applause] bloody dukes they were worse than disease ugh uh inhibitor container detected inhibitor container nearby hmm um uh um um [Music] nearby [Music] what's up container [Music] we got the power back who the [ __ ] cares [Music] you won you there go on i guess i'll look around but when it comes to power so you have no idea who in the blazes turn those lights on we're looking into it sir be patient patient what good are you guys i'm sorry have you seen lawn can't you see we're having a conversation so you're a peacekeeper huh yes but as i say no one knows who turned on the lights and when it'll come back in other neighborhoods please be patient we're doing all we can to figure this out i'm just looking for a friend lawan you sure you know what to do if you catch that tiger by the tail anyhow she's probably out in the field somewhere but you can ask at the bar now that we've got the lights yeah but where'd it come from all of a sudden everywhere in town that somebody had to turn it on i see her all the time oh wait you mean like today sorry got mixed up in all the excitement hey looking for lawn you know i can find her she was just here boo still didn't break your neck good this him the gajo you were talking about that i've heard a lot about you [Music] huh i haven't heard a thing about you at all do we have to see frank tucandano rocky wrestler what are you talking about that levant friends are my friends danier says that to get the power flowing we have to reactivate the other substations [Music] the power plants on but the cables couldn't take it 15 years took a toll atrophy muscularity means julieta untrained muscles wither come on frank's room is over there let's figure out why walt's turned it on in the first place good talk goggle better watch your back [Music] are we going one thing about frank do you see these people anywhere else they'd be savages at each other's throats but not here here they stay calm cool and collected because of frank they respect him because he was a night runner everyone here owes him something including me if it wasn't for frank i wouldn't be here and where would you be in a dark zone as a biter or in some den high and about to get higher frank will help us you can rely on him too trust me ready let's go break slaughtered us one by one like [ __ ] rabbits frank frank it's me wake up you where the [ __ ] you doing here in romney my conversation with robin's been dead for years frank pull yourself together you got a visitor who's that queen of [ __ ] england i gotta act old danny now this is aiden he has a gre access key waltz used it to turn on the electricity in town working gre key you're full of [ __ ] show it where'd you get it from one of walt's men so you want to watch this men too hey easy frank aiden is on our side we think this contains data proving what they did to us in the hospital so you still believe you'll find out why walt's [ __ ] up your childhood okay i'll tell you ready yeah because he's a [ __ ] psycho he's [ __ ] in the head that's your holy grail and arc of the covenant all in one load happy hayden right you and luang can get the [ __ ] out of my face now i got more important things in my mind it would have worked if that [ __ ] had showed up at the tv station you were right revic [ __ ] traitor without him we were like kids with slingshots going up against tanks we're not finished here frank this contains info on someone i'm looking for too i need to know how to read it it's a [ __ ] key not a diary you can use it to open doors start the electricity but it's useless on its own you need some place to stick it and before i tell you where you can stick it get out you'll give him your [ __ ] headache ravik you [ __ ] bastard why did you come back for this mission everything went wrong so many people so many wonderful people lawan says only you can help us lawan tends to run at the mouth and you know what it's mostly [ __ ] she's a junkie i picked up from the street understand you don't believe me ask her she'll tell you everything herself so what the [ __ ] if we got to that floor we were in a pile of [ __ ] not even close maybe this tower is not being won and will not be one you understand we're all gonna [ __ ] die and then it'll be cool you'll shut up too i didn't come this far to let you blow me off like this frank you came all this way to talk to little ole me well lottie [ __ ] dog congratulations you're a bigger loser than i am now get the [ __ ] out of here already see this revic he can't piss me off almost as much as you shut up that doesn't mean you can talk [ __ ] revic stop making excuses for this traitor denying what's happened frank damn it come back [ __ ] off kid while you're [ __ ] off take lawn with you i'm done the one it seems we're done here come on let's go walt's turned the power on with this key for the first time in years and i doubt he did that out of the kindness of his heart and you don't give a [ __ ] frank get your [ __ ] together you were a legend [ __ ] commander of the night runners do you even remember that that frankie's dead lawrence he died with the others of the tv station why the [ __ ] would waltz turn on the power don't ask me i want a clue but if you're looking for the gre database you need to find a terminal to access it the thing is i have no idea where one could be and those whom you are probably long dead but the good news is we'll probably be that ourselves soon enough cheers now get the [ __ ] out of my quarters [ __ ] drunkard you hear that [ __ ] something's happening will you chuck i'm right behind you my god it's not possible renegades are in the central loop i repeat renegades are in the center they're surrounding the fisheye can anyone hear me over [Applause] survivor they put a cannon on a nearby building to the east take it down [Applause] uh [Music] dude that was close aiden more renegades on the lower level there's a cannon on the roof to the west take that now uh yes uh [Applause] gotcha [ __ ] come on [Music] hmm [Music] all right [Music] they blocked the door i can't get in oh [ __ ] i'm on my way one aiden check who needs help and bring in some medics and make sure there's no more of those [ __ ] renegades in the area yes commander you you're right boy jackman come on frank you all right i saw you fight what's your name aidan if it weren't for you a lot more would be dead come on boys search the area sir i have a question we're looking for a gre database most gre equipment has been dead for years what do you need this database for with your knowledge of the city you know gre places inside out aidan and i need to find this database will you help us loan he's your friend aiden you could say that i've never heard of you aiden where are you from i'm a pilgrim i came from outside the walls so you've seen a lot you probably became thrilled villadore too right all right what do you want to know a lot has been going on there lately we lost our commander and the bizarrous tried to cut off our power source they say most of our people have been killed either by the infected or by those from the bazaar i also lost contact with the new commander ator in his unit know anything about them we found walt but he overpowered us and escaped what where in the tunnels near the car plant waltz decimated ater's squad i barely managed to escape i shouldn't have left them like this we need to find out what's going on there as for the gre equipment you're asking about you can ask lieutenant ro if something's working he'll know about it lately he and his unit have been securing the culvert islands and new dawn park areas but because of the butcher's raid we had to go radio silent so you have to look for him yourselves if you find him give him these what are they orders for him and the other units move it boys let's go come outside let's talk please my house got hit by a renegade missile where did you learn to fight like that where on the road as a pilgrim i had no other choice on the road don't you wonder sometimes what they gave us to make us like this stronger rather [ __ ] in the head but yeah [ __ ] up and stronger maybe i'll figure that out when i find mia but what's next well you heard it yourself row might know where you can access that damn database here take these orders to him just don't lose him or jack will gut me what about you i'll join you but first i have to see frank you saw him he's barely holding it together so uh frank he's not exactly the most reliable source of help you don't know what you're talking about he was a night runner even though these days he can't even say the name properly when he's drunk aren't the night runners ancient history history can repeat itself for good and for bad legends can't say what you want i believe that when the time comes if the time comes frank will rise to the occasion who knows maybe he'll even invite me to join the club and jack the commander do you trust him jack matt he's a smart guy but a bit of a narcissist what do you mean well he's only a major but refers to himself as commander-in-chief but he gave us rose location and a chance to find the gre terminal i don't care about the rest what about this rogue guy you know row two [ __ ] well i do he's a great commander and a [ __ ] hothead for some reason people say we have a lot in common once jack sent his squad to a spot that turned out to be a dark zone people panicked and they probably wouldn't have made it out of there but roe kept his cool makes them all back out and suddenly starts banging a stick on some barrels attracting the [ __ ] it was a suicidal plan but the vital thing was it was a plan that's what makes soldiers think clear again if the night runner still existed frank would have recruited him for sure okay good start with culvert island the pk have an outpost there hey luanne you should know that in old villadore i came into conflict with ader i blew up the peacekeeper's windmill and we really don't like each other are you afraid they'll figure out what you've done didn't you hear what jack was saying take it easy nobody has contact with old villadora here and even if there was someone by that time we'll have already found what we're looking for and stay on the radio all the time sure thing partner [Music] damn renegade one day they might just blow up the dam and flood the entire city pilgrim stay frosty there might still be tangos in the area okay [Music] we can live safely in the powered areas lawn i'm nearing culvert island great frank sorted out so i'm on my way if you get row to tell you where the terminal is let me know you'll find your sister i'll find the missing names of [ __ ] for my kill list everyone will be happy except the people you shoot they won't be in any condition to care ugh what the hell uh i hear the butcher's men are high hey i'm looking for the lieutenant got orders from matt matt you're not pk does it matter he gave them to me and here i am delivering him hey steady let's call someone and clear this up okay hey you there don't move a muscle for all i know you're a renegade with bogus orders wait i recognize his voice bart lawan loan is that you he's with me bart let him in or i'll kick your ass six ways from sunday laun what's going on here look matt sent aiden there because all his men are tied up matt orders bart let him through the lieutenant's there apologies are you just doing your job lieutenant raul i have orders from the commander i ain't row he went off of the squad to new don park i'm lieutenant grady great guess i got to keep going what are you talking about show me those orders son i was supposed to give them directly to roe and i'm wrong when rose not here it's called chain of command give him what the hell did the commander say why we're being pulled back to center he didn't seem too eager to explain anything to me i'm just the messenger okay boys time to pack it in commands ordered us to withdraw it's back to base for us we're doing what we're leaving this outpost don't question me you can't hide behind myers skirt out here you're you're abandoning us what do we do we'll be defenseless go arm the survivors then we roll if i were you i'd give them plenty of weapons the renegade sent a whole detachment to the fisheye any other bright ideas civilian just a question where can i find row new dawn park like i said i'm not sure if they made it yet you take these to them and tell them i'm on it better you than me buddy rose gonna blow his top when he reads these and i'm here to save lives not lose mine yeah thanks for the tip [ __ ] we won't stand a chance i'm really sorry civilian but we have orders you can't leave us if the renegades come will be dead within a day easy there civilian will army arm us old men and women all the youngsters have already joined the pk not much i can do civilian now move what if i don't will you strike a defenseless man might as well just kill us before you leave save the renegades the trouble i said move did you hear hey what's wrong this all of this we're supposed to be protecting people figures the chicken out roided out [ __ ] always have tiny balls we're supposed to leave defenseless civilians to the butcher's mercy i i put up with a lot of [ __ ] because i believe in our mission but if no one else believes we should stay protect the civilians everyone i'm going to new dawn park apparently roe went there i still don't understand why the renegade they've got their camps but butcher hasn't attacked fisheye since never even he respected the night runner so no [ __ ] clue what's going on in his head are you kidding me [Music] [Applause] i'm sorry i'm not i saw my dad once in my whole life and if mom was good at anything it was drinking she abandoned me that's how you ended up in walt's program more or less and your parents remember them no i just remember the hospital pain and the fire right before they split me and mia up she's the only family you got last year let's focus on the job okay [Music] okay tough guy last one there's a rotten egg i was on my last legs thanks for showing up when we did stay back man leave me alone please hey i'm looking for lieutenant rowe you seen him who are you why do you want to know i have orders from major matt lieutenant grady said he was here it'll be okay where's your squatting commander were making camp when renegades attacked us bro and the others they got a few then they went after the ones that tried to run what about you couldn't keep up and lost contact with them and then another group attacked me what are they doing here the renegades weren't attacking our positions in the center oh [ __ ] hey still some wraps here be careful all right go to hell sure already leaving aren't we gentlemen [Music] come on hey you are safe now you can come out so um where's wrong camp was supposed to be up there on the hotel roof by the junction with newell's drive there's a winch in the back of the building you can take that up if they haven't been able to come back yet that's where you'll find them thanks if you can make it back to base on your own go there and don't let yourself get chased into a box again [Music] come on quick [Music] suckers let's get the scumbags i need to get myself a new weapon at the armory this one was worn out how's it going not yet but i ran across some renegades let's kick those renegades asses hey over here oh that was close man thanks get that [Music] good they're taken care of check the status of the squad downstairs just sir lieutenant sir are the renegades outside they won't bother you you took them out who are you aiden i got orders from jack matt well [ __ ] me let's look at what santa's elsa brought us withdrawal now just some kind of [ __ ] joke know how many men i lost to secure this miserable plot of land look i don't lieutenant but i have other five of our very best bartes killed more virals than an entire unit sierra and little ron they've been fighting at my side since before the fall they gave their lives for that scrap of the city and now what i'm supposed to pull back listen yeah i'm just a messenger just calm down and talk oh you don't think i'm calm i'm a [ __ ] oasis of zen nirvana [ __ ] walking bartez's husband how's he gonna keep calm huh when i leave her body on this godforsaken turf sierra and brosco's mom she's not gonna be calm to learn her boys died here in vain what did i tell him all this for nothing just cause matt signed a piece of paper and sent it to me we do the real work out here and it's nothing to matt to take it all away with a smear of ink [ __ ] total [ __ ] i'm looking for access to the gre database i hear you know where i can do that yeah i do but why the [ __ ] would i tell you under the circumstances i got important if idiotic business to attend to get out of my sight okay gentlemen gather the dog tags of the fallen it [ __ ] sucks but an order's an order bro wait luan you come to piss me off too you know me ro aiden and me both are looking for that gre database and you're gonna tell us you wanna drag this out or take care of it here and now [ __ ] why are you after the database i've heard it was stored on servers in the observatory command center but that building was destroyed in the chemical attacks years ago the bombings came one after the other like we were the [ __ ] viet cong nothing was left understand nada if you want check for yourselves gentlemen we're going [Music] what's next next didn't you hear that database sounds long gone so much for discovering the mystery of our childhood i'll go back to looking for the shits on my hit list and you you can enjoy life in the center maybe rose wrong maybe something survived intact after all the butcher dropped chemicals the place was reduced to toxic rubble you given up are you deaf or dumb those chemical bombs destroyed everyone and everything they touched this was a [ __ ] waste of time frank was right i am [ __ ] naive what's the deal with those renegades why did they attack the canteen how would i know williams is a [ __ ] lunatic a butcher and a murderer he killed half the city with a chemical weapon strike now he's ordering his men to attack civilians in the center right after waltz turned on the power walt and that psychopath are buddies i wouldn't be surprised if they planned that together as well i'm going to the observatory then you're going alone so splitting up all good things must come to an end the butcher and the pricks from my list they'll find this out soon enough i'm going back to looking for them you shouldn't stay here either aiden i'm sorry you didn't find your sister yeah thanks you've always got waltz he probably knows what happened to her if i find him i'll let you know good luck gotcha take care of the one go there's nothing more to say hello hello we're under attack red gates they surrounded us on the island we don't stand a chance i'm begging you help who me hmm yes i could i could definitely paint you but but no no i have to avoid distractions not if i want to finish my greatest work the greatest work was that a grand fresco my magnum opus a painting of epic proportions the world is not prepared to see but i can't finish it i i don't have the proper shade of red red yes the reddest red i need it badly and all these idiot merchants have is some kind of pale joke without the reddest red my project will remain incomplete and my art will not find the expression it requires of course i could get my hands on but but no that's just such a crazy idea it sends shivers down my spine let's hear it oh my uh are you sure that okay then i i have to admit i already experimented in secret and what i need is blood of the infected but not just any infected i find the blood of a goon is the only one that is apt to give me the true deep red i need i've been observing this particular goon in a certain area and i've taken to leaving out red wine for it to drink wine should make its blood an even more intense shade it becomes rather aggressive after drinking the wine do you think you're up to the task of bringing me the creature's blood sure sounds like fun go then come back when you've acquired it's blood [Music] come on [Music] [Music] [Music] you see that the [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] you can come out they can't bother you now what happened here when we were just working then they attacked went for our supplies and cut down anyone in their way yeah but not everyone the others where are they i didn't see anyone else he must have been taken oh god maria robert they took my friends have they been attacking other camps survivors from the camp to the south said that they were attacked today too they took food and the able-bodied young men forced them to join them apparently we all knew the renegades are nasty sons of [ __ ] but they kept their distance from us until now you know where they would have taken your friends the border between the butcher's turf and ours is close to here that's where the renegades have their camp will you help them please there are no peacekeepers here no one to help them i'll try thank you be careful they might have outposts along the route i'll guide you over the radio my name's casper what did uh do to you hmm [Music] hmm that survivor was right something is really [ __ ] wrong here i'm at the first outpost there's no sign of your friends they must have moved on toward the camp uh further west on fulton tower road catch them before they get there i'm on my way don't understand they said the renegades are dangerous but the cease fire lasted for years it's as if they no longer fear the peacekeepers what changed that maybe we're about to find out i'll be in touch poppies is something wrong no nothing talking to myself that's all i can see something's the matter but okay it's just there's nothing that can be done there are too many of them too many who renegades degenerates six months ago they kidnapped my son rook and they forced me to produce drugs for them i was the chemistry teacher in school before the epidemic i held one of them back great but what about your son they're holding him hostage if i'm late with the next batch of drugs they'll kill him maybe what these bandits need is a lesson but there's a whole band of them i've faced far worse odds than that i'm not a fan of kidnapping will you help me yeah i'll try we're the keeping rook in the military building overlooking the canal south of muddy grounds near culvert island the entrance is on saint paul boulevard past the red car carrier just be careful i went there myself once trying to free my boy they caught me [Music] then later brought me one of brooke's fingers as long as these bastards are alive they'll never leave us alone i'll be careful i'll follow you wait outside for you to come out what's your name aidan thank you hayden [Music] i haven't slept away for six months what are they doing come on uh there's no one here either they might have stopped at the overlook by the windmill on garrison boulevard hurry up if they reach camp it'll be much harder to rescue them i'll catch up to them i think i saw who was commanding those renegades it was elias he was a survivor uh lived in the area two years ago he was a lawyer before the epidemic of man of principle and he disappeared there was a lot of talk about it it disappeared a year ago this guy came sniffing around here one of the butcher's men they said and that he worked for the gre back in the day he tried to talk people into going to the dam promised them weapons the ones who did never came back [Music] when i saw elias just before he looked strung out like he was on drugs his eyes what looks terrifying [Music] i'll look into it [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah i made it all i found were some renegades here so they made it to the camp there's no saving my friends now i'll scout out the camp and see what i find their ass but we can't give up help them please uh yes uh that's weird [Music] god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] dinner hmm

what did they serve yesterday yesterday hulk biomarker oh you again you don't recognize me ah the guy with matt's orders bravo report to meyer in dispatch the commander is on his way back from the field does matt often go out on field missions used to be it was hardly ever on the ship i was in the field i was helping that's why i joined the peacekeepers but lately matt's been acting weird i'm not sure what that's about it's been this way since before old villadore and the renegade attack there now this [ __ ] with the withdrawal i don't get it whatever is going on i hope he addresses the men soon helps us understand this [ __ ] withdrawal he's probably got his reasons whatever they are innocent people are gonna get killed go see meyer thanks you can go [Music] [Music] hey where's dispatch [Music] there all right man we take care of the uv lamps and head back to base it should be on point fast and easy go go go they've already attacked two of them everything we can to arm you if needed real easily if you could intervene why'd you leave in the first place this is [ __ ] wasn't your father some famous war hero i bet he's rolling over in his grave watch your mouth civilian things are tough all over you know that you need to get married go make yourself useful ah you i remember you from the canteen yeah i guess from the fight in the canteen uh maybe don't sweat it you can really hold your own i respect that aidan right commander told me to brief you about faction matters missy welcomes you uh who's missy it's the name of the ship you're standing in she played a key role during the revolution missy was meant to deliver drugs masks and other critical medical supplies then returned home but by then home was gone she and her crew had nowhere to go and what about now now she serves as pk headquarters in command central all directives are issued from right here smart easier to defend than a building exactly what did those survivors want talking about our little argument they want what everyone wants safety which i understand but we have to keep our eye on the bigger picture here and it pisses me off when people mention my father i i don't mean to pry but what's the deal with your father this again since you're new here i'll tell you the short version classic story saved a bunch of his fellow soldiers some civilians and got a medal what was this long time ago back when people were only fighting each other and not each other and infected at the same time joe is he why you joined the military pretty much he must have been very proud sure why not where is matt in the field he came across a lead in old villadore you gotta wait see that board i got plenty that needs doing and not enough men you want to pick up some of our slack we pay well [ __ ] that's major math something's happened haters in really bad shape take him to the infirmary summon the medics we have to save him hang on a tour we won't let you go you hear me get moving better hope ader survives we lost too many people in old vilidor jack will do all he can to find out who did this juan would rather enjoy his caviar than take care of that lamb delivery you're siding with the enemy someday those chickens move along [Music] here the pk engineers are working on alarms and electric traps i recognize your uniform um you're one of those carriers right sure need a message delivered no i'm in the market for information not sending it and nothing i can do for you so i hear but uh and maybe your boss can help me our guildmaster driscoll maybe i don't know he has the authority but you'd have to be a very special case i don't know about me but what i'm after is important you can try to speak to driscoll but don't get your hopes up story of my life where can i find him in a headquarters on downtown court inside the metro station that bears the same name you'll know it when you see it and driscoll you can't miss him sounds good thanks a lot [Music] knows what he's doing hey you want to be sent back to the outlands keep that bio marker in plain true what's the situation know what this is these brass knuckles belonged first to commander lucas then they passed on to etor what happened in old villadore it can't happen again we have to save the city aiden from the plague from the butcher and his men whatever they're planning okay but over the radio you said you have information for me yes but before we get down to that tell me aiden what do you need this database for what does it contain i'm looking for my sister what happened to her long time ago waltz heard her he took her from me and i want him to tell me where she is if she's still alive somewhere that's why i was looking for the gre command center to access walt's database on its servers so we have a common enemy meaning waltz that's the butcher's right-hand man he pumps his men full of inhibitors we can get them both i brought you here because i know that a few gre scientists are hiding out in the city we picked up the trail of one of them right before the renegade attack sounds promising when i find a scientist we'll see what they know if they're of no use we'll find another and another until you get the answers you're looking for why are the former gre in hiding they're afraid of the wrath of the people people angry because the gre spread the infection so it's true the gre brought in the virus who else they say they performed experiments in their bases they brought in containers from haran at night in secret from the government and then everything collapsed in revenge people captured the scientists and hanged them from land posts and killed the only people who had a chance of finding a cure there is no cure and there never will be aiden that's gre propaganda fine what do you want return what do you think i want maybe the same thing both of us want the city has electricity again the renegades are on the attack for the first time since the war ended they attacked her outposts in the city center but new possibilities have opened up for us as well thanks to the electricity we can fire up the biggest antenna in the center on the vnc tower spire well you want to defeat the butcher using radio in a way the signal will let me reach a larger number of people communication between settlements will be improved we'll enlist more recruits and defend the city and then it will be easier to find the surviving gre doctors you need i'll do my part but what guarantee do i have that you'll help me after you don't trust me aiden i haven't been here that long but i can already tell that kept promises are rare in this city if we don't find any of the gre scientists i promise i'll get waltz for you you're working with luan which makes me think you're looking for him too okay i'm in good the butcher attacked for a reason i want to make sure this city is safe no matter what you alright sir maya will share our plan with you go see her as soon as you can oh and aiden you don't have to call me sir to friends i'm jack okay jack god damn renegade these renegades it seems they're everywhere not for long once we get the transmitter on top of the vnc tower the butcher will have to retreat i'm not sure it's going to be so simple jack simple i heard you're doing a hell of a job clearing the city of rats do you think they might be looking for something in the center i mean they keep coming but it's not like an organized attack of course it's not organized because it's being led by a madman if williams is really crazy why didn't he just flood the city with the toxic water instead of sending in random excursions crazy is as crazy does aiden given how easily he could do it destroying the city isn't his goal not all at once at least by sending in bloodthirsty renegades the butcher's just creating chaos for its own sake so the good people of the city become steeped in fear as he sits there in his high throne in white [ __ ] gloves and listens to classical music that sounds pretty [ __ ] up to me but we can counteract his terrorism with our campaign of enlightenment that's why it's so vital to get the transmitter operating so the people know the true enemy then we can defend ourselves properly nothing i think i know everything i need good luck then until today i thought our chances against renegades were pretty good but now i'm not so sure okay [Music] move along citizen what the hell is supply doing delivering no stephen a filthy herb brother will decide my husband's fate is that why you got a medical degree to go running to quacks for magic cures listen we don't have medicine herbs are our only chance my husband has fought for you for years you must get medicine for him not some herbs that might poison him time to go kids how is he atroor is strong but he needs medicine and that unfortunately we don't have we did the best we could with what we have after the chemical attack some plants gained healing properties they work like an antibiotic but still i people here have strong opinions about healers but you can hardly blame them the folk healers give sound advice but it can prove difficult to follow correctly misremember something gather the wrong herb or use the wrong dosage and instead of medicine you administer poison which has happened plenty because if somebody messes up one of the steps of the recipe it could kill him exactly but it's enough to listen carefully to the healer's instructions and follow them the herbalist i know she's talented she's aetor's only hope and what's his wife's problem superstitions die hard margaret has helped many people everywhere some just don't want to admit it i think i can help you'd be doing us a big favor what happened in old veldedore is terrible we've lost so many people as far as i know ator is our only witness so if he dies we don't find out what happened there exactly where can i find this healer on covet island don't worry you can trust parker doctors are the real heroes they always were even before the 2020 pandemic broke out hey you want to be sent back to the outlands keep that biomarker in plain view [Music] don't just matt told me to see you yes he wanted me to give you this a little reward for helping us peacekeepers a uv flashlight could come in handy thanks we said something about a plan the vnc tower now that the lights are on we can use the tv antenna to broadcast our call for mobilization but first we need to get to the top and that's a long road what do you want to know tell me more about this radio station on the tower it's the tallest building in vilador it was once a symbol of the city's greatness now a symbol of its fall why do you say that that antenna could bring the city together once more but anyone who goes up there trying to fire it up guess what happens nothing good i bet damn right the city's potential shining beacon is a death trap we're hoping it'll be different this time we're gonna light it up with uv lamps [Music] what makes it so dangerous a volatile nest inside so we think it's the biggest dark zone around once night runners tried to take it over they wanted to use the antenna to connect all the separate groups of survivors give the people some hope but they never even got close to the antenna and in the end the night runners were wiped out [Music] wait wiped out you mean every last night runner that's the problem frank had it all carefully planned but for his plan to have worked he'd need everyone all hands on deck and that didn't happen not everyone believed in the plan so there was a rift frank thought they'd come around in time but not everyone came around after all the plan went to [ __ ] it was horrifying those who heard the night runners screams on the radio that night still have nightmares about it what happened to the group that refused to join the mission split up drifted apart whoever led the descent was branded a traitor and the night runners faded into a shameful memory after that we shouldn't waste time on the past we need our heads in the game here and now [Music] okay let's get going are the lights in place they would be if juan from supplies would just do his job for once i take it that he didn't he's been playing hide and seek the last few days and he's late getting on my nerves so look in on ron first see what his deal is and when you do find him kick him in the ass tell him it's from me hope that flashlight serves you well [Music] dispatcher sent me to check on the status of an order yeah yeah [ __ ] pks think we can just make the stuff appear magically just point me to your commander and i'll get out of your hair juan's pretty busy right now he doesn't have time for you we'll tell him to find the time jack matt sent me no one supervises juan buddy juan is just juan get with the program besides he ain't here you want to find him ask his assistant where he is just remember you're on supplier turf now mind your manners i hear the pk engineers [Music] looking for juan rainer you don't appear to be on a schedule it's urgent the commander sent me so i can't take a message no i need to talk to him in person where is he unfortunately i can't help miss reyna's whereabouts are no one's business what if he must anything else oh wait but you're no fun what about your boss what's he do for fun mithirena is well known as a connoisseur of the finest things in life food drink and pretty much anything that walks on two legs is he near any of these so-called finer things right now maybe i can drop in on him there nice try but no i won't say matt's not going to be happy juan is not particularly concerned with the little mages feelings do come again in the wine getting settled in the city working on it meyer and jack sent me to supply interesting bunch not like any of the other pks i've met that might be because they're not bks eagle eye business is their true faith i see anyway i can't track down their boss juan he likes to make himself scarce probably lurking around the fisheye the canteen the slick bastards even got his own table there bribes the cook to bring him off menu goods he lives like the fall never took place i'll look for him there good luck finding him and good luck if you do find him excuse me yes what are you reading cannival of the sad into bondage are you i'm afraid not people trying to tie me down bad memories no no of course you're not but don't worry maybe you'll grow into it one day why don't juan and jack matt uh like each other because jack matt wants everyone to be like jack matt and i for example want everyone to be who they want to be maybe that's why juan and i get along so well after all the world has ended yes the rules have changed so i do what i want and don't ask anyone for permission anymore gotta go now audra [Music] [Music] [Music] what's the matter i'm hugh and you're the pilgrim who turned on the electricity right word travels fast and word is you you help people and sometimes is that why you called me i i need help my kid went off the water tower earlier and hasn't come back i'm worried how long has he been gone about six hours now that's a long time wouldn't normally worry he's such a strong kid built like an ox but it's been such a long time hmm how old's your son does it matter i just want my kid back i would take care of it myself but but there are three young children waiting for me at home i can't leave them unattended okay i'll take a look for you it's not safe here let's meet in my place after you found him it's down on lower damn promenade hmm [Music] [Music] now jackass detected uh [Music] [Music] got a lot of money [Music] you lost man we didn't call for a waiter i've got orders to find you from meyer and the commander and my name's i know who you are aiden after that bang up with the renegades half the canteen wants to name their most precious offspring after you including vinnie here but you interrupted our meal state your purpose in one sentence then please make yourself scarce oh you know perfectly well why i'm here the uv lamps meyer says you owe the peacekeepers of delivery and you think your barking will make an impression on me the lummoxin chief jack thinks he can scent his terrier and everyone will wet themselves in terror but what can i expect he can't tell the difference between champagne and a crystal chalice or water from a dog's bowl he has an ounce of refinement isn't that right vinny i don't know don't be afraid it's not like jack is gonna march in and have you hanged at least not now ah ah vinny when will you grow a spine you want my attention aiden show me you deserve it what can you offer me look i could help you out as easily as i'm trying to help matt i don't doubt that i've heard you were a pilgrim but you're new here smashing the skulls of a few peasants doesn't mean everyone wants to lift you up on their backs you have to be more subtle with people everyone has their own desire their their own price your pitch just isn't working for me quite yet try again how about a court martial matt can do that right a court martial you have no idea who you're talking to do you who would hash out the contracts with the suppliers who would feed the army provide it with weapons and clothing a week without me and the peacekeepers will be left with nothing supply is everything try again man and don't improv this time i'm you've used up all your time didn't pique my interest what is it you want juan like they used to say if you gotta ask the price you can't afford it we're turning to more pressing matters and what should we try did you make headway with the papa's ass never met a guy quite like him before [Music] let me guess he scarfed down five courses and had a hot young woman at his side a young man but the rest is accurate he's a piece of work all right well i need him to get back to work jack needs uv lamps and juan's dragging his feet hmm that'll be tough juan barely listens to jack so he'll be an even tougher audience for you he has his own men and power base and he loves rubbing jack's nose in that and what can i do about that same as everyone else bribe him he likes fine art antiques expensive [ __ ] from before the fall when he sees something that used to be valuable he can't stop himself zero self-control hmm all right where can i find something like that i heard of an old polish guy who lived in a penthouse by liberation passage they say he was an art collector you can try his place you can only get there via power glider that's why there's a chance something is left i'll be on the radio and guide you to him what about you huh going on a hunt no a party it's daniel's birthday but you never know when a guest list will overlap with a hit list why don't you come and have a drink with us when you're done with one i don't think daniel likes me he doesn't like anybody we'll be in touch detected [Music] uh uh [Music] [Music] hmm the one there's nothing left in here daniel said it's a virgin spot keep looking uh he took his paintings but no room for jessica one romantic son of a [ __ ] ah [ __ ] there aren't any paintings left everything's been destroyed in the one found our collector for no sign of his collection the one hey you there jesus i told you i was leaving okay quick thing nothing here except for a bottle of whiskey and one of vodka at least the whiskey's the good stuff juan likes a good whiskey maybe if you get him shit-faced he'll loosen up so to speak see he's still in the canteen i saw him leaving seemed to be heading back to the ship probably to his quarters okay i'll go there and listen that vodka daniel is a big fan if you're planning to drop by which you probably aren't but if you really want to get to know this city this is the way just saying [Music] [Music] oh my god [Music] happy birthday daniel oh so you have calm after all uh here a little something to celebrate another year on the planet what do you want from me gacho what do you mean what do you need why the gift all of a sudden wait the one said it's your birthday so i thought i understand the concept of a birthday gift to get it sir dino wall yeah uh okay uh listen happy birthday huh last for that but at least i have something to cheer me up robert never mind lavon is at the bar you came you invited me didn't you want me here let me get a bottle so you can catch up with us hey ro off duty hmm listen you know how stressful things can be sometimes you get your orders they don't make any sense you're fighting the clock to get [ __ ] done oh i feel you trust me so you made it luann won it won is this about some bet yeah with daniel she was sure you'd come him not so much it's almost as if it mattered to her that's unusual here aidan drink nicholas's finest booze we were about to play a game no luan we weren't come on i'm out yeah count me out too drunk already a bunch of losers aiden are you playing what's game don't bother you'll just end up really drunk and humiliated aiden the longer we talk the more time we give this grump to back out you in or out [Music] okay let's do it my man rules are simple you either answer an awfully personal question about yourself or you must perform the dare okay so if i don't want to answer the question i get to pick the dare you wish we decide whether it's a truth or dare if you don't do as you're told you drink so have you slept with anyone in villadore [Music] no are you for real oh maybe the guy has standards fall in love first and all that crap yeah good luck with that not everyone is like you ro okay your turn i want to hear you play [ __ ] off wait what do you mean i'll drink forget about it you play an instrument never mind i drank moving on she used to play the ukulele really guys moving on aiden you play for ro and i dare you to ask ro to sing it's awful [Music] truth i look at you and i wonder who were you before all this good call we really didn't want to hear him sing believe me who was roe before he became a tough-as-nails peacekeeper a father and a husband you were a father i lost my kids at the beginning of all this i uh i tried to save him i almost did but at the end i was the only one who survived now i'm alive with regrets how how did they infected worse people a group of raiders typical bandits at a time tried to take our food i wasn't gonna stand idle and give up everything we had i had to defend my family i was proud outnumbered i didn't for the follow-up okay enough of this anything you want to ask the master assassin here i always wondered about that hit list shut up bro it's not your turn oh yeah the hit list how did it start with a bastard who had to pay for what he did it started with one then there was another one and then a whole bunch of them but who was the first one that's another question drink no he's just making you answer the first one who cares what he asked it started way before that when i escaped from waltz frank helped me he showed me that there's something else i can do with all my anger back then i thought i'd join them be a night runner someday who was i kidding they were wiped out at the vnc tower frank lost almost everyone nightrunners fell frank started to drink gave up on life on himself so i'm not a night runner but at least i have my list good night did i ask the wrong question that's the beauty of this game pilgrim sooner or later you get to the wrong question i'll see you soon i guess [Music] gojo here you are thank you thank you for the vodka thank you let's drink for me and another year in this [ __ ] you're not the worst you know why are you finally warming up to me nah it just means there are worse [ __ ] and that i'm drunk where's lavon i saw her with you now we played the game and i asked the wrong question how the hit list started ah god you gotcha you got her thinking about the past listen and i'm not telling you this because i like you i don't even [ __ ] know why i am telling you this but never never ask lavan about her past you get it good now get lost it's my birthday [Music] [Music] he is a snack isn't he dear care to join more the merrier no thank you oh if i embarrassed you i'm sorry i do have that effect on people i'll wait for you but make it quick i must admit i admire your persistence almost curious what you do after i send you packing yet again you'll regret it sixteen-year-old highland single malt bottled a year before the pandemic broke out [Music] i've read that one barrel of this stuff sold at auction for over half a million dollars what a sublime present [Music] to your health handsome what can i say you broke down my defenses so you're still after those lamps did matt tell you why he wanted them and why he really wanted them yeah to take control of the tv tower wait he's serious is he crazy nobody tried that for over a decade so i guess it's dangerous that's what the lamps are for but lamps need electricity to run the last i heard the juice ain't flowing there people have tried to take it without power heroes and fools alike all ended up as volatile snacks that's matt's problem what do you care i care because something's not right can't you sense that as well aidan matt wants to prepare to defend the city from the butcher's coming attack so we should start building him a monument right only problem the butcher isn't planning any attack how do you know i have my spies among the renegades as well since the end of the war we have occupied the city center while the colonel squats in the dam one push of a lever and half the city will find itself under toxic water the colonel is not stupid he knows war would be the end of everything so why did the butcher attack the canteen that's in the city center good question maybe it wasn't the colonel who gave the order something more is going on is something we don't yet understand what about the uv lamps why does he want them then jack is hiding something for a while now he's been ordering way more lamps than he could possibly need and then some of those lamps always disappear no accounting for them once we deliver why would jack skim uv lamps and here friend the mystery takes flight jack never got over the fact that he didn't defeat the butcher back when he had the chance years ago he knew that if he attacked the dam the colonel would close the floodgates and the rising water levels would push the chemicals up out of the ground burning through everything that lives in the city it's been a stalemate for over 10 years each waiting for the other to make a move but then someone turned the power on and something changed and the renegades attacked the canteen i'm not here for my health juan i need the lamps to find out what happened to your sister right aidan i told you i got my spies might be able to find something out about waltz and your sister specifically about the gre scientists you and matt are trying to contact i'd even say with my resources i can find this person faster than matt i actually doubt he's able to find them at all [Music] let's help each other smart man barely in town a minute and you picked the right side already i'll give you the lamps that'll keep matt from getting suspicious but then go to the cathedral there's a guy hiding out there total nut job but a tech savant get him to fix this old piece of spy tech if we get it working we can bug the transmitter jack once the place is on top of the vnc spire have him do his thing by tapping matt's comms we'll find out what he's doing with the extra lamps and knowing's half the battle kiddo [Music] wanna talk more about whiskey [Music] [Music] [Music] uh ugh [Music] hey ugh ugh [Music] uh hey i'm aiden what's your name [Music] match i was asked to bring you home what about the infected up there there aren't any it's safe then uh i'll just hang here tell hugh i'll be back later look your father wants you home he's worried you ain't my father i just work for him like a slave i don't want to do that anymore i don't want to go back you can't make me what's hugh's real story never mind i don't want to get other boys into trouble no it's okay you can tell me stay out of it okay it's none of your business fine i'll talk to him myself you really want to stay here sure not my first time alone in the city i can take care of myself i bet hey aidan thanks for clearing out the infected no problem kid [Music] ugh uh [Music] uh [Music] ugh [Music] it's [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] you want one sent me on an errand into the cathedral is there anything i should know about not much just that people say it's haunted haunted by what a ghost yeah right anyway the cathedral's been locked up for years but there's scaffolding around it you can probably use that to climb to a window and get inside still sure you want to run errands for juan might as well suit yourself big boy what happened where's match he says he's not coming back it doesn't want to work for you anymore what's he mean hugh none of your business you made it my business when you sent me after match got me there so what exactly are you doing with these kids hugh matt seemed desperate not to come back fine i'll tell you i'm training them to survive come again i've taught him to steal and spy for you or anyone who pays are you crazy hugh if the peacekeepers catch them they'll have no mercy that's the first thing i teach them how not to get caught it's a [ __ ] up world pilgrim no one's gonna go easy on these orphans i'm living proof of that i teach them how to survive isn't that what fathers do for their children match doesn't understand that not now he's at that rebellious age when he makes it in the city he'll realize it's because i prepared him you're not gonna go after him not holding anyone here we're family uh hmm [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh hmm uh you can't [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] well [ __ ] this [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [ __ ] [Music] okay inhibitor container nearby uh [Music]

[Music] ugh [Music] ugh [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the poor guy's not gonna make it one at a time [Music] they say you're a pilgrim haven't you found your place yet were you a pilgrim i know a female pilgrim and there weren't many of us but that's why i was so good at it no one would recognize me as a pilgrim some men thought that as a woman it would be easier to deceive me rob me my first reflexes and sharp dagger taught them otherwise how'd you end up in villadore i got this goddamn job a guy wanted me to deliver a package to villadore to some woman who was well known before the outbreak apparently she played video games professionally weird job eh anyway the guy paid me a lot but on one condition i couldn't know what was in the package and that was my big mistake i carried this damn thing for 50 kilometers and with each step it got heavier i sneaked into villadore found this woman and delivered the package she opened it in front of me found out it was a jar with a human head inside whose head i don't really know i got the [ __ ] out of there right quick is that why you quit the life well i felt that actually that i was constantly running away from something maybe from myself this is a big city even a pilgrim can belong here nobody judges you for what you were before like they do in the smaller towns who you used to be beyond the walls what you once did they kept you on the move you can disappear in the city that's how i found my place and what about you aiden don't you want to stop running maybe someday but first i have to finish what i started here i understand just remember this you can't run away from yourself good luck pilgrim [Music] welcome stranger what is this place i concoct and sell everything from healing elixirs to powerful wards against the infected ah snake oil then you will address the bubble with respect oh will i do a man corvus he is uh overprotective tell me more about your so-called elixirs by the looks of what's in these jars someone's been scavenging graveyards they're talking about my ingredients both rare and potent i combine them to create wonders some emit a scent that can cause an infected to come running no matter what lies in its path others pheromones that can cause most infected to flee madly and still others grand fists are fire that will burn an opponent with each blow theatrics aside i'm intrigued tell me about your healing elixirs i sell anything from cells for the gravest wounds to potions that cure illness and disease a young man like you might wish to try my virility

role of chief physician of the gre while i understand the higher-ups need a scapegoat for the virus leak your expulsion seems counterproductive all the more reason to thank you for agreeing to review my reports before i send them to the gre board october 20th 2021 a gre report on the state of the epidemic with the first cases in zurich and paris the plague spread like wildfire or dealing with a variant of the 2014 strain we call it tacky transmissive heron virus or thv it's deadly and highly transmissible we recommend immediate action all european borders must be closed immediately all civilian air and rail services suspended national governments must introduce civil procedures as follows isolate individuals thought to be infected quarantine anyone who's been in close contact with them issues shelter at home orders immediately as for the dead bodies should be incinerated implementing restrictions now will slow the spread of the virus we need time to create a vaccine and have begun working with private sector companies our diligence in the coming weeks will decide on our fate i'm recording this for posterity so they can learn from my mistakes to warn all who follow about the worst of plagues and i am not referring to the virus i was born into a very religious family my earliest childhood memories prayer every morning and every evening knees scraped from constant contact with oak floorboards when i grew up i had a very hard time i was lonely i suffered despite my upbringing i turned to religion for solace it gave me the answers i sought that i came to realize my father had tried to give me to endure bullying is to earn heavenly rewards god was my best friend my only friend i talked to him every day and i believed that he listened to me and answered and loved me too i felt like i owed him a debt that's why i enrolled in seminary i think i became a fanatic in a way the urge to spread his teachings convert others it was not about god it was about my own shortcomings it was about me there was something unhealthy about it and dangerous at the age of 23 i became a priest still just a snot-nosed kid and i was supposed to be a shepherd of souls i felt i was meant for this i had answered the call if god was with me then who could be against me i was full of conviction faith that i could make the world a better place but the world had other plans many times i performed someone's last rites i held their hands as they died and in that last moment in the millisecond before their last breath i saw in them relief not because they were moving on to some kind of better world to heaven but because it was the end of something painful they could finally bow out of the futile and exhausting dance of life their chore of living would be over their suffering would end it was something completely incomprehensible to me how can a person reject the gift of life to accept death joyfully for a person as strong as me this was something very disturbing or maybe they knew about something that i had not seen did they see it in their last moment this was the first crack in the edifice of my faith and then the epidemic started there's a term for what came next a crisis of faith and with me it started long before the epidemic but when people started to turn into monsters when city after city was eaten by darkness and poison i started to wonder where is god is he putting us through a trial or has he abandoned us when black monday came i no longer had any doubts there is no god there never was because of the thv genmont bombings two million people lost their lives the streets carpeted with human corpses what god would allow that he would have to be infinitely cruel of course other so-called men of the cloth offered nonsensical observations that this was the will of god punishment for our wickedness that colonel williams himself served as the hand of god but that didn't matter anymore the curtain had been torn off people lost their faith because what were they supposed to believe in no one wanted a god like that and in that moment to my own surprise i felt free as if i were a puppet who finally cut the strings that controlled him since birth free at last my name is anton novak and i'll be a [ __ ] legend sorry i couldn't help myself i'm recording this for you pops you want to hear a secret you know when you do i bet you'll be ashamed of yourself all my life you told me i wouldn't amount to anything but then i became a pk what'd you do called me a traitor and dad explained that the pk don't give a [ __ ] about us the people of the bazaar thanks for the vote of confidence pops there ain't no one i don't give a rat's ass about pops i'll show you what i'm made of today some guy i didn't recognize approach me said if i was looking to be a hero i was looking in the wrong place and that i have potential i never heard that from you said to meet him on the roof of the old textile factory at midnight and here i am like an idiot what am i doing here maybe i wanted to show you i i wanted you to see oh [ __ ] dude jumping between buildings like [ __ ] panther [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] i can't let them find me come on out kid i know you're here i'll kill you villain door tell me pilgrim do these ancient walls not whisper their sacred history into your very ears saint paul's cathedral is along with orla castle the oldest building in the city it originated in 1010 as a christian church that was built on the site of a former pagan temple subsequent work continued to expand the church which became a cathedral in 1207. its catacombs host many holy relics including a toe from the left foot of saint paul this made the cathedral a popular christian pilgrimage destination in 1444 another relic a finger from the apostle to the gentiles was stolen eventually the cathedral's popularity began to wane until it acquired a molar of saint paul's the cathedral briefly regained its status only to see its pilgrimages to grind steadily once more finally after a hundred year period the finger of saint paul was recovered and the cathedral was again able to attract thousands of faithful dear listeners you may find this strange but to me this is something very important my daughter renata is getting married in a week she was supposed to get married over a year ago she had invited over 200 guests she was so happy but then you know phv happened we had to cancel everything we were hoping that the gre would get the situation under control that the restrictions would be loosened over time but as you can see it's only gotten worse some of the overseas guests we invited well they're gone in the end we decided to hold the wedding with only those closest to us in attendance it is very important to renata and waldek that this happens and for me it's important to bake a cake for them it has been a tradition in my family for generations the mother bakes a wedding cake for her daughter unfortunately a week ago someone stole my hands i realized that now most food down to each small egg is worth its weight in goal but if some kind soul were to share some eggs with us i would be eternally grateful stay healthy daria hello my dears i hope you are holding on in these difficult times you're healthy and safe i trust i am life over the past 77 years has tried to kill me time and again i guess i'm immortal i live alone in a large heart my beloved wife valerie passed away in 2018. actually i'm glad she died then so that she didn't have to watch the planet go to hell i have a son daniel who lives with his wife and my three granddaughters in berlin but i haven't been able to contact them for months i'm afraid that that they have turned so perhaps they have gone somewhere and simply have no means of communication anyway if any of you are spending this christmas alone i have a large country full of preserves made by my valerie and i'm a pretty good cook perhaps someone would like to keep me company may is a holy child's grace shine upon you god god bless ladies and gentlemen allow me to introduce eugene kirkland chairman of the dynamo cars electric car factory workers union employees

further she'll kill him wait what kill him like she did several so-called boyfriends before him all fallen dead shortly after falling for her you have proof how about four bodies all her exes except the last one his name is josh managed to escape her clutches alive he can tell you all about her i bet find josh ask him it may be the only way to save my father from his own stupidity where can i find josh spends a lot of time at frank's half in the bag usually after sunset but i bet he can prove elena is a killer [Music] jack and joe could have took him never seen nothing like it swell for a second he was flying uh come on man all the weird [ __ ] that's out there suiciders goons hell night runners who says a man can fly for a tick and no way jack and joe can stand up to that i heard he

because we don't know if there's anywhere else to go [Applause] but the real stupid kid frank lay off the bottle you reek don't like the stink then leave gillian i can't watch you do this anymore you were right about him [Music] by doing this we agreed to die this is the way from darkness to light load of [ __ ] garbage frank get over yourself this is the way from darkness to light load of [ __ ] garbage frank get over yourself and rabbit what's done is done out of my [ __ ] face killian something something don't remember [Music] aidan we're about to meet up in the canteen join us used roger live above the antique show i'm looking for josh ah think of your teeth he not here thank god who stopped those monsters you know what josh i'm looking for him buy me a shot maybe i'll remember something first info another shot and you'll be completely worthless josh you gotta be swimming in booth somewhere around here either that or this thief in someone's face [Music] is my guardian angel guardian angel if you hadn't helped with the renegades i'd be out of work right now or worse that's more maths doing hey don't be modest on the house i'm nicholas tell me about luanne frank says women like her were given call signs based on cocktails bloody mary marguerita rocks lawan is hot [ __ ] with a hot temper you do not want to get on her bad side cross her once and that's it game over do you know frank well not all military buds well but well enough to know back then he was a big shot a special forces commando a night runner quite the high-ranking monkey muk until one mission he led people into the television tower ended in a massacre after that he ditched the uniform and started the fisheye took out a new lease on life but he became a haunted man frank relives that tower mission start to bloody finish every day the booze helps him get through it all i've seen him on a bender drinking like that isn't helping him get through anything then imagine what he's like when he's not drinking so how do things work in this place the fisheye they work better than anyone predicted when frank set up shop two days and the peacekeepers would take it over or the renegades will blow it up and nobody blew anything up it's the safest place around by far neutral turf even bad has come here just to hash out deals over booze anyone can relax without the threat of violence rivalries are checked at the door that's a good place to have i gotta go wait you interested in making a bit of money and how would i do that it's a simple job there's a metro station under the fisheye used to be uv lamps in the metro that kept the infected at bay but they stopped working because every tunnel and station is infested what happened might be the lamps but i doubted we've replaced them recently maybe something cut the cables but what it's not like the infected bit through them they take a lot of biters to accomplish that on the other hand heard a couple stories like that about infected who work together somehow coordinated as if they're smarter than we think once this guy at the bar told me he fell into a trap he claimed a group of biters herded him into a dead end in a dark zone intentionally they didn't act like a typical mindless swarm said he only managed to survive by climbing onto a trash bin to reach a fire escape above the pack but no i wouldn't put much faith in that if that were possible i think we'd see it more often could be a blown fuse best bet would be to start at the electrical room so you want me to turn on the lamps yeah get to the electrical room for all we know could just be a blown fuse if so you could just reset the main power supply from there before you go got a little something that will help you out a house specialty guaranteed to warm those biters bellies just a bit of house food your bottle and an old rag but powerful stuff or you can always just sneak in past the biters if you don't want to make a ruckus once you turn on the uvs they'll fry anyway and you won't end up wasting good hooch all right i'll take care of it great tell [Music] yeah thanks good luck you're aiden they're waiting for you come on the meeting's in the vip room the mood's friendly like [ __ ] christmas at my family home who do you think you are you [ __ ] liar calm down jack before you pop a vessel this plan is total [ __ ] do better how about this do nothing it's definitely man there isn't a high time we put this [ __ ] before a firing squad wow the dog started barking i guess i better behave all right whoa fellas you brought me here to plan something right adam these are the vnc tower plans once we get the power back on we can re-establish communication people throughout the city will learn about our mission they'll be able to join in and help us so you plan on broadcasting propaganda whatever it takes to defend against the renegades when the butcher sees how strong we are he'll retreat we'll prevent war however there are a few matters we need to take care of first the whole district is powered by an electrical substation i was going to send a squad to turn it on but i heard you already did that good job kid too bad you handed it over to the civilians we could have used it doesn't matter now row at least we don't have to worry about electricity anymore step one is securing the perimeter around the tv station my metal do that i'll head out sir of course rogue good luck we won't disappoint you sir yes we'll do our best sir who asked you where's bowsky now move your ass great house the next time you speak to me like that in front of my soldiers i'll take my life and cut your [ __ ] [ __ ] off oh imagine all the grieving talks shut up can we just get back to the plan thank you after jack's puppies secure the entrance my men will bring the lamps and set up an outpost and then if everything goes smoothly which it definitely will since the plan's author is the commander-in-chief himself you'll turn on the elevators and ride it to the top and when you get to the roof you attach the transmitter to the antenna got it a lot of people say this place is dangerous oh you don't say dangerous what place isn't dangerous in this town our best people are on this mission you'll be working with roe he can be a real pain in the ass but him you can rely up and you can always get in touch with me the entire building is powered by the electrical substation roseman will secure the perimeter with lamps i got it you see juan that's how you obey orders or get yourself killed but my neck's not on the line here see you at the tv station it's a great day we've all been waiting for yes a great day to trying to sell you a die load of horse [ __ ] meet me outside the canteen [Music] if elena ever hits on you be careful oh took a break from assassinations to come see me i'm just trying to keep you out of trouble what do those warmongers want ask me to climb to the top of the vnc tower what sons of [ __ ] you know what that place is the tallest building in the whole damn city but i can do it i hate those [ __ ] roll meyer they're solid but jack and juan they're destined to stab you in the back what's the problem oh nothing except that's where frank lost all the night runners and his leg jack and juan are throwing you to the infected wolves to further their own goals you're just a tool to them [ __ ] lunatics that's all right the pks will be with me jack said did jack maybe mention the creatures that live there i know it's dangerous luanne i have to do this i've heard there are things there things no one has seen or actually seen and lived to tell you sounds scared of course i'm scared aiden oh i didn't know you cared [ __ ] you look a few years ago frank tried to do what jack is planning and

classical literature his endeavors would surely satiate your curiosity and then some sounds interesting where can i find him he set up a modest library in the peacekeeper's ship has stockpiled lots of

oh [Music] so uh [Music] detected [Music] nicholas it worked generators are up and running so the intel wasn't some booze induced fantasy now get back out here i got some beers on ice with your name on them [Music] i'm impressed honestly i didn't expect you to go all the way down i finished what i start luann was right you're one tenacious son of a [ __ ] what else can i do you for how do you know so much about military installations i'm a bartender i'd get gre guys in here incognito of course military brass trying to lie low even big shot ministers of whatever after a few generously poured shots they all had stories to tell i learned about the metro generators from the skittish guy in glasses the retired history teacher type all buttoned down needed to spill his guts to someone later they hanged him for war crimes where'd that chemical gunk i ran into come from it was created to fast forward the infection to the terminal stage basically kill the infected with a form of premature aging it wasn't supposed to have any effect on the healthy or recently bitten like you and me but it didn't work out that way so that's why my biomarker goes crazy when i get near it yep but that's not the worst of it some say the military knew how lethal the stuff really was suited them to finish off every last one of us why only the colonel knows but the old bastard never leaves his fortress but if you really want to know the truth about the gre just check out their laps they're scattered all over town lord the [ __ ] that must have gone down there i gotta go thanks aiden with

got something for you thanks for what you did for my boys i know you really tried to help them what is this a proximity tool the gre tagged more important goods with special rf markers this might come in handy once all the antennas are working you can use it to detect important containers and stuff lord knows what's waiting for us once we actually get to the roof but you won't be alone you'll have my men with you and lieutenant rowe himself you're coming i've had enough of leading from the back and hearing my people die all right let's go then we're waiting for matt he's bringing the transmitter and he'll oversee the operation from here so you have some time for a nap or to take a thump just somewhere outside the camp pretty please it ain't the ritz but what can you do hey are you mind if i join you be our guest how you feeling about the mission aiden now we made it this far didn't we we'll see it through or die trying right so what are you looking forward to after this is over my wife marsha our child is due any day now i'm over the moon and we've been trying for a long time to have a kid and it seems finally i did something right see i told you somebody needs to come over

night for them and when roe found out i had to clean latrines for a week but it was worth it no now i have my eye on a nice jacket at the same place just can't afford it at the moment but this mission will earn me some extra so i can buy it soon will you shut up already we don't care about your wardrobe you're just jealous cause you look like ass and i get all the [ __ ] all your mothers you mean brochure is a hard ass of course he is you know a story right you've seen the burns on his face and neck i was there when he barged into a burning dark zone just to pull out one private yeah the guy can be harsh but not a lot of people will lay it on the line like he has damn right [Music] can you tell me anything else about rome when he and matt had a major falling out yeah it was hell squad 101 had orders to take over the old city warehouse thought it was empty until they went inside they turned on their flashlights and looked up ceiling was weird covered with clumps of rags and then the rags jumped down they were a [ __ ] scary breed of infected clinging to the roofs and walls hundreds of them god you could hear the boys screams for miles [ __ ] imagine that they radioed command but the orders were to hold position they didn't they ran away at least those who could afterwards jack ordered their executions they were deserters but roe defied jack said that sending them there was a mistake in the first place we thought jack would have roshan for insubordination sure did [Music] okay time to get some shut-eye just a moment gents special treat for the night wow you rock lieutenant

about them they're everywhere spreading the city like cockroaches but here the biggest antenna in the city strategic place and no renegades at all ah it's not like anything else they're doing makes sense good point first someone turned on the electricity no idea why and then when i questioned the renegade officer he babbled something about gre facilities they're trying to locate didn't make much sense if you ask me x-13 or something like that but i'm worried what they're planning x-13 i've heard about that place before oh yeah what did you hear i know that waltz is hunting for it as well any idea where it could be well if it's real it could be a gre complex top secret well hidden but once we're done with this [ __ ] maybe we figure out what it is and find it first but for now get some

solid plan we could really activate this transmitter yeah hell the army used to control that tower i have a transmitter here that can tap into their signal and take over their broadcast so all we'd have to do is activate the sector antenna [Music] [Music] uh inhibitor container detected hmm [Music] uh [Music] tuesday the 17th of july 2023 we hereby begin the 17th session of the council of mankind as you are all aware the global situation is degrading rapidly we have several reports confirming pakistan did indeed drop a nuclear bomb on the indian region of jammu entire countries are being declared lost to the virus hungary croatia portugal austria finland and the british prime minister died of thv last week ladies and gentlemen we must face the facts it is the responsibility of those of us in this room to start a new chapter for humankind as history shows it would not be the first time that international cooperation pulled the world from crisis you are in a fine mood today minister general pratt we would like to hear your report now at once monsieur dhaka agricultural facilities and warehouses are being seized and the main distribution hub is being managed by the gre under the watchful eye of the army the army's cooperation with the gre has so far been exemplary i concur thank you dr kobayashi we control the streets and checkpoints in the area we've secured electrical substations and water towers despite initial opposition from workers we finally managed to convert the former dynamo cars the electric car factory into a solar power plant now please dr kobayashi we would like to hear the progress on the gre initiatives thank you the first tests of the thv gen mod compound were successful it shows unparalleled chemical stability and its ability to degrade the dna of infected cells is remarkable we may finally have a key weapon against the virus within reach no time to delay dr kobayashi please provide samples to the army we'll do our own tests it's too soon for that research takes time i submit a motion for the gre to provide the army with thv gen mod samples and submit to military supervision over the gre itself general pratt history shows russian science leads to catastrophe there are people who general pratt is right dr kobayashi extreme situations call for extreme measures i accept the motion for the handover of the current gen mod component samples to army research labs dr kobayashi you will help general pratt move forward with a weapon concept using your compound as a basis who is for thank you who is against thank you who thank you the motion has been passed by five to three votes dr kobayashi please begin the necessary procedures [Music] so [Music] so uh uh [Music] i'm at the transmitter what's next good good now throw the switch and that's it [Music] it worked great and listen uh been thinking radio new hope is still an option but it's your choice juan gets what he wants and gives me what i want the way to find mia the truth about her sometimes our choices are bigger than ourselves sometimes the things we do they matter i'm not gonna try to convince you you got the transmitter working it's your call frank what kind of music did you use to listen to what i'm wondering what kind of music you'd play on your radio station and don't tell me it'll just be you talking all the time if so i'm changing my mind you [ __ ] i can't believe it thank you aiden thank you so so much you have no idea any kind of music anything you want hey there something's gone wrong we can't detect the transmitter signal the people need this antenna more than you do what aiden what have you done you'll hear soon enough and let's hope frank's still got it frank you handed control of this antenna to that washed up trunk i can't believe it i'll take it back i promise yeah good luck climbing the building yourself and i thought we were becoming friends sorry jack i made my choice [Music] good day frank is back and i've got some more exciting news for you blankets food and drinking water are being collected at the canteen all those in need can report to nicolas stay tuned and i'll be back soon with another message of

i can literally feel the concrete scraping my feet we need to get me a new pair well they don't look that bad to me you sure we don't have more important stuff to do if it was their looks i was worried about i would have trashed them ages ago i risked a trickier route to get to your sorry ass faster but the wind blew me into a broken banner [ __ ] spikes were nastier than they looked they were my last pair of intact shoes aiden my soul mates in this dirty revenge seeking business without them i'm look so let's go you want to go shopping for new sneakers now is this some kind of joke do i look like i'm joking the one [ __ ] lawn is not a sign of weakness to say you were worried can you at least tell me where we're going aren't a lot of shoe stores open in the area i bet there's a place some of my old stuff might still be there i thought all your stuff was at the fisheye but i guess that's not where we're going just shut up and follow me [Music] so [Music] so is frank happy i gave him control of the tower i didn't have a chance to talk to him yet i hope it was worth it because you lost your chance to find mia yeah don't worry we'll figure this out now let's just get my sneakers back back were they stolen the one if you knew where your things were why haven't you gone back to get them before now inhibitor container detected see that opening apartment 216. go look for a large red box with gold trim that's where i stored my shoes aren't you coming with me you're why my shoes are ruined you get me new ones go inside take the shoes and leave and don't touch anything else got it hey you got me suspicious lawrence what's going on just go get him would you you climbed the [ __ ] tv station tower you can climb into an apartment it depends on what's in there i'm fine chicken what are you waiting for gajo want me to kick your ass up there i'm inside don't touch anything just get those shoes what's in here that's got you so spooked cool i wonder if it works our mixtape this is i'm not like the one i know [Music] [Music] hmm it's a cozy place who would have thought did you find them yet i'm sorry i don't see a red box anywhere you dope you're not looking hard enough there's another room behind the plywood lawn you look almost almost happy pretty cozy nest you shared it with someone do you still live here nobody lives there just find the [ __ ] shoes and stop asking dumb questions why'd you ditch it for that den at the fisheye because that den is my home i took all i needed with me except for the shoes that is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like they uh spend a lot of time here [Music] vintage 2025 small fortune in these bottles hey luanne i found your shoes great now get the [ __ ] out of there oh but it's quite the love nest with the

pops today i was pulling civilians out of that dark zone i told you about with killian it was my first dark zone ever it wasn't that bad except for just this one thing we saved a mother and her children who got trapped in there and i have no idea what got into me but i wanted to go deeper i wanted to keep going find one more family one more child make sure no one was left behind i had to make sure killian tried to tell me would clear the dark zone for some reason i didn't believe him we argued middle of it all a [ __ ] viral jumped on my back i thought it was i'm alive only because of killian i wish i could talk to you about this [Music] [Music] here i got your sneakers you should also have this [Music] i didn't realize you and hackon had been together why do you think he's so high on my hit list yeah that makes sense just cause someone reads poetry doesn't mean they don't deserve to die did you guys break up because he abandoned frank or did he abandon frank because you broke up there's really no point in analyzing that now aiden whatever happened it was a mistake okay i should have never been so naive that's why i didn't want you snooping around [ __ ] sake you could have just respected that i'm sorry forget we went there just leave me alone [Music] the one what's going on you just don't give up do you you should know that by now you should know i [ __ ] hate whimpering saying how you feel isn't whimpering fine stick around if you have to but don't interrupt me i'm busy getting drunk no you dork looking at the stars hey i can see the big dipper hmm aren't you brilliant except that's not the big dipper oh oops it was worth a try though you know any other constellations yeah frank taught me a lot about the night sky back in the day we were building the fisheye and i'd climb the scaffolding all the way up to the roof frank would come up to tell me it's too cold too late and whatnot but i always ended up telling stories for hours and hours and i love to listen the stars are so clear and seem close enough you could grab them by the balls frank's way of putting it nice huh what about you aiden and what about me do pilgrims get their hearts broken uh well i'm we tend to just forget it wow the shy type [Music] looks like your constellation is sickness see whatness there look the swan when i stargaze i always find the swan first you're making all this up to impress me maybe maybe not are you impressed [Music] pretty much in that poem it's just words aiden words mean things love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickles compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks just words huh yeah just words [Music] so did you meet hakon when you were building the fisheye with frank he and frank used to hang out with each other a lot they were friends it's a simple story really i was a young girl looking for attention he didn't mind having his fun [Music] the good thing is lesson learned for life [Music] you still care don't you otherwise why make me go into the apartment yeah i care aidan about the person i am now that's why i didn't want to go back there so the weak little girl that lived there doesn't get the better of me anymore i used to hate her now i'm so over her [Music] um let's uh let's get some sleep aiden if i see hakkon i'm gonna kill him simple as that don't try to stop me that's fine but you know revenge doesn't make you feel better this isn't for me that's for frank i will avenge everyone who died that night a lot of stars winked out forever hakkon talks big but when it came down to it he bailed on his friends and they died he showed his real face [ __ ] coward you can't turn back the clock true but i can stop his [ __ ] clock and i [ __ ] will now good night eden morning villadore it's a brand new day a brand new world this is your friend frank broadcasting yes that's right broadcasting from the fisheye from now on i'll be bringing you all the good news from around philadelphia helping transform this city back into the community it once was the one hey luan you there right folks let's start this new chapter with some inspirational music for you hey you there come to the canteen no offense frank but i really don't have any more time for you matt was gonna help me find my sister but i gave the tower to you instead and now i'm i'm [ __ ] calm down come to the fisheye and we'll talk i might have an idea i wanna help you aiden [Music] fine be there soon oh [Music] yep [Music] two [Music] [Music] inhibitor container nearby uh [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] hello [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] the one it's aiden come in hello one come on luan answer me you there great i fixed the transmitter and now you go radio silent [Music] this is frank on radio free vlador your neighbor your city once more and forevermore signing off talk to me frank look we started off on the wrong foot [Music] i'd like to correct that mistake have a drink yeah for me frank i really don't have time for this i have to find another way to find my just listen [Music] walk needs to access that you get it that's why we have to find that pilgrim he's offering a lot of [ __ ] crystals for what he's got and a lot of boosters do i have your attention now with those renegades yes but how did you the tv station used to be controlled by the military they did more than just broadcast from there [Music] thanks to you we can now listen in on the enemy it appears that waltz is looking for the same database you're after but the observatory is completely soaked with chemicals i have no idea how this gre crap works but waltz sure seems to know maybe the is not the only place to access the database is this conversation all you have for now but if we got close to their position and hacked into their frequency we could collect more intel on what's his plans how the transmission you heard was intercepted near an old military antenna in the wharf just south of martian lane if we activate that antenna it'll boost the signal and we'll be able to hear everything they say every syllable and you'd know exactly what waltz is up to [Music] it'd be quicker if i could just find him you're impatient i understand i know what it feels like to have wasted too much time but you have to tread carefully remember you said waltz turn the power back on then the renegades invaded the central loop there's something going on so best to collect as much intel as we can before you confront him so you think walt's ordered the renegades into the central loop well until now the colonel kept him on a short leash in his stronghold but the savages we've been seeing lately what the [ __ ] something must have changed one of the pks told me that waltz is after something called uh x-13 doesn't ring any balls tell me more about these antennas the military installed them on the tallest buildings to blanket the entire city they're extremely hard to access but all we need is the one nearest to where those renegades were based when the signal's stronger we'll be able to hear everything they say now the good thing is it's the closest antenna to the canteen you shouldn't have trouble finding it anything else before i get going oh one more thing look at that poster aiden night runners used to abide by that creed live by it i used to think we were as torn apart as that piece of paper but the creed still means something and if you increase the range i can contact the remnants of the old night runners some must still be alive i see it now this means a lot to you doesn't it not just me to everyone here but there's one piece missing do you know why i haven't thrown this poster away in all this time because of lauan when i saw her for the first time she was maybe about eight nine years old she was barely alive she looked like she hadn't eaten in a year and she was trying to help some kids get a crystal back from a thief the guy was threatening them with a knife he was twice their size stronger and she jumped on him bitty's hands so deep that he screams were heard as far away as old villador after that she gave the crystal to one of the boys and left she didn't get anything out of it she didn't have to risk it i looked at her and thought this is all we have left as humans we can fight one another everybody just for themselves or no matter what we can stand up for each other then i wrote down this credo that little girl helped the night runners become who they were for years and if we are to be reborn we cannot do it without her why not without her you see she's a tough one maybe too tough i trained her helped heal her wounds but never healed the biggest one revenge she's built a mighty thick wall around herself can't seem to let go of her anger if she doesn't it could destroy her i know i know drunk calling the kettle black right i'm in no position to judge frank thanks no one's so [ __ ] obsessed with her kill list she needs to throw that damn thing away otherwise it'll kill her let's hope she's better fighting them than i am what are lawan's demons almost too many to count but satan himself is at the top you mean hack on you know him yeah we've met it all came down to the tv station mission hakkon was against that from the start got killian on his side he said it was suicide but i know the truth the [ __ ] chickened out plain and simple till then he wasn't just a night runner to me i thought he was leader material but he didn't have our backs tore the creed in half before he bought it and with it tore apart the night runners themselves [ __ ] coward didn't deserve to lickler wants boots [Music] look i'm starting to get pissed off and we should focus what about hack on killing lucas that took some balls sure but they weren't his balls they were waltzes hakkon's just the guy's lap dog now sit roll over assassinate that's true neutered dogs are even more obedient than they were before exactly [Music] okay i'm on my way then go get him i'll be on the radio you remind me of lawan before she became obsessed with that goddamn hit list of hers i'll get ears on the renegades for you i'll find out what waltz is up to i promise [Music] good day villadore frank is back and i've got some more exciting news for you blankets food and drinking water are being collected at the canteen all those in need can report to nicholas stay tuned and i'll be back soon with another message of hope meanwhile enjoy the music uh how rich do you have to be to eat crystals the worst thing is [Music] uh so [Music] ugh hey frank that's uh that's way up there yep gre made them hard to reach for a reason keeps them away from the bad guys but for a guy like you aiden ugh hmm uh two [Music] [Music] [Music] who does frank think he is one minute he talked about my potential the next he accuses me of reckless behavior says that i put others in danger back at the dark zone after we pulled that mother and her kids out [ __ ] we pulled it off didn't we what's so reckless about success he spewed some line at me about how he's worried my metabolism isn't handling the shots as well as he thought it would can you believe this crap pops my test results were always perfect if you ask me it says more about him than about me he just can't bear someone standing up to him especially not a young kid oh and check this out i was put on notice he'd be watching me he said [ __ ] him i'll give him something to watch [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] okay [Music] uh frank i got the antenna going okay let's see what these bastards are talking about [Applause] and head east [Applause] they said they're going to meet waltz heading east there's another antenna on top of a condominium at the intersection of saint paul boulevard and peach street just by the entrance of the main canal get it working and we can keep up with them got it [Music] uh aidan the colonel seems to be evacuating renegade camps first the electricity then central loop rates now this it seems that williams doesn't want to fight any more than we do or he really intends to close the sluice gates and back the chemicals up into the city but his stronghold will be destroyed as well so this evacuation wouldn't make sense we need to expand the range to find out more [Music] [Music] yes hey frank i activated the second antenna the renegades were here on the roof speaking of renegades hearing more chatter meetings waltz will be there to give us orders anything new about that pilgrim no but he found someone who'll help him access the database if you know something new about that [ __ ] pilgrimage let me know keep walking over and out frank i need to get to where they are you heard the maiden waltz is looking for you he's got a way to access the database i found someone he's too strong for you and you'll be playing straight into his hand if that's the only way to find out the truth and so be it you're stopping kiddo stubborn like the one i'll be in touch ugh good night just let me go it's easy see what was right these [ __ ] worries dropping on us first him then we'll get that gre employee from the old philadelphia and the boss will be over the moon where's walt's waltz we don't need waltz to deal with you oh good old frank so naive warning people talking way too much got him a great night uh yes hmm aidan ayden you're right i think so yeah waltz wasn't here and they know we're eavesdropping on them i know you know someone tried to tip me off but the warning came too late are you sure you're okay yeah i my infection just flared up the renegades were talking about some gre doctor from the bazaar waltz is looking for him too former giari and old velador i'll look into it who tried to tip you off well that's the strangest part it was hackon he wants to meet with you i thought he left the city well he's still kicking and he'll be waiting for you at the church on some paul island he's got the goods on waltz and hell and maybe he knows something about lawan too what do you mean something more i'm afraid she's found a lead on hakkon and she means to hunt him again which means she could get herself into trouble do you know what really made the night run a special aiden i mean true heroes it wasn't the inhibitors not the strength or speed they granted us for the night runners it was balance that set us apart self-control that's why lawan couldn't become a night runner not because she was too young she was the fastest braver than a lot of my men but she couldn't achieve balance i'm self-control this should be good don't laugh we used inhibitors but they didn't use us we had a focus on mental and emotional strength not just physical abilities balance physical strength is important but it's what you do with it that determines what kind of human being you are that's why hackon's betrayal hurt us so much why do you think he knows anything about the one first of all because she was after him but also because it's much more complicated than that you see the last time she went off radar like this was when this [ __ ] dumped her so if she's not answering now i'm getting really worried this is something more and hack on could be involved i'll go meet with hackhot frank you try and find out what happened to lawan just remember they're listening to you two will do aidan be careful who knows what hackon is up to i'm going back to the fisheye good luck [Music] you have one all right [Music] [Music] um frank the church is empty what are you talking about well hackon's not here but it looks like the renegades were camped here their fire's still smoldering hey then why did you want to meet hack on why not it's been a while looks like you've made some new friends how is lawan by the way wait don't you know where she is no but what i do know is that someone's been killing williams top officers each with a single crossbow boat sounds like la one's ammo doesn't it okay pilgrim time to get down to business [Music] he's still on walt's leash i see enough chitchat aiden give me the key what the gre key aiden give it to me i don't want to fight with you hakkon pity i don't care what you want i saved your life at the bazaar oh you saved my life i saved yours we're even whatever you might think we're not friends never were now give me the key you know i won't do that get that [ __ ] key from [Music] come him [Music] one day [Music] oh [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] you've made quite a name for yourself in this [ __ ] though is that what you wanted are you really ready to kill me for that key hack on so many people have died already you can't stop the wheel from turning now but you had a chance to kill me and to take it from me at the bazaar what changed well what do you think kid you promised to get me out of the city we had a deal but then you ratted me out do you think waltz will just let you go just like that you know what he did to dylan to to all the others yeah but they all stood in his way dylan betrayed him lucas wouldn't give up the key so so you murdered him the key is my pass out of the city real [ __ ] shame i have to kill you [Music] my wives i am [ __ ] i didn't realize how tough you got [Music] uh you can't get away maybe but you don't want to see me i ain't as pretty as before we've both seen your biomarker you're not gonna find me in time [Music] huh [Music] [Music] fine how many people have you betrayed icon killian frank lewand why did you betray her frank told you about the tv station told you i chickened out right well is wrong about that it was a suicide mission hello why did you leave her what how do you know about that just answer the question i made a deal with the devil and she had her own hell to deal with what are you talking about i left to protect her if i'd stayed walt would have had her killed so why did you work with him why did you betray frank i didn't i didn't betray frank i was trying to fix things after the tv station i was planning to spy on waltz but he got suspicious threatened to kill lawn and now it's too [Music] too late for us i'm sorry i can't i didn't want this frank it's aidan hackard's dead oh [ __ ] no i knew this would happen well come back to the fisheye i overheard something more about waltz he's heading to old villadoraden the person he tracked down is a gre doctor is that related to the database yes and i think i know the person he's after i'll try to use the radio to reach her first i'm taking that key eden you're in no condition to fight yeah we shouldn't find out won't we i can't talk to me this doesn't make sense [Music] do the night runners mean nothing to you don't you want to make things right hack on [Music] nothing to make right anymore the night runners are long gone no matter what frank says he ain't gonna raise the dead although it's a nice dream what's really going on here frank told me how you broke with the night runners every day since i've wondered would things have ended differently if i'd been there would my friends be alive i know i can't bring anyone back but i did make a vow i'd prove myself to frank and lawan [Music] i don't want to fight you anymore icon neither do i kid neither do i [Music] i mean i'm so tired so [ __ ] tired it's quite a trip huh i was worried that i'd have to learn surfing on my own [Music] thanks for stopping them up for me ah it's my ray of sunshine with a lethal crossbow shut the [ __ ] up a good thing you didn't finish me off eden or she would have been pissed one how did you have my own connections try to stop me and we're no longer friends aiden killing hakkon won't help you lawn what the [ __ ] do you know i know about the nightrunners frank told me he spoke about balance and letting go he's one to talk but he has and you could too can't you luan he said he wanted to protect you what is he talking about [ __ ] he said he joined waltz because he wanted to spy on him hey then shut up but he had to stop because walt's threatened to hurt you [ __ ] i know stop bullshitting me the one [Music] this is [ __ ] [Music] get the [ __ ] out of here you sure go before i change my mind you [ __ ] [Music] i'm sorry [Music] how do you feel i don't know i i feel relieved some peace finally but but i should have killed him he was on my list he's still on my list and throw your list away that list is my only purpose it helped me keep going throw it away the one you think you know me [ __ ] you know what wait [Music] well hack on butcher wants bravo the one you made frank where you been kid waiting for you at the fisheye get over here yeah look a lot went down since we last spoke [ __ ] what happened are you okay yeah i'm fine and you won't believe this but luann was there and she let her come go she what yeah she destroyed her kill list save your shock for later frank what about that doctor come i'll tell you everything [Music] inhibitor container detected [Music] see them [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] you ain't no [ __ ] badass [Music] [Music] huh good huh uh [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] is this a private party or can anyone crash it you've done a lot for the city for the night runners they'll be one of us someday aiden we'll make a decent runner monitor ah the best but as for today hey everyone i wanted to say something hey everybody hey hey shut up all of you frank's got something to say by whatever authority remains in me i hereby make lawan officially and forever a night runner the [ __ ] yes get the [ __ ] out get him a big you mean so you're really bringing back the night runners no you're bringing them back you and aidan in fact you've already started these old bastards are all former night runners who heard my broadcasts and came back but you you did them want better you grew up [ __ ] you see the creed if i comes alive it means you learn to forgive you found balance that's what being a night runner is really all about what about you frank do you forgive your timing always sucked econ sometimes but maybe not this time i thought you could use this where'd that come from i've kept it with me all along frank so what will it be chief if luanne can forgive you i guess i have no choice not a ringing endorsement but i'll take what i can get good now this is lawan's time not yours step back and shut up everybody get your asses up to the roof much better place for a ceremony than a [ __ ] bar oh yeah [Music] forged in you to serve a cause greater than myself today i am forged anew to serve a cause greater than myself i shall be the sword that slays the enemies of mankind i shall be the sword that slays the enemies of mankind i shall be the shield behind which humanity rises again i shall be the shield behind which humanity rises again i shall be the light in the darkness i shall be the light in the darkness this is my sacrifice this is my sacrifice this is my pledge this is my pledge as a night runner has a night runner [Applause] you already have and i say that calls for celebration everyone back down to the bar hayden the gre doctor i told you about it's veronica ryan she lives in old villadore are you kidding me what well she's one of the first people i met here we were acquainted once she used to come to the canteen i guess i managed to avoid pissing her off during my boozehound days cause i convinced her to help you can we talk before you leave aiden [Music] uh sure yeah seems serious talk to you later kid good luck so congratulations sorry for avoiding you i just you know what they say if you're starting to worry about someone it means it's time to go yeah that's a pilgrim saying neither of us need to worry anymore so you're officially a night runner how's that feel so strange for so long it was just frank and the night runners were just a ghost story of his now we're like a [ __ ] insta family even hack on for [ __ ] sake can you believe it having had come back must be weird tell me about it spend so much time wanting to kill him but maybe you know maybe i never did because i never really wanted to maybe all i ever wanted was to stop hurting well um are you hurting now not really itchy maybe like when an infection's healing but i'm not in pain for the first time and i don't know how long one i i was worried here it comes when you left after um after your place hack-ons in my place yeah i can say that now if i can say that then it proves that you don't have to worry about me of course i do especially now i mean take it from a pilgrim happy people are vulnerable people aren't you a buzzkill no it's just that after everything i just i just don't want to see you hurt again next time i get hurt i ain't gonna piss around so long before i kill the [ __ ] i guess i better quit while i'm ahead look i'm sorry i bailed on you i was just no it's okay it it was really none of my business but i made it your business when i took you there maybe i did it on purpose on purpose you've made me and frank all this your business and look how much all of us have gained maybe i i wanted you to know but i was too chicken [ __ ] to come out and tell you so so we went shoe shopping right those [ __ ] shoes they look good on you okay i've i gotta go to look for your sister right i envy her envy her how that she means so much to someone i'm sorry [ __ ] i'm talking [ __ ] no no you're not uh just shut up thank you frank's got something for you ethan aiden no one no waiting for you downstairs i'm coming hack on [ __ ] you go do your thing aiden and good luck right now i think i just got to do my thing the more things change the more they stay the same my kid frank found that doctor you were looking for veronica ryan seems she used to work for the gre and i thought i knew everything about the women in this city you can probably find her somewhere around the church i have more to tell you luanne [Music] [Music] uh frank have you seen the one did she leave yeah that was strange she seemed upset did she say anything where was she going no sorry no clue she's a night runner now you know it's a big deal [Music] good to see you [Music] nicholas i'm looking for lawan boy oh boy leaving your own party just like that i mean she was here for like a minute then she was gone what got into her a few years ago i would just say women i just don't get women but something tells me this is more complicated than just that what did you say to her what did you do wait what why she was quite well let's just say she was in no mood for celebration i tried following her but you know her aiden she doesn't let you you won't ever find her i keep telling everyone we should be getting ready for winter [Music] could send a postcard at least awesome panties do you uh wear panties in heaven could i miss you i'm sad you couldn't watch us build a canteen opening shindig we just had the guys think we're on to something here i love them killian see you frank be careful with my tape recorder you'll break it it'll be fine the [ __ ] off and good night you know ever since you left my life's been dedicated to the night runners people been talking [ __ ] about us since the army booted us out ignoring all the good we've done they say we're junkies because of the inhibitors they just don't get it anyhow i grabbed killian and hack on i said let's build a home where everybody and i mean everybody can gather and feel safe remember my old man was an architect i picked up a few tricks here and there and so a bit of [ __ ] around and wham we had a canteen ain't much to look at sort of an ugly child you love anyway but now everyone's got a place to come sit drink and talk night runners pk survivors even renegades if they behave [Music] hey have you seen the one there's still some booze left i'm sure well i think there is no listen i'm looking for lawn but she was with you under roof and then she left and came here here here yes jesus have you seen her or not yeah oh you have when did she leave i saw her with you on the roof yes i i know that yes okay never mind enjoy the party hey you too [Music] she's not here so she probably went back to her place i don't understand any of this don't worry i don't either sometimes i can't sleep because of the awful sounds the infected outside make take all the time you need luan just come back soon keep your eyes peeled hey meier you're looking for someone ah aidan you might come in handy yes one of my men deserted his post that's serious who was it that's what pisses me off it was a friend a guy named bart maybe it's my fault i know he had it rough here i tried to protect him i guess it wasn't enough to protect him from who the other soldiers they had a problem with him which was their problem not bart's believe me i know what it's like to be the odd man or woman out in old school military culture but here's my problem desertion alone will get him the death penalty but what he took could get others good men killed what did he steal let's call it a map that's all i can tell you the rest is on a need to know basis only and you don't need to know you need me to track him down yes with everything going on i just don't have the manpower to spare but i must get that map back okay i get the map but what about bart when you bring the map back just tell me where he is and leave the rest to me it's my job okay where should i start looking try his bunk it's in the barracks a deck above us can i ask anyone about bart sure he was pretty well known whether he liked it or not he was popular among the new recruits try asking mateo he's usually hanging around the armory then there's magda never had a kind word to say about bart nor anyone for that matter she works in the hospital on the next floor okay i think i can take it from here good luck aidan i hope the kids are all right [Music] tell me what's up with you instead yesterday my youngest not work on the boat like you and daddy they wouldn't do that you don't know how to do it [Music] stop one wrong move and i skewer you like a pig you so you're a thief tell me about this [ __ ] you this is my apartment get out now before i call the guard i'll go for it sure they'd want to know about your poison too so you found josh and he said that i tried to poison him right yeah and that you're currently conning a man so that'll turn over his shop and money to you right except you've got plenty of experience killing right hey we all got our ways to survive if mine is to have chumps throw their money at me and their way is to throw all their money at me well win-win i say but i've never killed anyone no way why should i believe you you took the drums word for it why not take mine hey there's more than that here remember four dead men all while involved with you what makes you think i killed them and not oh i don't know the virus or zombies look wet behind the ears that's medicine my mother was a medic and taught me a few things [Music] it's nothing it's just a disagreement a loud one i guess what's that in your hand got an anonymous tip to search this apartment for poison there's talk of a murder if this really is poison as suspected this woman will hang tomorrow you've got to help me you hear me please i'm not a murderer find baba she has a shop on saint paul island she'll pair my name share the penguins show her what you found [Music] [Music] i need to find out if this is a poison can you help me it's urgent you don't need me take a swig and we'll both find out soon enough i'm serious a woman's life literally hangs in the balance come on help me damn it you fight for this woman yet she is not the one you struggle to find [Music] yes you must bring me the proper reagents reagents there's no time can this go faster fast as you want to down that bottle boy are you again fine i'll get you reagents where they're scarce but you might find some in the gre field hospital in the cathedral [Music] [Music] detected hmm uh oh [Music] protected uh you're back i thought maybe you'd given up on your lady friend [Music] with reagents from the gre is this poison let us see carefully stirring ahold my breath will this heal or bring on death um what was that the kid is like that a little rhyme to pass the time so is it poison not at all these are antibiotics why i haven't seen antibiotics by years so those couldn't be used to kill anyone not likely these were made by a skilled herbalist exceptional work i could go on but didn't you see someone's life hangs in the balance [Music] and you will hang for that you entitled brat you're just jealous your daddy wanted to spend time with someone else than you you warned him you ruined us you [ __ ] jolly what are you doing here i'm watching justice finally being served hey zip it ladies it's a prison not a wet market wait meier it's not poison they're antibiotics antibiotics [ __ ] there have been no antibiotics for 20 years get the [ __ ] out of here it's true she made him i'll bite you drink down that stuff and prove it's not poison bottoms up sunshine otherwise she hangs i trust the baba down the hatch [Music] i hereby bear witness this man drank the contents of this container this is no poison in light of this new evidence elena will be set free no this can't end like that thank you aiden i owe you my life where will you go anywhere long as it's far from here they looted my apartment during the night i have nothing left here i certainly am too well known to apply my usual trade any longer oh well onto greener pastures as they say you know she would have taken everything from us you did the right thing reporting her to the guards i did what you asked i found what you needed to know jolly what is he talking about oh just a little competitive research dad to boost business wait here i'll be right back you failed aiden elena's still alive oh now the deal was to find out the truth not kill her how did you convince your father to call the guards on her it wasn't easy but i panicked didn't know if i could trust you turns out i couldn't just get away from me i don't want to look at you ever again [Music] [Music] [Music] back to the outlands keep that fire what a sweet sweet

all i'm saying i see thank you ah gotta report to supply after my shift [Music] garrett i'm trying to find bart i hear you know him maybe not depends your friend to fall uh undecided cute listen you can count me as one of bart's friends and as for those rumors that bart's done something wrong total [ __ ] [ __ ] give me a break whatever's going on it's a setup i'm sure the other pk's are behind this which pks throw a rock you'd probably hit one and it'd bounce off and hit another and so on how'd they set up one of their brothers like this don't believe everything you hear about dignity and brotherhood around here i see except you know where bart might be i don't but even if i did don't know if i'd tell you mr undecided right well thanks for the insight [Music] can i ask you a question okay but then scram before we both get in trouble um looking for a guy named bart you know sure do he's famous not in a good way have you been acting suspicious or anything lately i don't know never met him actually fresh off the boat as of today ah got it uh thanks yeah hope you find him i'd be happier knowing i don't have to bunk with a guy like that interesting i'll keep looking find something hmm you know anything about this not really but it's good full cream work if you ask me who drew it couldn't tell you i've seen bart be pictures like this off and on over the last year but as far as i know he doesn't have children of his own ah children mine are all grown not all are still alive either sadly but i remember when they were young and happy drawing constantly they scribbled their way through boxes and boxes of crayons the kid who drew that he's a happy kid oh bart doesn't have kids where to get it probably a child of a friend or something he was kind to everyone here there everywhere unless you were a bully hmm no this doesn't help now what do i do you might ask stack over at the canteen seen them together a few times bart helped him when he was in some trouble helped everyone a lot thanks i'll go talk to that star [Music] here [Music] that's fine swinging there spidey will you teach me good seeing you [Music] i was told you know bart who doesn't know bart what's this all about anyway that's between bart and me bart's my friend buddy if it involves bart it involves me you want info you're gonna tell me why you're looking for bart all right fair enough no he's been accused of theft well that's nonsense that is bart is honest as the day is long he's got no reason to steal from anyone the ceo doesn't want to believe it either you mean meyer hmm you hear any other [ __ ] about bart i left his post he's accused of desertion son of a [ __ ] he finally went for it good for him good for them if i were you i'd just leave him be we all should this probably happened cause meyer can't keep a leash on her men that's all i've been told trust me a lot of other pk have had it in for bart since day one meyers respected mostly but when it came to bart her men refused to follow her lead i trust you so i'll tell you this bart's loyal military but he had another side like the outdoors always out near the fields as the field workers on top of the old office building at the intersection of van peel and st paul boulevard it's right here in new dorne park thanks i'll do just that [Music] how you doing [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i'm looking for bart hasn't been here for a while might be watching andy's kid been doing that more and more lately andy yeah bart's friend and he's got the cutest kid liam the way bart acts you'd think that he was liam's father huh where can i find him don't riley know i've only seen them when they brought lame here but you could ask around thanks for the tip i'd never believed the night runners were real just fairy tales if you ask me you know a guy named bart of course is he here i mean he usually brings me books and i'm excited for the next one i see i'm looking for him actually damn i really want to talk to bart about the last book he loaned me the bhagavad gita man some of the material in that book was well challenging to say the least just cause you got holes in your shoes doesn't mean you're poor if you got no one to lean any other city still standing you heard people say the night runners are back god i hear pks were butchered in the vnc tower i had a feeling it would end hi looking for bart can you tell me anything about him oh for one you're not his type wait wait what relax honey i was just pulling your leg the look on your face my to answer your question i can tell you that bart is as fine a man as i've ever known high praise i know but i'm not just talking his looks he's brave kind caring loves children especially andy's son liam andy bart's bestie andy those two are like two peas in a pot and liam he's well like a spring pea i guess how bart dotes on that boy hmm so where can i find him probably at andy's they had a few of us up for some cool drinks just yesterday such kind souls up

for what bert's thoughts she's heard in an old tom dicker hurry i didn't realize this was a horse race either normally situations like this piss me off but if moyer hired us both means we're on the same side i can share an intel so you dig up numbered besides not sure how being hired by the same person makes us partners suddenly then get the [ __ ] out of my way and let me work [Music] aiden

confidentiality very seriously and i take finding them very seriously how seriously stop [ __ ] with me talk unless you want the pks to know you're hiding their fugitive are you out of your [ __ ] mind i ain't hiding no one if so what you'll have to explain yourself to him so talk fine your bobsy twins hired me to make sure they and their kid got to the colonel safely paid well easy job really but we ran into a peacekeeper patrol along the way nasty bunch ugh your boys freaked the hell out worried about the kid then had he leave them right then and there i mean what do i care they paid up front all right then tell me where you left them okay there's an old coffee shop not far from here by the off-ramp from the e-12 by a metro stop you can figure it out from there watch yourself here i'm telling you signs of a fight recent too very recent and the weapon broke looks familiar they're hiding nearby based on this they gotta be oh ugh oh who the hell are you and what do you want whoa calm down yeah i'm just here to talk you look familiar you bart yeah you're eating demeyer sent you yeah she told me to find you and get back what you stole but i talked to star and more than a few others about you maybe think there's more to this situation than meets the eye meyer tried but she couldn't help i couldn't take it anymore day after day will you two keep it down liam's asleep in the next room whatever your personal issues are desertion and theft are serious she plans to center men for you she'll get a lot of volunteers for the search team i'll be executed on the spot if they find me probably why she said you give me a running start so you did steal the map it isn't a map per se but tells the location of some secret pk stash weapons i bet it's all i could think of to offer in exchange for the colonel granting safe haven to the three of us i see like hell people like you never do you never see andy stay out of this it's too late for that you know it [ __ ] this map or stash or whatever the [ __ ] it is the pk are the monsters here surely you understand you've taken this from me by now if you didn't is that what you think i do if you go back to meyer and tell her you've killed us i'll give you the coded message and my dog tags do this please just let us be i sympathize but desertion and theft are serious crimes and i have a job to do please this isn't desertion this is survival not just for me but andy and liam as well would you please just help us of you deserve this least of all liam i'll help you oh thank god andy give aidan the message and my dog tags it's okay if you say so i had planned on going to the ship's library finding a book or two that could help me decipher it but things went south real quick i didn't have time to check maybe i'll check i'm curious what this is all about just don't get caught or you'll be right behind us assuming you don't get caught she'll never see us again you're better off not going to the colonel anyway you know they call him the butcher right we don't have a choice what do you do stay here for now till we figure out what to do next yeah i wouldn't recommend that if i could find you here others could just as easily you should keep moving you're right we got to keep a low profile in any case but at least we're alive and we'll be together i wish y'all luck take care looks like we got a real party going on here you're clint's man i gather yep they were kidding you're a real bloodhound to track these pervs down like you did wait there i'll handle this well look who we have here managed to escape our boss did you kind of wish one of you had gone down would have meant bigger shares of the bounty for the rest of us it'll certainly be a bigger share with you out of the picture you're gonna walk away or have we gotta convince you violently [Music] you talk tough i think you can back that up oh we're gonna back it up all right kill em god i'm gonna enjoy you're safe they can't hurt you now if only that was the last of our worries don't talk like that we're alive thanks to aiden i suppose what'll happen to us now one step at a time andy let's get packing quickly good idea you don't want anyone else finding you [Music] you're back and and your boy clint was a real charmer thanks for that look i had to double down on finding bart tell me you found him at least i did and here's his dog tax he's a little too dead right now to need them anymore but aiden you weren't supposed to kill him even i wasn't gonna let that happen he attacked me i had to defend myself i i see but the map tell me you at least got the map nope [ __ ] what happened to it from what i can tell he realized he was in over his head and ditched it the whole point had been to keep the boys safe and he played it wrong damn it not knowing where it is could be worse than knowing it fell into enemy hands if it'll make you feel any better you can send the team to where i found them building not far from the freeway overpass that'll help won't stop the [ __ ] storm if we still can't find the map though sounds rough forget about it just get out of here i gotta figure out how i'm gonna break this [ __ ] to matt okay then i'll catch you [Music] get some red guys later good now i'm not so sure [Music] [Music] let me go i'm innocent [Music] tell me what's up with you instead i don't know recently i had the honor of getting chewed out by raven's mouth he took the effort to do it what are they wanting in there i tell you something just don't get offended you're tougher than most men i know hey you yes you come here i'm albert and from what i hear you're aiden you have quite the reputation my boy for being fearless for boldly crisscrossing the city at night as if it were broad daylight you believe all that at first i didn't believe because a pilgrim's always a guy with some kind of dark past abandoned rebel and outcast but from what they say about you i'm sure whatever you've heard is an exaggeration nonsense my boy i have something you probably don't come across all that much faith faith in you i'd be careful with that it's no time to be careful my boy i believe that your strength determination and courage are just what you need to retrieve priceless treasures before they are lost forever before mankind is plunged irrevocably into the intellectual and philosophical dark ages so your books then this isn't about dime store paperbacks boy i'm talking about the greatest works of literature ever created through the eons of human existence the greatest thought pieces philosophical treatises works of romance drama and horror all of which serve to illuminate and uplift humanity itself losing such a heritage would reduce us to cavemen with no better way to express ourselves than through savage grunts as we scratch crude figures on walls sure how can i help work with me please to find and secure these treasures i've been researching the local private book collections if i'm right many priceless volumes may be found all around the city of course many of the dwellings are now infested by these horrible creatures of the night that's where you come in yeah take this list each title on it corresponds to one of the many facets of humanity fail to save them and the diamond of mankind will dull and shatter like cheap glass remember we are not simply creatures of flesh and blood but also of mind and ideas i am charging you with the salvation of the very spirit of man that's right i'm often [Music] hey albert i got a question for you you know i appreciate a curious mind my boy ask away do you have any books on ciphers or code breaking oh a fascinating subject are you familiar with alan turing he pioneered code breaking and in fact is considered the man who invented computers back in world war ii brilliant man and what thanks did he get from his government chemical castration and an ignoble death poor man well um just looking for some books albert of course of course looking to be more useful to the pk are you by all means from what i can see this book on the bacon cipher should do the trick and i have another two volumes on codes if you're feeling studious you'll be able to find them on the shelves nearby all right thanks albert [Music] [Music] until today i thought our chances against renegades were pretty good but now i'm not so sure ugh this is the drop point for the coded message [Music] ugh [Music] it's an emergency somebody there who's there i have a man in dire need of a healer she's asleep she'd be awake soon it's an emergency always an emergency like the time that young woman needed a potion to induce labor and the guy who needed herself for his hernia and what else was there please wake her up a man's life is in danger it better be if i find out he just has a hangover i'll wake her up but you'll still have to wait haven't seen you before how'd you know where to find us from the peacekeepers then you've come to the wrong healer get out haven't you all made her suffer enough and now those renegades there'd been a cease-fire for years they left us alone and then all of a sudden they went mad where were you when they were taking over the island for the first time we really needed you and what you didn't come and they're gone i just took care of them i don't believe you you're lying just to get what you want like all peacekeepers do we have a visitor gerard i'll be there in a moment it's a peacekeeper what does it matter is a peacekeeper's life of less value listen you arrogant little [ __ ] your people call healers like margaret witches people fear healers when they could be helping people then one wrong move and you peacekeepers are quick to hang them so you ask if a peacekeeper's life is worth less it is to me worth less far as i'm concerned well i'm not a peacekeeper i'm only trying to help one all the same to me let him in gerard i'm just a messenger a doctor sent me him his name's steven doctors shun folk healers these days using a folk remedy would harm his reputation it already has he sent me to you against the wishes of the man's family gerard yes you said there was a man he saved us from the renegades is this the man what's your name boy aiden so you are the one who saved us we owe you a great debt and who is the dying man his name's ayder he's a high-ranking officer margaret don't if something goes wrong you'll be blamed again but if this goes well perhaps it's a chance to help more people [Music] [Music] blamed again what do you mean the last peacekeeper to ask me for help blamed me for his own incompetence gave his wounded soldiers the wrong herb despite my clear instructions and several died blamed it all on me i'm only still alive because jack matt deigned to be merciful decided it was a tragic accident he spared my life but took my eyes [Music] this mean you'll help me i'm out of the herbs you need but i can tell you where to find them you'll be looking for a flower called the recluse it thrives in soil soaked in toxic sludge you will be able to pick it up safely only at night when its petals glow but it's not enough to simply pick it willy-nilly only the small petals have the healing qualities beware of the big ones they contain deadly poison can you remember that small petals heal big ones poison or remember we'll regret this i assure you you're the one i need your help sure you do what's up i'm looking for an herb it's called the recluse oh yeah i'm familiar with it i think those funny flowers grow by the canal north of all saints bridge that's where i look it's a lead and actually i'd wait until night oh thanks ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] uh oh maybe it'll go away on its own how's the patient he's starting to wake up thank you for your help you can go wait what's going on here you went to the witch didn't you to this margaret she gave me herbs that might help him she's not a witch there's no such thing as witches that's superstition superstition witchcraft is crying please just calm down what's happening we're losing him ayden give me those urges keep that witch's poison away i can give him an injection to stabilize him but it won't last long did you tell her who the medicine was for she killed his men she should have hanged for that but jack mack had eight all burn her eyes out instead what did you tell her she'll have given you poison i guarantee it aidan give me the herbs damn it wait i i need to check with somebody make it fast hey who won he there aidan what's going on do you know anything about recluse pedals pedals there was something wait frank told me once some were medicinal which ones the small ones the small the small ones heal that's what i remember thanks i was afraid someone might have misled me aydah what's going on i'll tell you later sorry so what are we gonna do [Applause] uh how is he it appears the medicine is as effective as i'd hoped he needs his rest we should all leave and be i i won't be far looks like you had margaret pegged she didn't want to poison him after all yes seems that way and what'll happen to him now if all goes well he should start to wake up soon and then we'll find out who did this to him all thanks to you [Music] [Music] if it wasn't for you it'd still be in a coma or worse i'm glad he's better me too only he knows what happened in old philadelphia and soon thanks to you i'll know as well over and out can i ask for a favor [Music] hmm so ugh hmm [Music] huh [Music] here are your books not my books dear boy power books humanities books the world is collectively sighing right now due to your efforts and it doesn't even know why this tale your tale will be the next great epic and it's only begun ah the bible i mean well that's like the book right few books have shaped the world as profoundly as the bible hands christian anderson and his fairy tales powerful stories of virtue and resilience children's tales yes but

looking for dr veronica ryan you're not the only one man what do you mean the good doctor's in trouble and uh weird kind of trouble you see a group of renegades appeared in old villadore first we braced ourselves for another battle but they didn't attack the bazaar just ask for dr ryan of course we didn't tell them where she is and where is veronica you can tell me right in a hideout vincenzo and a few of our people are protecting her there but the less people know about that place the safer she is where is it barney if the renegades are hunting veronica a few people may not be enough you just can't walk away from a fight can you the building is north of quarry end courtesan rose street but you didn't hear it from me and you why are you here and not with vincenzo and the rest i wanted to be but sophie talked me out of it said something about not wanting them to have to deal with my attitude what attitude for [ __ ] sake i have no idea okay [Music] thanks for the info i'll go and give him a hand the folks say i'm the one always itching for a fight anyway good luck man sometimes i wake up at night forget the fall even happened that's about the only time i smile then i see them

there is someone who needs to speak to you dr ryan i'm aiden i know that you're being hunted by the renegades hurry aidan more renegades may be here any minute frank told me you worked for the gre i need access to the gre database in the observatory i i have a gre key a gre access key that's what i've been told you think you can let's meet i'll be in a small building near the dam not far from the observatory okay hello be careful aiden the place is soaked in chemicals i will thanks for the heads up vincenzo thank you i'm lucky you showed up farewell aiden farewell oh god okay yeah oh [Music] uh oh my god ugh [Applause] [Applause] it's had a feeling we'd cross paths sooner or later you patched up barney right he whimpered like a baby soon as he saw the needle and those renegades why are they after you probably the same reason as you to access the gre database what do you want from it aiden why are you risking so much i'm looking for my sister your sister was in the gre she no she was a prisoner i haven't seen her in 15 years a prisoner you mean a test subject i don't know what i'll find she's she's the only family i've got the only answer to what waltz has done to us welts he held us there had a hobby of experimenting on kids did you know about that i was only a mid-level doctor aidan i'm sorry want to know anything else or can we go why are you helping me are you looking for something in the database as well aiden those vaults contain my organization's biggest secrets i almost died because i was a part of it i need to know what they were hiding what if you don't like what you discover nothing ventured nothing gained how did a gre doctor wind up at the bazaar by not letting anyone know i was a gre doctor after the revolution the gre were blamed for the disaster personnel were rounded up and executed people used revenge to relieve the pain doesn't matter if it doesn't work what happened happened now i'm someone else how are you planning to get us inside the observatory look there's a security tunnel into the complex it was locked up years ago give me the key eden are you sure the key is functional well it has been maybe the problem is that the building has no electricity is there any other way to get in there it depends how much we're prepared to risk a lot if you ask me okay and come with me i have something to show you uh uh huh see those domes sure but the place is flooded with chemicals the gre had a solution for that when they created the thv gen mod they had to protect their employees from exposure with the thv what the chemicals they came up with blockers shots that would shield their workers for a few minutes from the fumes fortunately i still have two doses had a feeling they'd come in handy one day well those must be worth a pretty penny they are extremely rare for now we will need only one for you wait you're not coming no i will join you but first i'd like you to restore the power to the building you see i have panic attacks when i'm in tight spaces or in the dark now you probably think i'm a coward not at all i think it took guts to come here so let's do this when you get there first restore the power then i'll be able to join you hold out your arm remember the shot shields you from the chemicals for a limited time only can't i take the other one too no not at the same time this stuff's too strong go as fast as you can to the smaller dome and from there to the higher one you should find a door leading inside there you'll be safe then head to the b block there you should find the building's main circuit breaker as soon as you turn on the electricity the security door will unlock and i can join you by going through the tunnel i showed you now go the blocker is working locker is working time that blocker won't protect you forever just go good job warning main power circuit malfunction in block b emergency protocol initiated veronica i made it through the chemicals to the first dome great now just get to the second one find a door a hatch or whatever leads underground right [Music] veronica found the entrance so far so good but how do you know this place so well by the way i was here just once long ago but i have a good memory that sounds useful well sometimes it's a curse really veronica i have a horde of infected here [ __ ] i hoped it would be empty by now well it isn't i don't know if i can get through use the uv flashlight on your belt that should keep them at bay just don't stop aiden ah [Music] ah [Music] what's up foreign veronica i made it the electricity's on great the security tunnel is open i'll try to take the elevator down to you this place was quite the hive plenty of infected but i got rid of them aiden what what's going on the elevator it stopped i see i think it blew a fuse i'm checking do something quick please don't worry i'll fix it please don't leave me here don't be afraid i just need a moment don't beat me don't leave me [Music] oh my god please please let me out [ __ ] again do something let me out i'm working on it let me out [Music] i'm not sitting on my hands here veronica try to breathe slowly don't leave me just don't leave me here shouting won't do anything except attract infected calm down i won't leave you [Music] so [Music] veronica i'll meet you by the elevators [Music] are you all right see told you everything would work out just get in [Music] [Music] you always been claustrophobic seriously for over 10 years so what happened then aiden for god's sake can we not talk about this right now the database where is it just give me a moment below us even farther than this another six floors down this is a pretty high tech before the gre this complex was run by the military they used it to monitor threats rocket attacks that sort of thing that's why they called it the observatory then the virus came and that was the end so what happened here in the end well the gre lost control of the situation and it all went to hell everything collapsed from what i know the scientists at first barricaded themselves inside but soon conditions in here were as bad as they were in the city so some of them quietly slipped out and those who stayed are the ones you got rid of earlier so the military ran this place before the gre yes it used to be a cold war command bunker cold war a period in the last century wars back then were fought on a grander scale it wasn't just about day-to-day matters like having enough water uv lamps and food scraps in a way though it was just like things are now people lived every day in constant fear that's quite the story they used to call places like this witnesses to history great dark again wait i'll try and figure something out if we have electricity here we could use it to power up the whole floor we need to open these doors somehow maybe from the other side we need to open this door hmm now i'll just plug this cable in it might work huh [Music] um [Music] [Music] i need to get in there somehow and get that door open [Music] smart move rerouting the circuit yeah saved my life a few times veronica should we get going yes let's get this over with and then get out of here this way [Music] the main computer is there you'll finally know what happened to your sister she's all i have what about your parents i don't remember them just her we we were a good team without her it's like uh god i don't know you don't know what well i don't really know who i am we are all different people than we were 15 years ago we all got lost it's here it's locked again what now the terminal is inactive the security system isolated this area guess i'm up i've got an idea try to find the officer's room there's a security desk we could try to operate the door locks from there you should be able to use your gre key on it you sure know a lot about this building please just insert the key and select emergency unlock on the screen i'll explain everything to you when we're done [Music] so [Music] it worked yeah but we may have another problem i'm stuck here i need to find a way out can i help you somehow i don't think so just stay where you are so hmm [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign uh dr veronica ryan director field laboratories department a mid-level gre dr my ass seems to be veronica's office you weren't honest with me veronica who's that boy maybe her son aiden a funny thing seems there was another veronica ryan director field labs department i was going to tell you why are you helping me are you working with waltz waltz no never even back then i didn't waltz had his own research team but you knew about the experiments how they used kids me and my sister that's why i'm here aiden i i cannot forget what we did here that we let you down all those kids in pain and no cure to show for it sure we were five for [ __ ] sake small children showed natural immunity to the virus we saw a correlation between age brain development and infection severity that's why they were experimenting on you the gre the world needed you you seemed our only hope i'm sorry [Music] was it worth it i mean did you even come close to a cure we were close but the virus it finally reached the complex [Music] so were you involved in those experiments no the tests on children were all performed at a laboratory here we were gathering data and compiling research i was here when it all happened team members began to turn and things quickly spiraled out of control one by one we were locked inside hiding sneaking around through those dark corridors and ventilation shafts my son he was here with me paul he was five back then too what happened to him i managed to find the shaft leading to the main entrance i told paul to wait for me i kissed him and i told him to wait until i made sure the entrance was safe he clung to me didn't want to let me go when i came back for him he was gone i was only away for 15 minutes i spent the next week looking for him and then the rest of my life crying i should have known he was a kid scared alone i'm sorry you were trying to take him out of here how could you know anyway we all have our own stories of the past let's concentrate on what happens next okay let's go so i'm going in hope you find what you've been looking for all the gre's data is in there aiden what's up damn it i don't know try it again it's stuck [ __ ] it i'll go nope i'm done waiting it's time for answers oh wow here we go [Music] talk to me veronica are you okay how do we stop it i don't know veronica veronica remain calm veronica i can't stop it do something i'm thinking so think faster blockers i still have one you have to find one for yourself any idea where to look the control room maybe they kept some there go find the controller ready to begin [Music] find a way up hurry control room upstairs [Music] i know [ __ ] know [Music] i found one that's it all right now comes the fun part did you make it aiden aiden you all right yeah yeah i use the blocker oh thank god i think we're safe now that's good to hear ready to plug in are you serious yeah do it cross your fingers aiden the moment of truth damn it's broken you [ __ ] me yeah i am it's just an old system wait give me the key there is a list of patients and personnel who do you want to check first search for mia is that your sister yes nothing impossible she was there with me i'm searching sorry aidan records show no patience named mia god it's impossible [Music] i will check my name aidan aiden there's one record among the youngest children year 2020 [Music] aiden caldwell is that your surname well it is now what does it say data classified only one note warning patience shows an above average tolerance to the substance most tests performed exemplary results [Music] you all right yes i think so is there anything else no that's all waltz checking [Music] one record clinical studies substance 1354 [Music] study abandoned all patients discharged from the center look through all the names uh patient discharged all of them yes damn it no inform where they ended up or about their substance uh 1354 or something i'm sorry aidan [Music] there's more the substance was also tested on some infected at gre facilities across the city to no avail the project was run and supervised from x-13 it was eventually shut down as was x-13 itself is there anything more about this x-13 in here i doubt it but i heard about it x13 was a hub of gre operations and the substance you know what it is there were so many tests in clinical studies aiden let me search the database for the research data something's wrong what do you mean it says the procedure's been initiated another procedure i'm looking lots of data started then paused 11 years ago resumed a few days ago in x-10 there's also a map several locations are marked including the observatory what the hell does it all mean i have no idea but intruder alert intruder alert infected they must be here somewhere they must have followed us there's no time hurry take the key hide yourself somewhere and lock yourself in i'll deal with them aiden we don't know how many there are i'll handle it hmm monica you all right yes but i have bad news these locations on the gre system they appear to be targets targets for missile strikes missile strikes what are you talking about the fail-safe protocol we don't have much time listen this marks river end and garrison that's in the central loop people live there you have to warn frank okay okay i will hey frank frank your neighborhood is marked on some tactical map you have to tell people to evacuate come on there's no time to explain just clear everyone out of there frank [ __ ] open okay [ __ ] up just wait here i'll

almost there just hold on hold on you're back thank god you really gotta stop doing that you had me worried and i don't get worried keep away from me luanne wow i mean it's not like i expected flowers but for digging you out from under the rubble and carrying you here on my back a small thank you would be nice you don't understand the wine i you what i am i killed veronica what i killed her and not only that i'm turning i saw veronica's body it was torn as if by a volatile you couldn't it was me walter's experiments back then in the hospital there was nothing in the gre database about me but about the drug oz was giving us it had the greatest effect on me wald's told me that mia's dead i have to get away from here i'm a threat if i stayed not to everyone what if he lied to you and mia's alive and even if not you didn't kill veronica aiden that wasn't you i repeat that was not you if this transformation is because of waltz then we're going to make him fix it got it i'll help you wow walt created the inhibitors he must know how to counter their effects it was that come on probably another building collapse oh my god the butcher he's finishing what he started 11 years ago it's walt he used the key that's when this all started what are you talking about dylan didn't want waltz getting the gre key he knew the whole city would be at risk waltz took the key from veronica and escaped apparently he needs it for something else do you see now you have to stop him him and williams no matter what one i can't control when i turn any moment now i can when you feel something happening just get to a uv light i can't stop them alone aiden okay okay let's get him now you're talking like the aidan i know frank's taking juan and matt to the stronghold he wants to meet with the butcher what i had the same reaction but he says that after the bombing williams contacted him and that he wants to talk has frank lost his mind that's why i'm going to cover their idiotic asses you go to the fisheye maybe you can still talk frank out of this stupid idea if that doesn't work i won't be far aiden nobody can know about veronica remember i know it wasn't you who did that but jack the peacekeepers they won't give a [ __ ] they can't stop us they won't oh my god frank frank frank do you copy so hey we have medicine and food for those in need contact us by radio or display a flag on your building the night runners are back oh frank aidan you're in one piece frank if you're going to the stronghold i'm going with you kid stop sit down and listen to me you saved a lot of people if it weren't for you i wouldn't be able to warn anyone but i don't think it's a good idea for you to come this isn't about waltz the stakes are too high what do you mean look i'll tell you but this has got to stay between us got it just tell me there will be more missile attacks hayden williams says most of the central loop will be destroyed you understand is that a threat or a lie we won't find out unless we sit down to talk and what if it's a trap aidan listen at the start of the pandemic villadore was one of 20 cities to be isolated by the gre do you know how many of them survived so far none except for hours they were all blown up when the virus got out of control villadore was saved because someone stopped the bombings and i think it was williams i don't trust the butcher or waltz frank i want to go with you if things go south you could use some backup okay i know i can't stop you you'll go with us but stay cool and do what i say is that clear hey [Music] oh [ __ ] let me get a hammer [Music] get the [ __ ] off me [Music] [Music] [Music] hey we can't wait any longer we need to get moving you okay open up renegades will be here any minute are you sure you're okay i felt worse

to if we don't then tomorrow this place is done either way tonight they deserve a party let's go get one he's celebrating too whenever matt walks into the canteen juan gets up and leaves seriously this schoolboy feud isn't helping anyone where's matt he here or will he be fashionably late matt's upstairs waiting yeah come on hidden buddy good to see you alive for likewise nicholas man wouldn't be if it hadn't been for you they say hell everyone here be dead by now later amigo i've never believed the night runners just fairy tales if you ask me [Music] matt everything all right this is

william says there are more missiles if he knows that he might know how to stop them so seeing as he's graciously agreed to talk we're gonna dress up real nice and go to his island on our very best behavior now move your ass matt only if i can kick his slaughter [Music] watch yourself here my opinion it turned out well at least uh hey aiden you're not going sure are a lot of them down there dollars to donuts matt [ __ ] this up i guaran [ __ ] tee it got a plan b oh improvise what if he improvises but don't worry so much what else is there to do get ready stop the car stay with me frank

use curari it is odorless not bitter smelling like this one just tell me what i need to find this is sacred violet you need aquatic herbs to neutralize it five pieces are needed to counteract the poison they grow beneath the waters nearby mix them with this before administering it foreign ah he's fading fast i have the antidote on my way yes hmm [Music] you have a promise to keep remember i

right breathe breathe okay okay i'll chop off william's [ __ ] and jam it down his throat [Music] the healer said something odd what she said the renegades don't use this kind of poison they do now yeah but why would they try to kill frank if williams wanted to talk because it was a lie i'm going to the stronghold and not with that wound of yours someone should stay with him luanne fine ask jack for help he knows a way into the stronghold aiden [ __ ] this up and that's a promise carl jack juan told me you know how to get into the stronghold get on the roof you can track the signal from the van better up there i bribe the renegades driver he'll be expecting you he'll take you into the stronghold who is it someone easy to blackmail in control you'll see why didn't you stop him before i

now what happened i'm a pauper brought blown by my own family who yes my own flesh and blood have brought me to this dreadful state my own kiss and kin how can they be so unreasoning so beguiled by phantasms whoa betide them whoa are you gonna tell me what's going on my papa my dear papa departed this vale of tears a month ago and his siblings my clothes some aunts and uncles i spit at them went mad with grief they traveled dark paths and found an infected with the power to raise the dead ever since they've been offering valuables to the creature beseeching it to bring back my dear departed papa they really believe that yes they think their offerings will make the foul beast's grand papa a new life seems people need something to believe in whatever it may be and what does this have to do with your poverty it is all papa's valuables they've taken to use as their offerings when i tried to stop them they threw me out of the house i'll have nothing left only memories of papa and a gaping hole in my heart i'd go to that alter myself retrieve his belongings but i'm a frail man but you you seem like a stout fellow perhaps you'd go there and retrieve his treasures for me well if it means so much to you i can try oh lionhearted i will reward you a hundred fold they make offerings in the evenings so you have to go there under the cover of night you'll find his belongings in willow line chests you can wait here for the sun to descend from the sky i'll be waiting for you in my crib on lower dam air on the garrison the entrance is near the old hotel by the canal farewell farewell my blood demonstrated the city here [Music] uh [Music] detected [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm all right i have everything serves you right you bastard you almost got my brother killed that didn't mean for him to get hot but he did because of you stop kahn and others to run your dangerous errands if i someone just get a whiff you pull this on anyone else i'm turning you in hey who are you another one of those fool's errand boys whatever i don't give a [ __ ] getting out of here what's going on here what was he talking about you see before the full i was an actor not even a good one breath of the stage i i took my craft to the streets and became a con artist but not a very good one of those either and i'm still quite poor everything you said about your father your family yeah it was a lie i had to convince you to retrieve those valuables for me the legend of the creature is real well as real as the bandits who invented it to trick people into offering up their valuables they come by later and collect them i didn't dare go there myself and risk them catching me so i figured i'd have someone else go i'm a greedy lazy bastard what do you want from me well at least you're honest about one thing i try sometimes like now you survived the ordeal keep the spoils for your trouble as for me the curtains going down be or not to be that is the question whether tis noble in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against the sea of troubles and by opposing in them to die to sleep no more and by asleep to say we end the heartache and well um well if you had a day job i say not to quit i need to get there somehow [ __ ] i have to get out of here [Music] uh anybody else seeing it this should be fun [Music] alive [Music] yep [Music] [ __ ]

renegades man am i high just get me in and you'll be fine the bushes got me by one bowl and matt's got the other another [ __ ] [Music] say everything is okay i'm here [ __ ] what's up you probably want to know what took so long you on the road um you are not really i kind of because be right there it's all good don't screw up the password again this time we'll blow your head off sweet love you too what we only have idiot working for it what's the password three horns no wait four no three three three yeah that's it you better get it right [Music] three three times for sure [ __ ] maybe it

you saw it happen you saw my men shoot matt did he saw my men i only sent one guy aiden only a driver hey what's that man we can count bodies later you and waltz launched the attacks and ambushed frank i had nothing to do with that i stopped the attacks 11 years ago and i'm trying to stop them now waltz he's not here don't listen to him aiden lower the bulkheads you know what he wants right if you don't kill me he and his thugs will if you let them in you want to find walls satan so do i you have to trust me all right fine help me stop waltz you're dead hayden i'll kill you both good choice we'll see about that where's walt i know very little except he was looking for a place called x-13 talked about it as if it was his last resort last resort for what i don't know but this is why he turned on the power and in the process triggered the fail-safe protocol with fail-safe protocol the same one destroyed the other infected cities the failsafe has been reactivated and soon more missiles will fly i was trying to stop waltz but he took most of my men that's when i contacted frank who attacked the fisheye i don't know aidan i only sent a driver out to bring frank and the others here guy named steve the one you need to find the bodies of the renegades williams says he only sent one man one i'll look into it let you know why did you even work with that madman he's as brilliant as he is mad i wanted him to enhance my soldiers and he did but what i didn't know was that he turned them against me and used them to further his own goals what calls he didn't tell me okay now how do we stop the missile strikes the failsafe can only be stopped with the gre key that initiated it it waltz took it so there's no time to waste how can i get to x13 it's the main gre complex built when they isolated the city the most classified operations were performed there you can get there via the gre tunnel in the central loop and waltz is headed there that's why he sent renegade troops into the center at least it seemed that way based on the notes he left in his quarters go listen to them yourself his quarters are in the west wing meanwhile i'll arrange transport to x13 you better hurry hayden one more thing i know that look son you were a test subject of his weren't you you're turning that's why i have to find him so what are you waiting for he's the one who tried to have frank killed i found those bodies cleared out on mats orders they were peacekeepers disguised as renegades matt set frank up where is he now i'm looking for him we've got his number now we'll get him [Music] anyone here he was working on something here what were you doing to us you sick [ __ ] hayden i've arranged transportation for you [Applause] come outside [Music] report 24 2036 130th day of the year it's been six months since the funds ran out 20 since any improvement has been seen patient unconscious after administering the compound blood pressure increased slightly noticeable pupil movement the only chance for progress is to go back to x-13 if the information can be confirmed and the gre key has been found by commander lucas there is a chance to further this research it must succeed at all costs report thirteen zero 2036 105th day of the year fund's gone an attempt to recreate the compound still unsuccessful patients react with uncontrollable aggression increasing psychophysical abilities as i no longer have test subjects i am testing the compound on myself report 20 2036 126 day of the year an old villador informant has reported that commander lucas has found it he has found the gre key this means that it is possible to enter x13 again i've sent a reconnaissance team under dylan's command to the old vilidor subway station i am waiting for a report [Music] [Music] [Music] that's right he's going to the tunnels near tower plaza drive gotta stop him before he gets to x-13 we're going there there aren't too many of us but the night runners stand behind you [Music] um [Music] [Applause] aidan the driver will take you to the tunnel entrance that should lead you to x-13 now go there's no time left soon the next missiles are going to strike the city [Music]

longer fit to lead you're too blinded waltz before he destroys the entire city okay and we need a search for wounded how come we'll go with you after once just be careful that cloud is basically a wall of deadly chemicals it's too late to worry about that frank looks like it's down to the two of us again hey pilgrim let's kick us some renegade butts i've missed your point in soliloquy's hakkon

bible only there the goal was to save pairs of animals and here probably just goat [ __ ] from the gre it doesn't look like it's for regular people nope selfish [ __ ] it doesn't look like anyone made it here the virus spread more quickly than they did justice was served waltz was headed this way for sure he knew it contained everything he needed for survival we have to find him you see [Music] i'll go first [Music] all right uh huh foreign i saw the plans aiden the control room is that way waltz must be looking for something in there go after him ate it i'll try to find some bandages i
