keep driving straight over yes it is still behind us [Music] watch out there's more of them head to the tunnel we can maybe lose them in the hills what are they gonna do rob us there's nothing in the back it's me thereafter i think and why would you say that stop stalling seb i can see two cars no no three three still after the tunnel take the right it's a shortcut a planar pedrosa you sure it's a shortcut you've never pointed it out before i've lived here my entire life you've lived here only a few seconds hey don't be so touchy you're the one acting crazy well i'm not arguing with that [Music] i think we're clear it's carrying on down the road ah thank you my love those must be those famous driving skills you told me about eh if i ever need a getaway driver you've got the job you'd better have a good explanation for all this [Music] [Applause] is that is that a camaro yeah 69. wow where did you find it cam and i fished it out of a lake back in florida couldn't bear to leave him behind so are you finished stalling can you please tell me what the hell is going on i need to come up with a lot of money in three days what uh have you ever heard of the dadakul should i have they've been around barcelona a long time they're sort of like an uh group that helps each other with special favors and business deals in america we call that organized crime oh [ __ ] you owe the local mob money look when we met i was completely honest with you about some of my business dealings some of which might be considered extra legal you said you were a provider of information look i point things out to people and if they're useful i get paid so i provided the talakul with some information and that info through no fault of my own turned out to be slightly out of date and now they want me to pay them for the expenses lost exactly how much in expenses [Music] how much a hundred thousand that is insane well the data could disagree damn it sebastian how could you let yourself get involved with people like that hey you're not from around here they're hard to avoid they have their fingers in everything don't you have any savings a secret stash of unmarked bills somewhere why come on v you know my garage is barely hanging on that's why you took pity on me sending me that car hey do you think i'm a criminal whoa who's a criminal well you may as well tell them tell me what we need a way of making a lot of money in a hurry so it is true you owe the moroccan mob money the guys at the garage like to talk hey don't worry i have a solution but you're not gonna like it there's a big street race tomorrow night we are not getting involved with mauricio first prize is always some heavily modified ride if you win then boom you've got the money to repay the gangsters well a decent part of it no way there has to be some other way sebastian can handle it when you're drowning and someone offers you a life preserver you don't say there has to be some other way you can't reason with them these are not people that listen to reason i hate to say it but they're right i either race or i turn myself into the police which is probably what i should have done in the first place well if you're gonna stand any chance of winning in that import of yours it's gonna need a tune-up so how far are you taking these like i said you'd be better off with me doing the work right here i can handle it well just remember these things are extremely volatile well we'll be extremely careful then [Music] okay let's get this race fuel back to the house we've got all day to work on the car before the race tonight when was the last time you ran it uh that track day we did at catalunya ah okay so new tires then new fluids and i've got some pads you can take thanks for you i i know you thought i was crazy there for a minute and i'm so sorry about this i know how you feel about street racing but cam is right this could solve my problem even if you do not agree with it come on get out of the way oh watch out for this guy now look at where he's going are you and cam okay we're just different that's all cam's always looking to the future always finding an angle hoping for something better i'm always wishing i could turn back time and i know that makes me seem hesitant sometimes but i need you to know that i'm just looking out for you i just want you to be safe [Music] [Music] uh great just when we need an accident looks like there was a police chase i heard they've been trying to crack down on the street racing scene you have to be careful tonight that's the last thing we need cam will keep an ear out on the scanners though and they'll give us a heads up if the cops are calling into the race wow that looks like someone messed up so yeah if you're gonna do this i want you to have the best shot possible cause i love you i love you too okay i'm trying not to kill us in a place of glory now [Music] if i didn't know any better i'd almost say these guys were out to deliberately kill us i wouldn't put it past it oh no i shouldn't have played it in that paranoia of yours we're almost home thank god though [Music] [Music] see i was right mauricio's put up his bmw e30 as first prize the vampire car with all those mods that's got to be worth 50 maybe 60 grand that puts a serious dent in sebastian's tab mauricio was also asking about you he was all like how come your friend never comes around anymore i miss her tell her i want to see her whatever he likes himself too much to like anybody else i knew you'd come around someday in your dreams i'm here to support a friend i think you missed the life i think you miss miami heard you used to roll with suki on her crew you heard wrong there's my friend see you around mauricio just answer me one thing i really have to go if you truly given up on the streets how come you brought that sweet ride of yours i'm willing to go double or nothing two cars twice the price but only if i see you on the starting line holy crap you could win this and you know it and double mean sebastian's debt would be completely wiped out did you forget everything we went through back in miami no i didn't i just thought you might want to repay one life by saving another what's going on why do i feel like i just missed something important vienna's going to race too no no no no you told me after what happened back home you would never race again i changed my mind when we first met you didn't even tell me you used to race i thought you were just a a cool chick who was into cars so what i'm not cool anymore no i i cannot let you do this mauricio's put a double or nothing offer on the table it could wipe out your debt completely i'm not worth you going back on your vow why don't you let me decide what you're worth it's a relay race so we're partners in this we'll do this together it's me something's come up with one of our drivers tell your boss this could be a very good thing for him okay we've got this v the first turn is a tight left so take the inside and then the quicker you can do the hairpin the faster you can tag me in tight left left again hairpin around the columbus statue sharp left and tag you just keep that engine revving drivers are you ready this is a relay race one lap around the course then tug your partner in the winner is the one that crosses the line on the fourth lap here we go three two one go let's see what you've got ah i gotta throw it in more [Music] oh yeah i got this let's see how that american whale deals with this hairpin watch and learn i may not be as light as you but me and the e-brake go back a long way mauricio get quick on those shifts now this is the time to make a gap the pedal's practically through the floor already seb ah this looks tight hard on the e-brake and i should slingshot around keep it on the red line seb i'm coming in hot let's go baby i can drift these corners all day long mauricio without power your tuner car is just skating my friend that's why i am the king i don't just have power under the hood i have power in the streets perfect time to pop that drift seb now who's the backseat driver eh keep talking mauricio your car is going home with me [Music] go go great job seth we got this nice and easy there's some police radio chatter better make it quick i don't have infinite gears here cam your reputation is every bit deserved miss cole but this isn't over yet your boyfriend isn't up to your same high standard he's still better than you mauricio here we go just clip the apex on the right hand side after the turn and we've got this that's it you're up go go go come on come on let's go that's it come on [Applause] i'll admit you play the game well but this is my game and i make the rules what are you talking about we've raced completely fair first rule is the house always you seem to be out here racing mr miro should you not be at home gathering our money whoa whoa you can't collect from a dead man you'd be surprised what we can collect from the dead my friend ah this can't be happening can't you see that i am doing this to pay you back by winning mauricio's car interesting idea but mauricio is one of us his car his house his everything belongs to us you are trying to win something that is already ours that's between you and mauricio we were about to win this race fair and square fee stay out of this i'm sorry i do not recall giving you permission to speak [Music] you now have 48 hours to reimburse us mr miro or would you like me to pursue your debt with her enjoy the rest of your evening are you okay come on we've got a scramble i'm fine cam is right we gotta go we need to get off the main road where are we going we'll go back to the house and figure it out from there i should have never involved you i would have been pissed if you hadn't enough with the sob story we've got to lose these cops make a left upper head we can lose them down the side streets damn it we can lose them in here hold on are you okay yeah my ribs are aching that's all you know this area as well as i do now lose those cops why am i getting deja vu that's twice now we're being followed on the same damn road just punch it here we can hide in here kill the lights do you think they saw us okay it was too close for comfort let's go so you've both done enough i'm going to split those greens will be looking for you at your garage no no i mean split the country it's the only way to keep you both safe you mean keep you safe don't you think they've already asked maurizio who we are and where we live and now the cops are after us too oh [ __ ] if you go we have to go but i'd rather not go on the run again there's got to be another way we'll sell all our cars everything and settle the debt no no you can't i'm going to turn myself in maybe the talakul will let me work off the debts and then you become a criminal for real better than dead [Music] i think i know someone who can help you have contacts in the criminal underworld since when since before and she's not a criminal over here i didn't think you come all this way i was in the neighborhood i wasn't sure you'd even remember me my visit to la was a long time ago ted put in a good word for you he said you used to drive together back in miami well i don't drive anymore that's not what i heard i'm just looking for some insight into the tata cool you know how serious they are the tatakol are no joke the top dog there is named kai can i talk to this kai no one knows how to find him interpol has him on a red notice closest thing you can get to an international arrest warrant so a polite conversation is out no you have to speak his language the tatakool are an international crime syndicate whose name means crossroads a reference to bandits who would prey on travelers the original highway robbers see that truck yeah i see them on the road all the time well now the highway robbers have a front company using those trucks to move contraband all over spain and france morocco and beyond one of those trucks just landed in the police impound maybe you can pry some information loose before the cops do [Music] okay i met with my contact she confirmed that tata cool are the real deal their boss is wanted by interpol they run contraband between morocco france and here but they can't find him so a polite conversation is out sometimes i wonder if you bugged me yeah i said the exact same thing so what now one of their trucks is in the police impound apparently if they're running supplies then whatever's inside has to be worth something they're gonna want it back if the cops have it then anything valuable will likely be already locked up in evidence i'm heading there now i'll try and find the truck and see if we can get anywhere near to see yesterday we were running from the cops now you're running towards them i know i know that's why i'm doing this solo if it all goes wrong then at least you're protected no way v i'm grabbing my keys i'll meet you there no stay at the house and look after seb play nurse for your boyfriend sorry but no that's your job besides he's asleep right now i'm on my way no cam cam damn it i never listen [Music] so [Music] get out of the way foreign whoa that was close [Music] okay looks like cam isn't here yet now where's that truck letting mention [Music] almost had you damn it kim i told you to stay at the house how suspicious do you think this looks now two cars parked up near the police station stop treating me like a kid now where's the truck over there near the entrance well there's no way in there so let me show you how the 21st century will solve this a truck that size is bound to have a cargo manifest if i can hack it i might be able to find out what it was hauling okay maybe it was good you tagged along after all oh so now you're fine with technology okay i just need to lock onto its signal almost there okay no manifest but it's got a satellite navigation system maybe i can find out where it's been previously right let's see where these guys have been okay there are six locations on their recent stops list you take three i'll take the other three sure text them to me if anything looks promising on this kai jerk i'll give you a call got it is it wrong that i'm excited about this yes it is you scare me sometimes okay first seems to be heading east out of the city in one mile take the next exit onto take the exit at the roundabout take the fourth exit onto avenue that maristan in 100 yards turn right turn right turn right and the destination is on your left the gas station from the street race last night i wouldn't be surprised if the tata cool owned this whole area still though they probably just used it to fuel the truck up it's not a delivery point next destination then turn right at the roundabout take the fourth exit onto caret different at the roundabout take the motorway v10 on run continue on motorway b10 for two miles [Music] is where you are take the exit turn left at the roundabout take the second exit onto carre del zabrez and the destination is on your right a moroccan restaurant no doubt they probably hang out there but it doesn't have a loading area no way they're shifting their hall out on the main road maybe it's the next place turn right in 300 yards turn right turn right at the t junction turn right onto kareruman casa at the roundabout take the third exit in 100 yards turn left turn left in 500 yards take a motorway v10 on run continue on motorway b10 for two miles [Music] hey v i'm at the third location which looks like some kind of factory can you get a closer look there's an insane amount of security around this place i'd say it's a fairly good bet this is where they either pick up or drop off okay any of those other addresses work out for you no but you'll never guess what i'm following right now i don't know rainbow with a pot of gold at the end if so that would be perfect right now ha ha no one of those same trucks from the impound it's driving pretty slow so it must be full okay tail it i'll circle back and take a look at one of the other destinations i found it's a restaurant and if i know one thing from watching gangster movies it's that bad guys love a good restaurant okay stay safe always amv i got this meet you back home so i should back off a bit i'm too close it's like this is the place need to make a space between us this is pretty much the last place i want to be what's going on where are you i'm in serious gang territory like where i could get shot if i look in the wrong direction we'll get the hell out of there meet you back at the house so what do you think those trucks are hauling rubies bearer bonds the lost wu-tang album who cares we know whatever's inside is valuable and we know the truck's root now so if the answer were any more obvious it would be break dancing on your face wait you want us to hijack one of their trucks no way v listen let me lay it out for you one we're not criminals two you're talking about stealing from a well-funded highly organized criminal organization that's been doing this for like a billion years three if we fail they most certainly will kill us can i lay it back out for you one they're not going to kill us because two we aren't professionals and for that reason three they'll never see us coming i actually followed that what they're right the tadacool is prepared to defend itself against tough rival gangs not three amateurs oh you're really selling this sebastian don't you see that's our advantage we hit them in transit we steal their booty and we're out you two have lost your minds v you know we can do this as much as i hate to agree with cam i think we can pull this off well i don't not without some help miss ortiz i was there at race wars when you took on that audi it was something to behold thanks and letty's fine letty and i have a mutual friend back in miami if we're going to rob the tarakul we're going to need some rides that can't be traced [Music] we've got company these cops are paid off by the taraku so they're dirty then i presume we can get rid of them by any means necessary okay split up let's make this a little more interesting for them these guys mean business [Music] the cops just shot something in my car and now it's stuck in there beeping it's a power dream [Music] now oh i'm sitting duck here damn you gotta get that cop off me oh playing dirty huh now to get your friend we're all clear how you doing laddie just got a few flies to get off my back three against one sounds good to me okay let's dance [Music] [Music] [Music] oh barcelona pd needs to up their game you want me to stop and pull over getting mad that takes care of you send my regards to your friend just you and me what you got [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] roadblock seriously you around vienna i'm clear let's get these mods done and then we've got a truck to innocent

they're firing at us sebastian is safe that's not exactly comforting over here get me you bastards [Music] one down they're too tough letty's right we can do this sebastian's still pinned down got him sebastian you're clear oh he's got some nerve oh [ __ ] he's here to finish the job get to the cab you set us up mauricio i don't think he's in the mood to talk v watch out they're throwing molotovs i've encountered punks like this before they all end up in the same place thanks for getting me behind the wheel that is for grabbing my arm that for attacking sebastian and that for being a general slime ball who's the king now mauricio sebastian you're clear go go go whoa who's this guy all right work together to get this last guy [Music] he's almost at the cab almost there just need to keep him off the truck a little longer keep pushing we got this he did it we've got the truck your boys got some skills but we still have that mercedes to deal with watch out he's dropping spikes sebastian [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] i'm so sorry i pushed you into this you didn't push anyone no i pushed i have a habit of doing that cam honey this is all on me they put you in cuffs you set us up where are we now wait a second did you cut a deal with interpol are you their informant now i am never forgiving you for this you done look we're helping interpol with the case just like you they're after kai in his organization and was killing sebastian part of the master plan we were trying to save him just like you who is we dominic tereto hold on the two of you are working for interpol how is this even possible we're doing someone a favor a favor for who nobody you'd know we believe the are a supply chain for a larger criminal network what'd you think you were ripping off a truckload of vcrs okay we get that they're super scary so why did you help us rob them then we wanted to force kai to show himself you gave us a way to do that without arousing suspicion you're kind of amateurs to him rude no she's right kai the man in the mercedes we were just mosquitos he was swatting away kai likes to keep his foot soldiers close and his enemies closer you want revenge we want justice interpol wants information what do you expect us to do make a decision do you want to stay amateurs or take this to the next level [Music] this is all interpol can afford i'm getting tetanus just looking at this place we're in the middle of a moroccan desert not many five-star accommodations around wait we're in morocco please tell me you know where kai is hiding not exactly he's been on the run since barcelona we detected him in her food but after that his trail went cold so he could be anywhere he still needs supplies and a way to communicate our drones have been getting shot down whenever they go near this a data center we know has links to his organization oh he's camera shy there's no way to hack it from the outside that's why you two are going inside us drive in hack the server get out this sounds awesome this sounds insane interpol will set you up with fake backgrounds strong enough to pass security you're also gonna have to learn that ancient beautiful language called arabic whoa what are those been working on these for a while now two desert machines built from the same parent chassis sort of like siblings well the moonshine racer has my name written all over it uh no you'll be driving that seriously it's garbage doesn't get any more anonymous than a van at least you finally got out of barcelona and into the burning desert inside a crap-ass rust bucket what do you think dom are we ready to pull this off if i didn't believe you could do it i wouldn't have asked now us uh they talk of what they need i think hecky z good to see a sister in charge for once so they're progressive criminals feel so much better [Music] okay this is your stop there don't seem to be any cameras here so jump out as i pass the back of the building and then get out of sight got it okay go go go go i'm almost in be careful careful is my middle name handful is your middle name that was deserved let me know when you finish the hack i've got to go deliver this fake package but i'll swing around and pick you up what is it uh we may have a problem but don't worry about it focus on the download i'm even more worried now i'll take care of it okay let me see if there's another way back in there from the delivery point we're gonna have to figure out another place to meet i think my cover's blown and i can't make it back the way i came what i'm gonna circle around the perimeter and try to get you out that way how's the download i'm done okay i'll figure something out cam they know we're here get out of there now already on it oh hell yes now this is a

what happened well after you deserted me i was stuck in that fortress everywhere i went there were bad guys and that solar array was blinding so i made an executive decision to smash my way out and that side seems to have been a little fragile still though it managed to take out kai's men that were shooting at me and you managed to get the data yep got that too wow great job cam i know i may not say it out loud a lot but i know you can handle yourself letty come in we've got the data and we're heading back we see you [Music] good work looks like a list of businesses and properties on the tatacool payroll so now interpol can just roll in and these are just map squares not precise gps points we're gonna have to check these out in person and soon they're gonna be on high alert since your escape wasn't exactly stealthy hey that was only partially my fault vienna you ready to ride i'm not letting kai slip away again [Music] you
