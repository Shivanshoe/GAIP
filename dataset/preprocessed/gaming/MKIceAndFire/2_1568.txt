knowledge how would I know more than anyone else you mentioned your ears we're everywhere you heard of me before I even set foot in NOLA seems like someone so informed would know a bit more than the

name I'm not telling you my name okay so don't ask anymore no need for the attitude where are you from can you share that a long way from here but no one's where I wanted to be a scientist oh [ __ ]

about a dead old man the old man had a name and it was all read and it seems like only was trying to track you down there must have been a reason right I'm telling you I don't know anything about what's going on up there there's no reason to trap me down what do you mean by up there if you're not up here with the rest of us where are you that's uh that's classified you don't have clearance if

family treated her as if she were my own flesh and blood yet she did not hesitate to betray me she tried to turn my dearest and most loyal friends against me she is desperate and will do the same to
