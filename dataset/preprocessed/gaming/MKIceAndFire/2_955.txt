[Music] alderaan shows destruction the survivors continue to spread dissent find them do not rest until the destruction of alderaan is complete lord vader's orders are clear are they yes wipe out all that remains of alderaan how i understood the survivors were in hiding intelligence reports a possible alderaanian convoy heading to foster haven you are to draw them out and finish them off do you understand that captain perfectly commodore sloane dismissed [Music] captain james everything ready lieutenant carol squadron's on their way they're excited to fulfill lord vader's command and you no qualms hunting down refugees from a world we destroyed during the iscalon uprising you taught me to ignore propaganda they're traitors not refugees and will be dealt with accordingly i've prepped our usual sigma 9 loadout no only standard ties today flying old school sir this might be a real challenge after all you hear me teresa but i don't think you understand me i guess we'll find out follow my lead and don't fire unless i give the order the convoy is out there we don't want to scare them off [Music] let's do this right i'll give it my all [Music] begin pre-flight checks pilot hold up your cockpit systems sure thing [Music] all systems up and running preflight complete let's get a clean launch lock onto my fighter [Music] forward sensor online and tracking now throttle up and deploy out of the hangar [Music] ah the rest of the fleet is back from malistaire we'll have plenty of help to deal with that convoy of sympathizers helix squadron we're prepping transport standby copy vigilance all pilots follow me we'll do a quick pass of the fleet calibrate flight controls all right [Applause] stay mobile we don't want any collisions [Applause] [Applause] is no time to get careless you're right sir it is good to fly old school again there's something very forthright about a tie fighter looks like someone's testing battle formations better here than in the field again keep your distance helix those engines run hot enough to vaporize a tie i've known a few daredevils who found that out the hard way time pilots push the limits sometimes the limits push back [Music] grown good all systems calibrated and the fleet is in good shape the vigilance reports how goes anti-transport is ready healing squadron head to the gaza and dock for hyperspace jump [Music] affirmative can engage helix squadron are docked and clear for hyperspace jump remember helix we'll have support but finding the refugee convoy is up to us they won't escape the empire twice it's only a haven for thieves and pirates if the refugees are hiding here clearly they're not as innocent as they claim [Applause] [Applause] is secure at least agreed all cargo vessels this is captain lyndon james of the galactic empire prepare for immediate inspection and this is foster heaven's station master kindly avoid harassing my customers if they cooperate they'll be fine pilot proceed notice check your forward sensor it will identify potential targets pilot begin by inspecting that ship wait wait we have always been loyal to the empire see we're loyal i swear no refugees are bored carry on good check that next look i'll pay anything just don't empower my not part of the check another ship so you're not in pounding my ship there a ship's trying to flee from a simple inspection we should teach them some manners all pilots bring your weapon systems online pilot track it on your sensors and fire a small volley just enough to damage them and see if they're hiding the refugees no refugees here sir just smuggled weapons and a cargo of spice let the fleet handle those smugglers we should get to the station my customers are legitimate you have no right captain the station's defenses just activated helix squadron destroy those turrets we can't search under fire out here no one shoots unless they're prepared for return fire even the empire should know that attack the defense capability is dropping keep [Applause] going destroyed taking fire [Music] [Music] that should do good shooting pilot our reputation will never recover from this [Music] captain james i think i found where the refugees are hiding on our way pilot with me [Music] imperials off my station they must be protected defend yourselves i've got a tail rubble down target destroyed down that's half the rebel scum destroyed target destroyed scratch one enemy is down picked up a tail rebel captain the rebel fighters are coming from that tunnel through the station the refugee convoy must be hiding in there after them we'll deal with you later station master you attack my station the convoy prepare to fire ship is disabled all systems down those were iron missiles where the hell did they come from sorry teresa after alderaan i can't ignore what the empire's become sir lyndon what are you saying that i don't care who ordered it i didn't sign up to hurt innocent refugees and if protecting them makes me a rebel then so be it damn it pilot see if you can bypass his shutdown keep it together lieutenant carol to the vigilance captain james is aiding the rebellion send immediate i hope assistance come to this watch you won't stop me i see the convoy dead ahead prepare to fire imperial squadron this is refugee convoy hope of alderaan we have families aboard i'm here to help convoy leader i'm trying to explain just get out of this [Applause] tunnel [Music] [Music] hey almost forgot you were there [Applause] that call sounds desperate can anyone make out what he's saying they're working on it okay any luck pinpointing that distress call hopefully you may need to get creative make sure your fighters are in good shape understood sir echo prepare for systems check coming back around squadron on me so much for a quiet patrol starting systems check fine if we're up against a star destroyer we'll need maneuverability shooting down ties double check shields right we might need to hold out a while systems check complete information echo 3 matching formation echo 2 standing by echo 5 standing by i'm with you okay squadron anyone low on missiles needs to stock up now head to the u-wing for resupply everyone needs a full supply of missiles all good good come on drive imperials don't rest we can't either admiral we're here yeah but the convoy's way over there but the bad guys between us and them echo squadron transfer all power to engines head below the star destroyer and wait for my signal it's risky but flying fast and close to the star destroyers hall should get us to the other side safely steady hold now fire all boost thrusters we are not losing anyone else the convoy needs support wait that was an imperial transmission on an open channel i'm glad someone heard my distress call i couldn't hold off those ties any longer who are you a defector if you'll take me call me lyndon i'll explain later pilot help me push these fighters back echo four leave that quasar for now focus on ties then we better get rid of those ties fire missiles joining formation defend the convoy before it's too late anyone got missiles let them have it they're on my tail good looking out i couldn't let the empire destroy more innocence from alderaan in the name of security there you go let's get in position and escort these transports i'm right beside you this is admiral the ripple alliance echo leader reports you're willing to defect willing and able keep assisting echo squadron squadron there's a quasar bearing down on the convoy and filled with reinforcements take the ties down oh focus on the quasar we'll mop up the ties destroy that one on my tail i'm not saying thanks so laughs enemy on my tail that's all the ties down yes nice work squadron i think we're clear for now let's make the most of it echo squadron bring the convoy and linden here to a safer position we're on it admiral i know how this imperial fleet operates i can tell they're prepping their capital ships for an attack right now we need backup all right i'll send you the rest of echo squadron with everything they've got heading towards a star destroyer again facing its turrets this time it's okay flank is now at your location echo squadron keep the convoy safe while the flagship engages the vigilance leave it to us wait the empire's sending in a raider to intercept the convoy we have to take that raider down pilot with me almost in range get ready this is our chance raiders top at least the fleet's keeping that star destroyer busy head to the far side of the nc 80. the star destroyer will be watching all possible vectors they can still find you pilot it's risky but if we can destroy the targeting system on the vigilance we might throw them off the convoy's trail wait you two are attacking the star destroyer let's hope your feet can keep those shields down right here we can take down the vision this is targeting we're getting there keep firing keep moving better to do multiple passes that's it vigilance's targeting is down convoy vessels prep for light speed jump and the squadron withdraw and handle any fighters near the convoy he did it now both of you get clear pilot whatever happens next you saved a lot of innocent lives and mine speed [Music] [Music] we all choose our path light or dark freedom or destruction the empire chose to destroy alderaan in order to spread fear and douse the fires of rebellion but the heroic pilots of the rebel alliance have chosen to keep fighting to show the empire that we are not afraid it was their bravery that ended palpatine's reign and brought about our new republic however the empire lives on shattered though it may be as i speak imperial forces are edging toward the bormia sector hoping to end our new republic before we find our footing as their empire collapses they try to tighten their grip but the galaxy is changing and you can be a part of it with the help of brave and daring pilots this war can end make a choice fly with the new republic change our galaxy for the better oh vanguard squadron to temperance do you read us now had some trouble with our long-range calms you're the third patrol reporting com blackouts head on back gunny the commander will want a full report lousy calms chasing our tails for hours and now we're late to meet the new boss well do you want to race home frisk we might make it before his speech ends ko i ain't racing you i learned my lesson the first 12 times hush the speech is starting i'm not one for speeches so i'll just say i'm honored to assume command of the temperance in this fleet vanguard squadron's reputation for bravery and integrity is unrivaled which is why i affected immediately we have been reassigned to an initiative code name project starhawk starhook then those rumors about a secret project are true what do you think it is some kind of weapon the key to victory if it helps end the war who cares i care i like to know who i'm working for the good guys risk remember the only people in the galaxy who don't have a death mark on you [Applause] ah grace the day ain't over yet come on back to the temperance we can meet the new boss and anyone else he's bringing along ah there you are are those said to expect you i'm zarel de sage chief mechanic and this here's the temperance my pride and joy i imagine you're excited to join the action speaking of here's the rest of your squadron hey gunny i got your new pilot over here you go ahead homie welcome to vanguard squadron i'm kyra kuva you can call me gunny happy to have you on the team let's talk after the briefing again you're joining one of the best outfits in the new republic hope you can live up to it anyway follow them into the briefing room i think our new commander's waiting for you in there huh you've arrived excellent otto meet our new vanguard five oh the one who saved your skin at foster haven ardo intelligence a pleasure i heard they rewarded you with a posting to chandrila a real honor very safe but a good pilot shouldn't just gather dust i needed people i can trust and i figured you'd want to get back into the action huh there's no shortage of that around here right let's get you briefed welcome back to the front line vanguard 5. as you've noted experienced the empire is jamming communications across the sector i fear these blackouts could be a prelude to invasion vanguard squadron i need you to split up to solve this christian grace bring our new pilot to the brental system's borders the scouts we sent to investigate haven't reported in find out what happened to them then regroup with your squadron near the planet cabos gunny and keo that's where you're headed if i were still an imperial well i'd send jamming ships there knowing the empire i expect they're using these jamming vessels to disrupt our long-range calms they'll have thai squadrons in tow destroy all imperial squadrons and jammers communications must be restored for project starhawk's future when you've succeeded regroup and return to the temperance let's see how you do vanguard squadron got a moment oh hey i'm keo venzie welcome to vanguard squadron you'll do great things with us trust me this is an amazing team i went from semi-pro racing to fighting the empire quite a change but everyone in vanguard lifts up the others you'll fit right in whatever this project starhawk is i suppose the commanders will tell us when they're ready but for now we have scouts to find according to the battle plan we aren't flying together on this mission but you'll be on my wing sooner than later see you out there hello grace salia vittara seiner grace if you like it's a pleasure i've been with vanguard long enough for gunny to trust me with second position and she doesn't trust easily especially those from imperial families well everyone finds out sooner or later yes unfortunately my dear estranged family builds tie fighters for the empire and i take great delight in blasting those fighters to stardust i trust you will too see you out there nice to meet you squad calls me frisk only grace calls me by my real name and only when she's mad i know it's not often you find a handsome fella like me fighting for the rebellion uh new republic or whatever we are now i used to be in what you might call acquisitions you know hunting down trophies antiques anything collectors wanted until i got that pesky death mark of course how was i supposed to know that painting was fake or that the imperial governor was gonna show it off to admiral thrawn that's what's great about this place though they always got a birth for a good pilot death mark or not say you play sabach i'm trying to learn but no one around here ever wants to play me maybe we could uh go a few rounds huh for credits of course it's the only way i'm gonna learn right guess we should get on and fix that calm blackout finally chance to get acquainted like i said the name's gunny stay sharp keep your nose clean and we'll be off to a good start we had calm blackouts like this right before the empire invaded mimbin lost a lot of friends but i learned to shoot a blaster you'll be flying with frisk and grace today meet him if you haven't the best advice i can give you is this stick with your squadron it's simple but sometimes hot shots and lone wolves need to hear it get to your ship they're ready to go just hop in the cockpit ah the x-wing backbone of the rebel alliance and our new republic a good all-rounder that'll stand up to any starfighter capital ship in the imperial fleet power management systems check all right i'm loading in your astro mcdroid now keep an eye on it quiet tin can we got a pre-flight check to do radar working like a dream loadout data looking good combat display check primary weapons charged up ready to take down ties throttle and boost good to go whole integrity never better you're welcome all systems go vanguard 5 you're clear for lunch good luck out there foreign [Music] you remember your mission parameters vanguard squadron find the scouts smash the jamming ships and get back before the candida closes i think commander james skipped that in the briefing all right see you soon good luck you two our jump points just ahead hyperspace coordinates calculated engines are hot let's do this vanguard squadron this never gets old hey grace [Music] you got anything grace we've got to be able to find someone out here [Applause] heavy interference gunny and kia will take care of that shortly we should investigate the signal and regroup with them me too grace me too there's our target let's slow it down ah heck our scouts didn't make it empire must have found him first if that's the case where is the empire vanguard 5 scan the debris i know it's macabre but we need you to lock onto the wreck and get close such brutality even that astromech got dusted [Music] someone really didn't want these scouts getting home hey i'm picking up a second signal let's check it out follow me i don't like this grace i hear you something's not right if we're lucky something survived the attack stay ready for anything wait it's not a new republic signal it's imperial good looking out another destroyed i'm not saying thank you must have been support for the empire's jamming ships if we scan the wreckage for its last known trajectory it could lead us to the jammers that's a heck of an idea vanguard five scan the debris and we'll watch your back that's it nice work vanguard five let's see that path was leading them toward gunny and kia's coordinates if we're quick maybe we can cut off the empire before they find our friends [Music] marking coordinates hopefully they don't know we're coming let's do this right for the scouts we lost lead the way vanguard five whatever comes next we face it together two imperial jamming ships ahead no sign of gunny or keo finish him off missile get moving that's just rude look enemies locked onto me i should have stayed home [Music] ties are finished concert still scrabbles do you read me we just got off two jamming ships to your location [Music] let's roll vanguard 5. finally oh you're right on time still imperial reinforcements another goes anti with ties now we take them out too i bet and stay down good job to be the hero hey you did your job that's all the tie fighters that'll patch up your hole and stock up your ordinance follow me i'm on your wing vanguard we have an imperial cruiser protecting the last of the jammers taking down these ships ain't gonna be easy oh while the cruiser has a missile launcher we'll keep our countermeasures ready what's our plane if we take out the jammers first we can call the temperance for reinforcements that's why you're in charge cubby vanguard 5 focus on the jammers copy here we go good enough for me let's finish off the last one you're safe communication should be restored if you read me we need reinforcements on my position has arrived right here and ready to go close one vanguard i'm grateful to command such a strong squadron come on back to the temperance thank you commander james we'll celebrate a job well done at the cantina come on vanguard let's get out of here foreign great work team first rounds on frisk welcome home vanguard no time for celebration i'm afraid we have a visitor and a mission i think you'll be interested so where is it now i helped talus group chasing away from a medical convoy towards yavin it's pinned in the upper atmosphere with no hyperdrive but too many fighters for talis group to handle alone this might work out for both of us come meet a visitor wedge antilles rogue squadron i hear you're the reason i was able to finally get a calm through i have a star destroyer problem that vanguard might be able to help me solve we need a star destroyer for project starhawk intact now we prove it vanguard's made of which you would settle as you may have overheard talus group has cornered the imperial star destroyer victorium above the planet yevon they're in tough but it's presented a great opportunity for us to jump in and not only disable that star destroyer but to seize control so first we need to give ourselves some cover by knocking out the turrets naturally if we can also take out the targeting system that'll buy us even more time next we need to prepare the star destroyer for boarding you'll need to find a potential breach point in the victorium's hull preferably near the bridge once you find a good spot bombard it until the hull is breached however we can expect that the victorium still has plenty of tie fighters they will try to stop us once the skies are clear we can bring in the boarding team while our troops capture the bridge vanguard will defend the exterior from reinforcements once the boarding team has seized the bridge and is in control of the star destroyer we will rendezvous with the temperance okay i think i accidentally made stealing a star destroyer sounds simple let's hope it is the star destroyer aren't you tossing him in the deep end a little early lyndon vanguard can handle it can't you besides project starhawk needs that star destroyer for well you know wedge made a name for himself at the battle of yavin he knows that system better than the empire ever will you'll be fighting on the rebellion's old turf so if wedge has any advice you'd be smart to listen you know a wounded krakana can still bite just watch yourself around that star destroyer huh get out there as soon as you can sorry for the speedy introduction but talus group was counting on me to get reinforcements fast your commander says you have talent enough to steal a star destroyer and get away with it normally i'd have rogue squadron for this but general sindullah gave me a temporary assignment to project starhawk meanwhile rogue is handling well that's classified too sendula keeps us busy your commander and i have something in common i once flew for the empire too at skystrike academy turning to the rebellion was the smartest move i ever made i wish more of my friends have done the same look i appreciate the talk but uh talus groups waiting for us [Music] so we're headed to yavin an exalted company it seems and now we know project starhawk needs an imperial star destroyer that's enough firepower to tackle a small fleet or a means to catch the empire off guard but that wouldn't warrant all this secrecy there must be more to the commander's plan we'll just have to trust him too bad there isn't an easier way to get what we need even a damaged star destroyer has deck upon deck of dura steel plating turrets shields my poor bigoted father called star destroyers the fists of the empire it wasn't wrong but they can be beaten if you're good and lucky let's stay optimistic to yavin then let's not have been delay the commander wants you on an x-wing for this mission got you outfitted with ion missiles they disable enemy fighters and they'll disable subsystems on enemy capital ships too [Music] gavin prime this place always brings back memories let's hope for some of that skywalker luck today all right ready vanguard we're heading for the heart of the action vanguard follow his lead this is leader calling for immediate assistance captain antilles with that guard squadron here to help it's damn good to see you wedge we've taken heavy losses we need that star destroyer stopped don't you worry we're here to hijack it you're what be ready interceptors those have got to be the first to go agreed they're fast they're right throughout fighters vanguard prioritized targets [Applause] you got it the enemies after you hey you did your job they got a lock don't stop now that's it all ties down good job vanguard okay regroup on thomas leader wedge we've taken heavy losses we need to make a few repairs then get ourselves out of here roger that talus leader i don't worry about the imperials we'll keep them busy you're really gonna steal that star destroyer that's the plan okay vanguard on me let's head for the victoria focus your shields before they open fire on us let's do it but stealing it i like that even better got a lock on me will anyone see that no on your wings if we take the bridge we'll have access to its internal systems scan for a breach point so we can send an aborting team you're up five reaching a star destroyer just like the old days look out vanguard we got a gunny story and let's keep looking imperial fighters incoming [Music] taking [Music] we can send the team in here clear the skies good looking out got interceptors on me can't shake them up i'm in a real bind here i'm not saying thank you i'm taking fire destroyed vanguard let's go morning team we have you in our sights ready to take on a star destroyer copy captain antilles just get us there and we'll do the rest you heard him back on guy those u-wings into position stay sharp what about the star destroyer's crew if a boarding party takes the bridge they'll slice internal security systems the crew won't be a problem with no computer access and out that cruiser here i am against the shields enemies to the bridge great work all right team let's finish off the rest brady is sealed cutting through the blast doors i'm with you enemy's locked on me [Applause] got them all okay regroup at my position the voting team might need support we're almost through those glass doors we've got another imperial carrier make that three carriers that's a lot get ready everyone we're in taking control now that star destroyer has taken down its own carrier what a sight yes the ship is ours i'll escort talos group to safe harbor great work general sindullah will be impressed wedge you know now that was a fun mission even better than beating my time on the death march circuit we got to steal a star destroyer and help our friends doing it and see yavin we still have allies on the fourth moon but i've never been there there was an energy at yavin like i've never felt anywhere else it was chaotic and serene all at once the empire corrupts the energy of every planet it touches but i can always feel the good buried beneath that and that's what we fight for the good anyway i saw frisk bothering commander james earlier knowing frisk the commander might appreciate some backup now the empire is gonna want that star destroyer back good let's see him try and take it you know back home after the empire invaded membin we stole an armored transport hauler full of scout walkers when the empire came looking for them we just turned the walkers against them had a real good time i'm guessing the commander has something similar in mind for this star destroyer right otherwise what's the point at least wedge picked the right team for the job those slackers and alphabet squadrons still be baffing around at yavin enough yapping time to check with the commander and see what's next not now frisk i'll answer your questions once the star destroyer has been delivered safely delivered where we risked our tails to get that star destroyer and you can't even tell us where we're going it's not my call besides i'd be risking a lot of lies if i shared too much too soon you hearing this after all we did for project starhawk listen all i can tell you is the basics [Music] it was just getting good we have an emergency the star destroyer you captured is unexpectedly fallen out of a hyperspace behind enemy lines our troops are repairing the hyperdrive as quickly as possible but you need to buy them some time there's an imperial fleet advancing toward the star destroyer victorium i want a wings intercepting enemy fighters the rest of vanguard will provide defense and i know imperial protocol better than most i have no doubt the empire will disable the victorian with ion weapons before sending shuttles to recapture it stop them at all costs the empire must not reclaim the victorium once the star destroyer's hyperdrive is operational cover its escape so it can jump to safety i'll send you rendezvous coordinates when the time is right [Music] you
