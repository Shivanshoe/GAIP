[Music] first what's going on here close combat training fighting at long range is a good strategy for machines but fighting an enemy soldier means getting up in their face i'm mariah my brother barack and i run this training pit we watched you bring down the bulwark made our day to see that arrogant commander so furious you're welcome to train here but you're only allowed your spear into practice bow in the pit everything else stays with me we also offer challenges for any fighters looking to test their skills complete all of them and you'll go up against me and barack what happens if i beat you i'll grant you a mark to prove you've mastered this training pit you earned marks from us and the pit masters in scalding spear and thorn marsh you'll earn the right to challenge the enduring i think i've heard of the enduring some kind of tanakh trainer way more than just that the enduring is a legendary fighter among the clans the master of masters only those who prove themselves in the pits get to train with the enduring including outlanders you're no ordinary outlander so what do you say let me know if you want to practice in the pit or take on a challenge and you can't win a battle if you're dead and distance will keep you alive this combination gets you out of trouble and punishes your enemy just need a rib from that fang survival on the battlefield is down to tactics your best target isn't always the closest so select your target and strike come [Music] judging by these markers that climbing trail jacka talked about must be nearby i should check up on her brother while i'm here oh is this all of us huh the way that wind picked up there's bound to be an avalanche that person looks like they're in charge i should talk to them well breaker if you've come to witness the march of the ten you're out of luck actually i came looking for someone called pentel pento that poor scab was as good as dead even before the storm hit you're out of line soldier what's he talking about the kid you're looking for is still up on the mountain along with two others pinto was the only one who decided to break tradition and climb without a partner his odds aren't good i'm sorry to say they never were to begin with as far as being tanak goes he's got most of it backwards so what you're all just waiting here shouldn't you be calling for help couldn't find anyone in that storm even if we wanted to those kids are at the mercy of the mountain now we'll see about that but first a couple of questions [Music] why is everyone so sure this penta can't climb that mountain our people are soldiers we respect strength and agility panto has neither never has he's been stuck on cleaning duty since he was a child yet he decided to undergo our clan's most difficult trial on his own and you think he's crazy for trying i'm not a fan of that word when i chose to wear a woman's armor people called me crazy too i guess pentel just feels like he has to prove himself to show who he really is i understand believe me but that climb is hard enough even without a storm what is this march you mentioned this is one of the toughest slopes in skyclan territory it said that the ten climbed this mountain in pairs during their war against machines our people partner up to earn their soldiers marks by following in the old one's footsteps and retrieving the blood crest a flower that grows on the summit until pento that is he insisted on climbing on his own you mean no one wanted to climb up with him i tried to stop him but there were technically no rules against it so i let him pass that sounds familiar lenora have a similar ritual no one wanted me in that one either they're a mistake i presume yep i could try following the path up the mountain see if i can find penta you said there were two other climbers missing as well just one the other is right there zika rocco and i we were climbing back down there was an avalanche where we got separated i couldn't see anything someone's got to go up there you can barely see your own feet in that storm except i don't need to i'll be back the snowfall is blanketing the land jeff storm gets too rough i can always use my focus to find those climbers i should follow the markers they'll lead me to the start this'll keep uh you want some of this sounds like someone's putting up a flight that's knox needs help i round up now whoever you are thanks for the assist stranger you okay not really but i'll live your climbing partner she said you got separated during an avalanche my partner yeah the avalanche caught us off guard swept me up like a twig i was sure i was a goner then someone grabbed hold of me and pulled me out it was penta he risked his life for me did you see where he went up that cliff behind you said he was gonna finish the climb i told him it was suicide but he wouldn't listen can you make it back down on your own yes you're not going after him are you go get back to a content before the storm gets any worse may the 10 be with you i have to find penta before he gets himself killed pack's full but my stash has room huh i should use my focus to pick up pinto's trail those must be pentose tracks looks like the avalanche destroyed most of the climbing path looks like the avalanche destroyed most of the climbing path missing soldier must have climbed up this way this pigment would work well since we made it past here the path must have collapsed after him maybe i can glide across i should be able to pick up pentos tracks again get out of my way let's hope that's bento looks like we could use some help who's there a friend hit something something's interfering with my focus we need to get off this mountain now no i'm not going back there as a failure i am getting that flower no matter what look i know what it's like when your tribe looks down on you but you then you understand why i'm either gonna get to the top of this mountain or die on it thank you what are you doing this climb is meant to be done by two people right i'll be your partner i'll follow your lead hey better take this looks like the trail carries on here you know my name but i don't think i caught yours it's okay you sure you want to involve yourself with the pool works biggest loser aloy i like to make my own judgments about people you know it's not like everyone could be born with a sword glued to their hand what was that i don't know maybe it's just the wind there's a cliff that was amazing i'll knock this i'll just wait here forever you won't hear me complaining we should be able to jump onto that climbing path from the tree not some climbing gear you've got thanks it's time to start climbing that doesn't sound like any storm wind i've ever heard almost there this is it i can't believe we actually made it let's get to that summit then rock clock that's what we need we can handle it come on get out of my way oh ah oh huh we got it come on this way wait up no storm it's easing up so how does it feel to make rank pretty great actually this this means everything to me you know even if you go back with that it doesn't mean they'll treat you any different honestly i think i just need to prove to myself i could do this you should go back let the others know i'm okay i'd like to take a moment if you don't mind i'll be right behind you of course thank you i can probably reach the bottom of the trail faster if i use my shield wing and get a nice view too i can't thank you enough for being my partner aloy everything looks so peaceful now that the storm has passed [Music] i should be reaching the bottom of the trail soon panto can't be far behind where's everyone eloy you have any news please i need to know what happened to my brother eloy you return alone where is he he's my brother you can't go crying like that jeka you're the sister of a proper soldier now bento ow i bring you the blood crest as proof of my march and with my blessing you join our ranks may you find your path on the wings of the ten you've got to be kidding me him a soldier please flower or no flower we all know all he'll ever be good for is cleaning everyone's i think we're done here [Music] better put some snow on that burrito bruise thanks for saving my life maybe when i get my own soldier's mark we can fight in the same squad give me a chance to return the favor he's cute go on i'll catch up here something to commemorate our climb may the 10 always grant you victory alloy i'll see you around pinto [Music] foreign [Music] uh come and trade good time to pull out shock ammo so huh uh oh [Music] huh oh jarrah said the old watchtower should be near the falls don't tell those soldiers to head home there's the watchtower i need to talk to their squad leader kiva this will be in my stash when i need it are you kiva i am and you you're the outlander who killed regala's champion at the embassy ram squad was there we saw your duel pavalo still owes me shards oh thanks for the vote of confidence chaplain jarrah sent me it's time for you to go home chair is cracked then there's no way our commander will allow us to leave our post not after our insubordination things have uh changed at the bulwark dakota won't be able to stop you really he's finally been taken down a notch all right then the last member of ram squad is on duty at the tower on the mountain let me recall him [Music] that's odd as echo always answers one of us will have to go up i can get up there easily i'll check on him much appreciated the start of the climb is just across the falls try not to break your neck yeah what's going on we're moving out back to the bulwark you're me what about a zecko the outlander will check on it calling gently uh this must be the start of the climb collapse hours should be applied [Music] gotcha [Music] oh wow huh oh [Music] i can get it for my stash later [Music] i make an interesting color for my armor there's some kind of machine certainly that's not a good sign i'm getting closer to the watchtower looks like i have to climb higher that machine could swoop down on me if i'm not careful [Music] i gotta take out these machines before i can look around [Music] so oh [Music] oh come on [Music] oh to this watchtower that must be him judging by these wounds the sky drifter surprised him winston was quick [Music] even sounded her horn it's a different call from before i'd better get back down to the watchtower and check on them i watch towers under attack i need to get down there fast swooping into battle those machines are in for a surprise one of the 10 outlander glides oh here we go and oh with an angry planet uh oh thanks for the assist is the zekko on his way down actually machines got him took him by surprise i'm sorry what he was the first of the squad our best fighter he's gone kiva it's just the two of you know damn dakota all we did was go to the embassy follow chief accaro's orders and what do we get for it a death sentence dressed up as guard duty all because takote has a vendetta against the chief well that ends now yeah thanks outlander here this is for you pavalo we're moving out dakota is an underhanded jerk and maybe now he'll stop wasting lives over political agendas [Music] [Music] [Music] i try using acid ammo [Music] a different fight [Music] access there yep [Music] down it goes oh oh uh [Music] could freeze that machine uh so so around your home oh how do you like me now wow foreign [Music] get away from my rig the officer on my mat said someone in their crew ran off in this direction i should keep my eyes open damn scavenger sounds like someone's in trouble but it looks like it's strong against shock damage i think she's gonna need some backup ugh ah is it safe did they get to it please be intact please i should make sure she's okay [Music] supply girl oh [Music] yes it's still working you took out those machines i'm grateful but you should go now there's nothing to see here so this rig of yours it's receiving sound through that wire from the thing up on the cliff what you call a spike but the message is only a fragment and you're trying to pick up the whole thing how did you figure all that out i've learned a few things in my travels if you want we could talk about it maybe i can help you do seem downright knowledgeable so go ahead shoot how did you first hear the message i used to be a smith up in the claim wasn't an easy life a lot of hard work without much to show for it then one day i heard a whisper coming from a steel rod faint like the last fingers of steam coming off a cooling forge when i moved the rod around the whispers got louder i did some tinkering built my rig and did my best to follow that sound further west i came the stronger it got then i found that spike up there when i hooked up my rig the words were clearer than ever what do you think the message is i don't know there's something sad about it feels like it's from one lost soul to another i'd sure like to know what it means your rig's impressive how does it work well like you said the spike up there seems to capture the sound it travels by wire down to my contraption i put some coils in there and a light sheet of metal that vibrates making the sound louder i'm not exactly sure why it works but it just does and you set it up out here all alone i'm not the trusting type pretty much everything i do is all alone you're no ordinary tinker didn't used to be a tinker at all more of a metal worker came from mainspring i can weld it seems so fine you could barely see it not that i ever got any credit for it you see up there you've got to be a man to get ahead i once had a shot at joining a first-rate crew one of the best forges in the claim but i didn't get the job my own brother wouldn't vouch for me just because i'm of the female persuasion anyhow at least out here i don't have to worry about any mainspring men talking down to me sounds like you're still mad at your brother some days i am other days i miss him he's passed on you see he didn't have the guts to go against the blast of the bellows and vouch for a lady even his own sister it was cowardly and i told him so in fact i told him we weren't family no more but over time i've had cause to regret it he wasn't a bad sort he knew how to make me smile when he wasn't being such a lout i'm sorry he's gone yeah so am i blast at all let me have a look at that spike i might be able to pick up more of that message how let's just say i have a rig of my own i didn't know nora were tinkers they're not but i am in a way be right back well okay then i guess just follow the wire to the spike at the top and then please just don't break anything you get a strong color on this better get climbing wire up a cliff wall there's a spike i might get better reception if i'm next to it uh [Laughter] enduring victory interesting can't seem to get a fix on where the signal's coming from though well better let the tinker know i got a bit more of the message this ought to be a good shortcut [Applause] so your rig is picking up an old world message a recording of some kind thought as much did you hear more of it a bit it was recorded during a war a bad one maybe that's why it sounds so darn sad there's something about it that makes me think of my late brother may his ashes stay warm in the forge not sure why exactly i uh i still can't get a fix on the source well the words grew stronger when i got out here what if you moved the rig now try to see if you can get a stronger signal elsewhere even if i could dodge the tanakh and the machines i can't lose that spike nothing else pulls down the words better okay if it's an old world message then let's try old world methods they used to pinpoint signals by listening for them at three different spots the taller the better and then they combined the information and used it to find the source and you can do that i think so but your spike is only one spot i need two more both up high huh well there's a big bright tower in the territory north of here yeah that should work i have another spot in mind near a place i'm uh camping wait i don't know your name or why you do all of this for someone you just met hey boy and because i want to know what's out there same as you zelda and when you find it eloy i'd be eager to hear what it is [Music] what i have to go on foot from here [Music] he's okay a tower should help me pinpoint silva's signal walking on will go foreign now what is it you're looking for today all right welcome gotta climb up to look for silva's signal i gotta keep climbing to pinpoint that signal just a little higher almost there huh okay let's see if i can pick up silga's signal [Laughter] well i got more of the message but not enough to find source yet climbing the mountain where my base is should finish the job what i see you champion sit please you shouldn't miss this chance to trade this mountain the southern face is my best bet for a client if i want to get more of silke's message just gotta look for a path i've got nothing to report don't let the pretty landscapes fool you it's deadly out here don't have much to say right now now that i'm here i should try climbing up the mountain to get more of sylga's message this southern face should get me to a good spot what huh do i have anything that can hit it with orange water oh the ropes giving away oh yep oh about that [Music] uh [Music] i have to get higher to try and pinpoint the signal [Applause] gotcha huh uh huh hmm i have to get higher to try and pinpoint silva's signal oh this mountain is tall looks like i have company shocked it still made okay now to pick up the signal where is the best spot [Applause] i should try to find a good spot to pick up silga's message to enduring victory supply dropping there found the signal's origin it's not too far from here i just need to get to it it'll get a nice view if i glide down from here [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] right [Music] hmm i'll mark this spot in my focus come back later that's my focus is picking up the signal that silke found before i can look for the source should do the trick hurt [Applause] paint's exciting [Music] [Music] so what guys [Music] oh [Music] [Music] it's there you are now how to get to you but i'll need to deal with these machines first what [Music] angry oh uh [Music] get down [Music] all right time to find my way to the signal source uh [Music] uh oh that looks promising right into the water [Music] there you are now what's inside just wanted you to know that all the bitterness is water under the bridge i only remember the good things and i'll think about them when the darkness comes sounds like she really cared about him sylga will want to know about this and she'll definitely be interested in the transmitter inside that's been sending the message huh so what huh [Music] hmm ah eloy the word stopped coming from the spike what happened this is what was speaking to your rig it's old-world equipment used for communicating over long distances the message must have shut off when i took it but i heard the note the voice was talking about what was it during an ancient war a woman was trying to deliver supplies to a man she knew she wanted him to know that their past disagreements didn't matter in the big picture that should be thinking of him when the end came oh i guess she and i are kin of a sort i wish i could give my brother a message like that tell him that i forgave him he would have wanted that i know this man the the old one did he ever hear the message i don't think so i guess that's often the way of it then but still with the power of that device you found the sender had hope that he might have heard it what a feat to send messages near and far can i keep this it's a treasure of course thank you sometimes people don't ever get to hear what they should but with this thing maybe i can get them talking to one another from mainspring all the way to who knows where hey i uh i found a few more things in the supply cache might be able to make something out of them can i use your workbench sure yeah right over there anytime hey it's all yours i think i know just what to do with these parts what [Music] that turned out well can't wait to try it so [Music] [Music] you
