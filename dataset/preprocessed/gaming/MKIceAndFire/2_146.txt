well i mean at least there's an island right yeah at least there's an island just keep an eye out for anything man-made ah you mean pirate name sure [Music] so maybe libertalia is more of a small beachside shack yeah maybe it's a tree house well maybe avery spent his entire fortune setting up this treasure hunt and ran out of money to actually build limited nathan up there well that definitely qualifies as man-made pirate made let's find a way up to that tower yeah huh it's a door of some kind covering a chamber a massive chamber for storing a bunch of treasure no way not with his ego wherever avery put the treasure is gonna be the most elaborate place we've seen yet and it would be well protected too that makes sense looks like an old lookout tower now let's see if we can spot something from up there okay up we go sam this way this looks promising huh some kind of symbol looks like a compass arrow how did you know to do that well there's one thing i've learned from you press everything down there it's the same symbol it's another arrow let's go find out where it's pointing huh come on boat's right below us yep huh let's follow these arrows see where they go [Music] hey look another arrow over there [Music] [Music] giant gate good sign [Music] here we go you gotta admit this is pretty cool what climbing this cliff yes climbing this cliff on a giant secret pirate island i mean come on right well i think it's pretty damn cool all right back in business okay hold on just gotta not fall to my death over here wow avery wasn't much for subtlety or understatement

come on give me a hand with this yeah sure go there okay come on through thank you that's your thing geez lots of lifting and crawling under things huh the glamorous life of a treasure hunter what do you suppose this place was these arches remind me of the saint dismiss cathedral but uh i don't know i wonder how they built that oh rope bridge up there come on see what you can find up there you got

big stupid ideas about pirate treasure are you trying to climb up there in those boots oh pretty sure you don't need this yeah it's working almost there okay ugh oh boy wait target saw something maybe movement along the three line the jungle over there eh it's all moving i don't see anything damn it all right everyone false alarm but keep an eye out let's go i'm gonna go with yeah how'd they survive that wreck they keep getting lucky luck eventually runs out we'll see huh oh what the  what was that what was it hey what what uh don't worry they're up just think it's not even noon yet wonderful nothing other day hey hey you're yummy one of ours is down come on out also another one down over here all right that's it fan out find it hmm hey all right uh uh okay where to oh what's this wow that is pretty dark seems like burns crew had about as much luck as me with this treasure holy i nearly shot your head off sam ah you're okay yeah nothing i can't walk away from hey it's good to see you're alive little brother come on we got a treasure to find hold up man i mean what are we doing what am i mean our supplies are at the bottom of the indian ocean okay so we go steal some from nadine's army yeah and there's that we're going up against an army we've been holding our own so far while being marooned in the middle of nowhere we were trying to get here remember we had an escape plan just hear me out crazy suggestion let's go down there and at least secure one of rafe's boats the boats can wait you wanna know what we're doing here we are buying my life back okay and we're gonna do that by stepping into that jungle and finding the battalion have you even seen any signs of a massive pirate colony because i sure the hell happened you're a little late to start developing doubts don't you think can we at least acknowledge the chance that maybe avery's idea for secret pirate utopia didn't pan out and maybe we're just swept up in this fantasy when instead we should be looking for a real way to save you i'm gonna scour this island inch by inch if i have to until i find that treasure now if you're confused about what you're doing here then you can go home nathan wait wait wait i can go home are you kidding me do you have any idea what i put on the line to get you here about what i put on the line okay the last 15 years of mine this is nothing to do with that it has everything to do with that what holy crap [Music] you still want to go home let's just see what else we can find [Music] thank you it's this way i'll be damned off to a good start yeah let's just hope the rest of it isn't buried in other centuries of dirt and rocks sam up here what's coming well no one's home this place has seen better days huh yeah the roof could use some work [Music] sam this way all right ah yeah that's not happening hey nathan i think there's a way through here this way a good workout look at this place this is no straw hut yep some honest-to-god masonry in here where'd those masons come from i mean your average ship might have some good carpenters among them and cooper's not masons man i wouldn't give for a camera we have one shut your mouth seriously yeah yeah it's on the boat with the rest of our stuff oh thanks come on ah feels good to stretch out again yeah you said there's a crate i got an idea here we go heads up all right we're in business you're gonna want to see this wow what do you see no houses wide street clearly a commercial district of some kind yes thank you for that nathan come on what do you see you just want to hear me say it don't you really want to hear you say it all right libertalia libertalia the long-lost legendary pirate utopia discovered after 300 years by one samuel drake and and his younger slightly less charming brother who happened to be tagging along for the right you know i always knew you'd make something of yourself one day yeah just so you know it's not my first lost city you should just enjoy the moment so where you want to start how about that building right over there oh you mean the one with the massive guard tower yeah i say we go see what it was guarding works for me this is i mean i'm speechless holy god damn nathan that's your idea of speechless god how long do you think it took them to build this place not a bad view hey cheers what were they doing here what we call this yeah i mean you throw your lot in with these infamous outlaws and then what you know take a load off yeah find some refuge enjoy a little grog there's far worse fates i guess except you have to see avery's statue every day hey you uh you ever wonder like with different choices how we might end it up i mean like you taking your magic show on the road you know that was a that was an option i was good it's not a viable option you know what you're just jealous you always were no but i mean what would our lives have been like if we hadn't started by chasing these people who've been dead for hundreds of years you think it would resemble more of a normal life normal we've got everybody gathered around the table for thanksgiving exchanging all the baby photos something like that no no thank you not for me i like the hand we've been telling yeah heard that before come on we're fortunate man this is fortunate yeah i mean of course i've been locked up for the last 15 years so it's all relative i suppose all right i'll give you that this is much better than prison well my mugs run dry yeah about to say service here is lousy hey sam check it out it's like a pirate code of conduct hmm the whole point of this place was not having roles well even pirate ships had their own rules captain avery was wondering when you turn up what's this symbol i saw a few of them when i was coming to find you who's marking these places is that another sigil no not that i know of maybe invaders i mean i'm sure these guys had plenty of enemies out there that's a good point yes even a pirate utopia needs a place to lock up riffraff can you imagine who pirates well i guess every group has its hey nathan check it out uh i would totally get a picture of myself in this thing if we had a camera that is well hey i can sketch in my journal really yeah uh [Music] this way follow me hey sam come here this looks promising right behind you i guess we're not going back that way it's like a hideout of some kind what would they be hiding out from themselves look at this looks like the layout of the commercial district and boom there's our treasury right there see there's the tower what were these guys up to [Music] that's our way out of here i see some light down below holy hey uh i found more of the colony [Music] i don't think they've seen us yet let's keep it that way all right keep your head down just about tell you the same thing yeah yeah hello over there nothing brew we're clear what is it uh oh crap we're shoreliners looks like rick's boy was right flicker last time we had a proper payday oh [Music] no no you don't nice work [Music] you see any more are we clear i think we're clear you all right yeah just a little winded this whole place is falling apart you see an old building over the edge hey you ever done anything like this ah i've been throwing a couple of governments looted villages but this this is something else hang on cool okay stay sharp let's keep this jaw nice and tidy for the boss lady bad guy over there uh uh no wait [Music] help me out here stick your head out that's it for now gotta keep moving over here come on ready ready okay all right thanks okay oh crap watch that first step it's a doozy yeah we'll make do keep heading up how you doing back there it's a hell of a view uh trust me follow my lead okay so don't do all of that then yeah something like that we're definitely in the high rent district now not residential though i think some kind of administration building probably maybe libertalia had a zoning committee yeah maybe they paid tax who knows nothing up here holy crap well i see our missing colonists some of them anyway jesus cannons improvised barricades what the hell happened here [Music] it's a rhetorical question real question is who's fighting who why man this is impressive uh to say the least here we go [Music] give me a hand yeah it's empty of course it is anything rafe no nothing's been touched in here for hundreds of years right well search for clues yeah search for clues empty thief huh fancy clothes got a uniform you were guard here weren't you nice job what the hell happened to you good question what if maybe there's no treasure left you know they spin it all on marble floors so the colonists find out their money's gone and they get pissed and maybe so another thief what happened here where the hell'd it all go found something hey sam you find anything i'm amazed this letter's still intact nathan over here hey nathan check it out what do you got the battalion money says avery sigil on it must have melted down the gold minted his own currency so based on that all the manifests on the shelves the treasure was here yeah is the bigger question where is it now okay so we know that there was fighting outside yeah dan inside do you think the colonists stole it no i think they were trying to reclaim what was theirs look there's avery two founders of libertalia all marked with the word thief not murderer not tyrant thief so by the time the colonists busted in here treasure was already gone yeah because these guys had already taken it for themselves pirates will be pirates right uh pirates will be pirates huh i know where they moved it what where that's a map yeah right there that's our treasury it's a map of libertalia all right so follow it to the other side of the island hey look right there new devon avery was from devon england he sure was man those are some seriously large mansions each of them has its own sigil too because that's where they lived you say we uh climb that watchtower huh get our bearings new devon here we come now how do we get up there okay ready okay that's step one step two raise the chandelier good idea just take the compliment excuse me oh sorry content baldrige what you're stepping on baldrige no so i am all right up we go definitely shocked the stairs are intact hey hey hey don't jinx us oops i spoke too soon like i said nathan you seen this tower sure am ugh sam yeah all right just making sure you haven't plummeted to your death just about there sure is excited come on ready ready okay all right i found something stand back here you go come on oh quite the crow's nest huh there it is just on the other side of the river no how do you say we go rob from the rich huh hey is there a path down there uh of sorts come on so how long do you figure it'll take us to get the new devin ah couple hours depends on what or who we bump into along the way oh jesus you all right shut up down here [Applause] where are you i'm down here come on jesus that was close something tells me they've had enough of us really what gives you that idea down here quick don't wait just go nathan nathan get up brother we gotta go we gotta go ah great [Applause] thanks this is nuts don't stop okay [Music] ah all right let's try this again okay mango mango what are you on about oh it's my safe word are you always this clever ah i have my moments yes you and your brother have proven yourselves the more capable treasure hunters on the island shame we're not on the same side there's still time trust a drake i'm not falling for that again just let's [Music] okay that was a bit rougher than expected i'll just uh see myself out after everything you think i'm just going to let you walk away that'd be the wise thing to do oh come on nadine really we know you're a badass and all but there's two of us i don't think my men are on their way here right now all i have to do is buy some time that's if i don't finish him myself god damn it go i'm tired of silence tired of your brother and i'm tired of you i know you don't care [Music] we just talk about this hold on hang in there son i'm coming what was that just a game changer ah you're fast but you're not that fast hey forget about her come on we got to get out of here before they everybody just just calm down okay well this is interesting nate samuel put your guns down all of you no reef this guy's on edge oh don't worry about him nadine these guys don't kill anyone in cold blood it's just not their style you wanted to bet her life on that go ahead then shoot her sam i die you both died so be it not another step you mean like this sam put the gun down i warned you do it hold your fire don't shoot put it down it's done okay it's done don't worry nadine it's not their style i say i didn't think he had it in him samuel you okay i guess you knew this moment was coming huh hey come on man you already got us take it easy come on now your business man let's just let's work out a deal oh i do oh yeah love to hear what you have in mind oh you can go ahead i'm listening i just wait you want to find avery's treasure we'll help you find it in exchange i let you live yeah that and a small cut the gauchos on this guy just enough to get him his freedom okay his freedom nathan yeah he did hard time our time and the guy who broke him out hector alcazar he owes him a lot of money whoa what the hell are you talking about nate hector alcazar died in a shootout in argentina like six months ago i'm the one that got samuel on oh [Music] wow what did he tell you sam what kind of story did you cook up alcazar really you lied you lied to your baby brother we're wasting time just a second thing is nate i never stopped looking for avery's treasure i just kept running into these dead ends and then i hear that our dear old samuel drake an authority on avery is alive and somewhat well there was no breakout i bribed the prison wharton and your brother he just waltzed right out the front gate he spent the last two years tracking down a second saint dismiss cross you know what he did it all with me oh okay that's  oh sam care to refute nate oh sam jesus no no listen avery's treasure was out it was always ours i left my life for you [Laughter] hey look look nate if it's any consolation he duped me too he pulled the houdini on me he brought you and that old man back into the mix and i cannot lie sam that really pissed me off but all behind us now you don't deserve it you do last i checked we're all a bunch of thieves digging around where we shouldn't raise what one way or another end it or i will well you heard the lady hey you miss one clue and you can kiss that treasure goodbye said it yourself keep running into dead ends why don't you face it ray if you need us no you're right you're half right i just need sam right now you're making a mistake [Music] oh my god nate hey nate [Music] ah there it is the hell lives here anyway no idea but this is definitely the address been scoping the place out for the past few days no one's home and here we are wow this place is humongous where do we even start yeah we start by finding a way in and then we can take the grand tour you think this place has an alarm let's try and find a way and that doesn't involve breaking a window i'm pretty sure the front door will be locked all right let's look around back huh okay give me your hand all right there you go i can't jump that high follow me come on nathan spooky well here i brought a spray so are we looking for any particular room uh just keep an eye

worked for me as i'm sure you've noticed i'm a collector of sorts that's sort of an understatement so mom was like your translator your mother was the most brilliant historian i have ever met we could have accomplished so much together but then her illness i'm sorry no sorry happened a long time ago of all her discoveries this would have been her crowning achievement sick purvis greatness from small beginnings so francis drake's motto yeah latin and historical figures those were our dinner conversations we were uh a weird family did she ever tell you her theories regarding sir francis drake and his heirs uh sir francis drake didn't have any ears yeah that's what history tells us but your mother and i believed otherwise learning that old pirate secrets is just one more adventure i have to let go i guess there's a lot i have to let go forgive me ramblings of an old woman it is as much yours as it is mine who knows perhaps one day you'll be able to finish what she started [Music] yeah sure uh we're off the hook right i'll handle the police you found your way in i trust you can see yourself out yeah oh here thank you sorry about the mess all right come on nathan let's go are you

lady she she was um sick i mean it's okay to feel bad but there was nothing we could do about it so what are we gonna do now i can't go back to the orphanage you can't go back to your job then we don't oh sure no i'm serious we get as far away from this place as we possibly can yeah and how long until the cops find us well i think they'll be looking for nathan and samuel morgan yeah that's us what if it wasn't nathan back at that mansion you knew just as much about that stuff as that poor old lady here i always felt that we were destined for something great but until tonight i didn't know what that meant but this unfinished work this is our chance to restart our lives with brand new identities what are you talking about i know some guys pretty good at forging papers too now as for our new name mom believed that sir francis drake had ass who's to say he didn't you're serious aren't you nathan we were meant for this and i promise you and me together we're gonna go far so what do you say nathan drake and everything changed after that you know we became explorers adventurers mostly thieves out okay just hold still now for a while it felt like you know if we weren't taking turns going to jail it was because we were in jail together and after i lost him i after i thought i lost him you didn't want to bring him back up again something like that that's it now you know everything with you i doubt that that's everything but it's a lot i'd love to know what you're thinking i'm thinking that you're lucky that i found you when i did i'm glad you didn't lose a limb or anything it would have been a royal pain getting you out of here how did you uh find me anyway oh you know easy just follow the sound of gunfire no i mean how did you get here oh of course come in sully hey darling how's he doing oh you know he's banged up but he's alive par for the course now we just need to rescue the other drake what do you mean i'll let nate tell you hey pal glad you could join us
