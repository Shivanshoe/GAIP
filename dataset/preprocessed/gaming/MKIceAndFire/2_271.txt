that's just [ __ ] great i don't mean you any harm i swear no [ __ ] i'm the one holding the gun looking for trouble says the american with a gun your friend said the enemy of my enemy is my friend that is not always true but if we both want to live we must fight as one a sword and the shield they're too worthy for my luck and i'm in if i think for one second you're trying to cross me best believe me follow any second you're dead that looks like our best way through one of us holds up the gate the other can slip through [Music] go [Music] are you okay what do you think it's locked i got to find another way around [Music] i think there's a way through i just need to clear it from my side do it quick those things could be anywhere you got any idea what we're dealing with they're vampires not possible my father once told me if something looks like [ __ ] and smells like [ __ ] you don't have to taste it to know that it's [ __ ] believe me they're vampires we must work together to defeat them yeah it's beginning to look like that hmm thanks what's the first thing you're gonna do when we get out of here hold my son how about you what'll you do i'll probably just go for a drink yes [Music] 9 p.m something unholy has happened as i sat with my wife i noticed something in her hand lady bradshaw's brooch she must have pulled it from her shirt when she grabbed at her turning it over i noticed that it looked like one of the creatures we'd exhumed from the cocoons were these the demons mary had spoken about had bradshaw known all along what we'd find down here then mary's corpse moved it was not my wife it was something inhuman it played to me and only the bars of the cell spared me from its fury [Music] you seem like you got your head screwed on so i gotta ask what the hell made you shine up with saddam for us we had no choice what is the meaning of those markings on your hand it's to honor the dead it's the reason i fight it's as good a reason as any it's a damn good reason the only reason i have no grievance with you maybe you need to switch on the nude listen there was a man once who built his house on the banks of a river when the floods came his wall washed away when the droughts came the water dried up and the man was thirsty all day the insects bit this man's flesh yet each night he says to his wife we have all the fish we can eat your people chose this war jason i think you need to give your mouth some rest [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] i sure would get the [ __ ] out of here looks to me like a medical bee

do you want to hear a joke nope first of january 1947 1am the saboteur has struck again sealing us in here we are hopelessly trapped with those things all around us they shriek from the darkness crow has set up his machine gun pointed towards the catacombs mary was right we cannot fight that which does not live there is only one option now bring the whole damn temple down on them even it means bringing it down on our own heads they cannot be allowed out of here [Applause] so it's covenants whatever's down there those explorers got there first hold up will ya what are you doing you think
