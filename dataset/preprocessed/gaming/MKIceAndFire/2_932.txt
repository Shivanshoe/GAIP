sabine here inspector lau i'm curious how you think you can bring mary kelly to justice now with no backing even before albion took over policing you couldn't lock her up and she goes on treating humans like cattle i had to work within the system yes it was corrupt i knew it i just didn't know how bad it was i thought a strong enough case couldn't be buried you weren't thinking straight the police force is rotten from top to bottom it didn't work last time so why would now be any different because i'm taking it to a contact in the attorney general's office an honest solicitor with a hard-on for organized crime specifically for mary kelly look our methods may differ but i want to help those people as much as you do all right but however this goes down there's no way we're letting mary slip the net again that's not how dedsec does things let's get to sandstone security here is state of the art quite impenetrable unless of course you flew a drone through the window one of mary's mouth breathers left open i'm in the recording device is in a security room getting there should be a simple matter of navigating the vents what the she's using these people as house servants against their will horrible in itself but a million times worse knowing they end up as unwilling organ donors [Applause] do you know that please i need help [Laughter] [ __ ] idiot do you piss everyone off the way you're pissing me off wanker that's it let's see what kind of recording we've got on her just look at this place this is what comes of old crooked money the kelly family has been profiting from people's misery for a long time she's got this [ __ ] all over the manor so you've been in there before is that how you ended up in the basement of the southern incinerator we needed something incriminating so we decided someone had to get in here and plant a bug i wasn't going to assign someone else to do that you saw how mary uses the people she grabs out of the epc and the staff's uniform's not hard to mimic so i went in what i didn't know was that she had intel on our investigation my team i thought going off book would stop the leaks but she still knew we were coming she tortured me for the names of my team tried to break me but cops don't give up cops turned out she already knew the whole unit and put hits out on them the woman is a mind [ __ ] oh wow still you didn't get implanted with a microchip she knew better than to even try and make you her slave that's how i ended up on that butcher's table so many reasons to want to rid the world of her but it wouldn't be enough to just put one in her brain my mates died trying to bring her to justice i have to honor that and then oh yeah look at this state of you what you've done to yourself after everything i've done for you you made me a slave all of us please let me go take this thing out back to your old life back to nothing back to you 2.5 screaming blighters in your dead-end job and sucking off the doll you don't want that love this microchip is scary i know but i got to keep tracks on my merchandise tonight and this kitchen knife that won't do it love cutting yourself affects my bottom line i can't believe like this anymore no you are right there it's all i sweetheart because i have another use for you oh paying attention all we're good be sure and spread the word you know where this one goes get these two and all the others over to their venue and ready for the sale right away ma'am also the foreign investors have already landed and the drones are programmed ready to deliver the invitations and the coordinates to all the guests um is that initiative i'm smelling peter initiative can be a dangerous thing can be misinterpreted [ __ ] psych this is insane how did mary get her hands on this kind of tech it takes a sick mind to come up with killer microchips perhaps a disease mind but definitely an ingenious one perfect psych profile for a group like zero day wouldn't you say her affiliations aren't my priority badly she's keeping these people enslaved and it sounds as if she's selling them this is huge [ __ ] that microchip is what keeps them in line disobey and zap you're dead but mary still profits i don't know what's worse deadseq we'll have to crash that slave auction get all the information we can out of there the location will be on the invitations she hasn't sent out the invitation yet but when she does badly monitor the drone networks give us a heads up when mary sends out her fleet until then i reckon we're in a holding pattern i'll get in touch if i hear about anything else that might interest you cheers dedsec [Music] since we're waiting for our cordial invitation to marry kelly's tasteless theme party we can finally get back to what really matters solving the mystery of zero day who are they and why do they frame dedsec for the bombings so what do we have bags glad you asked today the great ai detective has two leads for his dog's body politic obviously albion needs looking into but i also have a more unusual threat for you to pull on there's a new hacktivist group on the dark web scene called the 404 but instead of being in it for the lulls this lot seems to be in it for the brutal reshaping of society by any means necessary sound like anyone you know hmm got a choice to make then i've marked both on your optic [Music] there's a potential recruit you may want to check out pushing your location oh please just leave me alone huh no i didn't see shite you don't want me hey come on you're charizard i'm not gonna hurt you i want to help you're not with albion oh thank christ hold up just calm down and tell me what's wrong we can help i was out doing some street art and i accidentally witnessed some albion pmcs doing their dirty work they had a group of protesters tied up in a vacant building and they were just beating them senseless oh [ __ ] there were cameras everywhere no way my face wasn't recorded if albion decides they want to poke around that footage i'm as good as dead you'd need to get all the evidence before they do i'd literally owe you my life got it leave it to us i've got the location from a gps and there's a load of ctos surveillance around any number of cameras might have seen them let's go see what's up [Music] [Music] here's where our friend witnessed the albion crime the security footage should still be on site brilliant let's do this search units disengage this search is pointless did you see that what was that that was strange i've had enough of this wait what was that cleaned them up [Music] ross disturbance detected beginning located the ctos hub add that to the rest investigating this dude stop uploading the cctv footage can you see our target yeah there she is clearly identifiable too if albion saw this footage you'd be pretty [ __ ] [ __ ] however albion's crime was also clearly recorded which means we can turn this footage back around on them we just have to wipe the backup file from the central ctos servers to protect the witness's identity send me those coordinates awaiting an active protest report huh we'll see hmm oh oh ugh the chase is on they're gonna dale me for a while being mandated timeout you're up i got you bags let's go finish up what they started your somewhat reckless teammate has got themselves thrown in the old clink i'm afraid it's difficult to resist impression from behind bars it will be a while before they're available front tip however why not recruit a barrister to the team i mean no one exactly likes a barrister but they do have their function they should be able to shorten the jail time of imprisoned operatives there's quite a few albion goons in the server room either the perpetrators beat us here or you've just stumbled on a fascist book club oh my days we're probably not the only ones after this evidence you'll have to beat them to it there's the terminal we can do the intrusion there this will trigger a heavy security response [Music] you
