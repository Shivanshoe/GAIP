[Music] after months away john marston has returned to his loved ones while trying to rebuild his ranch and win back the trust of his family marston awaits whatever life will throw at him as he drives home one evening from an errand he ponders whether a man can ever escape his past he is a man who is ready for anything almost anything [Laughter] oh damn mother oh i'm sorry i meant to say damn this awful son i've raised with his half pollutant ways and his shame that his mother swears like a sailor and sews like a blind man is that better you're lordship much better mother dearest oh good i'm so glad my darling when you finished your university education and are far too good to even acknowledge my existence when we pass on the street and you gently kick me aside and beg an old crow out of the way with your highly polished boot well think of me conley at least will you mess up i'll try to mother i think that woman i just kicked that used to be my dear old potty mouth mom maybe i should bother to kick her harder dear boy oh i am so proud of you get off now father's here maybe he can beat some sense into you something funny's going on out there damn dog's going crazy and wolves howling and birds flying well it's just the storm john maybe uncle make it back yet i thought he was with you off drinking in the fields i mean working as you call it now uh he went into town a few hours ago after we busted that hammer working out in the meadow well he's probably holed up in some place of ill repute waiting for the passing of the storm i hope so well that old man could take care of himself i know just a funny feeling i got you going psychic ball either that or i hate something funny knowing your mother's cooking seems more the likely well talking about food who's ready for some poisoning me my darling i am starving what you reading just some book about monsters tell me about it it's kind of dumb that should suit me just fine well it's all about in ancient times how aztec warriors worship the sun but during full moons some of them worship the moon instead and upset the equilibrium of thanks so anyway what it involves is there's this one guy and he goes out [Music] that leaves him all alone so anyways since there ain't no cure the brave man has to kill everybody which is absolutely disgusting and completely unbelievable it's getting late guess we're not going to see uncle till morning come on then abigail jack get yourself to bed boy try to get some sleep ain't you worried about uncle sure but he'll have to wait till morning just like any other man

life i've seen this land when it was just wilderness and scrub i've seen missionaries nail their crosses by shaming and burn into just the cinders of their misguided devotion i've seen slaves get set free and returned to a bondage even more confusing than the one they left behind i've seen diseases wipe out entire communities in a weekend i've seen bad men make their own valhalla out in the [Music] with harems of maidens and the hunting of men as a sport i've seen men struggle with principles and morals and the very meaning of existence i've killed all that can be killed [Music] but i've never in all my natural born days seen anything quite like this nor me sir now if we could only get something that would attract these blighters we could kill them faster and and maybe return this land to its uh natural state some kind of bait exactly i think i might know how and more dynamite i'm running pretty low let me see what i can do thank you john and take care [Applause] so hello to you mr ricketts hello sir how have you been as you imagine good did you get the dynamite yes and the bait let's see [Music] wonderful here let's work with that for a second ah this uh calls for a soft touch not the brutish hands of a man of war but the delicate touch of an artist some uh use oils some a chisel and a block of marble for me sir it uh was always either high explosives or the trigger of a fine iron but it's much the same sometimes your humility overwhelms me ricky you and me both mr marston now if you just seen me when i was a young man if you'd have seen me when i was so fast you couldn't see me well then you'd know this is humility the truth is well the truth is long dead now we got only memories memories and a great swath of demonic mutants of course have you heard anything i heard a man in chicago was writing a biography of me and can you believe it an artist in pittsburgh painted my portrait i mean the demonic hordes not your own unending glory no that nothing too interesting someone said that there's some really big problems near escalara but i can't concern myself too much with that this is my home now this and this up here take care of yourself i will i don't think getting savaged by some brainless corpse would do too much justice to your myth yeah i think you're teasing me mr marston but i thank you and i appreciate your concern nonetheless [Applause] come on oh [Applause] uh [Music] you okay sister well i'm a life senior although come to think of it i just committed a moral sin claim self-defense always works for me yes well i fear my judges may be a little more stringent than yours but i appreciate the advice unfortunately many of my nuns are not so resourceful as you or i their innocence will kill them which is truly a terrifying reality i would not know i think maybe you would but let us leave the psychotherapy and focus on more pressing matters they are locked in the church while hordes of of of these half-witted demons are are trying to get to them it'd be my pleasure you're a true samaritan sir you know they say the devil has all the best tunes it may be so but it seems he also has the most half-witted friends so you know bill williamson then excuse me just a little joke i'll do as best i can to save the nuns on run [Music] [Music] god [Music] [Music] let's get back foreign don't say i never forgive you [Applause] thank you we hate your friends oh uh oh uh sister i've done as you asked bless you but it's not sister it's mother superior mother superior calderon our bishop was a stickler for regulations until he got sick last week and ate half of the cathedral choir boys i'm sorry i only mention it because my girls are laughing at you calling me sister what do you think is causing all this hmm [Music] many faiths have lived and died here many evil spirits have flourished i have no idea what is afflicting the people here but i know it is a sickness of the soul something supernatural maybe certainly nothing rational perhaps if you were to get me a live one of these creatures we could try a couple of experiments certainly get me a new one one who was recently human i want to work with a subject who has only recently turned i'll see what i can find for you gracias let's go [Music] you're mine now i pity the man then again i probably ate him oh [Applause] stay there [Music] come on [Music] brother superior i think i have a test case for you senor marston you're a true pilgrim that i ain't now let's see well it certainly isn't the flu their eyes are so devoid of love of anything oh lively one i see here what is that holy one i think we may have something it seems to be working maybe [Music] maybe not but it seems as if you were nearly saved spiritual infections are confusing things in your marcin none of us can hope to understand them properly but he came back for a minute i bless the water but perhaps my faith is not that strong i have to do more thinking but i need time every day more of my people fall as the dead rise in sepulchre then perhaps it's time i put them to rest take the holy water maybe it will be a calming bomb for the restless departed thank you no thank you you are a blessing in an unusual form i must be losing my mind here up come on uh uh [Applause] um um i'm scared of you oh right now one day uh uh [Applause] so you're slick friends man [Music] loves you [Music] um [Music] so go come on you do not appear to be in a great hurry to save you man how wonderful to see you alive i think i've cleared some pulchro you're a brave servant of righteousness i've been called many things in my time but never that who is that girl by the way she i don't know she said she was in a holy order in escalera i'm sure i keep seeing her or someone like her maybe but it is a common enough look seemed like a nice girl she told me something interesting what's that she blamed this terrible curse on our soon-to-be president abraham reyes perhaps you have heard of him heard of him i know him well i hope that vain ambitious and repugnant parasite is no friend of yours not exactly i didn't think he was that bad and who am i to judge forgive me i have just heard many unpleasant stories and met too many pregnant and abandoned girls of course but what has he done she claimed he had angered an ancient goddess disturbed a crypt and a temple in her honor i mean as i say it it sounds like heresy like the idiotic delusions of a cursed people but in a land such as this i have learned to be less dogmatic than maybe i have been instructed i am sure it is just folly perhaps well maybe it's time i go pay el president to visit anyway i shall pray for you someone certainly needs to good-bye mother superior con dios mejor thank you [Music] senora dundee dante is abraham reyes rice [Applause] stop that now abraham come on stop that do you see what your greed has done [Music] [Music] he always did have away with the ladies it's okay he's dead thank you senor you'll be okay i'm glad you think so but i fear i won't none of us will we are all doomed because of him him he wasn't a great guy but i'm afraid you're giving him a little too much credit my dear haven't i seen you before no he he he caused this with his greed and his lust for power he heard an ancient myth and tested it it caused all of these terrible things his vanity overwhelmed us all what the hell are you talking about where have i seen you me oh i have a comment in my face i'm from here he disturbed the royal burial grounds that lie underneath the town he heard there was a mask hid in there that would make him invincible [Music] i've heard this blamed on mexicans jewish people freed slaves the federal government immigrants the bad weather now this what's wrong with people it's true look in that chest he has a sacred mask that is where this plague came from him and his awful lust for power where did you say the crypt was there's a bullfighting ring behind the via well i guess it's worth a shot return the mask to the altar and end all these wait here it's too dangerous you need me i know what needs to be done [Applause] i sure hope you're right the animals have also suffered the threat that connects us all has been desecrated i always told my son never go into dark places with strangers the presidential palace should never have been built above a sacred place harmony is fragile the greatest so uh [Music] why aren't they attacking you you really are a strange girl no wonder they don't seem to you like act now look inside yourself oh [Music] uh [Applause] wow the older the corpse the more bilious their age [Applause] some of them worship the moon and the brave man here it comes do i look like your lunch let's find some rest you got a lot to answer for uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that worked [Music] the past does not like being awakened oh [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] christ that was close good thing
