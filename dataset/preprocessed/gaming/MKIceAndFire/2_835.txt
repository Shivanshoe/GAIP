let's win the bunker on our own foreign uh me no metal detectors for us we're going around foreign is foreign take us down hmm it's [ __ ] like that we gotta watch out for gear up they won't be happy to see us down here wait for my word cover me keep moving towards the mall uh cover my ass uh thank you an event good let's get to the vault we're almost to the vault there's the vault open the door i've got your back you grab the intake watch don't have much time before they get through there's the list belt copy it to a disk i've got contact running out of time pal we're cutting through you're almost through the door get ready here they come oh almost done coffee follow me this way i don't like this we're sitting ducks here keep moving i need to find a way out so this might be a way out you

fight our way out we're gonna need some heavier gear i know just the place my friend heavy weapons let's move what's up let's get up top lazar meet us in the southwest courtyard for five minutes felikov is hitting a ride plenty of room in the backseat once we get off the elevator just keep moving towards the courtyard get the charge ready though let's go don't stop so oh foreign [ __ ] got the list and we're heading back be ready to move it's about time i've been waiting for your call they caused a hell of a mess in moscow was it worth it adler managed to get the list of sleeper agent names despite himself he's got balls i'll give him that bell did well seemingly but i think that team is getting too comfortable they're acting like they know who they're dealing with perhaps turns out one of those sleeper agents is tied to operation greenlike theodore hastings he's a nuclear engineer based out of salt lake city and you believe hastings is the one he'll activate exactly total surveillance is already underway it's only a matter of time before he leads us straight to perseus this is it the recent movements of theodore hastings has led us here cuba right in our backyard a vacant government facility in the cuban countryside has become a hub of activity for perseus and the likely location of the stolen nuke no doubt castro allowed it 20 bucks to anyone who can bring him down before me who castro or perseus whoever we are not gonna let him move this nuke inside the states it's time to take down perseus once and for all team wrap up any unfinished business once we strike there's no turning back woods don't get any bright ideas over there yeah you've got my sure [ __ ] guaranteed you available you ready you look ready hastings left salt lake city we tracked his movements all the way to cuba we have to assume percy is moving nuke there langley believes castro could help perseus smuggle it into the u.s in exchange for a peek at the hardware of course that isn't going to happen what's the plan the last read we have on hastings came from 30 miles south of havana we suspect perseus is using an abandoned compound there to hold the nuke they're working under the radar so expect moderate security i say we smash and grab parachute in grab the nuke skyhook and what if the nuke isn't there it's there the only reason perseus needs hastings in cuba is to prepare it for arming and detonation there you have it hudson old range rxville while we're in route if everyone's ready let's move out adler's late no love we're early adler should be checking in right about we're in position copy that we're moving to flank all and loud find teams grab the new get the hell out light up this joint about [ __ ] time go go do the honor spell let's go oh oh smoke take out those empty oh oh they love a reward they've got close circuit cameras we could use them to locate the nuclear bomb sharp as ever the is incoming grenade i'm looking i'm moving rpg on the balcony oh jesus mason you missed one behind the counter thanks park keep looking there hold it adler we have eyes on the nucleus device someone's killing the scientists second floor room 27b second floor center room upstairs let's move crude but effective can't keep your eyes off me huh part bell use the seafool we're moving to the second floor move ahead we'll catch up ah please they're shooting at us stay away we must be getting i'm moving canvas the room hastings stop talking perseus was here he shot us escaped perseus would never leave his precious nuke behind he forced us to reverse engineer the detonation codes give him full access to green light what are you telling me perseus can detonate multiple nukes in europe i'm so sorry hastings stay with us how many green light devices can perseus detonate with those codes he can detonate all of them he'll wipe out half of europe and blame it all on the usa we need to find that son of a [ __ ] perseus time to go no contact chopper coming in low it's gotta be perseus head to the in this roof incoming grenade let's go in two minutes we're think i'm ready for that drink now don't tease me park but we'll have none of that

of people are gonna die and the united states will take to blame you need to find out where he's planning to broadcast the activation signal are we going to pull that out of our ass bell knows where it is no this goddamn science project was a failure don't count adler out yet the man has a deep bag of tricks you
