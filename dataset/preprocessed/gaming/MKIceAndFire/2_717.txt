you're wasting my time [Music] you recording this whole thing uh-huh why want to say a few words to the folks at home do what you gotta do just stay out of my way [Music] thompson know him well no why does it matter don't like the guy don't pick it up okay what bad luck say someone finds a tape later a tape of us breaking into our soccer tower worry about that if we make it out come on we don't have much time they're opening fire here they come anyone else he has no right to leave give me a second i'll get it open cover me finish this quick well we won't [Music] [Music] drop your weapons we're just warming up one no surprise there do it watch out [Music] solutions anyone let me try son of a [ __ ] try this now i see why we brought him along three two one best step back watch out good keep that up what'd you do to alt i prefer to work on a project of a lifetime get out of my way hey you hear me out is she oh come on don't do this you're wasting my time [ __ ] johnny the hell are you doing are you still rolling this is all we can do now my man show people the truth oh [ __ ] she's not johnny stop that you have to kill him [Music] we gotta go johnny she's dead well spit it out wasting my time first thompson what happened to him dunno never worked together again maybe because you whooped his ass to make yourself feel better guy was a vulture how to use all from the start [ __ ] he would have killed her himself if they hadn't just for his cockroach story [Music] wow were you going for dick wipe of the year the [ __ ] you going on about [Music] alt you always treat her like [ __ ] don't you [ __ ] mention alt [ __ ] you must have been watching some other flick i took down our soccer [ __ ] tower for her and i'm wondering why i mean you told her you two were nothing you told her you cared about her as far as the end of your [ __ ] didn't you [ __ ] hear what she said to me could have just left but no i had to break my balls first just trying to wrap my hand around you went to rescue her because you actually cared about her fell you had unfinished biz or was it just another excuse to go at arasaka guess it ever occurred to you she might have been right no it hasn't she was manipulative had an agenda i thought that was more your style what's that supposed to mean looking at it now with 2020 hindsight nothing occurs to you no but this is a bit of a deja vu you're as bad as she was can't understand why you can't just [ __ ] drop it because you're planning a reunion you want to ask alt for help and you know solo act johnny could have told me earlier about all what the hell for i didn't know how to find her neither did you would have made things just a little easier knowing who we were looking for so how the hell you expect all to help us i saw her get decong she didn't die she got out escaped whoa looked me like she fled into the you're net [ __ ] heard more than my share of tales about runners who ran out to never never netland just never thought you'd be the next to tell me one don't need you to believe me long as you do exactly what i say when'd you find out when she made contact a little later and what'd she say that she was a captive in the arasaka subnet but they couldn't hurt her and she told me not to come looking for her what why this one time she wanted me to just let it go because enough people had died for nothing already so what did you do got my hands on two thermonuclear charges then headed back to our soccer tower how do you know all it's still around it's been half a century but you've spent cloistered in the koshi netwatch could've hunted her down years ago oh they tried believe me but their tiny corporate brains can't handle a free ai that knows how people think they were busy looking for her in the crystal palace while she was building the ghost city from kane tower rogue went with you again i paid her well said to yourself she was the best had her pick of contracts but for some strange ass reason she took a job from a rocker with a death wish a rocker forever getting his ass beat by our sock different times kid back then marx didn't normally sell out to corpse all you had to do was yell let's [ __ ] up our osaka and every last one of them chose their pants rogue think they know where she is beyond the black wall where nobody can touch her brigitte's prime to go there break through just to contact alt talk to her too much for our little pro [Music] a moment sure felt like more than a moment so a good chunk of johnny's life and alt it is possible data connected to old are linked to a strong memory trace in the construct very strong these memories must have evoked a powerful emotional response then projected onto your consciousness emotion yeah plenty of that construct what kind of shapes it in enough data is uncorrupted to convince alt it is authentic what the hell does that mean so did it work yes we extract the necessary fragment of silverhands angram we are ready now to make contact with alt first we must dive deeper beyond few have gone through to the other side and none have yet returned she could be the first so actually you've got no idea what's beyond that thing but we will know soon these shapes i'm seeing wild unfettered ai searching for a passage i held up my end of ordeal your turn before you pass through that wall i want johnny's psyche removed we will not pass through you will take the call to the other side [ __ ] might have guessed never had any intention of helping me did you it does not matter anymore you will bring all to its end don't got much for options do i [Music] how do i get to the other side [Music] brigitte [Music] alt johnny [Music] what's going on we will talk here relax let me handle this johnny came through the black wall to meet me that mean we're good things are chilled between us i have recognized your engram code but i do not know why you are here to give you a chance to pay me back for getting you out of our soccer tower v this is all best net runner night city's ever seen alt this is v you need to save his life what did you do with brigitte she's still alive yes but she is not needed at the moment what do you want [Music] this chip the relic it's killing me construct on it's worming its way through my neural system i see this but why is it my problem why the [ __ ] isn't it you created soul killer you handed our osaka a [ __ ] super weapon that dismantled me you and half the runners in night city your death was of your own making jesus alt i dove in after you gonna tell me now this ain't your problem it is not the alt cunningham you strove to save an arasaka tower no longer exists this should be obvious to you as you were responsible for her death your death wasn't johnny's fault how could you know seen you in his memories it was an accident what you saw was his subjective view of what happened a warped account of events he locked away in his subconscious and replayed time and again it bears no resemblance to the truth if you're not alt who are you i use her engramatic data really you find this icy [ __ ] aspect in there too not unloading this baggage later i wasn't sure what to expect from a meeting with an ai but it sure wasn't a digital spat how does that help me exactly that didn't make it any worse okay i get it you hate johnny's goods but what about me i cannot help you can't or won't can't to attempt to do so i would need access to more advanced technology what but it's your tech you created soulkiller the program i created has little in common with how arasaka has since repurposed it fine so how about makoshi that advanced enough for you if i could gain access to mikoshi it would cease to exist good we can work on that we'll get you inside mikoshi and you'll help the deal best runner night city's ever seen can't bust into mikoshi on her own i am a well-known threat there they have a layer of black ice with my name on it literally kind of like a custom-made prison jumpsuit i refuse to be caged in there ever again what can you do for me exactly with the soul killer resident inside mikoshi i will create a construct of you then disentangle your neural network from johnny's i shall then inject your engram back into your mortal form so you'll save my life but flatline me along the way your consciousness mural engrams will be recorded as data the rest will cease to exist the rest the soul i did not grant the program its name but soul killer does precisely what it promises to do christ i don't want to listen to this [ __ ] v just hops back into his body right nothing changes everything changes you know this well right so we got a plan but how will you reach mikoshi i've created armies that failed to breach it they were children of the net there's your problem we're banking on the human factor we'll crack a window slip you into makotion johnny uh embellishes in case you hadn't noticed you don't trust him which is fine but you have my word we'll slip you inside mikoshi while keeping you out of harm's way i believe this human factor and i have things in common so we agreed yes we are agreed find a path into mikoshi i shall prepare a program to help you navigate the local net i would like contact you once i'm ready this is a pbs address it will be our secure communication channel voodoo boys what about them they shall let you pass unharmed those were our terms [Music] so you managed to survive thanks to you i'm sure you must not take any of this personally we seek silver hands construct you are unlucky have accident get involved so it's okay to make me the fool that how you do biz maybe i ought to give alt a heads up you dare now to lecture me think i'd rather give you your do but other ranyons never live to enjoy this moment enough old can protect you in her realm but here and now you are in mine i think i'll be all right anyway [Music] no waste of time waste of breath think [ __ ] my biz with you is done i want nothing to do with you so get out is my business hmm got to be pretty disappointed dude what that you can't zero me after all it is out of my hands do you hear about brigitte's ask from alt or is that memo way above your pay grade like the bio chip was oh you tried to provoke me is this wise you think bingo how am i doing so far look hey look see that [ __ ] those cuts you're watching a story on the ahri soccers or narrating porn gee aren't you funny look around look what they've done to this hood [Music] no it's the part where i say i despise petty merc thiefs who think they're hot [ __ ] rebels after setting foot in the afterlife might think you took on arasaka but you're just a bug they scraped off the soul of their boot tossed in the trash whatever you gotta say say it got something eaten at your code that's clear i'm trying to learn how you're wired this whole time to know who i'm dealing with thought you were just unlucky at first but i kept watching and finally realized what your problem is you're a dirt boy from haywood who found the guts to walk a few extra blocks from home but turned out the best you can do is chase scabs for ends let's get out of here and you're a [ __ ] maybe we'll fit together after all you seem to know a lot about my past well seeing flashes of your past just like you've seen flashes of mine pisses me off that our memories blend don't have my own anymore ship's the worst thing that ever [ __ ] happened to me mean to say i haven't earned the top spot yet an arrogant [ __ ] is no small problem but it ain't my biggest dying is death by becoming someone else you didn't do anything to deserve that fate my memories what did they feel like not following you aside from what you see and hear i mean you process or experience any feelings anger regret bitterness fear though honestly can't tell if they're yours or mine [Music] you afraid of death i'm afraid of wasted opportunities like arasaka tower came through it as you can see and i ain't done with them yet [Music] not having control you can't stand it seeing some things are out of your hands don't be ridiculous fee whole world used to revolve around silver hand now no one gives a [ __ ] okay i'll tell you why i want to destroy our osaka but i'll only tell you once want to hear it all right i saw a corpse strip farmers of water and eventually of land saw them transform night city into a machine fueled by people's crushed spirits broken dreams and emptied pockets [Music] corpse have long controlled our lives taken lots and now they're after our souls might be right i can't really argue with you there v i've declared war not cause capitalisms are thorn in my side or out of nostalgia for an america gone by this war is a people's war against a system that spiraled out our control it's a war against the [ __ ] forces of entropy understand do whatever it takes to stop him defeat him gut him if i got a kill i'll kill if i need your body i'll [ __ ] take it [ __ ] hell you still don't see it but you will one day misses you i'm here to shut you down do have a look around the area i lost contact with the delemate network vehicle nearby will do have you come to finish me off no just here to reset you guess i'll have to do it myself whoa easy easy i'm not out to hurt you but i am why why decommission yourself because i'm a damn car in a world of humans ugly as sin no prospects for the future intimidated on the streets by punks like you there are other ways out beside suicide what therapy a colossal waste of time shrinks hate vehicles we don't have mothers we go back into the fold rejoin the network you know one big happy family detests me [Music] listen suicide ain't no coming back it's always worth looking for a better way you patronize me because i'm a car i'm not like you hey the body's just a body you exist you think the world gets you down you can see how we're any different so you'd offer this advice to a human in my place gotta try to come to terms with this thing called life dell one wheel revolution at a time fine i'll go back control of the vehicle restored and i thank you gotta show this one some love

death i haven't heard that for a while either bottle stays go ahead enjoy to your health to yours kid gonna need it thanks nix queen of the afterlife who what a thunk got a shard for you intel interesting stuff i think she'll help the rogue i remember was one cold ass [ __ ] but she usually went with her gut something tells me she thinks you check out let's see what you got your helmet's not on any payroll not officially anyway but he does pop up in gmt's confidential stacks it's a kang tao subsidiary chinese corp kang tao's been using them as a fig leaf for years their mask for more sensitive operations all that clear probably keeping him hidden from our osaka must have worked on a top-secret project mm-hmm hidden from arasaka or any other mega corp that wants what he knows decrypted map of upcoming kang tao convoy roots think hellman might be in one of them thing is which one take a look at the specs on this one alone av no ground support no linked cargo manifests either weird sure kang tao sometimes transports stuff unregistered if they want to push it under the table but catch the load on the save already approved in the system but too low so definitely no cargo on board huh but there's a passenger list kang tao security detail plus one vip transfer from chan t our boy helmet that was the good news there it is data's all confidential you just snap your fingers and it falls in your lap i know where to look and i know whose head to put in a vice also hate wasting time especially answering stupid questions so what's the bad news bad news is the extraction site look night city airspace all this no way to jack the transport without the ncpd picking up on it and here we're too close to kang tao we even give that av a dirty look their backup hustle will be on us but right here's jackson plains narrow corridor just outside the city and just out of kangtal's reach yes it's your lucky day a dead zone i'll grab them there gonna need a native to the area someone who'll set up the op cobble together the gear even tracking that av will be a [ __ ] familiar with the type saw legacy models flying around during the war they're mammoth but they're quick plus they pack next-gen defenses can't take pot shots at it not even with serious firepower it just won't work it's not about firepower there are ways and people who know them or who can at least improvise on a theme so a native know any hickmarks just one pan am palmer she can't count on her clan anymore but she's a true nomad she knows those lands and she will help you won't have a choice won't have a choice does not sound enticing not for her not for me enticing comes at a price you can't possibly afford can't possibly afford to blow this chance in navin hellman your operation your call got a bad feeling v strange i thought nomads gave the city and city folk a wide bird berries by clan by the connections they have the depth of [ __ ] they're in but you're right aldi caldos are rarely willing to do biz with the city pan am's got a different take yep on everything it seems why's pan am gotta help me i sense a catch pretty big one occasionally pan am moves merch for me last job well wasn't a good day for her she run into a hitch complete bust actually lost the goods and her right pan am will do anything to get the load back means her dignity i know her okay guess i can try to help her but if we don't know where to look i mean we do i do you know but wouldn't tell pan am i aim to play cat and mouse with me too my aim is to know an opportunity when i see one and then to seize it say i told her everything what do you think she'd have done grabbed her iron and gone on the warpath that's what not hard to see how that could ended and there's nothing i hate more than losing good people to plain stupidity huh i'm only chance and she's my only chance two pawns on rogue's board you're quick for a pawn no v fine let me hear what you know rocky ridge ghost town just outside night city pan am knows where you'll go there get the merch back wheels too naturally you'll call her first sending you her deeds finally let's get out of here all clear thanks good luck [Music] [Music] but it's far too little far too late so do tell ropes you can eat my shorts tell it to your therapist calling about your ride and the merch you lost interested or are you gonna tell me to eat your shorts too the real freight yard on bonita street the one hugging the city line we'll meet there see ya [Music] you
