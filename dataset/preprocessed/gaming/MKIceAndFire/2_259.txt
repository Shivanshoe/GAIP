of him is still with us i'm sure of it i hope you've got one hell of a speech plan peter that makes two of us why are you doing this will you not leave me be you gotta trust us drax we're trying to

with my family drags love it is time to eat look i get it man they seem really special they are the only thing that matters [Music] i hovat [Music] was the most fearless mate i have ever known she brought me peace even during times of war she was the best of us both despite her meager stature they both were [Music] my family is gone what sits before me i don't know but it's not real it ain't good it is a perversion fed by desperation without it i will have nothing i cannot be alone again you're not alone man [Music] we're here for you we've all lost someone drugs but it gets easier if you

a sound mind thanks to you all amends for my lapse in judgment hey you don't know a squat ain't none of us perfect it's kind of our thing [Music] how much do you remember great darkness grew with every lie that i swallowed longer i remained with my family the more certain i became that i could never leave you quill your child is in danger if her pain is half my own darkness may consume her entirely not if i can help it we to be smart about this there's a whole lot of converted between us and her whole lot of that black dwarf too and anyone want to tell me why harry hobo was able to suck it up more than why that thing looked like him because it is me [Music] time to go hey goldie braun want to get back here and explain that bombshell time is tight and you're understanding unimportant can i shoot him come on let me shoot him that first bite don't count we got muscles and the bug lady now hey we're in this together and smart money says it's gonna be a tough fight even in earnest you underestimate so anything you can tell us about what we're up against will be a plus imagine ambivalent omnipotence drifting in darkness uh speaking of dark such was my celestial solitude power without purpose until uncovered by raker his crew were convalescent plagued by a pox i was serendipitously suited to soothe a ship full of sick people just happens upon someone with limitless healing we were need and needed symptom and solace i worshiped the wonder of my ways and declared me divine i think we know where this is going i do not know where this is going this is the scary part as the flock of followers fawned the dark delight developed deep within me and in the shadows it spoke weak whelps pernicious priesting feeble fools fit for feasting hubris made hunger a cancerous craving called magus [Music] what did it want complete devotion i too heard this voice and could hear nothing else congratulation flagellation gorge with grief and consternation i told you this was the scary part it was pure putrefaction sown from the seed of my strength my soul stoned gone sour i resolved to rip it out rip it out how a mechanical marvel wrought by raker would sever the stone from my skull and excise the evil entangled within translation you let raker steal your powers whatever his wayward wander it was on that day my friend he swore to separate sanctity from sin that my healing could yet be harnessed without harm sure but who's harnessing it i'm with rocket raker knew exactly what he was doing that man's a master manipulator damn it now you've got me doing it i bear no blame for my fallen friend our errant experiment all but broke us both then how do you explain how your best butt got his hands on the stone and has now taken over the galaxy i cannot i think i can answer that after i rejected my promise i got pulled into nicki's crow was there she was trying to show me something peter you can't trust anything you saw in there this was different and it felt different she took me back to the qz and i saw that magus thing i saw it get all twisted up with nikki and i i saw her kill carell you hear yourself how'd she show you this if she's dead quite conceivably her soul may be snared by the stone chained to the child i mean we could get her back essence can be retained but not restored or echo acts as anchor manipulated by magus to deceive the daughter so it's like karel said i think he needs to accept her death whose feat is not so easily done its appetite is insatiable if unassailed magus will absorb all we're gonna need one hell of a plan well you better come up with it quick because i see daylight the bond between magus and matriarch must be broken it harvests its hunger through the host so nikki's like the head vampire if we cure her it'll free the rest why didn't you just say that [Music] [Applause] so step one find nikki step two convince her mom ain't coming back from the dead step three get that stone away from her and mop the floor with that magus thing you show no shortage of assurance yeah this one's mr positivity it's enough to make you sick the stone is both bondage and bridge for magus and a young mind is most malleable if magus has merged with her she may not survive the severing we won't let it come to that not to join the golden downer but how are we supposed to find him again what are you what's going on oh flower [Music] they can go anywhere convert anyone [Music] we need to go now why does that sound like you're not coming with us these are my people some still survive if i stay then we'll stay and help go i'll be where i'm needed when i need to be just trust me i'm starting to actually get you you want to pop a squat golden boy you're making me nervous or perhaps your nerves need gnawing what did i do this precarious plan proves more meek by the moment the madonna was meant to be among us she knows what she's doing eventually sorry sins i have wrought to rest me among such a motley crew did he did he take my room not so much as a yip from the mud groot says he'll keep trying where's mr fancy words it is assumed peter quill's quarters it was a daring display of dominance don't you start usually i'd say who needs him but we do so you better fix this one quill just try not to piss him off any more than he already is if it is to be a fight to the death i will honor the outcome if he kills you i get your guns i wouldn't bet on peter winning that fight took all five of us to beat him last time i still can't believe he caught one of my smart bombs just like that we have already a man hold on you don't remember i remember sparring against the celestial madonna in a small village and then the cold darkness of the promise devouring my soul until you found me yeah you missed a lot more are you okay letting mantis fight the church alone out there she won't fight she'll focus on evacuating people maybe they can all hide in the caves so she's just gonna let the church take over her home world mantis would tell you that people matter more than the planet and she knows that the church won't stop coming until we rescue nikki you have great confidence in this celestial madonna she's one of the few people i know i can trust really she freaks me out because she's smarter than you and kinder hey that nickname makes my skin crawl i'm furry not fuzzy not even that little glad you're back on our side drax i got a feeling we'll need to go full destroyer on this one i should be ready peter quill i have witnessed the threat posed by magus first hand no one should suffer from its malignant lies i owe all of you a great debt of gratitude be my honor to fight beside you with all of my might that's a lot of mites groot agrees with your muscles sounds like we've got ourselves a nice church butt kicking party i only hope our guest agrees to join this buttock striking celebration hey quill you seem like you're in a good mood do i i've got a great idea for a new blaster extension can't wait to put it together well now that the gang's back together and we've got a minute to breathe i think you deserve an official thank you for what you did on lamentis quill uh yeah i know you don't like that kind of sappy stuff but i really mean it knowing about the crap those scientists did to you not only does it make my blood boil it puts everything into perspective come on it was just a puddle i don't know if i could have gotten over something like that you saved their lives man you deserve a bit of praise the rodents saved your lives and scientists were involved i have many questions yeah well save them for the next time we all get a drink together buddy be right there you impatient clark snuffle all right it's all yours one fine tech upgrade i've made it foolproof just for you as long as it's not a bomb hey warlock open up this is my room you know and that would be my cassette cover you penned this pithy poetry it's not poetry it's music hard rock it's supposed to have guitars and bass and drums simplistic scriptures as is its scribe okay what's your deal man what did i do to piss you off your lamentable leadership allowed the madonna to leave when we needed her talents to travel to the telepathic realm mantis had good reason to stay behind we just need to get nikki and get the hell out so we can find her again your tenuous tactics trust too much to fortune can you confidently convince me your meager measures may amply manage this mission my meager what your meager metal we stand against an adversary unlike any before blinded by burning hope-fueled hate magus right your evil twin that's our adversary before such a blaze still a stooge may steer but your wide-eyed wonder is merely wit and moxie you strut as an insecure uncertain of his stature does that mean what i think it means this audacity acts as stilts on sand as the tide thralls you in leading must be right off the fullness of your yearning yoke will it be so yes absolutely wise words sure and measured but be held by my bemused misgivings your demeanor differs distinctly in direction from my more willful ways maybe we can meet in the middle then yes an oath will you own an oath to operate with greater aggression to give gravitas to gravid seasons of your soul and struggle not to stand on destiny's icy flows sure man whatever it takes then assert it i swear i'll be a good leader that'll be decisive and and that i won't let manis do whatever she wants i stand partially reassured what about you mr fancy words how do i know you won't see raker and have a change of heart why would i weasel away didn't you used to be best buds with him we were common company for a fleeting fallow through which i witness the incommensurable extent of his sadness he mourns his lost son that's why he's doing all of this the church the matriarch because he wants to get his kid back but that can't happen right magus can't no cannot so we can count on you when you reunite with raker that man's gotta go down indubitably my shoulders are sore yeah mantis is heavier than she looks how is she connected with my soreness she rode your back all the way down the caves to goldie's place really so how is he frustrating it's like talking to suzanne harris at the summer dance all over again is that the humy girl you tried to impress with your yo-yo skills yeah and it went about as well as talking to mr cape what's a yo-yo rodent you mentioned the madonna riding my shoulders through the caves yep there was more than one cage then you really don't remember anything at all i have a vague recollection of dampness yep that would be the case [Music] please recount your adventures in the caves of lamentus i should be informed of what i cannot recall well we found you in the village and mantis knocked you out then we went down the caves until we found the cocoon whoa there you missed all the best parts like when groot slapped the ancient tree god yeah it was in the way the tree fought a god impressive it may be up to us to stop the church in nowhere you ready he's worried about the mutt says it would be easier with his help i didn't think cosmo would let the church take over a station but if they got the cortex then he is but one canine against the army of the converted i guess that explains why we ain't been able to reach cosmo if you don't answer it they'll vaporize us i will handle this communication all yours buddy we have my deceased wife and daughter are with me to thank the matriarch for our gift [Music] may the promised people fulfilled you are clear to land on the spaceport [Music] all them bars and bedding parlors and noodle joints maybe it's not as bad as it looks i assume it will be worse breaker rallies regiments while we wait whistling in the wings landing as fast as i can gold what the fork great cocoon boy thinks he's a butterfly now he's a man of action let's just hope that he can keep the church busy while we look for nikki [Music] you
