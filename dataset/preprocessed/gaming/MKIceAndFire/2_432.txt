shields do not get enough love give the void repulsor some sugar and watch as it blocks and returns fire well anymore where that came from shields are boring it is one of the facts of life but what if a shield could shoot back yes sweet right right and turn the void repulsor pull the fire trigger halfway to steal yourself and pull it all the way to shoot the short range widespread blast of [Applause] looks like you got enough for that beauty operate time oh now look at that new and improved let the upgrades commence shane come back for more goodbye now gary i am um going on an adventure i know how exciting i wish you both good luck and good luck on kedaro station how did he know i wonder that all the time uh if you don't mind me asking what was it like working for nefarious the emperor is very cool and self-centered i know that now but back then he had me fooled just like many others he often said i was his greatest weapon and took pride in that that is until i realized what being a weapon meant hey at least you realized it right that's not you anymore no it is not i am here to make the universe better not worse now you should be able to listen to whatever's recorded on it second dimension down not as colorful as the first one but the creatures were definitely stranger their bodies were made out of all these old relics but they could break apart and still be alive it was so wild and now i wish i had asked kaden for more time i just want to learn the stories of all these dimensions [Music] third dimension was cubes really really smart cubes i don't know what else to say there except that i might have to stop doing these for every dimension i visit because there's a little bit less than an infinite amount left and i could have mapped 32 in the time since i started talking okay fine you've always wondered what secrets laid within these lords yes [Music] ah good news mapping's going well bad news apparently not well enough because caden just asked me to go faster i wouldn't say why but he he sounded stressed so i let it go faster yeah okay like it's that easy well good thing i stopped doing those recordings wait i'm doing one now uh ah [Music] we're in a sand shark den yes okay that hurts oh nice work brother longbacks i'm grabbing the chest armor now so just bring those lords over and it'll be yours i know i was going to stop doing these recordings but i can carve out some time every once in a while just i'm a genius dimension 31x7 not super different from home but there were these creatures one was firing a gun and spinning himself around every other second while the other hung out on his shoulder doing live commentary oh i wanted to hang out with him so badly uh so um what do you think of savali well beautiful the locals are nice too i can see why you want to live here yes what is your home like well it's definitely different you know kind of beautiful in its own way perhaps in the future i could see it too huh i finally figured out a way to map even faster caden might kill me but listen instead of all the cranking and pulling a trigger to use the dimension eater i just converted the whole thing into a helmet that runs on voice commands i mean he can't argue with the results and if he does i'll just complain about it here [Music] uh [Music] dimension 242 y8 quite possibly the cutest dimension i've ever seen oh the inhabitants were all made out of wool i think they could literally make anything and there was a really pleasant voice following me around everywhere oh it was incredible oh and what's even better i think i'm finally close to mapping my last dimension oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] ah [Music] yes this is uh [Music] ah uh i found so tomorrow i'm going to sleep in for an hour because i'm done baby i mapped every single dimension in existence oh i can't wait to see kaden's face when i give him the map dan tell him that i'll be going back to all those dimensions soon there's still so much i can learn uh i found out why caden has been so stressed lately something bad's going on uh bad enough that we need to hide as many long boxes as we can and i guess all of my mapping work was to help find the perfect dimension for us to hide in so yeah i hope i didn't screw anything up yes [Music] [Music] brother lombax does it again here's a sick looking chest feet to go with those sweet sweet legs the only thing missing now is a righteous helmet if you collect the rest of the lords it's yours this is my final recording if you're listening to this that means you didn't make it to the new dimension with us and i'm so sorry we're trying hard to get everyone now but our race is scattered across so many dimensions it's this is not farewell i left a copy of my dimensional map in the archives and and i marked down where we're all going i i wish i could have left you a dimensionator too but uh hey i'm only one lombax i hope you find your way back to us and if you do please look me up the name's mags and i'd love to hear your story i don't even you just helped save lombak's history for generations my brothers and i thank you it was an honor brother so welcome sugar feel free to browse get that chain going hon service let's build us a dimensionator that phase quartz is all yours rivet and clank on sargasso you said you gave ratchet the dimensionator so that he could find the other long boxes i never thought i'd meet one of us much less find our home if you can even call it that do you really think it would work no no no what happened here i am uncertain [Music] please on appears to have stored energy from the dimensional ribs another dimension is this your blazer no but we can find intact phase quartz here we should seek out the miners let's worry about the toxic crabs first uh what was that seismic activity perhaps caused by the crumbling barriers between dimensions i was afraid you'd say that we need to reach the other side of that window to activate the lockdown release another dimensional thing yes the instability is worsening probably why miming operations are offline you know good merchandise when you see it glad to be in service haven't you punished me enough stupid universe no job no face courts no planet what else do you want huh my mind fine take it if it helps i just found out there's another dimension where bees are still intact still intact how do you of course the police on if the planet hasn't been destroyed yet who was that do you know what she was talking about she must be a survivor of whatever happened here all right we need another please on crystal [Applause] the intact dimension engaging oh come on oh got him so how are we gonna get the face chords we should speak to a minor or engineer in the intact dimensions i need to find them they need to know she's broadcasting to anyone who will listen we can look into it after we obtain the phase quartz this area is perhaps we can reset the log thank you and have a safe uh ah across the lava a mining platform kind of busy right now when they're not trying to gnaw your ankles which is never [Music] nicely handled now we should get up to the ridge [Music] the stranger i encountered no one like that in my dimensions please are ah so shiny wow uh [Music] bro where are we who cares [Music] [Music] really [Applause] but not as elite as us ah please thanks for the help boltz not really used to it we will need a way to mine the face courts hmm perhaps the giant drill let's find someone who can point us to it ah this is the mining hub perhaps someone here can direct us to the drill the chief engineer survey station should be nearby you are just full of fun facts huh indeed for example the average miners spend 72 percent of their life underground whoa really no but i would hate to bore you by running out of trivia these individuals appear as confused as we are earthquakes lockdowns interdimensional rifts can't really blame them but we need that drill we should hurry whatever happened to please aren't my dimension this one could be next of all kinds welcome sugar feel free to browse oh now look at that [Music] excuse me uh if you're going that way could you look around for chef julie o'shea she was supposed to be back with ingredients an hour ago don't know she's hurt sure i can keep an eye out appreciate it these miners have had a rough time today so we're going to cook up a storm to help julio ever gets back here hmm i am picking up a radio transmission you there with the fuzz in the ears how would you like to help create our galaxy's next food dish of the century don't answer it's historical just make your way up to crystal ridge and we shall get started chef [Music] hold on how are those robo mutts floating [Applause] automatic cloaking field generator fancy uh look at that now where's the exit [Music] so coming back what's that noise pretty sure we can reach crystal ridge through this cavern so uh emperor [Applause] i see the culinary life calls to you too there should be quarry jumpers nearby that can help you get up here hello gorgeous ah i can only create beauty when i'm suffering okay to make my greatest dish yet i must harvest the serangean honey below us with this vacuzak but doing so requires my full attention so i'll need someone to defend me from those allergic to brilliance if you wish to be a part of culinary history start the extraction sequence with that hammer crank so what's the dish there's been a lack of suffering lately so i do not know yet so be on the lookout for interlopers here they come on the left use the button on that side to activate my trap blended i could not abide by the stench of pesticides so i thought why not go back to my roots barbecue they're coming from the right activate the trap on the right before they damage the back you suck and scare away my muse delicious the traps protect the vacuum but they take time to reset can't have them overheating can and that's my preamble or as we like to say in the culinary world the appetizer now it's time for the main course it begins here they come defend me while i dig deep for my inspiration yes i can feel an idea coming to me a serangian honey glazed puffboard but what drink do we pair it with i need more more inspiration more honey just think of those hungry miners uh magnificent yes yes yes the drink shall be a certified magma mead but those miners deserve a dessert too which means we need to suffer one last [Music] [Music] [Music] our masterpiece [Music] [Applause] no the honey is starting to curdle take any more damage [Music] eureka the dessert shall be an upside down snaggle bee sally moose oh yes so much suffering but now my imagination has woken from its slumber this honey smorgasbord will be beautiful what's suffering you didn't do anything thank you for your assistance perhaps this will inspire you to make your own art one day i'm just happy those miners are finally gonna get some grub now how do i get back to them oh that secure taxi should do the trick all this food talk makes me wonder bolts who's the better cook you or ratchet oh it is never a competition ah it's you isn't it i knew it [Music] [Music] [Music] oh i believe we are close to the survey the decorations here are slightly more colorful than in my dimension focus oh sorry look who it's now thanks for choosing miss zircons oh that is practically bursting with power now that one is just begging for an upgrade great start where to next [Music] [Music] you looking for the chief engineer use that safety lift to get to the site the dimensional damage seems to be getting worse it's kind of pretty in a deadly terrifying way that must be the chief engineer hello do you hear that no voices haven't been hearing them for too long wherever the purple is they are too first the quakes and the blison now this i don't hear anything except someone asking if you'll be drilling for face court soon not until i determine what's going on for all we know this whole drill site is haunted that's why i set my science bots out to scan the purple and i have to pick them up and i know it's safe why wait i'll find the bots and bring them back here safe and sound these bots have intercepted a message from your dimension perhaps it is from that person we encountered hopefully they can help us figure out what happened there and prevent it here let's go [Music] you
