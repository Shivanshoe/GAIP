I'm not seeing away down here maybe well now that could work a mix [Music] kind of scary huh Saul in the mind hey check it out they stick this big boy on us we'd be screwed six ways from Sunday mechanized minutes like these were designed to take out giant monsters probably a new prototype if they do decide to deploy it and our best bet would be on then let's hope he sleeps through the explosion where is everybody Beach Shinra got scooped and cleared out [Music] take the lead yes my turn [Music] [Music] you're good at this told you so it takes me back [Music] should be easy [Music] [Music] all time cocky little bastard age [Music] well what we got is turrets and top pocket air with the whole thing [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] my god like Hitler [Music] take movie nothing's gonna stop you would say that [Music] [Music] [Music] difficulty on make that right yeah [Music] [Music] soldiers Shinra sick of this hey soldier boy Jeeva why how much time we need got all the time in the world this one comes with a remote detonator courtesy of Jessie we withdraw to a safe distance then go boom safe distance what no such thing we get out the same way we got in let's double back where you going weirdly perfect timing wait a minute is someone watching us greetings my dear sewer rats as architect of our populous engagement campaign public security you welcome the cheap you should be flattered right now what is this breaking news from mockery afterthought Shinra has confirmed the reactor to be the target of the bomb issued by the terrorism Avalanche members of the group were observed entering the facility and security is currently sweeping it for explosive devices we now go live to the scene [Music] residents are outraged that the tragedy of mockery after one was only the first in a campaign a vice-president Shinra has issued a statement providing assurances that the terrorists will soon be brought to justice and so to a people beset by chaos and uncertainty we will offer the finest bread and circus [Music] Engineering [Music] [Music] but quietly adapting trouble [Music] you I don't believe we've played right into shinra's hands Annette [ __ ] news is already right now so we're screwed no no no no no hell no they want to turn this into a spectacle then I say let's pretend she's the gasps snake in front of everybody okay I'm sorry [Music] [Music] subdued II insurgents and bring them to the command center right now you heard the man get these components prep for the air Buster hate that it's ready sir component outbound for PA coffee it's not take it out [Music] don't overdo it [Music] all clear now let's see what these bastards were up to [Music] cloud check this out it looks like a few of its components are still in transit we'll see about that could tamper a little with it slow down and give ourselves an edge there should be a console somewhere this to console you talking about think you can get it to work needs a key card will this fighter did you find it yeah good job now let's check out that console [Music] em units huh I'm guessing that some sort of component yep an enhancement powered by liquefied materia sounds bad pretty sure I can divert this unit for disposal [Music] and unit flagged for disposal heidegger's got no idea who he's messing with so far so good right let's move diverting annual to disposal room [Music] you think they're watching us even now yep probably got a live feed nothing we can do about it except smile for the folks at home don't get in my way all right like that take booyah be my ELF to you component outbound for p7 copy we've lost contact with p8 sent two men to check it out huh intruders seize them deal with that [Music] [Music] now bring it [Music] looks like there's two consoles this time hmm double the seven times then we can find the key cards any cards just the Warner two choices and only one single-use card it's up to you cloud what does an AI programming court do increases processing power dedicated to motor function computation makes it move real quick a real quick giant robot huh that doesn't sound good anyway we should weigh our options carefully console talks about Big Pharma sales you acquainted we call them bb's enough to blow you to hell and back good divert them and give it a couple less shots to take us out make the call [Music] big bone Nichelle flack for disposal just imagine in their faces when they find out so where did we send the discarded stuff to a storeroom for defective equipment I'm guessing that so you think these defective cells and programming cores might be valuable enough to warn a little detour baby I say we grab if we get that far [Music] oh okay listen up y'all everything Shinra has told you is a goddamn lie Marco is the lifeblood of our planet those greedy bastards are bleeding it dry y'all got a rise up Barrett who are you talking to no people put me on TV I will drop some truth thousand Gil says they cut the sound [Music] [Music] bro yes [Music] [Music] don't you [Music] piece of cake find any cards only water and this time we've got three choices take your pick AI programming core what are you thinking about should we get rid of it I'll tell you what I never look forward to an execution more in my entire life you don't say we're about to make fools out of Shinra while the whole damn city's watching jobs like these you've gotta save it Oh No if you're about to ask me to dance the don't come on don't be shy how about you cloud I don't dance parallelism immunity another type of enhancement you'll call if you want to mix it feel like scrapping some BBS hurry up and decide what you want to get rid of it's past time we talked similar lesson the more immunities God the tougher it'll be right we could do something about that and unit flag for disposal surge all right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because toffee they're here [Music] bunch of pushovers come on y'all let's see what kind of mischief they were getting up to four consoles and never enough key cards yes an AI program in core should we discard this or something else programming core platform soul Heidegger is not gonna like that ai programming course help it move faster right divert it or not that's an alien right yep this is our chance to really stick it to shinmin we should think it through before we make a decision Big Momma shells we should divert them if you think it will improve our odds big bone Nichelle flack for disposal just imagine in their faces when they find out we've done enough to keeping the robot all that we can at least two so the stage is set all that's left is to hijack hide-a-goose show we're coming up on the exit dzifa detonator still in range we should be good the moment big board goes down you get that switch right obviously alright alright try me ready finish it [Music] you [Music] case a we didn't prepare now we just got to get it done that just leads back down studies report we're making our final adjustments work faster or you'll hear from the brats look they're still prepping it they're here over there by us every second you can [Music] [Music] [Music] we're too late that's Oh [Music] this had a chance hey guys performance assessment don't you think we'll figure out its weaknesses as we fight it as long as we stay focused we'll be fine we can do this real no we need to talk victory pose something coordinated for the live on camera finish could blow up big start a new trend Neto no way up no way we're getting back keep looking don't overdo it [Music] keep it together your butt [Music] Oh you know subtle imitation ain't no Cinnabon keep those gloves up sure thing coach [Music] [Music] they bullet go to an institutional misery one of all damn city watches give it our all and quit we're gonna get through this we're gonna make it home all of us no exceptions right we don't want to disappoint Marlene that goes for you too cloud right you better give up bigger smile the price is right [Music] but open it already it's locked down is there any way we can get it open yeah from that room over there why does everything have to be so damn complicated you know the faulty equipment storerooms that way - do you think we'll find the components we do it's like a treasure vault oh I'd like to sounder that so how do we do this it's simple we move the levers at the same time got these ones I'll take that which just leaves right so annoying [Music] the emergency lockdown is currently in effect so we need to synchronize our movements in that case followmolly na tifa's fine have it your way okay pay attention you two three two one [ __ ] shake it off three two one emergency lockdown disengage gotcha now that is what I call teamwork go team [Music] what job got tucked away a netball this would be the treasure bomb that's right what's the catch we do bypass a high-level security lock different from the other one same
