pardon with my friends it's hard but for them the Colonel's death signaled the end of their journey and the beginning of a new life on the shores of Lake Baikal for me the loss became a threshold between the order and my own life between duty and my dream to see that again and like Artyom before I chose to pursue my wild dream along the way I sometimes felt the trees ruins of Leaning wire posts vanishing behind or just an endless movie reel projected onto a dragon's screen just for me only a late night viewer an empty theatre yes every morning the Sun rising dead ahead brought another change of scenery making sure that I was in fact getting closer to the Pacific one step at a time slowly but steadily no matter the obstacles on the way one day sitting in a recliner on my dad's porch I might actually be tempted to start a book about this one day but not here not now I see the town that's to become my springboard for a leap across the ocean nice smell salt in the air if there really is even a slight chance of me ever getting home I will fight it here privyet Vladivostok [Music] to eat black dance would you have me go show yourself so I know hit the goal boys I think we've

impressive it's the boss yeah it's me why are you still tied up we've arrived come aboard am i happy nice to meet you too Tom the sheep yours never good ticket follow me let's talk so where did you want to go San Diego one way California Oh truly a heaven on earth I say for the traffic in LA of course that was hell look man remind me what was the name of your baseball team Padres right our team used to play them often I'm from Seattle you know Mariners if you think any further check is in order nothing personal lance corporal these are tough times of course trust but verify exactly by the way Sam this is Glen my right-hand man he's in charge of the applied force Department of my business here hello Sam watch in pre-op no Klim klem's boys couldn't invite you here at a better time the doctor flex the wind somewhat but still just look at that yeah had I stayed there I'd be halfway to Kansas by now not that I wanted to go there where do you want to go wait how about we have a good smoke and hear your story first and don't say no to a smoke even though there isn't much of a story really Middle East Afghanistan and Moscow I was on the embassy guard detail happened to be in the Metro when [ __ ] hit the fan a lot of people survived there and then you just sat in the tunnels for 20 years thinking we were the last people alive in the world I'll come a perimeter of jammers the leaders were in the know but kept it under wraps for twenty years but why haven't got a clue really friend of mine learned the truth with him the whole squad OHS with we had to run across the continent we had a train at Lake Baikal we split I went further east and kept going until I ended up here if my dad is still alive he could still be waiting for my return he'd be over 70 now I haven't got much time I see so you're looking for someone to take you home yeah people don't just sail across the Pacific nowadays unlike the old times but I can take you there on this sub it's rather cool down Cantonment you're right Glenn can I help somehow Tom and how did you get this submarine in the first place it's a long story of perhaps just an executive summary well I am in a hurry but not to such an extent in that case I'll start from a farm oh by the way I almost nailed Tennessee sour mash here no proper aging of course well the flavor is basically right once you drink with us Clem they'll bad you know but suit yourself of course to our meeting to our meeting meeting Wow Curtis sure what did I tell ya so ready to listen now I'd been doing business here before the war and mainly on the international weapons market the locals had lots of money and opportunities but no connections and style whatsoever I came in Klim handled the relations with our local partners just before the war our enterprise was starting to gain momentum but then the bombs fell you can guess the rest yep our company had a competitive advantage though warehouses full of weapons and Clem's boys in charge of guarding those warehouses then we entered a phase of dynamic growth and a few years ago learned of a flourishing settlement here and the Divo stock the place was governed by the ex captain you met before he didn't do a decent job of it I must admit but was not ready for the ongoing war against bandits that's what we offered to help with the captain took the deal and was not disappointed the clinton found a radical solution to the bandit problem yeah you can still see some hanging right and then we learned that the sub was operational all along and the captain never even thought of using this immense opportunity how is he supposed to use it obviously you're not a businessman but just like him naturally to everyone's benefit for soon many years after the war mankind has been barely holding on to life because there was no force left tonight the survivors in pursuit of restoring the civilization but we we could create such a force a new state the true shining city on a hill to lead the whole world to new accomplishments to turn the apocalypse into a new beginning we won't even have to shoot just drop the anchor and view of any settlement open our missile ports and they will readily give us everything and accept our pen do you find this an elegant it would be just a statement of fact we are power here we are the force to lead everyone into the future I see so what are the captain's say ah human ballistic and tried to get rid of us but when he saw his game was up for good he ran away which means you get to decide where to sail now right certainly there's just one slight problem the subs alright but its reactors need to be refueled but only the ex captain knows where to get the fuel rods and can control the procedure regrettably after our falling out he wouldn't even talk to us no matter what yeah a lot of things starting to make sense now great then I can offer you a deal Sam I'd like you to be our negotiator make that fossil understand if he helps us get the fuel we leave the settlement to him we'll find a better base in no time anyway of course he's also welcome to have all crew members who won't follow me and once we get the fuel San Diego will be our first destination deal deal Sam you'll need some protection there's a burly man I'll send my best guys thanks Clem but I prefer working alone oh that's some true grit right there leave Sam be clam he can handle it whatever you say boss so we have a deal still if you are going to represent us in negotiations we'd better equip you to our standard a Klim please set Sam's radio to pick up our frequencies sure dear now for the important part the map of the area it's as exact as it can be all things considered plus it shows all the captain's hideouts we know of you should check those first done spasibo Klim well radios taken care of as for the rest of your gear and drop by the shooting range you'll be issued everything have some rest first though you had a long day thank you but I'd rather go now I prefer to strike iron while it's hot thanks Tom I guess I'll be going now storms already over after all good luck rookie course just leave oh just leave ah bye [Music] I know you're clean Liam quietly boys for good when they let him get away the captain himself I could forget we're keeping tabs on him but where's the XO the others I just can't trust your boys with these passerby but I do he survived in Moscow he survived there and then he came here if you say so I certainly do tell them to be on the lookout for our guest provide him support if need be and tell that to everyone else how the Uncle Sam you're expected at the shooting range Moses orders it's that way across the bridge hi American okay I think I got this time to check ignition this is ground control to Major Tom yeah your circuits dead there's something wrong damn it I knew I was forgetting something let's see if it works now engines on it really made the grade it's closed but why it's just closed is why is a clause man closed for special service what the hell I only need to zero my gun in won't take long well it will just have to wait look I won't take long if I could I'd let you in but I have orders all right aha here's our guest come on in spasibo hey how come you let him through wait didn't you hear the announcement this guy just came from America to see the boss oh [ __ ] how did he get here he was para dropped from the orbit all his staff burned up on re-entry so the boss wants him to have our best gear to prove his hospitality oh damn that's so awesome I've been expecting you my name is danila I'm Tom's gunsmith the boss want you geared up ASAP Sam so I'll cut straight to the chase first your universal detector there are mines all over the ruins so never leave home without it you can also detect spare parts weapons lots of things actually nice indeed now your new rifle this looks familiar but different it's a local make optimized for our home brand of incendiary ammo it accepts regular more right just not the standard max don't want our idiots ruining their old rifles with the hot stuff thanks I'll take good care of it glad to hear that I guess you're all set now you can test it here my assistant has a couple of mags ready here's your ammo good luck this one should not just feel familiar it's the real McCoy a 45 automatic straight from Tom's premium stock we've sold quite a few of its siblings here but this one's been fine-tuned to the max and hasn't seen a day abuse past its shakedown so it won't fail my mother what don't mind if I do I need more practice with this thing that was a solid attempt but perhaps you'd like to try again need more ammo here you go yes another try won't hurt shooting simplify look I can appreciate art of shooting like nobody else here thanks for the show thanks doc was truly amazing here's your prize all in a day's work well I won't be holding you any longer good luck sir thanks Denny uh see you around sure did you get geared up weapons zeroed in and all that stuff yep everything's fine great good luck to you them [Music] but the game just use one man just cuz everyone the brand that's outside take it all until they feel generous you get to die quick the castle he takes his gun will see the deal to the end and make sure the final buyer treats us fair so what do we do now now we just wait for the cats man to come check out cargo good I can do that sure so he did let you pass off the role not before wearing my patients theme like he's black so hello there are American guests how'd they do I heard you saw the captain how is he don't answer I know it's tough for him if you see him again tell him tell him we haven't forgotten to think he's done for us and we're ready to follow him anywhere we're still checking but yes there's definitely some missing many suspects yeah there's this clown babyface he took off as soon as we came to check on him and locked himself up in his cabin the guys are trying to get him out I know him I always thought he was suspicious I'll go check up on them alright we'll carry on here you don't like Tom's new direction look I know you're trying to provoke me but I'm best caring now so I'll just tell you straight I don't like Tom and his business stick but that's not what's killing me it's the way he took over it's the way he got rid of the captain and all the officers and its claim and his goons that I hate I also think captain was right nukes mustn't be used no matter what and it's good that the subs are the fuel you can run to clean now and have his flunkies drag me away to his torture chamber there I said it now piss off you don't have to shout like that I'm not going to report you or anything Yeah right tell that to the others they already took away hello again America north feelings right no hard feelings great the boss told us to find a nice boat and he or she is looks nice enough just take the wheel and use the remote box like the stick on a car and you'll be fine we will install the compass yeah don't leave it unattended though it's got your spirit inside also mind the inertia at full speed it takes some time to stop even if you switch the reverse and please bring her back in one piece yeah she has a lot of sentimental value for him I still can't believe we got one more American here sorry none of us really expected to see any American Seifert on so how's it going any progress no nice the [ __ ] got a good lock on this door you no matter we'll get him soon enough yeah I like your tail let's hear some more yeah I guess I'll stay and watch them get some popcorn it's gonna get really exciting when we open this parking lot well she's all yours good luck and calm seas to you goodbye [Music] [Music] Thanks [Music] [Music] [Music] beast sub they're tall I could use this [Music] could be abuse less many you guys around I could use that okay this I could definitely use [Music] very good sir but least near North car blow ha okay this I could definitely use [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this stuff is mine now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you talk about mining for resources [Music] too much TV is better under your eyes [Music] [Music] [Music] don't fret you [ __ ] we're gonna cut you up like real good this looks interesting [Music] [Music] at least near north car oh great find the beach was having up there [Applause] [Music] [Music] let's put something educational on for a change San Diego bonds of friendship and cooperation these cities are not be damned San Diego but also major scientific cultural and political centers that have played major historical roles in the development of their region both cities are as great economic importance not only for their countries as a whole in our turbulent times when the hundra of reactionary forces is once again raising its multiple heads we must make every effort to further strengthen the cordial friendship between Verde Vostok and San Diego we believe that friendly support and mutual understanding will undoubtedly replace hostility and distrust in international relations and the cooperation of our twin cities is a shining example of such understanding and an important milestone on the way to this goal dad I'll be home soon just wait a little longer scratch one mine [Music] [Music] [Music] he can yet DOMA [Music] kill them you can save the earth pull your hair down Beast oh my grafica jammed you again yes me Lance Corporal Samuel Taylor US Marine Corps well thank you Uncle Sam it was Baranov ex-captain glad to meet you yet how'd you end up in this mess this is one of my ports usually the traps downstairs were enough the Fargo is here know well enough to stay away let's go before some more arrived stupid beasts you kill a bunch but they just keep coming help me move the Sun you got it we did it which is a good sign means I'm alive so where was I ah yes then they bandits from the cinema decide to throw a party for the local gang bosses and think far enough ahead to chase a pack of uglies away from the ruins next door for extra security so the poor mutants arrived here and got sandwiched between the bandits and the other parks in the vicinity the only way open for them was up I could beat them but that Jam you're welcome I've been looking for you did you talk to Tom yeah he suggest sad eel yes he's fond of those alright my own personal Savior let's set sail come aboard we have a long way to go I'm over here Sam tell me yet what happened here during the war doesn't look like the city took any direct hits so why is it in such a state kids the warheads fell into the sea I need you to live my sub didn't even shoot all the targets were destroyed without our care we call the best for orders but there was no reply the base was hit naturally so we sailed here that's when the HQ was when we reach the city we couldn't recognize it it was even worse back then of course just the smell alone there were very few survivors and frankly we were surprised to find any we picked them up from the roofs organized somehow and ended up settling in the dock the place in the pretty cozy at least we had no problem with electricity with the reactors running and by the time they ran out of fuel we had a floating power station ready all this luxury ended up generating rumors so the bandits started coming by to check us out finally one day Tom writes with an offer of uniting our forces and setting up an effective defense perimeter hmm that bastard sniper get out Devils did it get you I'm fine keep your head down looks like we're safe did you see where he's shooting from I'll handle this later you stay here are you sure go get him then hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] guys we're getting [ __ ] trout [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm gonna check [Music] [Music] [Music] boys you show yourself [Music] you certainly see you reach and your [ __ ] back [Applause] just let me see you beach and you're [ __ ] dead there you modify I don't [ __ ] yes [Music] calm down I'll kill the [ __ ] he's [Music] awesome [Music] [Music] [Music] easy easy man I give up no I I see you are serious people going about your business so I won't give you any trouble anymore [Music] edie Sam here sniper neutralized this is a real price nikka kiss problem I gotta find another way [Music] [Music] yeah who were those guys ah these are the bandits I told you about they came to make a profit by robbing or settlement to the dog but it didn't pan out I must give credit where credit is due but bastard Tom did bolster the defenses all right these losers have long since stopped trading a few years back they made one last attempt cream gave them a lesson they were so terrified they didn't even cut down bodies of their hind pals all over the ruins they couldn't read didn't have a place to go so they turned to traffic they catch mutants in the ruins those human-like ones they're beasts are dumb and shrewd but strong quite good for dragging carts or boats on the rivers turning wheels and stuff they don't eat much either so using them lets you save a bunch of fuel so the bandits catch them train them a little and then sell them off to traders those come from the south a couple of times a month the paying weapons ammo rice all the things you need for a decent life in the world the visitor settlement - mostly buying restore generators engines and other machines our maintenance guys are real wizards after all oh and right fish - so that's the region's economy and I'm not sure but why did those trappers shoot us the whole city is divided between them it took a lot of fighting to define those borders so now they open fire at anyone approaching without proper insignia got it turf wars the primeval edition you got it all right we're here Sam let's move this thing and I'll show you my backup base cool so care to tell me the essence of Tom's offer simple he offers to leave you the settlement along with everyone who won't follow him and what does he want he wants you to deliver fuel rods for the submarine come on in sir don't worry the lifts fine my friends and I took our time preparing his base there's a generator on the roof the staircase is just an emergency exit too many fog leaves in the lower floors so the lifts no longer just have to keep that generator going so the guys didn't get caught back then after all or if they did they wouldn't talk what guys when Tom had shown his true colors my closest friends and I decided to refuel the soul and take her to see the plan was strictly need-to-know only Alex my XO and our executive rapido officer and Volodya the life support guy were in they left to recon the field and stayed in contact for two weeks they found the fuel and we arranged for me to pick him up in the night but it was claims people who met me there and I barely escaped do you think they were captured I don't know but seeing claims people there was hardly a coincidence yeah and we're there come on in sir make yourself at home son take arrest there's a storm outside anyway Jeremie Sam what's your angle in all this mess I just want to go home ed nothing more Tom said he'd give me a lift before starting the nuclear war all over again or after Sam the sub is a terrible weapon a weapon that was entrusted to me to protect my country not to be used in pirate raids or even something as Noble as creating the kingdom of heaven on earth can you see that I didn't use it in the last war so could anybody have any right to use it in any capacity now when we barely survived him after that one ed Thomas a reasonable man I don't think he'd goes so far as Tommy is first and foremost a businessman and he will get what he wants one way or another can't you see that his offer to let those who wouldn't follow him go is a threat what is going to happen to them should I choose not to bring him the fuel I think you're being too negative here really okay let's do it this way I ring him up you talk to him directly fine by me Tom Sam here the captain agrees to talk captain so far if we stretch the definition but that's besides the point even if I believe you I don't believe him did he tell you the three bandits are working for him I have no proof but the friends I left with went missing did he tell you anything about them said he was looking to them I had my doubts from quite some time already and now they're solidifying bar leader cannot carry double any longer once the fuel is here Clem will be taken care of anything else no just that we have a deal we do Tom I know I'm going to regret this but we do thank you for trusting him Sam I don't trust him not even for a second no matter what he says I can't trust him but but you have no choice exactly I really don't have a choice here then that generators out again let's go check it [Music] before we call let's do something about my knee it is swelling up already hmm sure thing yet do you have anything for the pain I don't drink really but I do have a crate of molotovs there moonshine and fish oil should do the trick I wish we had some food to chase the drink down with oh here wow that's a nice surprise alright no point in putting it off any longer now Cheers not so bad here you'll have some too are you sure yes I am come on let's get it boom casting all right I'm ready poly tars hold on your head yes I don't think it worked let me catch my breath and get one for yourselves - Cheers okay pull again put your back into it all right damn that was awful thanks for the ledge and I feel better already cheers Cheers I say let's not go anywhere tonight okay let's go check the generator he sure when my ex overseer shouts where the hell is my jet machine I think I got this pull that lever son I ain't got it you hear that what the music [Music] but we heard some music amen to that let me fix this I definitely got a mouth started [Applause] [Music] wait by the way care to tell me your story sure come on sir on vine sure why not when we bury the colonel this is new I had a leaf where's his new dad it's waiting thanks for telling me son run the ropes my dad inside to take the deal that bastard wants to save the world he's going to become a pirate with nukes that's it I don't know I think it's quite like that he has ideas oh I'm telling you Sam you're a nice guy I don't know he's not a madman I know but still yeah to hell with you that's [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what you'll like respect respect your elders [Music] [Laughter] amen to that [Laughter] [Music] what and blind are we drinking you are not blind your sleeping face down and stop shouting my head that's why I don't teach oh it's terrible but I feel better now here finish this it will help a bit okay if you say so [Music] okay while you're recovering let's go back to the conversation we had yesterday I don't know where that fuel is and it's not even that far in another ground submarine base the tunnels are half flooded but still accessible the entrance is in the naval HQ building radiations off-the-charts they're gone so I wouldn't even try without a protective suit this building used to be a fire department and I know they've had some suits in case of an accident with one of the swords now the place is overrun by bandits so it's not going to be a walk in the park I guess think you can handle it okay I guess some fresh air will do me good I'll go get those suits thank you Sam I'll be getting ready here too you should take the stairs down there and through the door oh I almost forgot while going downstairs could you reload the traps the mutants do visit this place from time to time I'll try to it there's one Molotov left take it there are many dead bandits on the lower floors they should have the materials for more if you need any [Music] you
