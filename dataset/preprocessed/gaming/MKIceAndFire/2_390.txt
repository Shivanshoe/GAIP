you're up there on the big screen biggest life you're a [ __ ] movie star and you're killing all the bad guys tearing them limb from limb and you feel good you look good [ __ ] you are good and then

you're nuts johnny powell you look like [ __ ] you were supposed to be the expert i paid you good money to help me figure things out and you repaid me by skipping out in the middle of the night for what jackie i did what i could to help you control the darkness but being around you was becoming a problem for me the darkness is so [ __ ] seductive i could hear it whispering to me whenever i was around you it was starting to change me are you gonna kill me is that what this is all about i let it out johnny now i don't know if i can control it let the darkness back out jesus christ jackie that thing is like a slow suicide then help me get it back under control you don't control the darkness jackie you cower in [ __ ] fear of it and you pray it goes away the longer the darkness is active the more it'll try to confuse you it will try to trap you make us see stuff that that other people can't see i need your help so you're back on the payroll until i say you can go a bunch of [ __ ] just came after my entire operation and whoever gave them this envelope is connected to the darkness somehow i need you to figure out who they are and what they know about it okay okay yeah yeah i'll do what i can it's it'll go a lot faster if you get one of your gorillas to untie me please it lives in viscera and you are the focus he wants chaos you can untie him now chief but keep an eye on him for me would you hmm wow that guy really let himself go i used to think he was pretty smart now he looks like something the cat threw up hey hey frank and idiot back from the club they're waiting for you

coke off a hooker's ass never could multitask well these two chuckleheads are getting their dick spit polished one of the [ __ ] starts running their mouth about the new owners i had this girl camille she says the place got brought up last month the new guys took over the top floor yeah but that ain't the best part camille says she seen some weird guy with a limp going in and out of the place says he looks like nosferatu on crack what the [ __ ] is nosferatu your grandmother no idea if this wack job and his crew are still there but it might be worth checking out all right enough talking i'm headed down there whatever you say jackie i think vinnie has a friend who works there might want to ask him about her hey jack so uh jimmy told me about the brimstone club sounds like a real dumpster you uh got a hookup over there uh you mean i mean well i mean i'd never go to a cesspool like that but i got a friend who goes there sometimes who you know when it's late at night when other places are closed i know a girl named venus sure she can help you out she's a real handful two of them actually the new owners are real pissy about the door they don't let nobody bring a gun in that's fine because you probably want to learn as much as you can before you you know do your thing and scare the living [ __ ] out of him damn right okay then you ready to get some [ __ ] answers take me to this [ __ ] vinny i thought you'd never ask let's go jackie jackie wait what what's the matter this envelope where did you say you got it again off some dead guy that was paid to kill me oh [ __ ] oh

darkness is shhh they're spreading the host is over there you're losing it jackie so predictable prepare the siphon [Music] he's coming too what the hell are you doing he's awake keep him focused i like the way he feels he feels sticky go about your duties when the transfer is complete that we'll have what we came for i want you to believe me i wish this could have been any other way jackie but we all have tough choices to make and this is yours so you're the [ __ ] who tried to hit us at the restaurant huh don't talk and don't think just listen you've been keeping something that was once lost something that doesn't belong to you now you have to choose to give it back what happens to you is of secondary concern i only care about one thing i want the darkness i don't know what you're talking about of course you don't but the fact is you're careless and far too many criminals in this city believe you have a demon living inside you the restaurant was a test to be certain you were the new darkness host now you've passed that test we want it back hmm i feel you shifting in there are you getting nervous you're too stupid to give the darkness the fear and respect it deserves jackie it prefers the company of a [ __ ] it can control and it loathes the sight of an intelligent man who can control it now i'll ask just once will you give me the darkness of your own free will why don't you try and take it if you're such a [ __ ] genius if you read anything but comic books and menus you'd know there are rules the host may only give up the darkness by choice i'm afraid i have to help you make that choice mr peevish if you'd be so kind watch this pretty boy it's your own personal snuff movie the darkness made you watch your girlfriend's murder your first meaningful act as its host was one of submission face it jackie you can't control the darkness and you never could best to give it back to the people who can that stream of dark essence flowing into the siphon tells me you're already thinking of giving it up let's see if i can grease the wheels of that decision mr bragg so this was your girlfriend a jackie boy i guess spores with lip rings give good head what's the matter couldn't [ __ ] her face when her head was blown off jackie oh jackie the whole damn place is overrun don't give it each jackie they don't got the whole place yet shut up you're under attack all across the city we have the means and the intent to bring your organization to its knees and within minutes we'll control your home so think fast jackie this isn't just about you anymore make a choice left or right jackie no you can't do this to me you son of a [ __ ] [Applause] that one got wet you did what you had to do jackie you show these bastards who they just [ __ ] with shut your ugly mouth you [ __ ] corpse you made a bad decision to let the genie back out of the bottle jackie to the darkness you're just a puppet made of skin and gristle last chance will you give me the darkness of your own free will [ __ ] you then not of your own free will i'm trying to help you but if you're too stupid to see it i'll negotiate in a language even you can understand mr bragg kill everyone in the mansion find the old lady and tear off both of her arms hey how about i tear off a useless old pit what do you think of that jackie boy you lost jenny because you couldn't control the darkness and now you're going to lose everything you cherish because you don't have the sense to accept your limitations break his will he will beg us to take it from him you must resist protect the darkness never i'm done with you do not let them take me [ __ ] you puppet well to my bidding give me one good reason my soul is mine you will do my bidding jenny jenny's dead idiot focus maybe the darkness or your dear old aunt sarah is worm food i can't you leave me no choice but to use the siphon mr peevish the binding rituals are nearly prepared won't be long now good keep working him over i want him as weak as possible when the ritual begins resist he's free the host broke free get outside and lock the [ __ ] door i tried to give you an out jackie so don't ever say you weren't given a choice you bought this on yourself and you've bought it on your family i was only trying to help you you won't die jackie the darkness won't let you but by the time you get out your aunt sarah will be gutted and boned and you'll have gained nothing think about just how powerless you are because next time i won't ask so nicely towards the entire building the siphon for jenny so oh ugh stay away from the light this one carries the darkness is [Music] monkey i found him hey butch up here holy [ __ ] jackie we thought you were done for i know i gotta exactly they give the mansion they're gonna kill

talk to me what am i up against here the seal on the envelope you found on swifty it belongs to the brotherhood the who they were the original keepers of the darkness jackie the brotherhood is the holy [ __ ] grail of secret societies they're led by a guy named victor high priest royalty to them he's not a good person understand yeah i met that [ __ ] he came after me with some kind of thing it was sucking the darkness out of me there's only one thing that can do that the siphon of the angelus jesus i thought that thing was lost for good hoped it was lost for good what the [ __ ] is it it's the device the brotherhood used to cage the darkness it's an instrument of light it was made thousands of years ago some say it was forged by the angelus itself it's the only thing that can contain
