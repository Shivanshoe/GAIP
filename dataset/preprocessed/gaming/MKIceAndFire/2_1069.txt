safe is there someplace close we could bury them that would honor their sacrifice [Music] the lighthouse they played there when they were young but it's been overrun by mongols then we take it back the lighthouse is this way they loved climbing that tower if they didn't come home at night i could always find them there gazing at the stars you are a good mother i used to think so but my children are dead and i am alive there is no greater failure i felt that way when my mother died that i failed her but you were so young and she was ill there's nothing you could have done even if that's true
