now have 24 hours of free time until then make sure to get some rest before your duties tomorrow understood hey yuito how was the test nagi how did it go on the test i'd say that i did kind of pretty good kind of good or pretty good we were looking rough when the sas cable connected oh that really hurt it was fine after i got used to it though sounds like you had fun that's so like you so tomorrow will be osf just like we dreamed i can't believe it [Music] yeah what's up you don't sound very excited no i'm happy too didn't i tell you i was saved by an osf soldier when i was a kid so i wanted to be one as well go ahead but what lately i've been wondering if that's it the end of my goal i'm here today because someone saved me so i'm wondering if there is a better way to save more people's lives you can't bear such a big burden like that people have limits we're osf so we fight others let's do our best at the job we've been given for now yeah you're right i guess i was just being a little anxious first i have to become a real member of the osf thanks your gratitude is greatly appreciated mr yuito so you're going to report to sumeragi tomb later i hate telling the ancestors every little thing so annoying well it's not just that the sumeraghi tomb is collaborating with baki right now what sumaragi tomb is your family grave i know it's a tourist spot but they do things like that i heard it's happening more and more it's something my father decided on oh right i have to send a message to my dad and brother your father won't reply anyway i know he didn't want you to join the osf but man that's cold he's always smiling when he's at the council it's like he's not even two-faced but three-faced i mean he's a politician after all anyways i only send him simple messages oh there's already a reply from my brother what does it say good work you pushed through a direct compliment from chief sumaragi you're guaranteed a promotion you're making fun of me my brother's not going to coddle me just because he's the chief of the osf okay sorry sure you are if you're really sorry you'll give me the keychain from the fortune you get from bucky all right i got it i'll pull a fortune and give you my keychain then you have to help me pick up the ladies i have a better chance when you're with me what that's just me doing extra work for you [Music] [Music] god you really do like bocky though he kind of makes me feel nice like a stuffed animal i had when i was a kid when you were a kid has bakki been around that long hasn't he i can just feel his cuteness in my dna [Applause] [Music] huh [Applause] huh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] so there are a lot of people paying their respects huh those two girls over there were cute what really i didn't see them i can't believe your family grave is a tourist spot you sure are an elite my dad and brother are but i'm not it's like one of those grand families your father is the chairman and your brother is chief of the osf plus you're descended from yakumo sumaragi our founding father he's the hero who saved humanity from the spring of extinction i wonder what he looked like maybe he looked like you he is your ancestor he's my ancestor but that was 2 000 years ago i certainly don't feel like his descendant the only record of him is in that mask even if they say he's my ancestor how could i be sure ah i get it he does look like the villain in a horror movie his face was injured in the spring of extinction right oh crap your dad would get mad at me for saying that about our country's forefather it's no big deal but you are the sumeragi house is known for having lots of authority your dad got mad when you said you didn't want to be a politician or a bureaucrat enough about my family let's go get a fortune from baki you're not going to pray to your ancestors okay let's get going then okay got it let's look at the same time roger these are the fortunes that will decide our fate in the osf ready go very bad luck me too this is a bad sign oh i'm dying let's go to a cafe or something after we tie these off yeah we already got bucky's keychain why don't we head to vision town um hey [Music] uh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] huh others and other alert but today's forecast said the threat level here was zero what others what are they doing in the city all units double time [Music] fire a transfer warning they're deploying the scarlet guardians septetrian current and fabuki [Music] september on car and travers and fubuki spring karn regiment fabuki regiment plan a roll out civilians head to the shelter [Music] wow hey yuito we have to get to the shelter too we're not real soldiers yet [Music] [Music] that very bad luck was a curse let's get to the shelter [Music] the other was defeated with one blow septetrion first class brain eater major general karen travers is amazing whoa hyper velocity evasion into an electric blast karen travers is the only one who can use that many powers he's so cool doesn't he have the ability to copy other people's powers yeah that's why he can use all those powers it's basically cheating but major general travers is unfazed whoa and other like that is nothing against a septetrion class mommy out hey are you serious we're not real soldiers yet we're the only ones here with the powers necessary to fight the others we can't if the instructors find out we can't just watch people die i'm going you call for backup i don't want to go alone i'll go with you thanks don't look so happy it's not like i want to go you're the best what you think i don't know that i'll take the right you take the left got it you okay the attacks are working maybe i can win you'd better win [Music] we did it it's not safe here get to a shelter yes sir be careful there are more others can you keep fighting sure why not i'll take them on okay let's go [Music] time all right here we go let's keep this up [Music] was that the last of them noggy that's odd you a civilian huh it's her you have to live no matter what [Music] you're osf oh no i'm a cadet i see either way our goal is the same what do you mean goal are you an idiot huh shh something's coming huh what's coming here we go huh okay come on you're osf too you can use brain talk do you see what's happening let's talk after we take out the others let's regroup now come on [Music] yeah here we go here we go good work that should take care of all the other readings around here yes kasane i saved that boy nagi you're okay yeah naomi saved me man i must look like an idiot i'm just glad you're not hurt thanks sis oh you two are sisters yeah they're both osf cadets like us let me introduce myself i'm nagi karman this is yuitoshi i'm naomi naomi randall [Music] this is my younger sister kasana randall so it was you making all that trouble the scarlet guardians have eradicated the others huh you saved ryujin ward in that amazing victory over the others what well what is this a victory interview it is how do you feel all righty all righty that's enough filming for today [Music] oh captain spring just who are these rookies what noggy huh where is everyone huh we should be able to talk here uh what's going on i'm luca traverse [Music] your septetrion 6th class luca travers it's embarrassing when you put it that way but yes that's correct are you all cadets please open your personal port so i can confirm your identities [Music] no objections thank you [Music] so all four of you are osf cadets cadets aren't allowed to fight others [Music] i i'm sorry isn't osf responsible for allowing others to enter the local air space and putting civilians in danger kasane you shouldn't say something like that those are some harsh words but you're right cadet cassani randall i'm sure you all have something to say but first report to osf headquarters keep away from the press got it understood what's that oh casualties from the battle two osf troopers on guard duty were killed i think it's censored but it's best not to look too close huh why because others eat human brains yes looking at headless bodies can have negative lasting effects on your mental health oh i just imagined it they should teleport or report them out it's too far to the morgan powers aren't omnipotent we have time so let's talk a little i'm sure you know but one person can only use one type of power but each kind of power has peculiarities and aptitude just as there are types of powers each person has strengths and weaknesses to use them in combat we must rely on devices to lessen the stress on the brain that's why things that can be accomplished without powers or things with low priority are done manually [Music] right sorry now then i'll be going that'd be us if we didn't get the others first i wouldn't let that happen we're all 567th class right we'll stick together and become great fighters yeah don't worry i'll protect you sis let's go oh goodbye yuito nagi that girl kasane randall she looks surprisingly like her those two from the registration numbers they're in the same class are they twins she's so cute huh naomi she's so my type kasane is pretty too but she's a little scary naomi is like her opposite shy and kind she kept glancing at me and blushing man this might finally be my big chance you're as simple as always whatever let's hurry to headquarters what do you mean whatever you should be supportive when your best friend is in love yeah yeah tell me all about it later let's go [Music] um oh god [Music] yes [Music] you [Music] huh oh it looks like another group of cadets has arrived that must be cadet uitosumuragi and cadet nagy carmen so it appears you were able to fight an other before your official assignment how was your first fight huh were you afraid uh no i just used my training i see so you are able to fight calmly although still a cadet you are a true scarlet guardian amazing really cadet uitosumuragi what will you tell your father chairman sumeragi about your actions today i've been ordered not to answer any questions excuse me nagi let's go you got a big head for a cadet huh what did you say all right everyone don't fight i'm kyoka eden of the first regiment eighth company you're cadet yuitosi and cadet nagi carmen right chief kaito simaragi has asked to see both of you hurry to the chief's office be ready for a lecture you did a good thing but it's important to follow the rules as a member of the osf good luck welcome to seto platoon i am seto narakami starting today i'm your commander first let's have everyone introduce themselves tell us what your powers are it's best to be familiar with the type of powers in your platoon for example my power is electrokinesis all right you first tanabe understood i'm hanabi ichijo my power is pyrokinesis happy to be here [Music] nagi carmen my power is air manipulation it was my dream to be in the osf i'm honored to serve under septetrion 7th class captain narukami i'm yuuito uitosumaragi my power is psychokinesis i was saved by an osf trooper as a child i'll do my best to repay that debt oh so you're the famous yuito you were all over the news last night they said the sumeraghi boy drove off the others how did it feel to be in the fray enough messing around kagaro introduce yourself yes captain okay all you babies of the 567th class i'm kagero dawn the late blooming genius only you call yourself that you're so harsh captain so yuito and nagi you're volunteer soldiers i'm an adult so we're in the same boat nice to meet everyone i'm sure we'll get along what does he mean by adult adults or osf troops who weren't scouted until later in life you didn't know they're like us that volunteered for the osf instead of being scouted basically fodder that's right i'm just trash here but i do my best let's work together to stay alive don't worry about how you got here only the strong and highly thought of survive in this world worrying about what others think is pointless okay next is water i'm watering frasier my power is reading thoughts basically telepathy nazar my power is clairvoyance nice to meet you so splatoon full of weirdos we should fit right in with the rest of the osf [Music] everyone do your best moving on we'll start with guard duty as your hands-on training we'll go in two-man teams nagi's with me kagura with sugumi and hanabi with yuito connect your sas with each other get ready and reconvene at the entrance to kikuchiba in one hour that is all dismissed long time no see himito hanabi what's it been two years who would have thought we'd get put in the same platoon you know messi joe call me hanabi yuito and i are childhood friends wow but we didn't see you at all as cadets oh i was scouted i see the training areas for scouted and volunteer soldiers are different so no wonder i guess you're an elite hanabi no i'm not hey do you know naomi randall the randall sisters i know them those two are the real elites khasane was scouted by the osf when she was 12. she was scouted that young huh you know kasani yeah we fought others together yesterday what you mean that other attack no way kasani didn't say anything about it are you friends with the randall sisters not really i talk to naomi a lot but kasami is i'm pretty sure the only one friendly with kasane is naomi oh really can you introduce me to naomi oh so that's how it is naomi is cute hey you three quit your jabbering and get to kikuchiba yes sir sir see you later i can't believe my first assignment is with you i'm excited hey yuito wait up yes what is it the mr wateru you can just call me watcharoo there's a notification for you about bias looks like they messed up bias it's an osf developed brain assistance system that amplifies and helps maximize your power every year they choose subjects to gather combat data on the system and this year you're one of them i won't sugarcoat it it's still in development so it's unstable and the side effects aren't clear so they want me to be a guinea pig sorry if i scared you they've done tests before so that people who aren't compatible aren't selected so don't worry too much either way it's an order so you can't refuse just try starting it up it should have installed with all the other systems is this right nothing seems different except for visuals the system works in your brain using your power to display visions powers are just the ability to visualize they get stronger the more you focus on them this will make connecting to sas smoother too it'll still hurt a lot though i think i got the gist of it thank you for explaining all of this to me even though i told you not to worry there are some nasty rumors about bias causing people to lose their minds or become emotionally unstable so if you feel strange at all don't strain yourself okay thanks i'll be careful well that's it for me oh and you don't have to be all polite with me just take it easy all right don't be late for your mission i'm a little worried about being an experiment well i guess it won't change anything okay i'll head to kikuchiba when i'm ready thank you uh so we're all here captain narakami may i ask a question you don't have to be so formal we call each other by our first names in the osf so we can strengthen our bonds most of us don't look our age ranks are there just to calculate pay the osf only values strength remember that that's the gist of it so what was your question right um water isn't here yet water is this platoon's operator he'll direct us from headquarters my power allows me to communicate telepathically without the system's assistance up to around 500 kilometers that being said it's a lot of work so join the group open your personal port [Music] team leaders will be nagi yuito and sugumi each of you listen to water's orders and move to the designated goal try to take down any others along the way retreat is allowed if you think you can't handle it but reach your goal that's all understood okay see you later good luck [Music] the teams are split up but you can use brain talk to share information come on whoops but it really feels like you're fighting together here we go yes here we go looks like there's a resource nearby that was closed don't wander off don't go into heavily damaged areas i'm good at reading the air i mean my power is aerokinesis after all that awkward pause was my power too i can still fight oh i have to water the flowers at headquarters oh i already did that the seeds we planted in those pots have sprouted nice recovery i know right every household should have a dependable cargo let's keep this up [Applause] i guess i'm getting better huh hmm [Music] [Music] this is pretty rare huh your power is really great let's keep this up i feel a little more confident we did it [Music] yes [Music] huh that was quick [Music] [Music] this place is incredible the city is above and below us it feels like i'm in a vr from a theme park i went to when i was a kid it used to serve as the connection base to togetsu the city infrastructure was destroyed in an other attack about five years ago so what you see is what remains togetsu is the stronghold of the togetsu faith right it's kind of like a cult don't say that out loud kaguro was a believer he was even a priest at one time what that guy is a priest hey you do realize i can hear you right don't forget our platoon's headsets are all connected sorry no don't worry about it my parents were believers so i just naturally became a priest i don't care about the teachings at all now the kikuchiba is like this you hardly ever see people coming to suo from the church anymore [Music] what's that drone doing so they sniffed us out look alive everyone crows and the press guys the crows will make a big deal out of this let's make it exciting the city vision projectors must be broken they're pretty but kind of scary yeah it's like they're looming up there [Music] okay all right let's keep this up many more of this all right [Music] huh souls return spray something like oil don't get it on you i've been using braintop since i was dead but it still makes me angry sometimes i believe that someone might care i can't read other people's thoughts don't worry we did it all right don't be burned come on huh all teams anything amiss no sir naughty team has nothing to report oh that's good you're on my team though so you didn't need to check in what are you doing that's a big blade that's a restricted area get back here oh sorry i was just curious it still doesn't make it okay you'll write up an incident report when we get back to headquarters yes sir huh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] oh yuito's team is the first of the objective nice going yeah hey do you hear something good instincts yuito i'm getting other readings nearby no wait this is a major other captain tsugumi a major others appear to be ejected major others are others that have killed osf members in the past captain it'll take a few minutes for the rest of the teams to arrive this may be rough for rookies but hold out [Music] i guess we've got no choice panavi let's go all right i'm ready this thing does look pretty tough oh look up there there's some material hanging down youtube use your cytokinesis to put it down on its head okay got it [Music] okay here we go [Music] [Music] hmm so if you lose my power you can turn it into a big fireball [Music] don't get worked up because it's a major hug keep your eyes open you especially you know your power lets you use the things around you don't focus only on the enemy in front of you yes sir [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] come on [Music] did we do it are you okay all of you stay back or you'll get hurt hmm uh so the hero of this fight is of course private huetos sumaragi who took down a major other on his first assignment congratulations private super aggie let's hear from him thanks how do you feel uh i'm glad we were able to defeat the other your first victory on your first deployment was it satisfying um i can't answer you very well myself please ask the commander september on seventh class captain seto narukami how did private sumo aggie do both yuito and hanabi fought very well the fact that private sumoragi was put under your command captain must mean that the top brass thinks highly of you that's something you'll have to ask my superiors about we're pulling out the mission doesn't end until we get to suo keep your eyes open understood no sign of the crows looks like they got their sights on yuito this year what do you mean this year every year the crows latch onto whoever stands out among the rookies he or she becomes their new star it's gonna be rough here on out what oh man that just means you'll be in the limelight you may get tons of interview requests maybe they'll put them on the pr magazine like are she could be they don't know when to quit you ito i know it'll be a pain but don't answer directly just evade any questions yeah i'll do my best here they come [Music] ah looks like sagumi found the crows okay we'll keep this short that's the end of this assignment from now on our orders will be sent directly from above [Music] you can't refuse a deployment order go to the designated place at the designated time and carry out your mission you can take on suppression assignments and training at your leisure but don't slack off too much crows they'll be here soon we're jamming them but it's just a matter of time if you have any further questions ask water okay back to suo captain can i be excused here i want to make a stop do you have to do it right now wouldn't you like to know yeah yeah fine do whatever you want love you captain [Music] i didn't just say that for the press you two really did a great job um [Music] god [Music] oh sato the pampered sumeragi kid what's with the attitude wait naomi oh nagi and yuito naomi and kasane hi good job today [Music] gyoka are you training rookies too yes we got a bunch of cuties again this year so i have to do my best my guys are doing well hey casane was it how was training i think i did as well as i could good hasani wait what is it naomi oh um are you all right huh oh i'm fine i just saw you on himuka tv you looked way too composed to be a rookie i was very impressed thank you kyoko platoon everyone except team leaders is dismissed team leaders come with me to headquarters same for us team leaders to headquarters uh cassani what um have we met somewhere before we fought an other together did you forget oh no not that uh so you have a sister you mean naomi did you get hit in the head you're weird but your power was pretty good good luck oh thanks hey yuito so you're friends with the randall sisters if that seemed friendly to you then you're weird as well really i'm heading back to headquarters keep chatting to a minimum outside crows are after you i'll go back to headquarters with you naomi gave you a compliment that's nice yuito that was just because she happened to see me do something good because it was pretty harsh though i'm still jealous fight just gotten there a little earlier god [Music] um so hmm liberties you can't just say you're taking a detour and go straight home by yourself her girl is always like that you're very serious no you're the serious one [Music] [Music] hey it's major general karen travers keep your voice down you idiot private yuuito sumeragi i heard you were getting chased around by the crows yes sir they're just like mosquitoes in the winter powerless but annoying so use them instead it's easier to climb the ranks with some notoriety you'll also learn a thing or two under setto's leadership anyway keep at it i expect big things from you lucky you major general karen apparently has had an eye on your talent since you were still a cadet what really yes a septetrian first class thinks you're promising don't let him down major general current's faith in me it doesn't seem to be because of my brother he doesn't seem the type oh crap i can't stop myself from smiling anyway could you go report to water i'm going to go check on kaguro oh why it seems like he stayed behind in kikuchiba and i'm a little concerned oh yes and nagi you entered a prohibited area back there write and submit an incident report immediately oh wow a septetrion like kara knows you he must really see something in you it's so amazing that you managed to get his attention yeah but i'm a volunteer soldier you're finally here i got so tired of waiting for you that i dragged myself out hurry up and give me your mission report to put on record i want to get this over with so i can go play some games it's a distress signal we have to go i'm coming too you were told to write up an incident report nagi but yuito is going hanabi please go see water for me and could you help nagi write his report i'll head over to mizuhagawa what uito be careful it must be bad if arashi is asking for help you're backing me up i'm counting on you [Music] be careful yuito yeah sorry about everything like nagi seriously make it back in one piece all right [Music] [Music] god [Music] do [Music] i sent you the location data for the distress signal confirmed understood i'll be able to make the mission easier here we go looks like there's a resource nearby hey what's it like there the extinction belt advanced while the city was being constructed a lot of others came down and it became a dangerous area there are no plans to restart construction it's a forgotten ghost town [Music] looks like the enemy dropped something rare now done all right [Music] [Music] here we go all right let's go i hit the outer shell i think i can break it if i focus my attacks successfully here we go [Applause] come on all right that was close i can still fight [Music] time [Music] [Music] [Music] this is pretty rare [Music] hi there new guy right on time as you can see i'm in the middle of something do you think you could help me out of course at your service you don't need to be so formal agent rink don't mean much here oh okay i would like to help as well good answer gemma connect ueto to the sas [Music] affirmative orishi can you use your hyper velocity to get behind the target do i get hazard pay that's something you should take up with major general oh fabuki i'll help you two handle the front while i take the back damn it's the crows i'm gonna give it my all that's it what's with that drone it totally gave us a way to the others it happens the crows have a right to use their drones to broadcast but i know how you feel all right you guys promised to back up my story later okay what for real hershey you're going to be reprimanded so get your story straight and back me up yuito your power is psychokinesis right use their remnants as you see fit you can drop any crows that show up after too okay don't say i didn't warn you thanks aurashi but you're the one who knocked it down hey i just answered those requests what i should charge [Music] come on now i can take it easy here we go here's this give it everything you have here we go all done oh that was way too much work i don't feel like doing anything now what are we gonna do about destroying the crow's drones intentionally interfering with their reporting is against military regulation we accidentally mistook it for an other and destroyed it it happens got it yes it was an unfortunate accident though i'm not sure how i feel about this hey don't worry about it you showed promise all right we'll leave it at that we did what we had to now let's get back to suo yes hey gamma what your leg you look like you're limping did you get hurt oh you're right this isn't good running into more others now would be bad news i'm fine if you're limping you must be in pain we should at least do some first aid no it's dangerous out here we need to move i know a place my family has a unit around here we use as an emergency shelter when we travel to ceyron we should be able to treat you safely there that's great show us the way copy that i'll send you the coordinates now okay you're right that is close gemma you just have to tough it out until we get there i'm fine stop it i know you and you're always pushing yourself too hard [Music] [Music] so this is the sumaragi family evacuation unit it's a lot fancier than your standard unit you think so i know we should tell seto about this place and make it a safe house for seto platoon it's like a little hideout it feels perfect what's a safe house it's like an evacuation site each team has that's separate from headquarters osf refers to them as hideouts they come in handy when we're faced with casualties like today oh that's right gamma let me see your leg [Music] you're not fine at all look at all the blood stop trying to tough everything out i wasn't doing it intentionally i just couldn't feel the pain because of all the adrenaline yeah yeah anyway yuito you looked comfortable with medical treatments i'm impressed i had health problems as a kid so i have a lot of experience taking care of my own injuries i see i'm sure your parents were pretty busy yeah you know who my father is and my mother was killed by another when i was five we had a mate at home but i just got used to doing everything on my own it's good to be independent oh not sure that's very convincing coming from me yeah you could learn to do a few more things on your own so major general fabuki won't have to worry so much [Music] major general fubuki what does he have to do with arushi i thought it was common knowledge kabuki and i are siblings what you're the major general's younger sister the other way around you can't judge anyone in the osf by our appearance i'm fabuki's older sister or she has the potential to rival even the septetrions if she stops slacking off how rude gemma i just hate wasting my energy what do you say we rest here even if we go back to suo all that's waiting for us there is paperwork and nosy crow news interviews hello everyone um aren't you the daughter of the ichijo osf hospital chairman captain irishy spring call me arishi please every year you newbies have the same reaction i'm sorry um nice to meet you i'm hinabi ichijo the hospital is run by my uncle who's the head of the family so we aren't directly involved i see well i suppose it's best if both of us avoid connections to hospitals and pharmaceuticals hanabi did you bring it yes i brought medication and emergency rations were the supplies here in this unit that old a lot of them were past their expiration date i mean my dad hasn't been to ceyron in a long time so i guess it's understandable oh don't worry gamma the medication and bandages i used on you weren't expired [Music] thanks again for your help you two seem close did you know each other before joining the osf we're childhood friends not surprising the ichijo and tsumuragi families would be acquainted well you've come all this way why don't you stay and make yourself comfortable yes sounds like arya she calls the shots [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] our she looks so different from the way they present her on tv she's always lazy when she's not on camera so a lot of people call her lazy aura lazy aura that suits her perfectly [Music] [Music] a message from kasane i should check it right away a call from kasane maybe i can ask her a little bit about the person who saved me sorry to keep you waiting so what is it i'm glad you get straight to the point i was getting tired of people who forced small talk thanks i figured is there anyone you like what why is she asking me that does she what's your type what are your plans for your future are you interested in taking over randall industries wait hold on why are you asking me that i'm running a background check is that why you called me here not just that captain seto seems to have dropped his fountain pen around here somewhere i wanted to talk to you anyway so i thought i'd ask you what you knew about it his fountain pen now that you mention it i guess captain seto did have a nice one how come you're looking for it so even you like to ask too many questions what that's a perfectly normal question to ask don't look at me like that we can talk while we look for the pen [Music] here we go i guess i'm getting better [Applause] looks like the enemy dropped something rare thanksandi here we go this is pretty rare hey i bet captain sucho would be happy if we found the valkman conversation is non-existent but i have to ask her about the person who saved me uh looks like there's a resource nearby that was close i guess you're not as useless in battle as i thought oh man she's really harsh hey i have something i want to ask you too is that all right what when i was little i was attacked by another and almost died but then someone from the osf saved me and she looked just like you so i was wondering if you knew anything about it we're about the same age when you were a child i would have been one too no i mean maybe you have a much older sister shh quiet an enemy get ready to fight okay let's do it together everything all right let's keep this up ah looks like we won huh isn't that captain seto's fountain pen behind you this is it thanks you are a big help anyway back to what you were saying about the osf person who saved me did you check the osf registry of course but i didn't find her i thought maybe she was discharged oh right the person who saved me had the exact same hair clip as that one can you tell me where you bought yours that's not possible my sister made this for me what really hmm your power is psychokinesis too do you think you might be having realistic dreams dreams hmm i can't really say for sure i was a kid at the time and my memory is a bit hazy i've always had strange dreams oddly realistic dreams a woman muttered something about red strings and then red threads and circle me like a cocoon i thought my dreams were real when i was a child it was confusing i thought that since you also have psychokinesis maybe you had realistic dreams too no i'm sure it wasn't a dream it has to be real that person gave me this ear cuff i see then i don't think i can help you any further oh no i uh i'm sorry that was a weird thing to bring up it's fine well we found the fountain pen so i guess i'll head back right thank you that was a good background check oh right i completely forgot that was a thing uh why me all right goodbye i'll head back too [Music] [Music] i heard you took down another major other oh man i wish i could have fought with you it wasn't broadcast this time weren't the crows there no a lot was going on yuito want to talk i mean we're on the same team now okay but what do you want to talk about we've known each other since we were kids you pretty much know everything about me uh you know we didn't see much of each other since joining up i thought we could catch up catch up i guess we haven't had the time to really sit down and talk right why don't we go take a walk out of the city okay let's go i haven't been on a relaxing walk like this in a while me neither i've been on missions constantly since being assigned we need to take time for ourselves like this now and then so what were you doing between the time you were scouted and the time you joined well during my time at the academy i studied trained my power and hung out with friends me too i guess there's not too much difference between the scouted and volunteer soldiers yeah we were both headed to the same place in the end what about everything else how are your parents they're both doing great just the other day they kept messaging me while they were on a date for their wedding anniversary they're so carefree i'm glad to hear they haven't changed i found myself ignoring their calls for a while it feels nice to talk like this again it's only been two years but it feels like we haven't seen each other for much longer yeah it really does are you okay it's nothing anyway can i ask you something sure what's up so um what do you think about kasane huh why are you suddenly bringing up kasane well you know we're catching up i wanted to ask you something that must be on your mind and it seems like you've been thinking about kasane a lot it did well i guess i've been curious about her what do you mean by that i don't know how to put it i can't get kasana's face out of my mind you can't no her face looks exactly like the person who saved me when i was a kid i'll never forget that face so when i met someone who had the same face i started to wonder if they were somehow related oh so it's just because she looks like the person who saved your life yeah that's right the reason why i even volunteered for the osf is because i wanted to be like the person who saved my life she's the ideal image of what the osf should be that wasn't exactly the direction i was going for but i guess that's fine then what did you want to know i'll try to answer it's okay it's not a big deal you know you're really amazing you've had this goal since you were a child and you've been working towards it all your life no i'm not amazing at all you're way more amazing because you were actually scouted that's not true being scouted meant that i had no choice but to enlist you didn't want to join the osf it's not that but i never thought about what i wanted to do in the osf that's so like you you're more comfortable taking action than you are thinking hey that seems like a roundabout way of calling me stupid what no i didn't mean it like that at all you just put more stock into being proactive wait ah that's not much better i'm just joking i know what you mean ready to head back to the hideout yeah thanks for inviting me out i'm really glad we got to talk like this again i had fun too um do you want to talk again like this sometime that sounds good let's do it okay it's a promise don't forget i won't you better not forget either i definitely won't well let's head back to the hideout she hasn't changed she's so cheerful and energetic i feel [Music] recharged you haven't changed at all really really i mean you're still into bucky but i'm a bit happy that you haven't changed just staying being you [Music] i want to get to know you better you know oh like fighting habits i guess that would be important if we're fighting together [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh do i'm tired maybe i should rest a bit huh when did i get to sumaragi tomb yuito kaguro said the running military exercise is in the training area we should join them okay i'll be right there what am i doing here crap do i sleepwalk i'll talk to kaito about it later i'm still out of it the training facility should be an osf headquarters [Music] when did i come to sumaragi too it's creepy that i don't remember [Music] hmm god [Music] oh yuito great we're all here now time for some three-man field exercises the rules are simple there will be a single flag placed on the field the team who grabs it and reaches the goal first wins and you'll be happy to know that your beloved kaguro has saved up his hard-earned allowance to provide the winning team with a luxurious prize whoa all right how are we dividing up the teams a lottery system courtesy of me and implemented by sugumi we all draw strings and team up by color let's draw already looks like we have our teams let's do this you two naomi and i are in different teams yes nagi gamma you'll regret it if naomi gets so much as a scratch got it don't worry my power is specialized for defense sagumi let's do our best okay i guess we're on the same team let's see if you're as good as the crows think you are [Music] what's with him okay as i'm sure you know i'm shiden from the scouted class i have the same electrokinesis power as captain sedo you better not slow me down i'll do my best okay let's get started i'm sure everyone is fine with me being the team leader objection what are you suggesting that an adult like you should be our leader lookie here sheedan you're just not really cut out to be a leader hey are you trying to make a fool of me see that's what i'm talking about i think someone more calm like yuito should be in charge what me i mean i don't mind the responsibility relax you don't have to be so stiff with us welcome aboard mr leader spoiled sumeragi brat i suppose he's used to giving orders what's that supposed to mean what's the matter sheed in you jealous of yuito or something this this is beneath me oh that's right didn't you put in a request to join seto platoon this year what your hero captain seto didn't choose you oh that's so sad shut up let's just get started already anyway let's play nice out there okay baki always says that where there's smiles there's happiness bucky huh that's great you hear that sheedan don't forget to smile enough talking let's go already okay let's look for this flag but don't let your guard down [Music] so hmm [Music] [Music] oh it's time for my power you ito i need your help i can hit it come on i mean i know they're just training visions but the others here are always so realistic it's not just the others everything here is a simulation is my body real [Music] you need my towel so be careful that enemy is done that attack worked it must be a weak spot no way here we go so you need help leave it to me nice job thanks cairo let's go don't get cocky leave it to me nice job good i think there's something over there hey there's the flag we can't get through though let's look for another way i'm using this all right don't get caught now die it's over come on huh thanks i'll take it [Music] i'm using this sheet leave it to me lose your power i need your help exterminate the surrounding enemies [Music] here we go [Music] the enemy is now's your chance finish it off yes it was just too many that was close looks like there's a resource nearby hey that's the goal area were you going to leave without recovering the flag what's up you need help leave it to me here we go nice job let's go let's keep this up okay i got the flag now we just have to head to the goal stop dictating every little move just get going oh scary you're yapping like a chihuahua still get cocky i can hit it something rare here we go yeah come on i can still fight are you sure this is the way you tell as the leader you should have the topography memorized just shut up and come over here young man come on guys this should be the way so let's keep going let me use your power hey here we go leave it to me nice job you're a genius now die come on i can hit it so be careful leave it to me let me use your power there's still more uh nice job finish it off all right looks like it lost us so you need help come on i can hit it here we go [Music] thanks i'll take it so trivial what is your power status is low and you fight like an amateur why would captain seto or even major general carren take an interest in someone like you whoa there sheden did you ever stop to think that maybe this is why you weren't chosen to be the leader shut up it's not that i want to be the leader i just don't want to follow orders from someone inferior to me are you sure you're not the one who's inferior shut up you adult yuito keep your eyes open up ahead if i were the leader i would be waiting in a blind spot near the finish line what do you mean in other words instead of looking around for the flag it would be more efficient to steal the flag right near the finish line oh i see but this is just an exercise hold up we got company it's kasane's team i knew it that is so like kasane let's ambush them sorry but i've got my hands full here take care of castaneda team leader same here i can't help you're the team leader so figure it out [Music] that was close [Music] at this rate that was close [Music] come on [Music] this how's that that was close i can't give up whoa kasani is a straight badass she's good hard to imagine she's a fresh scout you really are amazing kasane damn it we underestimated them hey it's just as they say cassani randall isn't messing around good one kasane i can't take all the credit tsugumi and hanabi did a lot of the heavy lifting your team may have had some coordination issues but i think your individual skill is still very noteworthy thanks i wasn't trying to give you a compliment oh okay you're strange did i say something funny i think kasana is the strange one here a message from dad congratulations on officially making it into osf kaito's filled me in i'm still against you joining osf but just promise me you'll be careful you're your own man now that you're a member of osf i think it's finally time we sat down and talked about our family and your mother we should invite kaito and have dinner together sometime i'll contact you once i know my schedule what is it i got a message from my father he never sends messages oh hmm well i guess it's time to call it a day thanks to everyone who participated [Music] you're acting strange kagura hmm what do you mean don't you hate training exercises well i thought it would be a good opportunity to show off to the newbies there's some real cuties this year and you cheated drawing strings shh i just wanted to team up with the new guy and see what he's got i must have gone to sumaragi tomb at some point before training i should go there again maybe i'll remember something god [Music] so huh uh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] me do [Music] god oh oh god [Music] so why did i end up here i don't remember how i got here at all i really should talk to kaito about it yumito deployment orders we confirmed a large pack of others in an abandoned subway head over there right away okay got it and gnocchi he's already on his way thanks i'll be right on his heels it looks like colin kaito is going to have to wait [Music] platoon is all here you've all heard the situation from water apparently there's a swarm of others in these abandoned subway lines the extinction belt has descended to lower altitudes and they're flowing underground from the air ducts sure there's no need to explain it at this point but we have some new blood here so let's see what you know about the extinction belt what's the extinction belt nagi yes sir it's an anomaly that's believed to be the product of the spring of extinction exactly it accumulated near the earth's stratosphere and has covered the whole globe others are born inside it and have been observed descending to the earth's surface so don't go near areas where the belt is thick the others could appear anywhere the extinction belt also has the tendency to block signals if that happens watcher's telepathy will be our only means of communication without a communicator my telepathy only allows me to talk to you and not the other way around let's hope the communicators don't go down so that's the deal i want you to stay on your toes out there understood this will be a joint operation between the seventh and eighth company from the first regiment and the first and second company from the second regiment it's a large-scale joint operation i want you all to refrain from going off on your own especially you kaguro what you're really going to call me out in front of everyone captain don't get so upset team one will be me nagi and hanabi team two will be kaguro tsugumi and yuito seto platoon will head to point alpha behind second company so this is the first time we've worked together i'm looking forward to it okay [Music] [Music] do let's go [Music] i think there's something over there looks like there's a resource nearby [Music] [Music] we need your help [Music] come on here we go here i go [Music] [Music] watch out you always get all the good enemies you tell but i'm going to get a piece this time sure i'm looking forward to it let's do our best looks like the enemy dropped something rare all right i'm going to get stronger here we go it off here we go he's closed here we go must be a weak spot right let's keep this up finish it off so this is the subway so it's basically an abandoned line there are some places with active subway lines though [Music] this is pretty rare [Music] i need your help all in so this is brain drive feels like all the nerves inside my body are standing on it i can hit it there's a train huh notice me doing what you know i need your help let's go nice job [Music] now die step it don't get caught not bad i need to support the injured here we go i need your help all right i need your help here we go the attack worked that must be a weak fight finish it off here we go [Applause] looks like there's a resource nearby [Music] captain does the extinction belt usually come down lower than the stratosphere no it's usually higher it's pretty rare for it to be this low let's be ready watch out for electric attacks you won't be able to move nice job here we go [Music] everything in the subway looks the same try not to get turned around you can't see it but the other is still around use sas to find it leave it to me [Music] brain drive is basically just really intense focus right apparently bias has a function to adjust the stimulation to the brain allowing for easier control of brain drive but i don't think relying on it is good you need to control your power by [Music] yourself huh let's get serious [Applause] here we go [Music] don't get caught i think we can use that just ram the others when they're not looking watch out in front charging stronger [Music] like this let's go keep going come on finish it off here we go i need your help all right [Music] reinforcement requests from kyoko platoon's operator haruka they're being attacked at point alpha it appears they're cut off we're unable to contact them let's go i can hit it now this is pretty rare someone's coming this way captain seto naomi we got a request for reinforcements from haruka what happened others have descended on point alpha the additional units scheduled to arrive were nowhere to be seen so acting commander gemma ordered me to request reinforcements from sedo platoon three others attacking from 12 o'clock we'll arrive in one minute the enemy will flank us with hyper velocity and attack from behind what what do you mean my power is precognition it's true captain the others are gathering at point alpha and three are closing in on saturn platoon's current position wow naomi connect to sas with me team it's time to clean up these others take them down while we make our way to point alpha [Music] so your power that you see in the future can you choose when to look yes leave a weak spot i need your help hey here we go that must don't get caught all right looks like it lost us [Music] thanks cairo so it's no big deal here we go now die come on huh what [Music] [Music] [Music] yes hmm [Music] what [Music] the interference from the extinction at this get those communicators back up is there anyone else point alpha survivors captain the ceiling is starting to crack damn it evasive maneuvers kyoko platoon disperse they're coming from above get out of there watch out get out of the way look out thank you you saved me is everyone all right gimma garrison and tsugumi nazar reporting in there are two more nearby yuito you alive where are you right now next to the rubble i'm with naomi let me reboot the gps what's wrong doggy others are attacking from all around us naomi this is bad there are too many others we have to hurry i'll clear the rubble there are too many i'll help naomi naomi are you okay i'm okay i just hurt my leg a little i'm gonna kill it hey calm down i will once i kill it you handle things over there fine tsukumi understood i hope kasana is okay i think hannah is with captain hook i'm worried about what happened to kagura [Music] you're right let's take care of these guys first [Music] good the attack worked that must be a weak spot keep this up here we go come on [Music] thanks man naomi i'm okay i'm heading to now naomi what's up what is naomi what's wrong they help me naomi [Music] oh anyone that can move lend a hand [Music] i'll fight two once you decide to fight don't lose focus a second's hesitation can be dead got it a weak spot there's no other way [Music] [Music] oh hmm how is naomi another what happened can't you hear us anymore [Music] at this rate i can still fight time to use this i need to support the injury [Music] where are you here we go i'm sorry naomi naomi please oh okay no problem where are you [Music] dammit that was close oh stop what are you doing this other is naomi naomi a transfer power you need strong abilities to move something that size [Music] wait where did you sit naomi hey kasane wait damn it the rubble what is this an ampule it has seyron's emblem on it what was that naomi she's she's nagi calm down how am i supposed to calm down what the hell is that look i don't know either [Music] i don't know what's going on but we have to do something sorry i know now's not the time to panic but what do we do the person with the most experience here is no this is beyond what i can handle look at what happened when kyoka put me in charge of the platoon okay then let's do this i'll go after kasane nagi go report to the frontline command and tell them what happened no i'll go with you [Music] not with that leg you're not sugumi you go with nagi it seems like we can't get a hold of command because of the signal interference okay be careful you too gamma if you were put in charge of kyogre platoon that means kasane is your subordinate right i need you to come with me as her acting commander you're right copy that [Music] [Music] uh hold on major general fabuki i'm glad you're both okay i ran into nagi and tsugumi and i came after you as soon as i heard heard what about naomi i'll tell you what i told them you're not to repeat what happened to anyone what do you mean i mean just that don't tell anyone about it it will serve to protect all of you also did you happen to pick up anything like an ampule on your way here oh yes would you mind handing that over to me what is that ampule or is that classified too to put it simply this ampoule is a power enhancer it boosts the psionic hormones we know that it's developed in sayron however this is classified osf information i can't tell you any more than that so many secrets yes unfortunately whenever people gather together there are always ulterior motives it's best to stay away from these sticky spider webs that's why i'm warning you anyway you two come with me we'll find somewhere safe no kassane is up ahead she went after naomi would it be okay if i continued looking for her i'm worried fine if you see her make sure to tell her not to share what happened to anyone either don't do anything reckless i'll send some reinforcements soon and since there's a chance we'll have to withdraw from the front lines you should fall back to your hideout if you meet up with them it'll be a lot safer to head back to suo from there in any case be careful [Music] he said we should be quiet about what happened today to protect ourselves major general fubuki was so calm how can he be when naomi turned into another yeah something's not right you
