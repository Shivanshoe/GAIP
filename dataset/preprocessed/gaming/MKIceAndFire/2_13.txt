gonna kill me [Music] [Music] at certain times throughout the night opportunities will present themselves giving you the chance to take matters into your own hands [Music] it is worth noting that they are only suggestions you don't have to act upon them in fact sometimes it's better not to max why didn't you tell me [Music] thanks hon yeah do you need a hand yeah actually if you could just shine a light right here there you go perfect thank you the sooner we get out of here the better just picture yourself curling up in front of a big old fire pit singing campfire sing-alongs i don't think

we're just a little shaken up [Music] well you folks want to tell me what happened here [Music] package quarry is full of twists and turns unknown paths and unexplored wonders with each step taken you tread a path of your own matched with its very own consequences there will be moments throughout your stay that show you that the choices you've made the path you've chosen could have gone another way at hackett's quarry there's no such thing as the wrong way but be warned some paths are more dangerous than others yeah um we um uh something jumped out right in front of the car and we didn't want to hit it so we swerved and now here we are something jumped out [Music] i'm sorry it was so dark and it happened so fast and they were gone they ma'am did you hit someone no no god no of course not you

completely lost you're not gonna make it to heck it's quarry not tonight harbinger motel it's the nearest place you can bunk up there for the night okay uh i think we're just gonna stick to the plan sir i mean mr hackett knows we're coming and we called ahead no ma'am you're gonna head to the harbinger motel do you understand with all due respect sir why can't we go to hack it's quarry because i told you to go to the motel okay i just don't understand what the problem i am please step out of the vehicle officer she didn't do anything ma'am if you wouldn't mind stepping out of the vehicle i

out can we just look around before we jump to conclusions did you actually even talk to mr hackett or did you just leave a message what's the difference this this is the difference hello i guess he doesn't check his voicemail how was i supposed to know that i mean clearly there's somebody here yeah or it's just an abandoned car and this is a complete why would there be an abandon i'll get the

apocalypse i mean you never know the universe has a kind of way of uh working these things out the universe yeah like the the cosmic space gods space gods you heard me okay spell it nothing a spell you know we're cool oh so cool we are super cool so she dumped dress huh hi emma hey okay this is um you've heard of spatial awareness before right spatial awareness is for nerds uh be alive and grab the last couple of bags boy yes boss say hi to emma for me you're a bad person yes i am hey what are you uh what do you listen to before good to know jesus christ hi hey are you guys going to help with the bags or what oh um you know i was actually just working on fixing uh the door it's broken dylan please i can't it's it's i got to get the last bags and they're coming with this thing it's just feeling sleek sorry bro cool thanks guys oh skill ugh horror i hate horror okay really dude locking me out okay in my defense a it was dylan's idea and two it was really funny oh yeah right is that is that right i don't write the rules man okay whatever look you can help me with the bags or what no i got to stay here and wait for mr h to return our cell phone sorry jesus christ okay and why are the stairs blocked well apparently it's to keep raccoons and other pesky violence from ransacking the place mr h's words are not mine oh boring is that you dylan i can only deal with one at a time jacob this place needs a serious overhaul oh jesus hmm all right got the bags great all by yourself huh yep i guess you have to get used to that oh my god you are so mean at least i'm honest oh okay here we go okay you're not telling me the whole truth about you and emma are you son oh okay so now i'm the one who's not telling the whole story huh oh well this is the bait i just gotta take jake oh sorry i just got so distracted about that rhyme i forgot what we were oh no no uh you were telling me how you totally have the thing for ryan wait are we talking about ryan the sailing instructor with the sexy brooding loner thing that totally doesn't do anything for me at all ah sexy huh how does that camp by far okay sure look it was all settled by the girls in bunk seven like second day of camp it goes ryan me of course then dylan emma abby okay nick and then mr h okay are you almost finished please yep that's it that's everyone so she really just dumped her ass huh i don't okay her whole thing is like how are we gonna make this work different schools blah blah blah my whole thing is like you know maybe long distance blah blah blah blah blah and she was just like jacob she gave you the look huh yeah do not pass go man just got you wrapped all the way around that dainty little finger of hers how does she do it okay okay you know what maybe you're right maybe she does have like this super power over me but you know what maybe i like it oh licks it check totally not in denial check okay wow the um the fumes of of jealousy are just stifling over here excuse me i'm just saying i guess some girls don't have what it takes to hang with the big dog you're a real charmer you know that look i'm just saying i don't know why you didn't make a move on ryan you should have seized the moment well kansas a moment that ever happened yeah well you can't wait for it to come to you you got to make the moment happen yourself oh right chase the moment around all summer like a dog with two dicks until it dumps you on the last day of camp okay not going to miss it okay so are we sure that this old rust bucket's roadworthy we'll take a look it better be one more night in the great outdoors might actually kill me hey it doesn't kill you will make you stronger well i haven't killed you yet and you're still pretty pathetic hey shut up uh okay so um total hypothetical but if i was like a huge and i wanted to break down the van so we'd have to spend another night here uh what exactly would i need to do well you'd probably break the fuel line or i don't know rip out the rotor arm and yes that would make you a total okay and what does a rotor arm look like again it's like a arm that's all rotary you know it's under the little black dome with the leads poking out jake you do realize that even if we somehow did get stuck out here one more night with emma wouldn't make a difference trust me chicks made up our mind yeah sure i guess we'll just have to find out wow this looks important i will hook you right back up tomorrow okay thank you promise [Music] up here my dudes why did they look like they're up to something hey jacob what no dude please don't dumb oh dick oh there it is oh man good side freak oh oh oh i wish i had some singles freaks i'm surrounded by freaks oh thank god i'm gonna get the whole new technology thing but take me back world you would have thought mr h could have like charged up our phones like a little bit nothing's ever your fault is it you know you should really just save it for emergencies only unless of course is being dumped an emergency oh ben back off i'm sorry i peace and love man i i didn't mean to hurt your feelings you all ready to bounce where's everybody else why why would i know that sometimes you know stuff i don't look i don't i don't even know how to respond to that you say nick you're way smarter than me and you're a super hot star who gets any cheeky ones okay yeah keep dreaming junior hey there party bear status report we are officially empty nesters high five up top oh boy you're about to get your phone back aren't you let's go collect our bags and away from this mosquito infested backwoods dump door is locked bags inside  me yep what it's obvious what we have to do here find someone with a key shape our destiny then by shape our destiny i mean shape our way through this crappy lock and grab our bags okay let's do it we better not get in trouble i won't tell if you won't tell mr hackett's gonna find out so what he'll just think it was a bear or something have you ever seen a bear in these woods no but that doesn't mean they're not out there fair point all right let's do this on three one two three uh all about the power of positive thinking why do i ever listen to you because i'm always right are you sure they're gonna think it was a bear oh my god relax it's not like we killed someone all right well i'm just gonna take another look around make sure we didn't miss anything go nuts oh this was little izzy's i want to play a game yeah you can probably just stay here you creepy little thing why would this place be in the news can't believe i'm actually gonna miss all those lumpy loose springs ugh it's gonna be weird not waking up to dylan's morning announcements um hey you stopped that dylan is not gonna be happy i'll tell chris about it when we see him everyone likes a scavenger hunt and at hackett's quarry that's no different there are secrets in these woods fun secrets that should you uncover them could help protect you from criminal prosecution after all the stories you'll take with you are only stories without the proof to back them up so it's time to dive into the mystery take pictures or find pieces of evidence and you may just prove your innocence ouch so jacob hasn't seen ew what this that is it dylan's i don't think anyone knocked caitlyn out of first place all summer ready to roll let's do it finally time to let loose and vamos this caboose how are you so dramatic annoying confident it's just acting that's what people want so you're faking it and in a way faking it is just being yourself but louder you should try it sometime you never know who you might impress no it's too late now anyway for what you nick you never know unless you put yourself out there [Music] oh wow oh nice steering tech jinkies okay so hypothetically if i were to put myself out there what if he ends up being a dud kind of like you and jacob it's actually really sweet that much you couldn't summer fling we're going to school like four states away he gets it yeah sure but that's us you and nick could be different when do you get his handle hit him up oh i already have his email it was in the packet that they gave to us on the first day email are you 93. what's wrong with email i'm really gonna miss you abby oh hold up oh but the lodge is that way go right here why come on scenic route one last victory lap around the camp yes sure what's the victory two months no technology i kind of thought it was nice to be offline ugh i didn't plus my subs need me oh how'd they even get by for two months without you i will have you know that i have a very loyal and engaged subscriber base i provide very important and educational lifestyle advice in the form of entertaining and hilarious video monologues they rely on me oh totally you're a big deal uh yeah i mean i'm sure they're gonna be like really heavier back my favorite spot the fire pit the island mad secluded right is is that smoke should we tell someone um it looks pretty contained it's probably just mr age burning some stuff before you know he closes camp for the summer yeah speaking of which we should we should probably yeah get back oh yeah worried nick's you know we're gonna leave without you well no they're probably like all waiting for us everyone's waiting for us everyone yeah nick waiting for you all everyone don't worry jacob i got you i got a full tank of gas so oh

love them well i saw a wheelbarrow out front so we can load up all our booty in there uh i'm sorry what booty oh it means like um like treasure or buds no before that wheelbarrow uh yeah um okay uh it's like um it's like a barrel with wheels you can put stuff in it and just wheel it around oh i see ladies first which way [Music] [Music] all right the inner sanctum it's just an office this is where the magic happens okay yeah let's just make this quick sure just give me a sec to get this going and engage podcasts yeah all right uh what's it called the one that you're listening to right now uh bizarre yet bonafide so like ghosts and stuff it's like um yeah like the the weird and the wonderful digging up weird mysteries and discussing if they're well bona fide banner fad get it your wood knows no bounds so should we check out what mr h keeps in his private den of sin uh i don't know man i feel a little weird going through his stuff okay well i don't i mean come on what kind of dirty secrets is the owner of a summer camp full of impressionable young children gonna have anyway not mr h i know he's cool it's always been cool to me kaylee and kayla packett weird kids huh i like them yeah me too um they are pretty reclusive you have to admit whoa look at this old thing hey give me your number i want to try it out why oh no reason i just thought it'd be nice for somebody to call you for a change good burn thank you i thought it was pretty good hello what who is it hello it's weird i thought i thought i heard someone maybe we should stop touching stuff fine well hello what is this [Music] you hear that is that a trap door i knew that there was a secret sex dungeon around here somewhere oh yeah yeah i bet you mr h is into some real kinky i doubt it weren't there a couple counselors who never showed up uh-huh why secret sex dungeon it's not funny it probably just goes to the basement or something open it up all right well it looks like a pit of eternal darkness so you're being dramatic climb down take a look look you can squeeze through there you opened it you climbed down what's down there oh my god ryan you will not believe this what what what it's nothing oh i had you go in there for a second didn't i no maybe just shut up [Music] it is uh pretty spooky down here though and it smells very unnatural so yeah okay i'm coming back up oh that's a nice chair i could get used to this you better hope mr h doesn't catch you taking his baby out for a joyride oh sorry bud gotta take this one second hello hack it's quarry summer camp what doesn't kill you will make you stronger what can i do for you on this darn tootin doozy of a day is that your impression of mr h uh yeah uh-huh yeah yeah i you're absolutely right he does need to be nicer to dylan and uh what's that you want him to give dylan his phone number that's a little forward but i can see what i can do smooth oh laura kearney and max brindley oh yeah those are the ones that never showed up yeah it's because of these goobers that we had to work extra shifts this summer uh hey what's the gun for uh chris mr h told me it was for um bears bears here yeah yeah he said they don't really come around because he's got the gun to yeah just leave it alone leave it alone dude what if we're out partying tonight out in the woods and we end up in a sort of most dangerous game situation like when people hunt other people yeah yeah well i mean think about it it's camp is over and hunting season has just begun true what what if okay bear with me here what if what's on the menu tonight is us well then i guess we would need to protect ourselves exactly that's why we need the gun for protection yeah not gonna happen what about for fun no okay yeah yeah totally [Music] well we know where the gun is if we need it your call man so got anything going on when you get back home school or uh jerry's out i understood girlfriend uh not exactly boyfriend free agent cool yeah me too are the uh phones uh they could probably use a little while longer ah okay can't you like speed it up at all i can try to encourage them go for it you guys can do it it's not working dudes we're gonna have to wait [Music] yo my guy toss me the keys uh so you can poke around in chris's private area i i'm sorry is that something that only you're allowed to do party harhar come on what's the harm in looking it's you're not a little bit curious i'm not gonna touch anything fine don't let me regret it you can't promise that but nothing but that you're using that wrong oh huh fashion icon [Music] mr h knows what he likes i'm sure he does wow there's yo hey hey maybe we shouldn't [Music] uh brian whoa what the these monitors this is the camp huh is mr h spying on us no no i mean no no he can't be these are just they're all different trails in the woods around camp sure most of the cameras are pointed away from camp so it's not like he's spying on the kids unless they wandered out into the woods you know these are just probably just trail cameras what are trail cameras people set them up to catch weird random okay yeah like what like bigfoot sightings you know that kind of thing so okay i'm going to upgrade mr h from super creepy pervert with a spy cam to you know super crazy conspiracy hunter to be fair bigfoot's not a conspiracy okay fine how about an aspiring cryptozoologist hey maybe he likes the podcast that you listen to sure yeah let's go with that okay but why go through all the trouble of hiding this room through a secret door in the closet uh i mean it's not exactly secret right like it's just hidden by stuff yeah that's what a secret is ryan it's weird it's majorly weird i don't disagree with you but it's it's got to be something juicy in here dylan it's it's none of our business and if you really want to know you can ask him tomorrow sure that won't be an awkward conversation like at all okay yeah maybe i will all right i i'm leaving the secret layer have fun hey you just admitted that it's a secret layer okay these are boring [Music] huh [Music] [Music] well there's some pretty heavy-duty stuff in here yeah maybe let's not touch that yeah there's nothing fun nice full up hey dunza all right cool let's go thank you this would be a lot easier with mr h's chainsaw it's really very pretty out here when there's no kids around they can get kind of obnoxious huh yeah they always seem to listen to you during painting class you've seen my class just walking by the art gavin's all the way out of the way yeah well there's this shortcut that i take that goes by [Music] which way should we go why don't you choose [Music] good choice better sticks this way better sticks like burning or whatever think we've got enough uh not yet so this place was an actual quarry uh yeah apparently some of the caves are in pretty deep it's like a honeycomb under there cool [Music] are you sure this is safe what are you scared no are you no ah it's all right calm down [Music] so so you ever think about what's next like after we die it's heavy man no i mean like the future yeah sometimes all the time it's overwhelming i know what you mean sometimes i just try to like let it happen you know what like whatever happens is what was meant to happen like it's all predetermined fate i wouldn't call it that exactly a predetermined future maybe the direction stays the same but the details change like it changes as you go you're still in control of your own fate yeah i don't know seems a little defeatist no i see this way i can do whatever i want and not feel bad about it within reason guess that is a little freeing in a sociopathic kind of way oh i know where we are yeah up here here hold this this view is just wow oh do me oh sorry i'm i'm just trying to get this down right sorry dumb idea i just want to finish this take your time uh you hear that huh it's probably nothing no listen there's something there [Music] look it's so tiny my god he's so hold on hold on [Music] you're in danger hunted by a creature of indeterminate origin don't breathe you need to stop breathing tricking the beast into taking you for nothing but a corpse and where's the fun and hunting then which is already dead watch the visuals alter or listen to the sound change as the threat approaches when the danger has passed run pick the right moment and run for your life be warned exhaling or running at the wrong time manages to mark you as the creature's quality causing serious consequences um [Music] geez that was close almost just moved me to death i'm sorry i'm sorry oh little piggy at least we gave her a good story to tell her pig husband how do you know it was the mommy pig i got a pretty good look ew i think she was coming on to me oh got yourself a little girlfriend she wasn't that little all right guess we should head back finally get my phone back and it's just a big dumb brick hey caitlin guess what mr h is a voyeuristic creep he has hidden cameras everywhere and a secret room no that's not uh well no backup what his eyes are everywhere he's always watching us knock it off man he he's just got trail cameras set up you know forest surveillance that kind of thing oh you don't think that's weird well he's got a perimeter to check kids should protect he'll probably just to keep track of wildlife guys i have no imagination so uh what's going on here everything ready i did see a weird light in the treehouse across the lake yeah that was pretty spooky maybe it's your girlfriend brian the hack of hack it's corey i told you never to say heck of heck it's corey again what's wrong with saying hack of hack is corey are you done you know i just realized we may never see each other again after tonight you can't have just realized that just trying to set the mood what mood mood the vibe you know speaking of setting the mood i have work to do okay because playlists don't make themselves i mean i guess they do but all right right guy time to get wood yikes wording oh i know what i said abby nick just in time we got wood we've already done that joke it's mostly just kindling oh that's all we need there's already a big pile of logs here we could have gotten more but there was a hog or a boar but nick was very very brave and took one for the team oh my gosh it can't be the hog of hack it's corey what i thought you hated that phrase big jokes take big sacrifices you're so brave oh i just want to shrink you down to little pocket people and put you in my pocket and peep it to where i need a little pick-me-up okay special delivery whoa whoa where the hell did that gun come from dude relax okay it's not even real uh well i mean it's a real gun but it's just for shooting back we found it in the storage room okay fine fine we'll put it down thank you guns are no joke and and we bring you a hand-picked selection of only the finest that hackett's quarry has to offer no freaking way yes freaking way pop pop peanut butter butter pops i didn't even know you could still find these anyway hey cool your jets there cowboy all right these are spoken for dude you can't just shove those in my face and not expect me to want to pop pop pop them in my mouth come on emma please hand me the shotgun what you're gonna shoot me over them no dumbass okay we are going to shoot for them nah dude absolutely not no there is no way i'm leaving you dill weeds alone with a gun come on look the shooting range is like right over there okay it'll be fun okay look you and me old-fashioned shootout first prize peanut butter butter pops all to yourself dude i guess you don't really want them then huh fine you're on yeah boy jacob hand me that gun now i mean nobody's handling any firearms if you're gonna act like a dick about it okay then you can be the ref you need an objective third party okay we're trying to get a party started here jacob okay well the main party's not gonna die just cause you're offering a little side quest come on all right guess we're gonna have ourselves an old-fashioned shootout look there's a clearing we can use as a shooting range back there but if i see either of you around i am turning this car around oh be good okay so just so you know i was an expert marksman third class three years in a row ranked highest in camp each year i'm just letting you know that your goose is cooked nick but if you back down now i might let you just have one little peanut butter butter pop if you're lucky no way you've never even seen me shoot yeah it's because you've never shot before yeah nothing you know of okay i think i would know if you're actually boys i'm gonna have to stop you right there as much as i'm enjoying your charming machismo the moment we step foot on the shooting range we're playing by my rules okay and what i say goes got it okay good now i'm gonna go set up some targets and get more shells do not move a muscle or touch his gun until i'm back all right so is it just me is it kind of hot when she gets all bossy like i'm always hot pencilled okay thank you bye bye so um how's your little one-on-one with abby in the woods fine how was your little one-on-one with emma ah dude it's incredible she's totally still into me really yeah just got to figure out this whole long distance thing is that what she wants which she wants i mean you could ask her [Music] that's funny speaking of let me show you how a real man shoots his gun are you guys seriously still thumping your chest at each other no i think he's got brain damage okay please just give me the gun uh-uh you'll have it when i say you'll have it all right huddle up boys this is how we're gonna do this you're shooting the one on the left nick first then jacob's turn keep your fingers off the trigger till you're ready to shoot you got it aye aye all right two things remember the spread remember the recoil this is a shotgun we're not sharp shooting here the flashlight shows you where you're aiming i'm sorry to have to say there may well be times during your stay at hackett's quarry where you'll have to defend yourself using potentially deadly force when engaging in combat simply aim your weapon and shoot where the flashlight is pointed take note if you're up close and personal with your target you'll do more damage the farther away the larger the spread and injuries may not be fatal there's a time and place for the use of weapons and you may want to consider all your options remember it's not always wise to pull the trigger that's how people get hurt all right nick one point okay we're too far back to do any real damage let's scoot forward a little and uh these guys up okay you're good all right nick this time for real nice shot i'm lucky point to you nick good job nick all right let's see what you got all right you might want to uh avert your eyes nick i don't want to give you any more performance anxiety all right all right just shut up and shoot jacob i thought you're an ultra elite pro marksman yeah with like a rifle okay not with this cannon blaster that is how you get someone shot no it's okay you probably would have missed me anyway hey disqualified for being a dumbass no oh what's that jeggy huh huh peanut butter butter okay i get it i get it blam you thought this was over what whoa pop pop peanut butter butter pops so okay new idea party game come on people we might never see each other after tonight let's make some memories well what do you have in mind how about the ultimate game of secrets and lies truth or dare but dylan's style okay house rules are someone asks you truth or dare then you choose and then you do and there's no ifs ands or buts so like normal truth or dare yes so we can like make people kiss if they choose dare yeah as long as everyone can sense of course cool beans i mean keep it in your pants until it's your turn but well who does get to go first well it's house deals so abigail truth or dare um truth really dodged a bullet huh all right here goes have you ever slept with anyone oh um i hey take it easy man that's too far come on i i'm not finished um have you ever slept with anyone at this camp no nope sorry all right abby it's your turn all right okay um oh abby oh my god just pick someone okay okay um i don't know oh ding ding ding too late my turn ryan truth or dare dare give me what you got okay ryan your dare comes with a choice can't you do that i can do whatever i want and i dare you to kiss either caitlyn or dylan wow i mean i guess both is off the table sorry i don't make the rules i mean you literally just did but okay let's do this caitlyn shall we always happy to please all righty who shall i pick well uh me and jacob haven't got no turn yet good point all right jacob let's see what you're made of oh there there man come on okay i dare you to take a flying leap over that fire pit naked oh dude  yes oh i will jump over this thing i don't care yeah i don't think that's a good idea no jacob wait don't do it stop dude i say vito you're gonna yourself up what look come on man i got this brian come on fine veto you know what  this game all right someone else can go okay fine then i call your turn whatever emma there emma so you have to kiss jacob or oh well then um uh sorry nick this is not there obviously i don't know if that's good i choose nick m seriously guys guys thank you nick he's good you like kissing my girlfriend it was just a guy i'm nobody's girlfriend the it was just a game yeah the it was man jacob grow up well i guess i should probably go after him you should probably go find abby so anybody want to play part cheesy what ah  this welcome back i am as always delighted that you're here so then what more has been found the hanged man to be the hanged man is to surrender and by doing so gain a new perspective so look carefully and consider that sometimes one needs to be strung up in order to let go but these are just words there's more to show you if you'll let me [Music] that's all i have to say for now secrets remain buried and the night grows darker i'll see you again you can count on that be careful where the wolves go [Music] the ravens follow stupid game what are we in middle school why should i even care anybody can kiss anybody stupid stupid great when the hell am i so i took everything ah is that a trail cam yes foreign oh abby you out here nick abby shout again i'm over here i'm coming nick hey hey um hi you are not i think that game just got a little too intense for me hey yeah i know what you mean so all that stuff back there oh my gosh emma really wanted to make jacob jealous huh anything i mean yeah why the heck else would she kiss me like that true i was just playing along yeah it's just a game right right i don't think emma was the mastermind here then who well caitlyn all of them i guess but mostly caitlyn she's sneaky truthful there's a stupid game right i don't know maybe it lets us act how we really feel or it lets us act as props to help jacob and emma hash out whatever they've got going on so then do you have feelings for her no i mean i just meant the whole thing's dumb that's all you remember the second or third day of camp when we were assigned to take our cabins down to the island ropes course together yeah that was when we met um do you remember that camper that a little accident on the course he was so embarrassed i thought his life was over i had to take him to get cleaned up before anyone noticed except you i guess thanks for not telling anyone that wasn't actually the first time we met we met at orientation on the first day we did yes there's like a million people um but honestly you kind of seem like a dick i said hi and you barely acknowledged me  i'm sorry i've seen most counselors make fun of their campers tease them a little jacob does it emma kind of does it too but you don't i've had my moments i'm not proud of some of the stuff i've done that'll be jacob's influence yeah i tend to just fall in love when he's around you're not jacob don't try to be jacob who wants to be jacob girls are into jacob not the cool ones who are the cool ones into then guys who are cool enough to help a camper out of a sticky situation that makes me feel a little better is it a bear it's too fast run [Music] [Music] oh my god [Applause] uh ah uh [Music] wow [Music] it's a fun game ugh uh foreign technique needs work hey uh yeah i miss your family of course sneaking down here was a little more fun when we thought we could get caught huh yeah yeah i guess jacob i thought we agreed that this us was just supposed to be some summer fun yeah no no i know i just you just love having an audience house jacob i mean you do i can't believe you you frenched him you know in front of everyone jesus wept french are we 12.

[Music] that was some mighty fine social disruption there kaitlyn i have to say ah or was it just the nudge that abby needed you're an evil genius who do you think is gonna make the first move nick robbie oh good cue my bet's on either i don't know nick's got the beast in them huh if by beast you mean some sort of mild-mannered baby deer hey don't let that cute preppy aesthetic fool you it's

for your own good what are you off to now girly what the what the uh seems like just a blink and you're back to see me again so then what have we got it's the star [Music] stars stars in the night sky beacons of light dreams of hope purpose or a reminder of our insignificance fear of despair trust in the light of the star with it comes clarity and sometimes proof remember there's always more than meets the eye would you like me to show you [Music] back to it then back to hackett's quarry back to hackett's quarry you go oh the fun you'll have that was horrible it was it was i i don't even know what it was it was so fast and and there was a there was a hunter and he was just oh abby here what oh try drawing trying what can you draw what attacked you nick hey buddy can you tell us what happened i don't know attacked where's happy super out of it man we need to know what happened right there was there was a guy there but there was some kind of some kind of adam what kind of animal does this abby yeah she's okay dude she's right over there because teeth were on top of me i think it was a bear a full-size bear would have crushed them there's no way i thought we don't get pears around here [Music] oh look at that oh that black stuff that's that's infection that's and it's it's spreading this is bad this is really bad dude oh sorry [Music] you're okay it's okay  that we should amputate we should cut it off before the infection spreads what why would we do that i don't know man look at that black stuff what what do you think it is do i look like a doctor i can't remember much i mean i don't even know what i saw holy [Applause] hey i've got a gun and i know how to use it sort of brian what if it's jacob or emma what if it's not be careful it was probably nothing yeah but is it gone yeah you better run very brave all right so uh lodge is sounding pretty good right about now yeah [Music] don't shoot i'm here to save you holy nick is he okay nick and abby were attacked in the woods hey does anybody have any dry clothes i'm freezing all our bags are still in the minivan so wait what happened to you right right okay so like i was saying okay i heard abby screaming so i came running like as fast as i could from the lake yeah and then out of nowhere i stepped into this like i don't like like a booby trap like some sort of hunter's trap the goddamn thing snared my leg hoisted me halfway into the trees so i'm hanging there half naked and then this guy with like a machete comes right up to me looks right in the eyes but i thought that guy lesson booked it right the out of there we gotta get nick and abby back to the lodge like right now uh hard agree also why are you covered in what i hope is strawberry jelly oh yeah no um i'm pretty sure it's blood it was this guy with like um he had like a bottle thing i don't know dude it's like a really long story ew yeah no it's super up i gotta go get emma uh excuse me hey i need this okay it's not safe out there dude we gotta protect nick and abby yeah and i need to save emma all right she's out there alone you don't even know if she's in trouble you don't even know if you're in trouble are you trying to piss me off no i'm trying to save my girlfriend's life yeah i don't think she's your girlfriend dude what get  oh  stop we're in a real mess here guys you're acting like pricks both of you jacob we're keeping this nick and abby are injured we need protection there's someone around here ryan sorry this is make sure she's safe if she's on the island she's definitely fine and what risk another run-in with captain deliverance no thanks okay there's probably another boat by the zip line either way i can make it to the island from there we need to get back to the lodge try to get help how nick can't walk properly yeah i have an idea okay let's see what tonight brings okay here's a riddle for you what's got two thumbs and it's suddenly riding solo on a freaky island in the dark this fool well one thumb one available thumb okay and it was here on the strange uninhabited island that this brave young soul found herself okay full disclosure i've suddenly found myself on a a strange tiny little island all alone with nothing to do but show you guys around so there's a tree house over there i'm gonna go and see if i can't dish out some of that sweet sweet panoramic goodness because here's the thing not that i want to go back because i don't but even if i did i can't because then i'd look like the super needy one when he was the one who who stormed off in the first place god you know what sorry i'm bending oh explore venting you know what it let's do it to the tree house fellow explorers and this is the meeting shelter it's a shelter where you meet at okay i'm trying really hard to make this interesting but sometimes a thing just is what it is i think i've made my point so this island is like an unexcavated part of the quarry that rewilded itself after it flooded into the lake pretty cool huh you know when i was little i used to think that islands just kind of would float in the middle of the water kind of like an air bed but i'm older and wiser now and realize that not everything's always as it seems kind of like how you thought you were just having a hot summer fling and then it turns into babysitting a big hairy man-child who's all sad because you don't want to go steady with him and write him love letters every freaking day and while we're talking about it you don't mind that we're talking about it right why why is it up to me to justify my feelings when he's the one who got all blue about it you know oh look a metaphor in the narrative by mean of fork in the road how fitting here's the big question do i take the high road literally and forget about it or do i continue on the path i'm on and keep ranting about my stupid dumb life i guess since this isn't live the choice is up to me oh what the hell we're in it now anyway well and truly in the thick of it because you know what else i was really excited for the next part of my life you know i mean the summer was great but what's next i mean come on i know by the time i post this hack its quarry will just be about a distant memory and you know it's just one night and you have to make the most of all your opportunities and yada yada i guess i just don't want to have to settle for what's around me you know abby sees me as this confident person but really i'm just desperate to stay afloat in a world where everyone wants to be different this is actually kind of fun i feel like this is the first time i've been alone all summer kind of like it i guess that kind of reinforces the whole jacob thing i know the plan was for him to come get me but now that i'm by myself i kind of like it sorry jacob if you're watching nothing personal it's a me thing we're cool right yeah we're cool actually no we're not cool you left me here on this freaky ass island i'm so gonna make you pay for this in fact let's do this idea time what'll it be ty's shoelaces together no two slapstick not even sure jacob knows how to tie his shoelaces to be totally honest laxatives in his drink think that's a felony oh man i need some inspiration i'd say throw your ideas down in the comments but we'll all be long gone by the time this uploads maybe i should do a series of pranks though no no those those videos always seem so staged god whatever happened to good old-fashioned authenticity i guess i gotta do this one-handed huh that didn't sound great oh oh all right this is the luxurious skyway tree house obviously constructed in the year 18-0 by a blindfolded man who used only the finest rotting wood rusty nails and donkey spit that money could buy a real hacket vintage classic honey i'm home what's that now i forgot the children's bedtime well now that's a fine how do you do take it all in folks that's the summer camp experience right there and oh look it seems somebody forgot to clear the place out i guess one of the kids left their stuff or maybe one of the guys back there but i don't recognize this did you hear that looks like we have a choice on our hands do we snoop through someone else's belongings or do we open the spooky trap door and die a horrible painful death there are literally no right answers bag it is and you know what i'm putting some clothes on this is all you're getting fun okay so i think there's something up there and it is not gonna make me jump i can promise you that much goodbye cruel world the final curtain is calling and there's no time for an encore uh uh uh oh uh um uh easy i got it he's okay are you in pain no no sorry i'm just i'm really hungry we'll get you some food inside okay yeah okay come on come on oh man i can eat a horse well i don't know if we'll be able to find you a horse but maybe some granola oh yuck i had granola uh this will open the nurse's station should be plenty of stuff in there well hopefully we can just get him cleaned up for now i'll get you something neat you and i are gonna find a landline oh uh yeah um isn't there one in mr h's office yep we'll come meet you copy that do you think that whatever attacked them out there is i don't know has their scent or something what i don't know like what if it got a taste for blood and now it's gonna track them down i i doubt it i just feel like if we stick with them we're sitting ducks i don't know i really don't think that whatever attacked them out in the woods is gonna get into the lodge okay yeah yeah you're probably right come on let's go call for backup it's pretty weird to see this place so dead you never came down here at night while camp was in session what no did you a couple times yeah [Applause] where are you going i i i i thought i just heard my name i didn't hear anything i don't think nick's injuries are as bad as we thought we don't know that no it's true caitlyn said so all i'm saying is that we are not professionals okay we don't know we he could have rabies or something way to be optimistic man i'm just being realistic we gotta call for help who should i call uh mr h the only number i got is to this phone okay then 90-1-1 you mean 9-1-1 who says 91-1 i don't know anyway yeah but like what should i ask for like police ambulance huh uh cops yeah don't around there's hunters out there trying to kidnap us so they'll say 9-1-1 what's your emergency and i'll say help for help my friends may have been attacked by bears but maybe not a bear but definitely an animal with teeth and then one of them was kidnapped by these hunter guys with blood on their faces and there may have been shots fired but not by us but also maybe by us and they cut my friend jacob down from a tree separate incident long story yeah yeah that's that's good okay well that's go dead sometimes out here right when you're about to call the cops though it's a coincidence did you try the hang up thingy what here what are you doing i don't know it's what they do in movies when the phone goes dead you tap on the little thingy we're not in a movie okay well you know how do you know that maybe that's just what they want you to think man okay so this phone's a no-go no one has signal is there anywhere else in the camp that has a landline well not a landline what the radio hut has some old broadcast gear where you do your announcements where i curate my sweet summer jams yeah and where i do the pa announcements it has some old equipment there i think we could probably break something up and get a message out all right yeah let's let's head over there and see if we can contact somebody put that back dylan you gotta be crazy if you think i'm gonna go out there without something to defend myself it's more of a safety concern oh do you think i'm gonna shoot my eye out or your whole head don't be a dick man i know how to use this okay uh it's it's probably the weather what weather ryan me maybe it was the bears bear and why does everyone blame everything on bears okay so for the sake of argument what if that bear that uh cut our phone line and just cut out all the power what if that bear is waiting for us out in the hallway fair point thank you we should probably tell caitlyn that we're going to the radiohead they're probably freaked yeah okay yeah let's go oh god yeah we should probably leave that with caitlyn do you think she really needs it though uh she needs it just as much as we do she's staying in the lodge we're going out there you literally just said there might be something dangerous in the lodge when like 20 seconds ago okay sure but that's because i really wanted the gun just give her the gun man ah all right you're right hey we'll still have mine if you're extra nice to me i'll i might let you hold it don't write a check that your ass can't cash my ass has got quite the bank account can i interrupt something chin up big guy it i wouldn't really know what to do with it okay i trust you oh thank you so much dylan you're so generous and handsome yeah no problem don't mention it [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] oh good to see you good to see you that time again is it strength strength can be surprising knowing one's own raw power tapping into it tapping into a previously unknown energy i suppose there are forces that work within us all and with one hand it gives and with the other it could rip away as always there's more to see and as always the choice is yours would you like to see more [Music] so it's goodbye again i'll leave you with this remember who your friends are remember who's looking out for you hey i couldn't find anything to eat the kitchen's pretty cleaned out oh shoot i left my bag i i brought you this that was  i don't even know what happened it was all just a blur how are you feeling how are you holding her i'm uh well i'm just happy you're okay are you okay i'm sorry i i just asked you that i it's okay all right they're off to find a radio or something what's with the um uh oh uh we found another in mr h's office so just in case oh what happened to the lights not sure any better i'm doing okay kind of wait are they going to the radio hut phone's dead they're going to try to send out an sos or something we're holding down the fort did anybody else hear [Music] that i thought you said dylan and ryan already left wait stay here i'll check it out we don't know what's out there it could be dangerous yeah that's why i'm gonna check it out uh uh so so [Music] no sign of them when you find blood them and keep me posted bobby so so [Music] oh hey so this may not be like the best time to say but like what yes so like i was just you know thinking about like the start of summer and when we first met and started camp and well like now that summer's over and you know is that like the last time i'm gonna see each other you know sorry nick what what are you saying hey don't worry about caitlyn she's tough i know i'm sorry nick i'm just distracted just get through the night okay maybe i was misreading the situation back there but kind of felt like a little bit more was gonna happen well did you want a little bit more to happen are you dumb hey sorry i just mean of course i wanted it to happen i just didn't know if you did too that seems like such a long time ago now you didn't want it to happen though um you can tell me yeah i i guess you're just saying that cause i'm hurt nick what is going on out there caitlyn we have died we've died i got this oh my god what happened jesus where's the gun we gotta get out no we have to hide [Music] [Music] so the radio hut has like an actual radio i thought it was just like for your morning announcements oh yeah yeah it used to be more of a actual radio station actually um you know i mean it is still technically but nobody brings their radio to camp anymore yeah it's weird actually that there used to be kids with their radio and their portable cd player and everything and you know nowadays everything we need is on the phone but mr hackett takes it on the first day of camp so that we're not distracted by technology technology it giveth and it taketh so is is that something like that you want to go into camp radio no like uh dj or music or something oh um yeah i mean i like music but i think i want to major in um quantum physics wait what yeah uh you don't really seem like a science guy oh yeah i mean you know not not here um i'm i'm sorry i'm so completely fascinated by this what do you mean by not here not here at camp i do that at home and then here i um euro wise wise cracking smart ass uh that's a little harsh but no okay so maybe i was a little nervous when i arrived in an uncomfortable social situation and i overcompensated a little bit by making a bunch of jokes you played into it yeah i mean people kind of enjoyed the blase dillon and do you enjoy the blase dylan not yet like you know whatever man it's pretty cool um i like dylan dylan well it's nice to meet you dylan dylan i'm ryan ryan well actually i'm let's get the out of here ryan yeah i like him he's that makes a lot of sense oh what in the name of voodoo dude is this all good all good oh this place is kind of a dump huh okay when i was a camper here it was barely working it hadn't been used for years and it took me a really long time actually to get this place cleaned up and looking the way it is so i'm sorry if it's not up to your standards but i've been putting in a lot of tlc okay okay let me get this set up all right anything over here we can use the power tools no um that's mr h wanted more storage it's kind of how he lets me keep the station going gotcha so uh how far does it go oh um well it was designed just to broadcast to the pas around camp for announcements and to you know portable radios and whatever so i think the range is about a mile how do you even know all this stuff i just kind of picked it up the tech technical stuff has always been a little uh hard for me to get a handle on well if you like i could show you the robes like a class yeah it's easy like climbing sign me up teach anyways this thing's gonna need a bit of a power up um but that's where this comes in does magnet it's supposed to be a signal booster it's kind of janky looking but it's worth giving a shot so we can actually talk to people with this thing yeah well it's not a two-way radio so um you know we can talk uh but then the best we can do is switch it over to the receiver and see if anyone broadcasts anything back which is unlikely but well i mean it is what it is i guess yeah so what should i say uh just like make it sound urgent okay hello how's it going out there this is uh uh we need help this is uh we are counselors at hackett's quarry summer camp and there's been a horrible accident attack some stuff bad here we need your help uh there is a swarm of bears and they are everywhere and there's these hunters too and they seem to be shooting at the bears but also at us um which is not good and a few of our friends are hurt and um we are in desperate need of help so please there's vicious bears and uh we don't know what to do so please uh come help us sos uh this is an emergency s save our ship come on down please help us did i do good was that swarm of bears yeah heard of bears yeah i've heard of bears but oh my god all right i i guess i should just like switch this over to the receiver and see if we get anything back okay yeah i'm gonna keep an eye out while you do all this techy stuff okay yeah sure uh another couple unaccounted for holy they're talking about us how cuz we just told them on the radio they know where we are man we can't stay here  okay let's let's stay calm okay um let's let's go find caitlyn and everybody okay okay okay why didn't you tell me i i i wasn't sure man what the was that i have no idea uh ryan is it a bear i don't think parents can jump like that [Applause] what is that  what caitlyn abby and nick they're coming up the path oh they're coming toward us we gotta warn them um what about the pa up top yeah okay yeah yeah we can tell them to hide or something oh  no oh hold the button uh caitlin get into a building now do not come up here there's an animal outside the radio hunt get in get your cabin now go oh dude they're gone what now is there anything we can do i don't know i i don't know it's just an animal right i mean maybe we can scare it off uh well yeah i mean if it has hearing like a dog maybe we can play like a like a really high-pitched feedback loop and just blast it and and i mean it would hurt like hell but you know do it okay okay come on down let's do this um come on it's almost hey dylan just take a breath i'm sure you can figure it out okay yeah right so there's something missing i do what's missing [Music] oh crap i pulled the wire fix it i'll cover you do it now go quickly oh no okay okay just hang on hang on are you sure guess do it do it [Music] the wire get the wire get the wire what get the wire get it on it plug it plug it into the thing keep pressure the button the button [Music] oh he blew the speaker it did the trick nice work dylan [Laughter] just hold on why did you do that you told me to that was a bad idea is it safe i don't know that thing's gone but we heard those hunter guys on the radio what picked up their walkie signal they knew we were here  you get a message out i'm not sure anyone heard it great what the hell is going on oh my god tell him what happened oh um i'm okay i mean i'm not um but it's it doesn't doesn't hurt okay you're in shock holy uh did that thing do this no well sort of caitlyn where's your gun i lost it one of the friendly locals wanted to say hi what the did you shoot at us who's there who was she should we follow her oh dylan what is that oh my god [Music] oh you're back looks like that's one less vermin in the world [Music] let's take a look once more the devil without restrictions like a shadow torn from one's corporeal form pay close attention and act before the demons unleashed each of us have won even those who are pure of heart and say their prayers by night i want to show you more would that be all right we spend so much time looking toward the future it's easy to forget that the past told secrets too worth remembering that so it's goodbye again i'll be here i'll wait for you emma jesus christ man god this night sucks ass [Applause] am is that you yes one more five this foreign well that bozell  ammo huh maybe there's something on here oh uh is is oh

what it was like what emma like out of a horror movie okay um well it was probably just like a a bear trying to defend itself don't be a dicky you know it wasn't a bear well you're right you're right and now we have these the hunters running all over the place so that's a fun new wrinkle they did this to me that's a lot of blood yeah well it's not mine um got quite the funky bouquet no offense um okay okay we've got to get out of these woods yeah no sherlock you know jacob you don't have to be a dick about literally everything hey i'm trying to keep us alive i've been doing pretty good by

this is all i've got left from the nurse's station ooh fun you better hope uh we find you some real help before they wear off we need to be keeping a record of everything that happens for the police yeah dead girl in the pool needs some explaining huh easy man maybe like photos whatever we can i've got a funny feeling the cops are not gonna want to believe any of this crazy unless we've got some hard proof from now on if you got your phone and you see something take a photo or a video or whatever you okay over there abby look why don't you look around and see if you can find anything to help make nick more comfortable here that better thanks hey this place was so different like 12 hours ago i wonder where caleb is yo something is not right with that boy dude is real sick did you see how he freaked out in the water yeah he was like uh he was like a fish out of water right uh sure you know something was weird when i tried to clean his wounds too at the lodge what do you mean all of his clothes were bloody but i couldn't find where he was bit or scratched or whatever he just kept moving around like he didn't want me to see how badly he was hurt huh rabies he's not frothing in the mouth i think abby would beg to differ point yeah isn't aquaphobia a symptom of rabies hydrophobia yeah but i think it's more about a fear of drinking not just getting wet this was like like my cat in the bathtub yeah can i ask you something of course you like me nick please just tell me i've really enjoyed spending time with you this summer that's such a such such what it's such a cop-out answer abby uh what i've got something to ask you uh yeah okay why don't you like me abby nick i do like you no you what do you mean tell me the truth i am telling you the truth god i shouldn't have had a pig what not really very smart aren't you oh stupid abby stop easy pickings right off the bat this isn't you but this this isn't you whoa whoa abby abby everything okay holy [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

jump out of windows and run into the forest i just don't get it nick was that was not nick and where the hell are jacob and emma don't you think we should have run into them again by now well they're probably just winking their brains out in some cabin somewhere i don't know man something up is going on the hunters chris running off nick kaylee oh god kaley oh hey oh where the is chris hackett who's there i need your help please who are you my name is laura kearney so don't let me in it's not safe out here uh yeah there's a crazy woman with a gun killing people i'm not killing people holy you laura kearney you're laura kearney yeah you were supposed to be working uh helping out in the nurse's office right and you never showed up you and the guy what's his name max yes max yeah yeah yeah uh mr hackett said that you had changed your mind last minute i i think that we should i think that we should listen to her inside i don't know i don't trust her dude it's dangerous out there yeah she's dangerous whatever man you're not in charge dude dylan here we are again just you and me why don't we take another look at what you've found the moon how poignant tonight of all nights to harness your fear and anxiety and turn them into intuition if you can do this and plan ahead your cunning might just save your life now tell me would you like to delve deeper into one of many possible futures [Music] off you go then top top one down remember isn't that terribly exciting so uh why didn't you come where have you been for the past two months we did come one night early that was our mistake um max hey come here come on get in there  do it uh you goddamn kids oh what have you done to max shut up you can't just shut up this is an interrogation i ask you answer name eat when i say name you give me your name do i make myself clear you've got my license can you read i am an officer of the law i need you to do as you're told and answer the god damned questions i don't care what you are you can't hold us like this this isn't legal i want a lawyer stop you need to shut your mouth and listen to me or there is going to be a problem do we have a problem [Music] okay sheriff hack it wait hack it like chris hackett don't change the subject what the is going on here man you have no idea what's going on here not a goddamn clue you just stepped in some grade a double prime go ahead and kill yourself cosmic type young lady and your only option is to buckle the up and do what i say do you understand just stop trying to intimidate me and tell me what the is going on is is max alive i feel like i'm going crazy what let's go hey hey you you wanna tell us what the going on max i know you hear me [Music] max are you okay yeah i mean i'm i'm kind of all mixed up but more or less intact i think laura yeah why am i naked what i mean after we got attacked the next thing i know i'm waking up in a jail cell and you're gone and now you're back again and and i'm super naked and there's blood and stuff everywhere i mean what the happened i was kind of hoping you could tell me what happened i feel like i remember bits and pieces but none of it makes any sense yeah same i feel like were we drugged i feel like maybe we were drugged by a cop do they do that who does this guy think he is well sheriff of north kill apparently north kale yeah max what did you even look at the map hack its quarry in north kill that's the town oh and it gets better i gotta look at his name badge and get dressed what's he giving you i'm not gonna be the guest of honored fashion week i'll tell you that much hey did i say you could talk to each other sorry sir we'll be quiet we will max hey what'd you do with my real girlfriend right buddy hands through the bars come on [Music] your turn let's go i'm not going anywhere we can talk right here come on hey hey let's get the off come on move good boy hey stop struggling max calm down you're only making a purse laura what the hell did you do to her shut up okay okay think laura i think there's got to be something in here you can use what's this not a chance i need some sort of lever that could work oh yeah this ought to do it ah yes watch it man i bruise easily give me a break [Music] hey the second we get out of here you're toast sure second you get out what the is that supposed to mean hey what the is that supposed to mean hey you can't just leave us in here hi come back some pinkie pocky are you okay it's just a foot it'll heal i meant the interrogation oh yeah can't break old max many have tried many have failed i'm being serious max he uh he just asked a lot of questions a lot of weirdly specific questions about us and where we're going and why and how i was feeling this morning and i don't know nothing i said made him seem any less annoyed he asked how you were feeling yeah well he didn't ask you no huh rude oh hey did you get a look at his name badge you mean it's not really detective dick whippet it's hackett sheriff it you think he's related to chris hackett oh my god like the chris hackett yeah who's the chris hackett as in camp leader mr hackett of hackett's quarry remember man last night feels like a lifetime ago the does that mean though you know where we set up maybe it's some kind of crazy camp counselor kidnapping ring that's i mean what like some kind of setup a trap i don't know chris hackett and sheriff hackett there's no way that's a coincidence okay they must be related well what does that prove they knew we were coming maybe it's some kind of kidnapping extortion conspiracy that's a pretty big jump i'm just trying to get us out of here and i can't get us out of here until i have some clue of why the we're in here i don't know what if we can't make sense of it what well you have to sometimes things just don't make sense what then we're just stuck in a backwater jail cell for the rest of our lives this isn't forever max you can't just hold us here forever he didn't seem too convinced of that you gotta stay positive you can't think like that why not might as well just accept it right no  that think about the rest of the summer max and school i mean i've been dreaming about becoming a vet since i was five years old i'm not gonna let this fleabag stop me we're gonna get out of here i'm gonna study to be a vet and you're gonna um why i'm gonna why i saw the letter max what are you talking about the rejection letter for college i found it in your bag you were poking around on my stuff i can't believe you didn't tell me i i was embarrassed but your grades were good and you wrote a great essay apparently not good enough we've been making plans max what the  i don't know what do you want me to say i'm sorry max this this really sucks hey it's not the worst thing to happen this summer i'm sorry i shouldn't have kept it from you you know you can talk to me about anything right yeah yeah i do okay let's just focus on getting out of here for now great sign me up we need to go over it from the beginning like from when we left home like from when we ran into the cop so after we ran into the whatever we ran into yeah actually yeah that's when started getting weird the dude acted super weird when we said we almost hit an animal you remember that it was like he already knew or something yeah yeah that was really sketchy what if he's not even a real cop well he's got to be dirty but i mean i think he's a real cop we're in a police station i mean yeah but there's like nobody else around yeah that is concerning especially the whole hacking hacket thing let's just go with the idea that they're both in on it okay so we're supposed to meet chris hackett at the camp and instead there's nobody there and we get attacked by something and then the cop shows up that part's all fuzzy for me like i remember the steps and a smell like wet fur and a dog collar with the name ian on it ian ian i don't think it was a dog that attacked us whatever it was was big like person sized big yeah it really did a number on you like i'm surprised you're not more messed up like like i vividly remember the things teeth ripping into you what is messed up about that is laura i don't have a scratch on me what hey okay so weird question do you remember before we got lost you got lost well yeah but before that i was all like whoa look at the moon it's so big so cool to see a full moon in the middle of the woods and you were all like yeah no  max it happens once a month yeah so right so you know full moon what if uh okay no stop i'm just saying you know maybe there's a slight chance it was a werewolf are you out of god damn mine werewolves seriously what the what what what what's so funny i said literally the exact same thing okay do you you got anything better i mean like zombies aliens time hopping draculas ryan right yeah shut the up you let her finish man would it really be so crazy with all the  that we've been seeing with nick with a thing on the roof okay it would really start to explain a lot of stuff dylan i'm just trying to keep an open mind okay this is like your ghost stories how is it so different from your goals those are those are just campfire stories like there has to be a rational explanation for everything for all of this okay you were not talking so rational when you separated my hand from the rest of my body you told me to and if it's bite with which your face to cleave limb from torso with great haste what you did the right thing see she's got a whole poem about it there's more to all this than you think just let me finish and you can decide for yourself if you believe me or not i don't care but i think you should hear all of it the next few weeks were long the cop kept us fed and let us take showers but aside from that we barely saw him max and i we talked a lot as much as we could about what happened that night it was like trading conspiracy theories we talked about the cop the camp the accident the woods the thing in the basement what happened to max we just kept going over it all again and again and nothing was making sense all we knew is that we needed to get out of there i can't take this anymore it's not that bad they're probably in the same crap at camp no i can't take being in here anymore oh yeah well that part's pretty tough we've got to do something we've got to get out of here we need a plan we keep saying that it's been weeks so you know let me know if you have one that's really not very helpful max you are forgetting something what just the e.t.b.t tiny detail that i may or may not be a  werewolf laura so what what can we do really we run off into the sunset only to be stopped when i turn into a nasty ass monster and kill you and eat you and then i run off alone into the sunset with little bits of you stuck in my teeth okay okay stop just one problem at a time all right we don't even know if that's what's really going on and we won't until we get the hell out of here okay well it seems to me that we only have two real options we can play nice and try to get this guy on our side but so he'll let us go or we try to catch him off guard and make our escape i'm not gonna be nice to this one second longer than i have to we've got to escape cool okay so how i don't know knock him out not lori you know that's kind of a movie thing only right i mean you bank someone on the head you're more likely to kill them or leave them with permanent brain damage not just knock them out well what can you do right prison break it is can we have code names if we're doing code names i have dibs on gold and thunder no seriously max we're doing this okay i'm with you okay here's how it's gonna go down next time he opens your cell to take you to get washed up you jump him you tackle him down and take the keys from his belt drag him into your cell lock him in there unlock my cell and then we'll steal his car and just drive right the out of dodge right okay that's not really a plan though you know that's just kind of saying let's escape but with a whole lot more words no he won't be expecting it we're in a routine now we'll catch him in the back foot hmm [Music] come on now wow ow careful really careful really genius but what about my shower i said take your clothes off off get back that's what's going on get the away from him [Music] come here get off of me shut up have a seat quit squirming said you want to be a vet right call us an internship let me go you're not going to believe it until you see it for yourself just ask next time then dude geez don't get too close come in what's your position over just wrapping things up here down to 20. over what's gonna happen well i'll tell you it's not gonna be pretty but don't worry i'll be back at dawn you're really gonna leave me here you'll be fine just don't get too close hmm hmm don't worry max i'm here yeah yeah right are you all right uh yeah i don't know i just don't feel so good um what do you need what can i do to help oh it's just hot are you hot i'm kind of stuck next to this big ass pipe so i'm not exactly cool just stay back okay you shouldn't be this close there's not a lot i can do about that right now max max tommy what's going on oh ah oh [Music] so much for depth perception let's see what that bastard cop's hiding wow [Music] what's he hiding um [Music] what are you hiding travis [Music] um so so hello [Music] this not so much a hint as a slap in the face and radcliffe and edward benson wonder who they are so i'm gonna need to rest soon ha mama's boy 56 that means he was born in 1965. so this must be what he used to knock me out i can hide this in my cell july 7th i need to lie down [Music] locked figures and i guess i can't leave max better keep snooping or i could go back to my cell and wait i guess [Music]  yeah weren't hikers at all but ghost hunters who went in search of answers fell victim to the mercy of the hag of hackett's quarry never to be seen again like us except for the fell victim to the mercy of the part we're we're more like um ghost investigators specter sleuths sure so what happened next well according to reports from the local paper the north kill gazette some hay bales caught fire during the opening night and that spread pretty quickly before they knew it the whole place was up in smoke including the show's leading lady and her alleged baby so i have exhausted this and myself you need to sleep while the town of north carolina sleeping the hag in the woods started weeping as the bodies decay the wolves hunt their prey and the sheriff continues his creeping wow you want to tell me what happened i could ask you the same thing why didn't you run i won't leave max this doesn't mean i trust you i don't care i just want to help him turn around hands against a wall seriously i am too tired to argue me too happy i'll grew some coffee what's this an education watch nice job cleaning up the eye i mean it's harder than they make out in the textbooks especially when nobody's helping you you're the doctor uh animal doctor and no i'm not and i probably never will be stuck in here forever you know just cause you know doesn't mean you know you know uh what i'm not this isn't what it seems to be you're gonna have to be more specific you and max are in just as much trouble as i am my family we didn't mean to hurt anybody we're just trying to survive like everybody else do you understand not really we're gonna end this thing once and for all we so how is your family involved my family is down at the bottom of a well what family is the most important thing in the world but if your whole family you know like every last one of them decided to jump down the bottom of a well and they're all just hanging on the end of a rope how can one person be expected to pull them all back out you can't so you pull on that rope i'm just gonna fall right down at the bottom of the well with the rest of them and what's the point of that right so you you're the one at the top of the well with a rope and yes i thought that was obvious yeah okay yeah i got it forget it let's see how smart you really are what is this information well what does it mean read it unfold the moon above shines first the beast internal shall outward burst one by one leads lambs to slaughter it stalks your breath but shuns clear water and should you yourself be cursed armed with silver and the first when moon is full before its wane rend the beast that cursed you slain no longer shall you face your blight or fear the dread of full moon's light yeah keep reading and if it's a bite with which you're faced cleave limb from torso with great haste perchance you'll save your cursed soul before infection takes its toll starting to get the picture it's not a lot to go on and frankly it's why do they have to make it rhyme i don't know but it's all we have to go on kill the werewolf that bit you and you'll be cured it has to be silver has to be full moon seems pretty straightforward to me if you can kill the werewolf and that's a big f i just want to cure max it's not as straightforward as you think if you knew all this why didn't you just kill it in the storm shelter when you had the chance it's not so i'm i was when i straightforward no it's not they're not too easy to hit i was trying to protect you too [Music] so what's the plan well that's from helping you come in me yeah because your studies i haven't even started well you're the best option i got i've been hunting this damn white wolf under the full moon so long i start to think it doesn't exist you know maybe it doesn't matter because maybe there's another way whatever you believe there's got to be some science and you do science look take some time to think about all this i'll be back in the morning seen enough i don't think i'd believe a word he just said if i hadn't so i hadn't seen that i believe him you can't tell me you really trust that guy now i didn't say that i said i believe him about the werewolf stuff not the science bit i don't know what he wants he's a dirty lion kidnapping cop laura we should be careful of anything that  says well  him he's had his chance to fix this we're getting out of here and we're gonna fix it on our own hey laura yeah i saw what happened what i did to your eye yeah is it bad yeah it's pretty bad i'm so sorry it wasn't you i know it wasn't you i know but it was we're gonna fix you max promise i promise i said let me in there chris i know they're in there the counselors that didn't show up how'd you find out bobby told me said you scrapped an abandoned car a while back i worked out the rest why why'd you think chris jesus travis you're still here that's up  bet one of them chris was i supposed to do what was that you shot me i'm telling mom thank you lucky stars it wasn't silver what's your plan you can't keep them here forever i am handling it maybe if you'd done your job they wouldn't been at the camp that night you ever think of that i'd have done my job you'd all be in prison you were thinking that was all bobby and caleb and those hikers that that that journalist damn it travis what are we gonna do now whatever happened to we're all in this together shh man let's go to my office we shouldn't talk here max uh max ah what is it travis was just in the hall talking the cop so with chris hackett was he here to let us out no he's the werewolf max chris hackett is the one that bit you down on storm shelter holy that's who would have guessed i mean i guess thinking about it i could have and yet you didn't it all makes sense that's why chris's car was at the lodge that night travis was protecting him that's why he followed us and that's why he didn't kill the werewolf in the storm shelter because it was his brother god it's so obvious if if chris was the one that bit me then yeah then that's our cure how we fix you jesus laura we thinking the same thing tomorrow we're getting out of here i'm gonna get travis's gun and kill chris hackett hey hey help her lord needs help laura are you okay god damn it [Music] what the hell is going on laura [Music] okay starting to think you were really sick well maybe i should consider acting as my major i wouldn't go that far we should go before he wakes up [Music] we should grab our staff we need silver ammo he must have some around here what is it i thought i heard someone no i still can it's coming from behind that door there's nobody in here what the he makes them what is it shotgun shells he loads him with silver that's where he was last month hunting well i guess he won't be needing this anymore hey i just realized something we're free no max we're not free until chris hackett is dead and it doesn't look like we've got much time i know you're right but let's just take the win for now huh we'll celebrate when it's over we're going straight to hackett's quarry and we're ending this tonight [Applause] let's go and i made my way here to camp left max at the island seemed like the best place for him surrounded by water and all that's it that's the story and i'll jump in at the same time wait the island like like our island like the one in the lake yeah why because jacob he went back there looking for emma and he hasn't come back yet neither of them has oh well if they were there they're not there now what's that supposed to mean don't make me spell it out for you i've just come back from there and there's one werewolf and no people oh all i know is i have to do this i have to kill chris hackett before it's too late after you saw me at the pool after i shot chris i went back to the island expecting max to be back to normal but so max max max hello um oh so the werewolf i killed can't have been chris that wasn't a werewolf it was haley hackett chris's daughter whatever i shot that was no girl unless i i guess it turned back after i shot it when i went to the island wait so how come max didn't kill you then he tried i got away i need to end this we don't have much time oh so this is our new guest smell good donut [Music] go dumb animal let me go let me go get your hands off me please let me go okay i need to be ready to happen please please oh my god why aren't you answering me oh oh oh is there is your money that you want cause look what dad's got buddy like lots of it how are you i mean not really but you can get something probably just let me go please i'm so sorry [Music] oh geez great [Music] that's too bobby hey hey hey where you going hey hey oh nosy little rat aren't you poking your nose where it doesn't belong don't believe everything you hear anyway here we are again let's see what you've brought me this time shall we the chariot at the reins of a chariot we would all feel safer taking control relying on determination to make our choices valiant but in some cases foolish many seek refuge in chariots but perhaps in some cases they're not as safe as we think they are and the same question as always will you let me show you more [Music] you'll be seeing me a few more times before the night's over i look forward to that as long as you follow the right of course where is chris hackett shut up wow rude guys she murdered kaylee we have been over this uh caitlin what do i do oh wow real strong showing on the leadership front i said shut up oh no way i am not getting involved this is all you buddy look just think about everything that's happened tonight okay that's all i'll say hold up you said you heard a woman crying when you escaped why what do you know it's the ghost story he told us about right caitlyn this isn't a ghost story it's a creature feature it's really happening and you're all in it your bracelet what are you doing trying to help worst case scenario this should give you a fighting chance and this will kill them for good yeah but what if it's nick or someone like i said worst case scenario ryan put that thing down before you hurt someone so come on where does chris hackett live when he's not at camp i mean what makes you think i know that uh you guys are counselors right you've spent the last two months here he's not in the storm shelter i'm clearly getting nowhere hunting him in the woods i need a place to start i think that spooky house behind these woods dude what listen there could be another way have you thought about that i've spent the last month thinking about nothing else look when the sun comes up i am stuck until the next full moon so is max so is anyone else he's been how is that our problem why don't you ask your friends in the woods don't forget about nick dude okay any clothes are gonna spray you two with cold water ryan let's just get out of here i'm running out of time if i can't find chris hackett then a lot more people are going to get hurt going with you what uh yeah what they said i'm gonna show you that chris heckett has nothing to do with this he wanted us to stay inside tonight he wanted us safe i don't care what you think i don't care what you think shut up fine do whatever you want you saw what happened to nick he was bitten everything's gonna be fine that cop car you stole where is it ditched in the lake why it was a stolen cop car you're gonna have to try and fix the minivan get somewhere safe how long do you have an hour or two i don't know it doesn't seem like an exact science we better get going are you sure this is the right way pretty sure yeah pretty or definitely what do i look like a tour guide this doesn't feel right i think you're up to something i'm not you better not just be running out the clock i'm not the longer we're out here the longer we're in danger said the murderer you know it might be a lot more pleasant if you lighten up a little what is wrong with you nothing and if it makes you feel any better i'm not a murderer you murdered kaley and you want to murder chris i don't i want to save everyone else he's infected except kaylee right she would have killed you all if i hadn't shown up you must know how insane this all is there it is pack your house so he lives in some redneck mansion with his redneck family and the ass crack of the woods look at this place no but it's where his mom lives i think never been there but if we're looking for answers it's probably the best place to start so uh wait how do we get there what do you mean how do we get to the house that's a really good question maybe we just don't look i understand chris is your friend there was another way i'd tell you sure yeah laura chris is a good man this isn't about good and evil ryan just how can you be so certain i let my conscience slow me down now everything gets a lot worse for everyone believe me if there's another way i'm all for it hey where are you going you're the timer remember there must be another way across somewhere i got you careful oh are you okay laura it stalks your breath but shuns clear water right oh my god laura jesus mary in jazz hands here's the thought what are you doing relax look but because you have grandma no can you see yellow in my eyes define yellow we haven't got much time this must be part of the old working quarry makes sense these must have been from the quarry days no duh no one's been down here for years did you hear that too it's her who the hag of hackett's cory it's like she's warning us off or guiding us you think anyone heard that no they can't have done this place is not up to code i mean if the code is literally crumbling to the ground then i think it's doing fine let's just keep moving yeah careful jeez just look at this place i could really do with a hamburger right about now stop being weird oh boy this is high whoa do you think actual way something is in here with us either that or this route isn't as disused as we thought a long way down well where's cave out look who's finding their funny bone so what's your deal then what do you mean the whole mysterious brooding loner thing it doesn't quite fit with the i love my camp leader vibe so i don't fit into the right box is that what you're saying and what box would that be nothing forget it do you always do that do what uh start to engage in a conversation and then just immediately recoil into your shell maybe i don't want to talk to you anymore oh wow charming i am assuming you're single yeah why no reason this way i see a light yeah or you can just hang out here up to you someone's been eating their spinach so you want to go into the collapsing nightmare tunnel first or shall i looks promising foreign careful splinters thanks i'm fine guess we found the party alcohol from prohibition these are run running tunnels that would make that liquor almost 100 years old probably still good good try vintage well i guess the hackets were bootleggers that makes sense i guess when the cores get down they branched out come on time travel later you think this is it uh beach me i'm pretty much completely lost yeah me too shall we hey uh what the hell happened here uh that's kind of my bad had a bit of a tumble with one of the locals the caitlyn this place is wrecked well you should see the other guy what do you think happened to jacob and emma probably nothing hopefully i mean should we go find them warn them i think the safest thing the most responsible thing is to try and get help right and then we can come back for them and nick and nick wait what is there is there something in there i don't know what is it jacob ella are they should i open it up your funeral buddy hey it's us oh it burns oh my god i i'm so sorry dylan i am so so sorry i didn't know you i was really scared and i thought it's not mace what air freshener oh yeah it's all i could find in the van uh dylan you're uh so she was in the police station this whole time insane right this whole time we were having such a fun summer we never knew jeez okay so the engine's completely screwed more great news i mean if i could summon a working car out of thin air i would wait maybe i can okay she's gone nuts there's a scrap yard up the road if we're looking for a vehicle maybe there's one there that sounds like a long shot dylan come on look i need you we need you fine okay once again dylan puts himself in mortal danger for the sake of his work friends what exactly are we supposed to do i mean the van is nice but it's not exactly fort knox well there's a shelter under the lodge you could be safe there for a while all right abby you're with me good luck what was that huh what was that oh it's nothing we got we got

after all fortune is nothing but a spinning wheel sometimes you have to take a chance karma works in mysterious ways but it favors those who pay attention watch closely though the wheel spins the eagle-eyed can tell where it's going to stop the emperor authority paternity stricter is designed to topple no how the mighty may fall and their empires with them let them bleed let them rip each other apart let them rot details then choose the possible future you'd like to witness and watch carefully try and find some clarity in the chaos [Music] go you still got time be careful now be very careful have you been there before the scrapyard nah just seen the sign on my way to camp what if we just like walked to the main road this isn't the main road no this is all hackett property the main road is another mile that way wait how do i know so much more about everything than you do wait shut up so basically it's another hour walk to the main road and then at least another three to four hour walk until we hit the nearest whatever yeah what was that let's just keep moving okay so i guess this is me now what you're gonna look great with a hook we can call you the hooky in the coke face yeah i guess it's pretty unique i could get different attachments for it yeah man lean into it one hell of a story too yeah i guess it's something to talk about on the radio station we're all gonna be laughing about this in a few years you me maybe even ryan kind of got close at the fire pit back there am i crazy or was something about to happen it was always next year right well let's get through this year first it wouldn't really matter anyway it looks like we finally know ryan's type confident and heroic with an eye patch so pirates maybe she shivers his timbers there oh relax it's motion sensor we're okay i think oh look steampunk's back in ew come on this way so what do we do now well i guess we just make ourselves at home live up some cocktails see what's on the tv no why are you always so positive oh why do you keep asking me that uh i asked you about your confidence not your whatever is happening right now ugh i don't know i guess i just don't like to see other people sad is that why you do the internet video thingy internet video thingy whatever it is you call it you know people think influencers do it just for the attention and maybe you do at first but after a while it's like what's the difference between four thousand randall likes and a hundred thousand rando likes but i make people laugh i act dumb and they laugh maybe that makes me dumb or maybe i just like to make people laugh there's nothing wrong with that  this night huh yeah come on i want to hear you say it  this night it all the way to morning put me down easy ma put me down yo your hell everybody

i'll get in trouble ow you stabbed me yeah hearts donut i ain't never been stabbed before leave me alone oh it really hurts dad what the happened to you oh you know nothing out of the ordinary oh ryan oh how about it i'm so sorry that bad huh i keep trying to fix it whatever this is people keep getting hurt first max help you it's not your fault i didn't have to come here i shouldn't have let you come uh you're not the boss of me sorry am i dying you've lost a lot of blood but it'll it'll heal though right wait maybe maybe it will what ryan if you let me bite you what if you let me bite you it means you'll be infected which means which means it will heal yeah but it also means yeah yeah i got a big bad wolf yeah ryan i don't have much time i can feel it like it's fighting to get out if you let me bite you and you heal then then i have to kill chris it's it's not killing chris it's killing a werewolf it's saving your own life and mine and max's and your friends too let you bite me and live to kill chris hackett or bleed out and die pretty much yeah it's your call for now so we doing this or no do it okay ah nice and tender for you oh you should start to feel better soon i guess ugh these guys never throw anything out huh so do you want to give me some direction on what we're looking for specifically well most of these cars look like they've already been stripped apart it's just empty frames and chassis which doesn't help us much okay so we're looking for engines well anything relatively intact got it looks like we got our work cut out for us huh try not to make too much noise oh right anything by you not yet keep looking uh problem ah  sticks i mean there must be a way to open it maybe in that house thing let's take a look hmm [Music] ah are we gonna end up in a documentary no shut up let's go [Music] ah sorry that was scary that's so annoying we are being hunted by literal monsters and this is what bothers you you both are bad uh look so you ever operated a crane before i actually used to be pretty pretty good at the claw game at my local arcade the kids used to call me the grabber no nope uh-uh oh i hear that yeah look why don't you see if you can lower it down so i can take a look under the hood sure yeah sure thing um just uh watch my back yeah yeah all right looks like somebody's mom never taught them how to clean up after themselves okay let's see what we're working with all right not too complicated welcome back grabber what the hell is going on my bad ah okay all right here goes nothing so you did it yeah uh i think i found my calling about time oh maybe we can see if we can try and get this thing running ah score oh what's up there's something coming what hide [Music] damn uh oh hurry the up on you rusty [Music] ugh dylan thank you you actually saved my life for realsies yeah you know no sweat i just can't wait to see who they choose what to play me in the movie about how brave i am don't push it okay so so much for our brilliant escape plan okay back to the lodge me nuts better than being out in the open come on we can't just sit here why not dylan set it safe here yeah i just i don't want to be waiting around but that's literally all we need to do just wait until morning right fine but we need protection go see what you can find it's better than just sitting around huh huh looks like the main fuse is gone that's why there's no power why would somebody do that what is it silver shells how'd they get down here the hunter must have dropped him this is probably how he got upstairs and attacked caitlyn these guys are everywhere what'd you find oh i'm just checking out this ladder is that a tiny little door up there uh yeah we'll open it up why we don't know what's up there exactly have you not been paying attention like at all okay what i mean is it might be good for us to have an escape route you know we don't know what's up there right the lodge there there also could be a a way for us to defend ourselves okay guess that makes sense ugh you all right yeah okay that was i was close oh they ain't getting through there in a hurry man this place is huge i might need to rest a bit you'll feel better soon cool i'm feeling pretty good actually what are you doing stop it do you smell that no never mind let's just find another way down a way to chris hackett or just a way out maybe i'm done being chased and stabbed sure and another way out fine watch your step yep what was that i think i think we found chris hackett son of a oh bobby the gun [Applause] hey uh thanks for not killing me yeah likewise so what now everyone's back to normal what oh you think this is over this isn't over uh i don't understand chris is dead oh how chris wasn't the first that's not possible caleb kaylee the girl you killed her brother what caleb bit chris and kaylee chris was just trying to protect him he was a good man my brother then who bit caleb silas i've been tracking him for years he's a gypsy transient he'd been long gone from the area but we hoped he'd come back so we could end this anyway there's sightings up down the coast uh a feral albino child giant white wolf white wolf what what'd you say where did you see it at the cabins earlier tonight okay okay okay it makes sense it all makes sense yeah he must have been back for months and he's what ran you off the road two months ago help me help me we can still save caleb we can still save what's left of my family we we can help those who are still alive why the hell should i trust you i'm not asking you to trust me i'm telling you we can end this we kill silas everyone gets better everyone uh is still alive anyway okay okay so where would we even find him i know exactly where to find him okay let's go okay this doesn't mean i forgive you for what you did to me i understand can someone please get me some clothes you had your chance you had your chance to wipe out that wretched family and you failed doesn't matter there's still time we can still come out on top past is the past let's just look to the future shall we death death takes many forms it could mean change transition transformation often interpreted as a beacon for the hopeful in your case it means well it just means death [Laughter] the sun the vitality of a new day there's still time to wake up to the warmth of a night survived your choices your actions your very life hangs in the balance it's up to you to find your path in the darkness and see the sun rise once again there's always more than meets the eye would you like me to show you yes good but i can only delve deeper into one possible future so which is it choose one last time go back go back and end this oh man what what the why am i on top of a tree laura blood how the hell am i gonna get down asked an answer where the hell am i oh yeah where the hell are my clothes you gotta be kidding me okay gotta find laura totally should have just gone to the harbinger motel so she must have come back the table help me okay well can't get much worse than it already is right great just like the cartoons it's been off and on all night gives us a little time how do you figure they don't like water remember right right oh we should have just been swimming in the lake all night and die of hypothermia no all right well we're good now night's not over yet these know we're in here and they're coming back first chance they get great news okay all right we got to get a vantage point how long is this guy been here a long time ago long enough ago that it was okay to have an oil painting made of yourself i kind of want an oil painting of me now maybe i should keep looking pour in some camp mascot to kick it before camp starts nightside sounds about right we have a camp mascot no we did we eat in here here what he died before we got to camp huh bummer so i remember mr age's cheesiest announcements whoa careful with that that's a camp relic relax it's dead anyway ah r.i.p microphone where have i seen this emblem before what is it a ring with the crust on it oh very fancy you can never pull it off sorry what's this trail cam footage it's like they're looking for something yeah uh in chris's surveillance room he's storing all the footage i think he might be right every dusk and donald through the summer if it doesn't kill you'll make you stronger we're here to lead the way that mates for life we're proud to say shout two months and you never learn the words [Music] showtime what is going on out there should we go find the others no we're safer in here and it's nearly morning what the uh uh scale okay [Music] what the was that it's caitlin holy well we got a letter in well we can't office door's locked from the outside but there must be something we can do yeah but what silver shells if we can time it right we can give them to her she passes if she passes come on come on caitlin this way [Music] caleb we don't have time for that come on it's silver hey i'm here okay [Music] [Music] uh  you i got you you got it yeah yeah i got it so so what exactly happened six years ago there was a fire that wiped out dozens of people and now there's werewolves and a ghost that roams the woods looking for her lost baby boy which i've just put together is silas oh it's a long story no it's not there was a fire silas the wolf boy escaped but a bunch of your family you failed to stop him burn what happened in the past doesn't matter right now uh it kind of does actually we need to know what we're up against at least what we're up against is a feral boy

something else who the woman the old woman she was saying something over and over again oh my god she was saying silas that's impossible who you're talking about i saw her too in the rum tunnels eliza voris salsa's mother i think who was she she ran a traveling sideshow called harem scarum came here six years back she kept her son in a cage called him silas the wolf boy died in a fire some say she never left the hog of hockey's cory we've been looking for silas ever since how did the fire start really you're still hiding stuff now you blew half the head off my niece kaylee hackett one of the kindest gentlest souls to ever walk this earth all she wanted to do was help that little boy locked in a cage by that freakshow what did she do you just wanted to help him travis she convinced caleb to start a fire it was just a distraction it's may bales give him enough time to get silas out of his cage and give him his freedom that's not what happened no because within minutes everybody was dead never see hey burton liza old crew kaitlin managed to get silas to freedom but caleb got bit in the process that's why you've been hunting him silas i mean every full moon for six years some hunter you are listen this is all that's left jesus christ man any sign negative damn i never saw any of this i didn't even know this was here ryan i'm sorry if that was close we must be close did you

not about to stop now just because the nights come to an end no you hear a noise in the dark of whisper from the shadows the breath on the back of your neck that's gonna be me i'll be there now i will never leave you i'll never leave you bodies recovered in summer camp murder mystery what do you make that anton bad journalism murder mystery isn't that just an unsolved murder yes i i suppose that is what most journalists would say but perhaps the journalists of north kill share my supernatural suspicions yeah i guess there wouldn't be much competition in north kill probably not getting the best writers there okay can we at least start the podcast before you completely resign yourself to cynicism i thought we'd done the whole hack it's quarry thing not this hack it's quarry thing what was this like three months ago old news dude anton introductions first we are bizarre yet bonafide the podcast of the paranormal i'm grace and i'm anton and together we explore the possibility of supernatural involvement in real life everyday occurrences and that's exactly what they are real-life everyday occurrences with a shadow of spiritual supernatural occurrences no okay so i hope you've got hat insurance anton because i'm about to blow your mind did you just ask if i had hat insurance yes it's responsible to ensure those things which mean the most to you a hat yes okay i know where your priorities lie go on anyway there actually is a real reason that we're coming back to hack its quarry there have been some developments and i've sourced some information i remain skeptical but i'm all ears under my hat i was hoping you'd say that oh god why why are you smiling stop it i hate it why i had braces i have to make use of them sometimes you do have very pretty teeth thank you that's something that a lot of podcast listeners might not know about me so it just so happens i've got someone on the inside so today's episode is going to have a bit of a show-and-tell vibe to it who do you know on the inside the inside of where what you know someone on the inside don't we all have someone on the inside you know an inner critic that says stop doing a podcast no one's listening you should listen to that voice grace okay well what i really meant is let's call it an anonymous donation you know we're not the only ones who flagged this as a bizarre situation someone actually reached out to us they sent us a package did you you didn't open it anyone who i don't trust anyone who listens to this show oh i couldn't wait to open it surprise anonymous donation okay you've always promised me since day one of this podcast that if you could see true evidence you will consider all options right did you not say that i did say that yes knowing for a fact that we would never see any evidence i did say that okay well we've been sent information and we need to decide whether it's bizarre or bonafide okay fine let's do this for anyone listening at home we are about to open a package from a mysterious person who listens to this show if you are the one who sent us whatever it is congrats you got us sorry the tape is just really really there's just so much tape on the package sorry can you help me with this do you have like a key i could like slice at it with no i don't want you to dull my key just use your fingers but just give me your key anton no give me your  key no get your own key not like you lock your door of course i lock my door what are you what are you hiding what am i hiding do you not lock your doors no i have nothing to hide you think that ghosts are real but you don't lock your doors no ghosts couldn't open my doors they could walk through my walls anton okay you need to be more concerned with murderers so remember those missing hikers yeah what if i showed you leaked photos from one of their cameras photos that show them at hackett's quarry supposedly where the camera was found i would think that maybe they went there and they dropped their camera okay anton let me ask you real quick what makes you drop your camera uh tripping over a root um being jostled uh in uneven uh row of cobblestones what about being murdered if you dropped your phone you wouldn't go missing where are they now i don't know people get lost in the woods all the time there's like hundreds of people a year they could be anywhere that's not all no i'm about to lay a little something else on you my sources also tell me that their backpacks were found at the summer camp really then okay well then shouldn't this be public knowledge why aren't the hackets prime suspects exactly my point maybe they would be if anyone knew where they were is it all just a big cover-up operation yeah that's where it falls apart a bit in my opinion so we've got to talk a little more about the hackett family right so these guys are like the heritage landowners right mm-hmm yep their great-great-great-grandparents were trappers who claimed the land way back when they just claimed it yes they did they put their flag on it just like the man on the moon the hackett family flag right well apparently when they claimed it they found quartzite quartzite okay i was hoping you would ask fun fact every building in the whole of new york is made of quartzite that's not fun or a fact most of them are but i digest digress it was a pun they dug the quarry and hit great heights of success before septimus hackett classic bad guy name the seventh son of the trappers the number seven has great supernatural powers closed the mind down okay so then they only had the land to live off yes you say only but this land actually spans acres that's a lot of forest a lot of unexplored darkness oh okay a great place to hide to have all these dark secrets for this strange reclusive family mm-hmm and this is where we start to get a little more into paranormal territory okay here we go acres of haunted woods if you say so [Music] the podcast of the paranormal welcome back to bizarre yet bonafide anton today i'm actually going to pass you some light writing okay you're going to make me read this all right um this is what you're seeing now is a copy of a letter that kaylee hackett wrote to her grandma allegedly all right uh this seems like more of a you job but i suppose right but i feel like if some of the evidence comes from your mouth it will have more clout right okay here we go gammy how long we gonna drag this out i know family is the most important thing but i want to know what's outside the forest outside this damn house and camp and i sure as hell no that ain't about to happen cause of who we are maybe we can explain what's going on  show people then they'll know we got no control over it i know you just trying to protect us but one day you won't be here no more and right now it feels like we stuck in a dark hole i can't sleep gammy or if i do i dream about that fire we were just dumb-ass kids back then i wish it never happened love k-x-o-x-o that took a turn yes dream about that fire does that not read us the haunted scribblings of someone who saw something that they shouldn't have seen yeah no i'm fully creeped out she was clearly going through some stuff and this is legit i mean i don't know why someone would fake it then again i can't verify any of this so you've got to suspend your disbelief slightly man this poor girl yeah there was something going on something eating away at her and that's what i want to explore okay well consider my disbelief suspended for now so i don't think that's going to be a problem for this next one oh god why holy this is a cease and desist letter and it's addressed to us dude why didn't you tell me about this well it was never actually sent that's mad fam what signed by travis hackett we're not doing anything illegal aren't we think about it i guess it wasn't technically sent to us cease and desist letters come from people hiding stuff hmm okay and next we have this empty vial thing now to me empty implies that it was once full same zs blood stains maybe filled with blood looks that way freaky some kind of ritual thing do i detect a hint of belief love a good ritual kind of up that these guys know who we are though okay but putting the hackett family aside for a moment there's more to this are you ready for some real spooky i'm ready for real spooky  i don't know if you can provide it but please try don't get too freaked out i'll try my hardest okay do you want to hold my hand no okay do you need someone to comfortingly pat your back please just say what you're gonna say do you want me to turn all the lights on so you i don't want you to do anything i want you to say what you have okay so what's this what are we looking at now a photo taken by one of the counselors i'm a mount bank downloaded from her phone oh my god is that real this is what we're here to discuss it looks shopped i mean doesn't it i don't think so look at the eyes and tell me that's not real danger what the hell is that bizarre yet bonafide what the hell happened more than what we're being told man there's something else too yeah look what happens when i put it through a negative filter what is that it's her the hag of hackett's quarry see full circle i mean that could be anything dude it barely even looks like a person what's what's that thing where your mind makes you see faces and i can't believe you're still questioning this what do you want me to say ultimately unless i experience something myself the most likely reasoning is that it's fabricated okay then what do you think of this ew is that skin skin fur whatever you want to call it really it looks human wait is it apparently it belongs to whatever creatures supposedly caused all this do we have the actual thing can i see it in the flesh so to speak no just the photo whoever got in touch was smart enough to not risk actually stealing evidence oh convenient that we can't see the real deal come on man just saying okay you know what it's weird i'll give you that oh my god i just said it was weird don't make a big deal out of it oh my god i've done it you haven't done anything i said it was weird i've done it i've turned you you're i've converted you to my side you're a believer now right i will never be on your side i won i won you did not win this is a contest and i have prevailed you have not look i just mean i can see it the lack of details in the news report and this stuff i don't know whatever it means there's merit to the idea that something strange went down strange interesting word choice so what are you saying shut up come on no give me what i i'm not giving you anything you've practically given it just give me the succinct sound by i so desperately long for okay i never agreed to this title but i would agree that for the first time ever this case could well be bizarre yet bonafide ah this is the best day of my life and that's sad why is it not yours no so what now we gotta send this stuff to the police they can decide whether it's useful or not i just wish we could know more i wish we could just look into a crystal ball and see how it all played out yeah but what fun would that be sure we could speculate but we weren't there we didn't go through what these kids went through there's no way we'll ever really know what truly went down at hackett's quarry um who the even are you i'm being genuine that was beautiful thank you you just launched into precisely the kind of content i've been trying to make it's just the first time we've had a coherent thought on this podcast [Music] [Music] you
