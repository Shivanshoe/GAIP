lauren it was a massacre biters were everywhere i'm the only one who survived so what are you still doing here i was going to tell her but instead i locked her up and returned here to clean up this mess i wanted to i didn't want her to know till i took care of this till i knew what to say she's an adult lauren do you have a sister no i i mean it's complicated then you must understand i i have to protect her aidan are you there have you reached the condos [Applause] you can't tell her ayden it has to be me he's not here what do you mean are you in the right building yes but there's nothing here but infected then why would he lock me up why would my brother keep me from my timor sounds like the two of you need to talk he sure has plenty of talking to do treating me like this it's [ __ ] and let me tell you as fairy tale princess go you really suck i'll go back to her hopefully i'll figure out what to say by then thank you uh [Music] [Music] hey herman where's sophie hey why were you on the mission friends could have used you okay i guess that means i should wait here [Music] hmm [Music] mia [Music] here mia [Music] aiden what's the matter with you mia where are you [Music] mia oh no no no no [Music] jack and [ __ ] joe will pay for what they did i had a bad feeling about it from the start i had a feeling carl's plan sucked and yet i let him lead [Music] don't beat yourself up things could have been worse too if i had listened to myself we'd have water and more of our people would still be alive you were just doing your job you were following carl's lead yeah but i won't let him lead the bazaar to its doom i see why didn't you send herman on the mission they wouldn't have stood a chance against that beast him he's strong but as helpless as a child it's one damn big child you don't understand herman's almost deaf he used to be my mother's bodyguard has been around us as long as i can remember and after she died he stayed close to us one time the lights in my shelter went out the infected broke through a window hermann blocked the path and tossed a grenade into a nearby infected he survived the explosion but lost his hearing in a face-to-face battle he's nearly unbeatable but if he's caught from behind he's as vulnerable as a child a killer combination especially for him that's why i prefer to keep an eye on him sometimes i wonder if he's watching over me or i'm watching over him you think jack and joe could have had something to do with lucas's murder joe perhaps he's a total psycho and a thief he knew the peacekeepers would hang him if they caught him but jack wouldn't let him he's a coward he thinks rationally [Music] from now on i'm following my gut last time something like this happens on my watch if you'd hurry back there maybe some of our guys would have made it i thought a pilgrim like you was supposed to run like a [ __ ] gazelle barney shut up what if he'd have made it in time to help we'd be having a party not awake in case you change your mind he can be a real pain in the ass but we'll do something good for the city one day [Music] birdie to your health [Music] i gather you were close with birdie he tried to be a poet kept showing me his work and said all the other guys were too stupid to understand i never told him how bad it was he was a good kid i took him into the group when he lost his father in a dark zone he was 10 years old that's pretty young too young but he had no one else so i took him in [Music] if you managed to take out those bandits it jack [ __ ] and joe [ __ ] you think killing monsieur's [ __ ] and kant will change something death usually changes a lot in a person's life carl was wrong we should have gone after them right away but right or wrong we have to help him he's one of us we'll rescue him and retrieve the crystals from jack and joe besides i won't let them get away with killing my people ralph suzie logan birdie they deserve revenge and jack and joe sentence them to death so they'll die your radio yeah it picks up static sometimes go see alberto he can fix stuff like that on the spot thanks hey tour here leave but make sure no one sees you you two make a pretty pair aidan i'm on the roof nearby we have to talk now it's about saving your life i'll tear them apart i swear i'll gut them real slow peace by peace to ralph susie to her crew [Music] uh uh um [Music] so so [Music] oh oh oh [Music] yes uh hmm [Applause] um [Music] [Music] are you just gonna stand there or will you come over what do you want i don't like what's going on here aidan first jack and joe's bandits killed carl's people now sophie's getting ready to retaliate you're not a part of that are you but you said you wanted me to get close to them i'm gonna search sophie's camp that's why i came to warn you rumors have started you found the lazarus for me they may suspect you of being a pk spy that doesn't seem like it they seem happy to take whatever help is offered so they say but those people hate us aiden along with anyone who works with us so if they do suspect especially someone like sophie i can handle them lucas thought so too and look how he ended up be a pity if i found you in a ditch somewhere with a piece of your hide cut out you came here just to warn me you help me with the lazarus and i take care of my allies sophie's just fighting for water that's all i don't think she suspects anything you think so she hates the peacekeepers she blames us for not helping the bizarre and for her mother's death so when we start questioning her people you better be careful thanks for the warning you gain any intel for our investigation sophie's also wondering who killed lucas what else would she say they know if we can prove they killed lucas it'll be a bloodbath find out from sophie when she's planning the attack keep me informed where you are be careful go help sophie but be careful hayden don't trust the people of the bazaar they're more dirty dangerous than they seem hmm it's time for hey have you seen sophie sophie uh yes she went she said uh she went that way exactly thanks wait there's more one more thing something's wrong with uh not working with the it's broken that uh oh dad's asking if there's something wrong with your radio oh uh it hisses sometimes but as long as it works no point messing with it um can i ask you a question sure call me aiden vincenzo how do you become a pilgrim does that mean you're a murderer vincenza why what do you why would you dad i'm asking because i'm curious will you tell me aiden i'm not that exciting i've had to kill people but i'm not a murderer all being a pilgrim is to me now is a means to an end to what end vincenzo leave him alone to find the only family i've ever known did you not yet but i might be close i hope you succeed i've never found federico who federico he was my best friend we were like brothers we'd known each other forever he disappeared like the other kids because of those [ __ ] tests tests you mean gre tests you heard that when they built the walls they were trying to create a vaccine here it all fell apart in a couple of weeks one day federico vanished into thin air and we'd been playing football i went to my house after that he went home too and i never saw him again i'm sure they took him and that's not all you see he wasn't the only child who went missing that winter there were others two girls disappeared from the building next door at the same time and more all across the city and none of them have ever been found no but based on what federico's mother said i have a feeling i know what happened federico had been in the hospital a month earlier with pneumonia his mother was told that some gre doctor had ordered blood tests but they wouldn't tell her why a week after he was released from the hospital he was gone do you remember this doctor's name no one knew and no one at the hospital would say only that he was on classified gre business then everything went to hell the gre collapsed after that some of the kids were sighted in the central loop but not federico every day i wonder what happened to him i hope he's alive and that you find him someday he lost something you won't find it here if you came to find out if i have a boyfriend i don't which doesn't mean you have the slightest chance with me because you don't if you think i was interested in whether you have a boyfriend i wasn't which doesn't mean if you change your mind about my chances i'll change my mind too fine what brings you you take care of barney today that guy is like a neon sign that reads big trouble right the pilgrim and barney me likey ah it's our brave [ __ ] pilgrim been looking for you drink up cheers uh my throat's sore don't want you to catch anything i'm on [ __ ] touchable the nastiest plagues can kiss my [ __ ] ass hey did you get your radio checked by that dumbass alberto that kook can't ever finish the sentence he starts must have a brain made of swiss cheese show some respect humphrey alberto's a genius with weapons and armor what's your big skill farting into a harmonica and calling him music hey you mangy pricks say your prayers barney's coming and he's gonna kick your derrieres i'll rip out your brains then your hearts huh i'm here how's your radio working now sometimes it works sometimes no roll the dice susie logan i swear i'll tear them apart and eat the pieces [Music] birdie ralph to your health i love you what now do you remember the beginning of the fall aiden vaguely i remember it as if it were yesterday we'd been defending the church against infected for some time my mother was in charge she was losing dozens of people every day she was keeping everyone alive while i was keeping an eye on barney she begged the peacekeepers for help but they ignored her eventually she was injured it was dawn [Music] they led me to her to the roof of the sacristy she saw me and made me promise to look after my brother she said it as if she was lending me a car and asking me to have it returned intact after that she appointed carl as her successor with me at his side you'll grow up to be a far better leader than carl she said but while the world is burning people won't listen to someone so young she was wrong i've been thinking like that all my life but not anymore now i understand my mother you have to be ruthless to be a leader i wasn't ready then i am now i think i know what you're talking about and i know what loss is like talking about someone in particular [Music] about my sister i'm sorry yeah maybe you don't have to be we'll find out that's why you came to town for her yeah sophie we have to talk time to act the quicker we do this the less prepared jack and joe will be aiden aiden and we started on the wrong foot his sip of courage should you be drinking this much before the mission barney me i got the toughest liver in philidor worry more about yourself pilgrim where's sophie there on the rooftop i'm watching you pilgrim i'm not gonna let some morons in the tower [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] interesting apparently the peacekeepers are watching us i'll let them see what happens to jack and joe and that we can do it to them too well you said it was time to act we're acting i sent three scouts towards the camp carl and the crystals must be somewhere

other side and then we'll catch them in a pincer movement if anything goes wrong we retreat to our base where the tango motel [Music] [Music] [Music] change of plans aiden they attacked our safe house
