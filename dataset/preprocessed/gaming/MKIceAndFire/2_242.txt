research at horizon outpost and my cousins rami and alec said they could introduce me to a horizon driver and i guess that's you me hey i'm just here to help thanks juan if we want to gather data from inside a sandstorm first we have to find one let's tour the region you want to drive or should i you're the scientist i'd better drive some desert landmarks will be helpful if we get hit with poor visibility i can take survey data on the way welcome to bajia de plano but sandstorms don't come from the ocean let's move on and step on it when you step on it you step on it my friend [Music] so [Music] hey it's the baja circuit do you think the university needs geographical data on local race tracks definitely now let's turn back for the coast and head south [Music] they say sandstorms here can get moy malok dark skies wind gusts up to 100 kilometers per hour so that might be why we want to drive into one uh because it would be really really cool also for the science very very important science right now i remember if you get caught in a sandstorm just head west until your feet are wet [Music] [Music] it's a popular tourist destination maybe i'll come back during semester break time to head inland the university asked me to check out some strange grub formations [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's enough for one day time to get the raw data back to the university muy now you have your bearings for when we find that big sandstorm i'll keep an eye on the forecast and give you a call fingers crossed [Music] hey me amigo still working on this desert weather survey for the university can you beat me be right there hey champion that's it it's time for an adventure here's the thing it's not all about expansion we also want to build our existing outposts with bigger race programs and more events expeditions into the unknown or new adventures in our own backyard the canyon would be perfect for our pr stunt outpost horizon rush sounds good no [Music] finally jamin might leave me alone romero's in charge of the expedition but he said something about stopping by a party [Music] amigo it's interesting we're planning this expedition now do you know what else is coming up

the place where papa fernando lefty for us to find or the baja where he did all his off-road racing what do you think that's where this all started come and meet me [Music] turn around when it is safe to do so in 100 meters [Music] [Applause] [Music] turn right in 400 meters turn right [Music] turn right original condition just like when it rolled out of la fabrica in the 60s you like it that's a classic look what about the upgrades though don't worry all the upgrades are safe we can put them back on anytime i wanted to take a nice picture of the car ah yes natural habitat of the vulture [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] this was the first beetle in my family but it wasn't the last i own one ramir owned one baby this sounds stupid but maybe we carry the spirit of our papa fernando with us you know or maybe it's just a mexican thing it's really nice alejandra probably a mexican thing too though definitely a mexican thing come on come on get the photo already [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these desert skies were perfect i was thinking the same thing [Music] if it wasn't black and white it could be papa fernando on race day i want to say muchisimas gracias for everything we always put up a fernando's picture on the ofrena fer dia de los muertos this year i have a lot to say to him tell him the boccio is in safe hands it will be papa fernando says the wacho belongs to me now i can do whatever i want with it so i'm giving it to you what alley no just promise you'll always bring it back to my garage now get out of here and i have some ideas to work on i'll call you [Music] [Applause] [Music] all these adventures look amazing glad i don't have to pick one um [Music] great they're filming for the new vanguard force movie and the star frankie raymond was asking around for you i still don't think the two of you look anything alike but frankie really seems to need your help [Applause] me [Music] you have arrived at your destination people usually say they want a cavania by the ocean you're the only one who wants a cavania by the baja what's not to love listen to this my great aunt used to work for the government and she says there was a classic car built right here in mexico so many of them it should be easy to find one [Music] [Applause] wow it's like looking in a mirror right i mean the perfect stunt double is an identical twin you said you wanted some driving lessons get in let's go so there's a new movie vanguard force 10. yeah i've seen the teasers and i had fun driving stunts in the last one right the director is insisting we do our own stunts this time round so i need to get decent after the standard you set on the last one have to do your own stunts well let's see what we can do that's uh the stockholm slide so [Music] we've already started filming it's hopeless i'll never impress victor garcia hernandez as a driver or legitimate dramatic actor actually i have an idea since you know there's a bit of resemblance here what if we don't tell anyone and and hang on you do the driving and i do the acting i think we could pull that off i've got a stunt coming up get the costume on and pretend to be me turn around when it is safe to do so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] ah it's a renault catrell that makes sense in the 60s there was a banana import so the government allowed them to be built here gracias for finding it i'll get it running shouldn't take long these things are indestructible [Music] [Applause] don't sweat the dialogue mate we'll get that later you just focus on your driving okay mike will do mate come see me after we cut i'll get you some lozenges or something scene 15 downhill escape stunt sequence faction righto victor and this is the very first shot of the movie yeah no intro just straight in with the car chases you're the genius very good mike i'm in the helicopter i look forward to seeing what our driver can do that was mike steele he does the stud direction while victor is the overall director it seems like he bought it obstacles ahead you haven't done this before just keep your foot down and take the hit okay not my first time [Music] now keep a tight line through here i'm about victor but that looks mint to me [Music] victor's in the aerial unit says he likes to have a god's eye view hang on we'll put him on we are the stuff that dreams are made of my friends mako is our canvas the car our paintbrush and vanguard force head will be our masterpiece let's go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] 400 meters turn left [Music] turn left [Music] and

through it give it brilliant i haven't seen that kind of driving for years yes and now through the resistance cap let nothing stand in your way wonderful frankie that's amazing you truly grasp the essence of the character [Music] victor's notoriously difficult to please but he loves your driving frankie ready for the next setup c-25 one flew over cobalt's nest action now the supplies are delivered alex cobalt must escape not from aliens but from a fantastic gloria fears and doubts tracing all the way back through everything you have experienced i don't know what a phantasmagoria is but i've worked a rally v8 in that thing so give it the guts barricades and ramps ahead keep your speed up hard turn onto some winding roads up ahead [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and cut ah where on earth did you learn to drive like that frankie so i have some ideas for some improvisation we could do a scene along the beach or around the airplane graveyard i'm not sure which so you choose along the beach yeah i can think of some stunts turn left [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] you have arrived at your destination victor has handed this one off to me he's working on something new for the ending and that has me worried anyways go for it frankie and let's get this one improv c beach rush action we've got debris along the beach dodge that and keep away from the houses otherwise there's people who have to edit it all out digitally frame by frame brilliant kid i mean frankie sorry don't know why i said kid there [Music] um [Music] i think mike is on to us what no way my sore throat story is flawless [Music] [Applause] [Music] cut right i'll take this footage to victor wait till he sees what his superstar sorry movie star can do [Music] right got another stunt drop by when you have a look [Music] hey champion sorry to bother a future hall of famer but can i have your input on this next adventure [Music] dude it never asked alex has been talking golden ideas for weeks i'll call him hola amigo have you heard of the i've just been told about another barn find nearby shall we go find it i can't believe i'm saying this but that's about all i can think

driver yeah bien hereford las barrancas i'll explain on the way [Music] [Applause] so what are we looking for my favorite book is called el camino the sydney wolverson about an explorer who traveled mexico 200 years ago in her book she described these as land fishing around giant statues but there aren't supposed to be any of those near here giant statues from an old book that aren't supposed to exist yes i've been piecing together clues from the book do you think you can get this car right into the river at the bottom of the copper canyon you really don't know me very well uh [Music] [Music] so so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] that is incredible how has no one ever found this before according to the book there is a statue at el arco de cabo san lucas wolverstone said she found it at sunset but i thought we could try an experiment i've worked out where the book says the statue should be we can set out and reach the area around mid-morning and see what we can find or the other option is we get to elarco just as the sun sets if you believe the story that's when we'll find the statue right we've got another stunt drop by when you have a moment [Applause] [Music] in 400 meters turn left [Applause] turn left [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] i see bmw too old to be made in mexico though we should take it to the diet so i can get a better look call you soon all right bmw let's see what we've got here [Applause] [Music] in 400 meters turn right [Applause] [Applause] you have arrived at your destination well well well if it isn't the two masterminds caught in the act can't believe i didn't recognize your driving sooner kid mike glad you're here how do you like this uh this dummy the art department made it's um it's very realistic save it frankie this is a brilliant idea but if you're gonna keep victor in the dark you'll need my help it's nice to be working with you again mike you can talk i never expected that look get in the car we've got a big jump to do scene 43 time travel volcano jump action uh mike did you just say volcano jump come on now kid i saw the opening ceremony hammer it up the hill kid that stunt vehicle is a mic steel special custom engine and suspension [Music] why it's nice to have a real driver at the wheel i heard that [Music] there we go well done frankie brilliant well done but we keep this between us yeah no need for victor to know hey superstar we're showing off and come collect this renault before i take it for a spin hey there kid we've got a new stunt set up drop by when you can [Music] turn right [Music] [Applause] hey there frankie no no don't talk we have to protect that nice bankable accent of yours get in the car i'll explain the stunt as we go scene 68 dr strange guard action careful up ahead watch the turn hang on there i'm in here too oh corner ahead through here and keep the speed up oh blindly victor's on the phone keep it tight kid victor said you're still frankie's driving is exceptional as always but uh why did i just catch a glimpse of another frankie relaxing in his trailer with a mug of lemon tea oh that was a dummy it's a stunt dummy gotta go victor bye hey i always have a role in the movies i make i was pursuing beast number two in the one we made in the uk the one that ran into the wall i loved that very funny captain silent protagonist now drive nicely done it's good to be working with you again frankie oh too close by half let's get this done kid we have a small problem on vanguard meet me and frankie when you [Music] can 400 meters turn right you have arrived at your destination the director was asking why i'm not doing my lines in the stunt sequences don't worry about it frankie i'll cover for you hey kid you're ready for the next set sure what's the stunt talk me through this what's my motivation so it's a race basically gonna outrun the pursuit car i can explain mike and that is an excellent accent frankie uh you have hidden dabs this is an escape of course the self-replicating control system is intent on stopping you it has commandeered a pursuit vehicle you must escape it if it helps imagine the pursuit vehicle has a number of hilarious lines of dialogue but even emerging as the true star of this movie [Music] [Music] well done this is gonna look great and there we go that's done only one more stunt to do i'll call you when we're set up [Music] hey kid next scene set up maybe with the stunt unit [Applause] it's time to expand what are we doing next [Music] couldn't agree more i'll tell alex the title [Applause] [Music] you have arrived at your destination right this is the last shot we need to get should be easy what could go wrong scene 107 data offload stunt sequence action right we've got other stunt drivers in traffic vehicles dodge and weave and get to the destination as quick as you can [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] and this is where we bring the pieces together past present future messages and themes come across the franchise coming together not resolved never resolved don't worry about all our past present themed stuff let's just get this done before he rumbles us [Music] [Music] turn right [Music] turn around [Applause] [Music] turn around when it is safe to do so [Music] hmm coming up on the destination now just get there there we go cut and print it there stunt units are wrapped on vanguard force 10. it's up to victor in the editing booth now he's not the type of director to change his mind or ask for re-suits or anything like that right mike's going off the deep end something about product placement can you drop by easy frankie i'm on my way [Music] there's a new scene apparently we need to take advantage of the presence of a major cultural event to root the story in the zeitgeist uh zai what now get in the car kid i'll scene explain um something at the festival florid kid straight through the festival hear the jumps apparently the scene's got to go right through the middle of a race or something tell scott tyler not to flop his lines this time wait wait we're putting the festival in the movie and scott tyler's got lines that's right kid up through here head for the rap cue the drivers cue scott going the wrong way this is dramatic and unexpected you got tyler by the way here we go there's cars coming the other way so watch it that was close what now this is very improvised [Music] you're doing good now out the far side keep the speed up victor wanted frankie to drive this [Music] [Applause] so there we go that has to be enough for him right right kid we're back in it get here when you can another stuff i'll be right there turn around when it is in 400 meters you will arrive at your destination hey there so i just got off the phone with the director and he wants one more stunt and not just any stunt he wants me to jump across the bay being chased by a cargo plane and there's dialogue all over it so no driver swapping i think it's time we fessed up to victor hang on if we can't swap drivers why don't we swap cars with one waiting in the motorway tunnel right i need props and another hero car do we even have another hero car yes we do the one that was too fast for anyone to drive i'll get it ready over at the bridge i'll do the first section and you take over at the tunnel we can do this frankie just drive casual now frankie it is time we must close the loop combine the dimensions and transform this conflict into art got a bad feeling about this see you are being torn apart from the inside it's almost as if there is another alex cobalt straining fighting to take control understand and find go go quick i can't act and drive at the same time the plane's spinning up get to the airfield go go go the car's a bit of a handful this is the high power what victor asked for but we never used so uh enjoy whoa this thing can move [Applause] uh we need a line here i think uh frankie would you provide something for me please uh i have to return to the future cc it will be in you capture the conflict perfectly [Applause] i mean i love my life [Applause] not bad i mean i have a few notes what frankie said just hit that jump but not the plane i love my life [Applause] and cut you did it we did it we actually bleeding did it amazing both of you i couldn't tell from watching the feeds amazing work great driving and i mean reasonable acting too that bmw is the 2002 turbo very rare get down here [Music] [Music] hi no storms on the horizon just yet lo siento while we're waiting how would you like to throw a desert flyer around some sand dunes might as well now let's demonstrate some physics no i should say i've also set up some important scientific equipment for you great more things for me to smash well if you must i'm sure we could use the data perfecto the last subtraction can cause a phenomenon you call oversteer an effective demonstration of newton's third law this is excellent practice for driving in poor visibility you mean if there's a sandstorm when there is a sandstorm my friend i have seen the satellite pictures trust me clearly this is a lesson on the shape of a parabola [Music] [Music] commonly known as the kangaroo skill [Music] ah the numbers are looking good show me more andale excellente i'll get the numbers to the university and the video to my friends at horizon pienecho be ready for the call according to the weather service it's going to be a big one ah count me in oh i will call you soon dry conditions in the baja region wind increasing this is it my friend this is it get down here i'm coming i'm coming [Music] [Applause] you have arrived at your destination [Music] one i got here as fast as i could not fast enough to get in those vamonos this storm is forming over there winds up to 110 kilometers per hour and can't you go any faster sure what do we do we get there you know science let's just get there there it is the sandstorm full speed ahead straight into the middle okay cc did the university equipped us with sensors we'll be gathering data the whole way are you lost or are you smashing things on purpose going this fast what we can see making superstars proud okay if our data is correct we have to take it off road so [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] you can't get much closer to a sandstorm that we just got my friend with our data the university will be able to track weather patterns much more accurately so drivers can avoid sandstorms in the future why would you avoid them they're awesome [Music] okay we'll check out el arco de cabo san lucas and see if it matches the book let's get there fast you've read my mind so there they're there down onto the beach as the book says we found the statue by the ark looking out across the pacific in the warm light of the setting sun hmm i don't see it huh well let's get some lunch and try back later in the day [Music] oh boy i told you that was the best place to eat around here was i wrong aye okay we need to get going can you get us to the beach before the sun sets you may not run the sun yep i think i can do that even with the extra helping of tres leches [Music] [Music] my definitely out running the sun now down to atlanta before we lose the light and get your camera ready there it is right in the sun where the book said grab a picture of it right that is freaking me out it's right there how did we miss it the shadows were really deep just here earlier maybe we just didn't see it but now i really want to see if we can find any more of these mysterious statues [Music] whatever you all i've been reading the diary over and over i think lady sydney's exposition came inland but i jose jose it's hard to find the evidence hey champion sorry to interrupt your hall of fame chase but we need to pick an adventure you wait till you see this showcase i have the train and conductor on standby all i need now is driver in 200 meters turn right the expedition must have traveled up river i still can't believe this i used to take the book to me escuela and my teachers told me lady wolverstone's adventures were as fictional as pedro baramo or sherlock holmes so she never got any credit never asked for any she said she was writing stories for her grandchildren but if they're true our story deserves to be told and you and i can prove it let's go we can start in the center of town and move outwards [Music] [Music] lady sydney writes at a local bruja a wise woman said the statues were only visible on certain days in the rain because they are statues of zlaloc i still think it's the trees hiding it but call me when you work out the next location okay hey amiro haley called to ask about the promo shots but when i told her about the diary she said they could wait come pick me up we need to go to awasul i'll be right over 400 meters [Music] in 100 meters turn right [Music] recalculating route 100 meters turn left have arrived at your destination we might get a little wet i'll keep the windows closed okay okay okay ah let me translate this part [Music] cool waters of our soul quenched our thirst and inspired our hearts in the heart of the blue water is where we found them okay are we looking for more than one statue and in the heart of the blue water what does that mean so the question is why was the diary of lady sydney wolverstone published as fiction she was really here she she really had aventuras all over mexico maybe she didn't want to be famous or maybe she didn't think anybody would believe her [Music] we'll turn off the road near the waterfalls um [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] hmm oh the pictures are good and you know having pictures means no one can doubt us if we can find the statues again hey champion festival setup is looking pretty good right i don't know i think we have a few more adventures in us and you want to put a bow on your hall of fame run right [Music] this is big i have our next lead meet me as soon as you can [Music] you've arrived at your destination i found more of lady sydney's papers or regional drafts of el camino she made pencil sketches of formations that i recognized in the valle de la rana's and she sketched one of the statues lead the way okay okay so uh fantastic creatures carved in rock and she found a statue early one morning and get this it was after a rainstorm and this is another statue of travel that is interesting let's see if we can find it valley of the frog so i always thought the stones looked more like fantastical creatures and ladies it needs to do she got sketches in her book [Music] explorers like lady sydney came all this way with nothing but ghanas for the wilds of mexico she sounds like someone i know i shoot cars for the festival you do all the work and my ride is a lot faster than her wagons no we have slightly more than one horsepower oh my suppose reading el diario is one of the reasons i became una photographer i wanted to capture the same ideas [Music] is one of the most visited natural wonders in mexico lady sydney definitely knew a marvel when she saw one but the guidebooks don't say anything about talalok's that you hear [Music] turn right [Music] i cross reference the final pages of the book with all the other papers i could find and it's egg balaam it has to be lady sydney wolverstone's expedition headed south to egg malam i've been to ekbalam i know the way it was only properly studied in the 90s but we know very little about it actually in fact researchers are divided on exactly how much of what we know about the tortex is historical and how much is aztec legend so why are we going to egg balance and not tiller oliver stone's book doesn't call it ekbala of course but she describes a large group of buildings perhaps 20 or more and a large oval palace and listen to this three large statues of the sort i have found in other places three i'm pretty sure only two no that's not all she also wrote the third largest of them in the same stone i have come to recognize laid to the south of the complex only fairly visible in the driving rain let's get there before the rain stops then [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] it's been fun though i do feel like there should have been treasure at the end of it when maybe the treasure was the friends so that's that there's one more thing according to the book wolverson took a jade statue from the site but lost it in a flash flood i'll try and work out where that was i'll call you as soon as i know now i'm intrigued cool mia hey champion you know what time it is where to next [Music] one juggernaut coming right up i'll tell jade to make it a good one hola amigo i went to a drag race meetup last night and i talked to some mechanicals about the latest rumors i think you're gonna like this one yes you did it horizon rush is complete now if you'll excuse me i have a date with several drips [Music] [Applause] i am gonna set the ultimate trailblazer room actually i'm gonna stick down two gates and you're gonna set the ultimate room it'll be wicked [Music] you have arrived at your destination all right let's get going the sun's setting but we have enough time to get there along the beach i'm excited do you think we'll find it to be honest i don't know but i'm getting the sense that there's more to mexico than meets the eye um [Music] did you know sydney wolverstone was also a um a natural historian and a pretty decent artist you want to talk about just read about your life [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] the book describes several sites for sydney wolverstone found statues she believed they weren't aspect though which is interesting because they look tall deck to me but even that isn't really clear we know so little about the doltech about the whole pre-conquest era in fact there are so many undiscovered sites so much forgotten history in mexico so many things we don't know about the people who've lived here for thousands of years [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] there it is ah interesting the design doesn't seem entirely acidic but it does remind me of plaloft the rain god this is amazing i'll work out where the next one should be and give you a call where does the trail lead from here south and england i'm sure i'll be in touch [Music] [Music] 100 meters turn left [Music] [Applause] you have arrived at your destination [Applause] [Music] the titan right let's get out there and finish this cross-country program with a bang [Music] so so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] so my hey [Music] [Music] so so [Applause] [Music] thanks yes how can you not love cross-country racing but you have such

faster come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome to the gauntlet get ready to throw down oh [Music] [Music] [Music] hello [Music] [Music] [Music] nice [Music] [Music] so so [Music] the worst um

in guanajuato you have arrived at your destination [Music] [Applause] now i know you've raised trains before in the uk but watch out for this conductor i've never seen someone so competitive best of luck i've never seen someone so competitive best of luck [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh i'm not sure if they're allowed to be dropping carriages but it's certainly going to give the engine an advantage oh yeah we'll see about that so [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] amazing don't worry i'll talk to the conductor might be able to use them on the festival roster actually perhaps driving something a little lighter [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] rami nice ride i have to look good for my old compadres and i thought what looks better than beating a horizon superstar into your hometown first of the basilica wins [Music] let's do this so there's a bit of a street scene around here maybe back then i was just a little kid learning to drive with my mommy and my eos i couldn't even reach the pedals [Music] but you know they do say that the most fierce street racer in all of mexico comes from guanajuato ah do they really see they say he's never lost a race who knows if he'll make an appearance at horizon and does this beard street racer have a name oh many names [Music] you might meet him one day but not if you can't even beat me into them coming off of guanajuato wait till you see the scene at night [Music] welcome to city in mexico the name means shield of rocks that's no very straight razor but you've never seen a frog at top speed superstar turn up turn up i'm sorry folks that's okay the tunnels were built to keep the city from floating but they are perfect for el jefe and the local street racers oh and watch for traffic these streets can get busy but i've heard the racers find it adds to the challenge and i mean so i've heard [Music] [Music] oh you're on the final stretch the massive guy's just around the corner i wish i'll have fake it cs now oh he can my friend now get across the finish line [Applause] [Music] the basilica racers come here to ask our lady for her blessing you know i might be able to contact him jeffy i hear he's

be furious and my uncle carlos would challenge me to a race before every family meal well you can't keep street scene a secret anymore you're going to have to show these racers how it's done they've never been part of a festival before so they'll learn fast lessons give the people what they want and what do the people want someone willing to win the rules [Music] [Music] and we have company meet my compadres when we started this meetup we were just a few kids racing around the northwest since then the racers the engines the particle ground a little bit [Music] sorry about all the mystery by

[Applause] you have work at your destination thank you for coming now first the university wants us to map out the city ready to take a tour in a gr supra absolutely now this might be an intimate tour

technology i would like that very much [Applause] good to see you the university is trying to improve response times on the speed zones outside guanajuato and horizon street scene are trying to break them sounds about right let's make sure the speed zone can handle it the competition is tough out here follow the route and show everyone what you've got we can do it speed by example let's hope you're driving is better than your plums i called it a favor from prima ale so you should have enough horses in the gr supra more than enough bubbles [Music] check this out check this out precede um so so so [Music] coming up on the speed zone almost [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] these numbers are very impressive my friend nice work one thing is for certain the university engineers will

to come down here and settle it me well okay [Applause] you have arrived at your destination you got here just in time the university is working on an improved gps but the street racers say it will never be as good as local knowledge i've programmed the route using ana but you're going to try to find shortcuts i'll watch the telemetry and evaluate it using an efficiency algorithm does that make sense tech versus god speaking of gods has been working on the gr supra yeah i noticed again again much faster so might be able to shave off a few seconds [Music] [Music] [Music] according to the telemetry and my efficiency algorithm that was a lot of fun especially street racers have their shortcuts but without gps technology there'd be nothing to compare well i'll let you get back to the streets adios i i try not to take sides [Music] [Music] what does our favorite superstar have to say about their name up in lights i'm speechless actually it's funny you took more than any other horizon driver i've ever met but you know what i'll just say you're not finished yet the festival playlist is full of exclusive rewards and drivers who've given anything to line up against a legend
