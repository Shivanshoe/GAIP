it began as always with the desire for power the need to conquer the hunger to consume inevitably this led to conflict humanity fought an endless battle against herself until it was forced to unite against a power far greater than it had ever but even united humanity left only destruction in its wake despite their best efforts at survival the humans of sierra continued to march blindly to their imminent doom unaware that their misguided attempts at retaliation were only leading them ever closer to extinction they had thought as crippled by their weapons of mass destruction but to survive is to endure and prosper and we have most certainly survived jacinto now stands as the last bastion of humanity a final desperate difference in the face of impossible art in a way i pity them that humanity as always brought this war upon itself [Applause] it never ends they're getting bolder those gears regarding pomeroy depot damn that's just down the road exactly they're moving deeper every

but it is a fight we cannot continue humanity faces extinction unless we end this war now so why land down sergeant why not just drill down here jacinto is a one place it can't dig through and land down's a perfect spot to hit them on their own turf heard there's a shitload of grubs there sergeant more like ten shitloads we had hoped the light mass bombing would decimate the locust that they survived and have returned stronger than ever they brought with them a force that can sink entire cities even jacinto our last beacon of hope through all these dark days is now at risk soon we'll have nothing left to defend and that means we have only one option attack gears what i ask of you now is not an easy thing but it is necessary if we are to survive if we are to live long enough to see the seasons pass our children grow and experience a time of peace that we have never known we must now take this fight to the locust we will go to where they live and where they breed and we will destroy them this is the day we take the battle to the heart of the enemy this is the day that we correct the course of human history this is the day we ensure our survival and the species soldiers of the

botanist give me that control you have any info on this thing it looks like a big snake or a worm made of stone recent intel lists it as a rockworm not sure if it's dangerous but we do know it's an indigenous cave creature that feeds on plants flowing plants right we've had reports that those are one of its main food sources we've also been told that the worms are nearly indestructible apparently gunfire doesn't affect them at all she's right that thing's not even paying attention to you marcus you think dizzy and ty made it up there i don't know i hope so ty's as tough as a broom up though so if anyone could make it it'd be him so who the hell was that screaming locust guy anyway no idea crazy bastard cut through a freaking tank though it's gotta be a locust big shot or something what like rom maybe but he made rum look like a goddamn pushover which way marcus sweet you take the rook right i'll take the high road left fine man good to go oh man [Music] [Music] man i was expecting a base here or something well maybe it's just a staging area probably a base down deeper sarge yeah you really think we're gonna see the surface again yeah yeah kid i do seismic activity

seismic activity control this is delta control do you read me control guess we're too deep whatever that was it's gone let's go one thing i still don't understand have the locust been down here like forever or what who knows man this one guy in basic he thought they were from rasaya or one of the moons and that they feed on emulsion hey marcus you ever seen him eating emotion they can eat and die for all i care [Music] down here something else to shoot i think it's safe to say that's not a natural k formation you were wondering where they come from carmine [Music] what are these guys i don't care just shut them up use the worms for cover oh okay uh okay let's move out i don't see any movement up ahead but let's split up and get the drop on anyone who's there [Music] come on marcus shoot

through that routine again proper access will prevent unexpected and most unpleasant occurrences i assure you after all we don't need you running around and plugging into random computer terminals do we now command this is delta are you getting this i see it phoenix but we're not pulling up anything on it it's like it doesn't exist off the record you are completely in confidential territory now your guest is as good as mine roger that dealt out screwed jack plug in and see what you can find maybe one of these terminals will have some intel on this place and where the hell we can find the

little less wacko though [Music] subjects who's he talking about don't will be leaving know the semi-sentient security system to walk over the facility i would hate for anyone to disclose and we were all like the laser opportunity to study them as they grew i'm almost up to admit that the security system is based off of another person jack what just happened what the hell was that nothing good i would begin exiting the facility if i were you i tried to warn you now it appears that could be very problematic [Applause] they're trying to get out should we be trying to help them i don't think so we don't know what's in there it could be something contaminated or worse what the hell are these things of course didn't you win the abstract before your arrival good those are irreplaceable

want to be anywhere else i think i take the tropical island so now what now we gotta get into the palace and find that queen let's move delta that's the palace i'm guessing this will lead us to it worth a shot man still don't get how they could have built all this so fast i still don't know how long they've been down here and all this emulsion are they thriving off of it maybe but that queen of theirs keeps talking about reaching the surface on the surface speaking of the devil reavers no shoot them down before they knock this off the cable nuts let's do this so [Music] nice can't get a

me get this straight the regular locusts are fighting the glowing locust i thought they were all on the same side i was wondering why we were doing so well well that explains their desperation in the raids they're losing their home turf to the land get back into cover grinder never give up my children you are sarah saviors they're definitely fighting another war down here good thing too i have a feeling we wouldn't have lasted this long without some help behind you bring it don't those things explode yeah usually keep your distance uh [Music] [Music] next [Music] uh [Music] here comes some

that's a lot of juice oh man don't start with that juice water shall again fire good to go should be about halfway to the bottom like i think so escape my god good to go who's next gotcha [Music] guards down in front fine now check this out looks like what the queen keeps yapping about so we know they're trying to sink jacinto it sounds like it'll flood the hollow why would they do that they're desperate all this time we never realized that jack plug in and see what you can find we cannot allow  you hear that you could be ass are going down like way down get down shoot down you ain't gonna even know which ways huh your ass is gonna be glad to your skin ass queen oh mommy you let the bad man hurt us you we gonna whoop your momma's ass whoa there we go one muscled queen not you her you were great i love your your speech there especially with the bitch-ass stuff very good very enlightening jack anything there appears to be only one way to end this war i fear the cost may be too is that who i great it is i think so if we were to sink jacindo with seawater nothing below would survive we could end the war today but only if we sacrifice our last possible refuge who's that talking adam phoenix he's my father what but what's he doing in the locust computers we'll figure that out later look my father and the locus queen are saying the same thing it's just a matter of timing we need to sink jacinto before the locusts leave not after can we even do that marcus i know it's your dad and all but listen to what you're saying consider it a backup plan if we can't get to the queen jack see if you can send the data back to command tell them we found another way to put the locus down for good keep moving delta [Music] 83. the cold tree cold knock it off if the locust queen's down here then we're gonna have enough problems as it is we need to be careful and quiet oh man come on could i resist that same team split up [Music] behind the wall we can use uh i know hmm

door we've got no points you're the first humans to ever desecrate this palace with your presence it's her and i assure you you will most certainly be the last that's the locus queen if you're planning on flooding the hollow then i guess we would be the last yes there you destroyed the riftworm there are still ways for us to sink jacinta you will perish along with the lambert not if we sink at first scourge informed me of your plan to sink jacinto before us i'm afraid it won't work don't be so sure oh but i am we already have an army on route to jacinto to prevent that from happening tell me is it true you're the son of adam phoenix what's it to you he spoke highly of you it's a shame that you didn't follow his powers the hell are you talking about it no longer matters scourge destroy them there go go after the queen [Music] take cover stop i need your help with those tickers [Music] watch the stalactites oh wow [Applause] other side heads up take cover [Applause] dom i

delta here we lost the queen did you get the data from jack affirmative delta evacuations are underway but we're currently under siege roger that the queen is sending everything she's got to stop us from seeking jacinto we're gonna do it we gotta do it now understood we're working as fast as we can are you able to assist we're close and on our way on you delve down watch the dream there comes

have a plan to sink jacinto almost we're finalizing the logistics now when you first sent this information sergeant phoenix i thought you were insane it seemed to have that effect on people but it looks like your father was right all this time imagine that locust troops have reached the courtyard we're on it now without me you aren't if this is jacinto's last stand i'm not sending it out fair enough the base is under attack approaching the south platform hmm damn it i gotta rape heads up uh wait please respond immediately take position along the south flank copy control we're on our way

attack we need your assistance immediately let's get a move on delta we lose those towers all of our forces lose contact and this fluvar situation gets worse in a hurry listen to me you better make it use the turret we can't lose so sergeant phoenix locusts have just broken through the main gates got it we're on our way control camarey is secure we're heading to the main gates roger delta make sure they don't reach command patrol we're gonna need air support here asap sorry colonel nothing's available right now all ravens are now evacuating or prepping for the bomb drop hey colonel i guess we are the support huh looks that way sergeant let's get to it um uh right rumored [Music] uh [Music] control main gate secure we're heading back built out so what's our status we have a plan but it's not going to be easy we've identified an underground cavern near the locust sinkhole we believe that a strategically placed light mass bomb can give jacinta its final push what's the catch due to cedar and nemesis infestation we're unable to get a chopper down there to deliver the bomb we need someone to clear the target area and by someone you mean us baird coal i want you two to assist with the light mass bomb dom looks like we're heading back underground [Music] snipers get down gotcha we're gonna have to flush him out of here to make it to the sinkhole looks like there are two ways in you want to split up yeah let's go for it ah behind the prey [Music] [Applause] let's get to the rear gate of the complex that'll lead us to the sinkhole yes taking fire oh uh [Music] nice oh yeah grinder [Music] nice um that's better good night good to go hey bring it [Music] charged [Applause] nice listen to [Music] uh us great drag out control we're through the archives building and are now

and get me across nice that's not what i had in mind but that'll work died hey hmm good to go rock and low taker in your home um good to go uh  can barely see a thing what's your status ah we're about halfway down the sinkhole we're still trying to figure out how to get to the bottom copy that we've almost finished loading the bomb onto the chopper they should be headed in your direction within minutes hopefully we'll be in place by the time they get here i'll report in when we've made it to the tunnels below delta out dom you all right all good marcus [Music] oh um let's do this behind the crate we need to get to that building on the other side all the way across if not again [Music] check it out let's get down there suck it up ah tanker firing on the building grab hold of something keep moving this place isn't gonna last long [Music] unbelievable you need to get around to the side of it take out the driver keep your head down oh [Music] let's get over there and finish it off but we could ride it and speed this whole operation up rivers were one thing but a brewmach they can ride them so can we delta here we've hijacked the brew mark so that we can what we're riding a blue mark we're gonna use it to clear the area faster okay roger control out i've got the guns so smash the doors everytime come on grinder so take out that let's clear it out so one at the other um one

me anya come in anya all that you held dear all that you held close is washed away into the sea of distant memory i'm sorry marcus [Music] life is cruel of this i have no doubt but life continues on with or without you [Music] one can only hope that one leaves behind a lasting legacy but so often the legacies that we leave behind are not the ones that we intended this is adam phoenix is anyone out there can you hear me [Applause] this is adam phoenix can you hear me what have you done [Music] so you
