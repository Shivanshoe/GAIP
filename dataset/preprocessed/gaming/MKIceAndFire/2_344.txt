[Music] [Music] in ages long past it was believed that mother dana was indestructible and everlasting [Music] rena on the other hand was thought to be the domain of the gods a paradise where the souls of the departed could rest forevermore oh how wrong we were in the face of rena's unimaginable technology its soldiers clad in huge shining armor and its fearsome beasts known as zoogles the prosperity and bounty of dana all but disappeared overnight that was 300 years ago the world of dana fell under ren and rule and its new masters split the land into five distinct realms and now today orbis calaglia one of the renin's five realms [Music] it is ruled over by the tyrant balsev lord of the firemaster corps [Music] unrelenting fire scorches this barren wasteland storms course over the rocks and cracks and no relief is to be found from the oppressive heat the danon people toil as slaves day after day they suffer under the ruthless oppression of the renin soldiers with only one hope of escape death only in death is their agony finally brought to an end they have forgotten what it means to be free so complete is the renin's domination [Music] [Music] [Music] oh yeah you call that pushing put them back into an embedded [Music] iron mask why you let me what is this some kind of slave support group mind your own business you work all right third squad time to regroup [Music] go on get moving hey wait for me thank you iron mask that's okay cool are you hurt no i'm fine iron mask you you're bleeding we need to get you looked at by doc that bad huh better safe than sorry i suppose i doubt doc's gonna like what he sees ah you again sorry to trouble you doc hmm look after yourself and there'd be no need for sorry's wood there now sit so still unable to remember anything i take it blank as always nothing but that strange dream no face no memories unable to feel pain you're only too eager to take on everybody else's what will we do with you here let me see you may not be able to feel pain but that doesn't mean you can't be wounded just like everyone else if you're not more careful you'll wind up dead without even realizing it one of these days i watched another slave die today more corpses than i care to count unfortunately that's hardly a rare sight around these parts denons are always dying and the reddens just watch how long can this continue why doesn't anyone stand and fight keep your voice down will you uh if only it were so simple my friend there have certainly been uprisings all right three centuries worth of the damn things as for all the good they've done take a look around and judge for yourself there that should just about do it now do me a favor and try to stay out of trouble so the wound doesn't open again duck back when i knew nothing you were the one who taught me just how things work around here you know i'll always be grateful for that but i can't just the race is won by the calm and the steady you're still young and you have time wait for the right moment both for yourself and the world work will be wrapping up for the day soon enough don't sit around here go out and feel the breeze against your skin even a slave's entitled to that just do me a favor and keep a low profile alright you stand out enough in that mask as it is [Music] yes i'll go back to my room [Music] [Music] i'm a slave just like everyone else here so how come i don't have a spirit core or face or memories for that matter not like worrying about it'll change anything so i should get some rest i wonder how many people have slept in this bed before me mine for now but for how long tomorrow's another day i guess i should get some jedi [Music] i better head to work so i've got business with the freight train today huh great great time to start another day toiling away for the rents am i gonna do this until the day i die look lively slaves let's see some work around here [Music] hmm granar [Music] zephyr she's here [Music] yes [Music] what the hell [Music] come [Music] back ugh the girl's nowhere to be found this hurts hey embedded should you find anything not yet sir what do they expect from us on such short notice hey you're over there go now hurry get moving stay still you cost us a lot of trouble you know now we can do this the easy way or not [Music] uh [Music] [Music] here we are armored soldiers [Music] yes [Music] idiots [Music] come on [Music] [Music] away you go hope you can jump you all missed your chance to become lord which means you lost live and die for me the mighty balsas got that through your skulls now hurry up and bring me on even the drinks lost its appeal someone's in a bad mood lord of woolsey ruler of orbis collaglia ah but it's wild beast you prefer isn't it do forgive me ganabel volkiris what do you want from what i hear you seem to be having some trouble over there in collagula as a fellow lord i merely thought to ask whether i could be of any assistance to you enough with the false pretense i can tell a rat when it's sniffing around forgive me i can only imagine the emotional toll failing to ascend the throne not once but twice must take a most distressing state of affairs shut up it's none of your concern the crown contest is preceding a pace and so quickly i must say it won't be long before the victor is crowned as the new sovereign i look forward to it and you can be sure i won't forget our little chat nor will i until next time [Music] um [Music] where you awake who are you the name's tilsa i'm the medical officer for the crimson crows you're in one of our safe houses crimson crows don't tell me you've never heard of us we're the resistance for the denon people we get in the way of the bright eyes best laid plans the denon resistance i didn't know such a thing existed oh we exist all right though i guess we're not as famous as i thought we were seems like i know more about you than the other way around mr iron mask is it true you can't take that thing off yeah worse is that i don't even know why i'm wearing it that woman i was with oh yeah she's quite the character isn't she zephyr should be interrogating her over in the slammer as we speak you locked her up why why go take a look for yourself if you're so interested [Music] they're interrogating her just what the hell is going on i need to go and find out for myself [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah damn it so it wasn't a lie the slightest touch is like being struck by lightning what are you doing so you're finally awake huh what's going on here what did she ever mind your business so even if you don't mean to hurt somebody if they touch you they get electrocuted huh it doesn't seem to be poison or magic is this the reason bolsef soldiers were after you for the last several days bolsef's forces have been getting pretty restless when we looked into it deeper the word thorns came up over and over again and now we come across miss prickly herself hmm drop the attitude did you really think we wouldn't find out anything about you miss shion imeris that's her [Music] you mean name what you didn't figure it out already yeah that's right this lady's got herself a surname which means one thing she's a remnant our enemy yeah but she was being chased by running soldiers so then why that's exactly what we're trying to figure out after all aside from the clothes they wear there's only one way to tell a demon and that's whether their eyes light up or not ain't that right bright eyes big talk for someone who can't even use astral arts embedded don't you call us embedded look you see the stoner people embedded in me and there isn't one because we gouged them out the day we swore to rise up against your kind this scar is a reminder not to rest until every last one of you is [Music] we dannon's may not be capable of using astral arts but it looks like those thorns of yours won't do you much good in escaping here either still inflicting pain on anyone who comes near you that's one hell of an ability you're wrong do you think this curse is some kind of great ability curse fair enough all i know is bolsef must have his eye on you for a damn good reason until we find out why an ambush they must have tracked us down evacuate his plan hurry and bring the girl if she gives you any trouble wave a spear in her face got it hey iron mask sorry but right now it's everyone for themselves what about you i'm going to welcome our guests don't go dying on me come on move and don't try anything funny [Music] enemy attack an ambush readings are here i have to find an exit and get the hell out of here anyone who can fight grab a weapon damn how did they find out about this place have these kinds of battles been going on this entire time i just didn't know [Music] stop right there oh it's just a denon you there where's the wren and girl who was here well i spit it out i want an answer insurgent how's this for an answer go to hell you dare address a random armored soldier that way i'll show you embedded [Applause] concord died so much for playing nice all right we're up now real fight still i have to do this i won't go quietly [Music] [Music] i won i actually beat one of those running soldiers i've got to keep going i have to survive this no matter what what's this thing you're mine rising library now take this swallow blade rising my bird swallow swallow blade [Music] you're mine [Music] [Music] play one [Music] i hereby detain you in the name of his excellency lord balsam what the you've got some kind of death wish those are armored soldiers you're shut up and get out of here while you still can step aside slave these are renin affairs you're meddling in hey we've got a better chance working together besides i don't much feel like being indebted to a ganon fine suit yourself [Applause] word to the y i call my own [Music] don't expect any promises [Music] rising life [Music] why did you help me what could a danon like you possibly gain from helping a renin like me trust me i have no great love for renin's i guess i'm just not as concerned with hatred as some what have we met somewhere before me friends with a dannon can't say i've had the pleasure well when you put it like that yeah silly question i don't remember anything about my past don't have any clues to go on either not even my own face let me get this straight you don't know what you look like but you thought i might somehow recognize you something like that guess my helping you back there wasn't as self-sacrificing as i made it out to be besides i can't feel pain anyway so it's not like wait you really can't feel pain yeah it's just another thing i don't have no pain no face no memories i only know one thing about myself and that's that i'm a slave what about your name you must have one right iron mask got the name from the person who found me said that this way i wouldn't forget i had a real name out there somewhere i see so where to next outside silly what do you think we fought all this way for [Music] stay sharp we're going in can you even see out of that thing like at all of course i can how else do you think i managed to avoid tripping everywhere i go what is that thing anyway it doesn't look like anything dan and i've ever seen beats me i don't remember anything about my past when i came to i was already wearing it if i could get it off i would damn thing makes it hard to eat i can't scratch my face when it itches it's the worst honestly i'm just impressed you've managed to survive this long looking like that i'm sure you attract attention wherever you go most of the other denons don't pay it any mind it's in everyone's best interest to just keep their heads down focus on their work and pretend they don't notice what about the ren and soldiers didn't they notice the guards they're more the kill first asked questions later type be in the wrong place or step out of line and you're dead mask or no mask that said as long as you keep your head down and don't cause trouble they mostly ignore you honestly sometimes they don't look all that keen to stir up trouble themselves a friend of mine said it's because if they kill us without a good reason it could delay the work and put them behind schedule at that point it'd be their necks on the line you should know more about all that than me though right i don't serve any of the lords but i see what you mean after three centuries of run and rule without much upheaval it's possible the soldiers might be losing their edge all this trouble we've caused might be the first excitement they've had in a while well i don't plan on getting killed for their amusement glad to see you made it i heard you managed to escape but i didn't expect to see old iron mask with you in any case we're all wanted by the renin's it'll be easier for everyone if you both just come with me where are the others they're waiting for us up ahead come on [Music] stay where you are dissidents just look at all these soldiers how badly do they want to destroy this hideout [Music] apprehend the traitor slaughter the rest see one [Applause] [Music] sword [Music] he was embedded within her all along no matter kill her if you have to just retrieve the core [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] you okay your arms oh yeah how about that guess it's just as well i can't feel it huh you're not in agony wait are you serious hold still it's one of my healing arts a sword that sears the hand of he who wields it and a healing r to mend a man numb to pain and a woman whose very touch deals nothing but thank you all right let's route the bastards and finish them off before the surviving stragglers have a chance to regroup iron mask you coming definitely i'm not about to go back all that way alone so i guess you're not planning on releasing me huh sorry you're coming with us in that case there's one thing you should know no one uses that flaming sword without my say-so you needn't worry on that score i doubt many of us could get close to it in the first place or would want to [Music] the blazing sword it just might be strong enough to match the power of a lord no maybe even to surpass it are you sure you're okay what do you mean your wound that soldier nailed you're pretty good not to mention those flames bursting from you they only hit my master core so i'll be fine and the flames weren't even hot it's probably because they're just a manifestation of the astral energy honestly i'm more surprised that you really are incapable of feeling pain did you think i was faking no i believed you i guess seeing you stay calm while bearing those burns to your hands just really made it hit home for me that's ironic i have no problem hurting anyone who touches me but as soon as i try to wield that sword it's me who gets hurt do you wish you were impervious to pain too you realize you could burn your fingers off without even noticing right so what all i need right now is power and up until now i haven't come across anything stronger than that blazing sword the whole time i've been doing this you really don't care what happens to you as long as you get what you're after do you don't talk like you know me you [Music] you're right i don't get you i don't get why you're so quick to throw it all away not when us slaves have never had a choice in whether we lived or died [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] [Music] self-imposed ruler of all calaglia i've never seen it from this close before that's it all right and next to it are the gates of fire take a good long look while you still can that wall is what we've come to tear down the only thing standing between us and freedom freedom let's go [Music] be careful if you get close to a zoogle they'll attack [Music] [Music] don't go [Music] one final push right give him all we got here's a healing [Music] you're quite the gunslinger i have to be in this world don't worry i've got your back [Music] don't fight any enemies you can otherwise avoid all right makes sense if we try to take them all on there'll be no end in sight you sure won't hear me complaining [Music] [Music] take this [Music] everything's coming up zephyr [Music] what a weird store i sense a strange power from it we should gather as many as we can find [Music] this is seems you found something good supplies like that are valuable never overlook them got it i'll remember that [Music] let's stop a moment to catch our breath but i've barely worked up a sweat speak for yourself what do you want a metal doesn't look like we're being followed fail to grab these rare moments of quiet when you can you'll end up regretting it later you're the boss normally we should take turns standing guard but this first time i'll watch over things so you two can rest easy i've never just sat and watched a fire like this before it's surprisingly soothing well aren't you getting comfortable you realize there are still zoogles prowling around out here right ah don't be a spoilsport it's important to let your mind and spirit relax does you a lot more good than you might think zephyr why aren't you concerned about who i am you feeling left out son no it's not that but you said you wanted to fight so that you can live a free man at this point that's all that matters even if it somehow turned out you were a renin it wouldn't be such a big deal oh renin until we know who you are we can't rule anything out besides we've already got xion with us at this point what's one more renin as long as they're on our side so you don't see every renin as an enemy our goal isn't to hunt down and kill all renin's we only arm ourselves as much as we need to to set ourselves free if you can believe it not every danon agrees with what we're doing either are you saying we have enemies among the dennins not quite they're just not up for rebelling per se the thing you have to remember is that everyone has their own path to walk i'm not sure i understand that's okay just focus on what we have to do right now however the time will come when you'll need to decide what to do for yourself zephyr why aren't you concerned you're feeling no you said you wanted a master core huh now i see so that's why balset's cronies were so desperate to catch her is that what it's called the jewel in her chest oh right you don't remember a damn thing do you ah fair enough guess it's time to fill you back in tell me you ever wonder why we dannon's are made to work ourselves to the bone day in day out well when you put it like that i always just assumed we were mining resources for them and don't you think it'd be quicker if they used all that high-powered tech they have why go to all the trouble of relying on weak human labor listen what the renin's are really after isn't resources or minerals it's astral energy [Music] they're harvesting the astral energy that sleeps inside all matter and life forms and they're doing it the same way they have for the past 300 years using us dannon's as mere siphons right they have machines for minerals but extracting from danon's requires spirit course any astral energy collected passes through a spirit vessel on its way to being stored in a master core [Music] but why go to the trouble of collecting all this energy in the first place do they really need all that juice just to use astral arts it determines the sovereign sovereign is that the renin ruler exactly five lords each doing whatever it takes to gather as much astral energy as they can and store it in their master course whichever of them manages to accumulate the most power at the end of their contest is crowned the ruler of the ren and motherland a new crown contest as they call it is held every decade or so so you see the master cores are the receptacles in which the lords store their power and we dannon's are sacrificed so the renins can choose their new ruler that's insane you're telling me that's what our people have been dying for this whole time relax hero you're not the only one who's bent out of shape about the whole thing there are two things that i haven't been able to get my head around yet what business would a renin have stealing a master core and what's the deal with that blazing sword i think the sword is a physical manifestation of the mastercore's astral energy [Music] as for why it took the shape of a sword well i don't know any more than you do honest and that stuff about needing your permission to use it what was that about i'm the only one of us who can control the master core to some extent without me to adjust the flow of astral energy the sword can't take a physical form what do you want out of this you may be one of them but you don't strike me as the ruthless oppressor type i'm going to take down all of the lords [Music] never thought i'd say this but i like the cut of your jib running well as far as we're concerned the struggle continues either way and with that sword on our side our chances of victory just increased that is of course assuming we can count the two of you in fine by me after all it sounds like we're after the same thing anyway i honestly i'm still a little confused by all this but if it's a choice between this or going back to being a slave then i choose to fight then it's settled together we'll overthrow the renin-lords and first up on that chopping block is bolsef the wild beast sound good [Music] uh i've gotta hurry [Music] we have another secret hideout in ulsa back not far from here we should be able to meet up with our comrades there cut it out didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to stare i know i already asked you this but are you sure we haven't met somewhere before what's so hard to understand i'm renin you're dannon there's no way besides i'm from lenegas trust me wherever you were before you lost your memory we've never crossed paths lenigus you mean the same lenigus that's up in the sky i've heard it called the renin's castle but i never imagined people actually lived up there well then where did you think we all lived didn't you see the renan lords descend for the crown contest and how long ago was that well the current contest started seven years ago so then i wouldn't remember just how far back do you remember about a year give or take that's how long ago doc found me one year then no i'm sorry but there really is no way we could have met guess not [Music] huh what's this thing [Music] we should be able to eat this whenever you find some make sure to grab it it's edible huh good to know definitely [Music] what's this thing [Music] that's one enormous stray i don't think we can take it right now [Music] we've almost made it to ulzebec [Music] i'd steer clear of that zoogle if i were you damn for that week huh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] whoa take a look at that whoo-hoo hoo hoo that's an unusual bird it's an owl they're often used as a symbol to represent ancient dana [Music] normally i don't pick on the weak [Music] no time to hold back i'm on it [Music] i'm sure i can put this to use [Music] what's this thing right here goes here i go you're mine [Music] right [Music] it's over [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind [Music] [Music] okay people this is it no sign of any renting guardsmen the rennons aren't as populous as the damons probably figure stationing guards in a place like this would be a waste of precious manpower so this is where the next safe house is yes the last place they think to look for enemies is on their own doorstep that is assuming anyone actually made it here before us zephyr looks like we needn't have worried come on so should this really be here [Music] zephyr you made it see i told you there's no way zephyr would have kicked the bucket fine you were right so what's the plan well we've got an ace up our sleeve and the enemies in disarray i say we strike while the iron's hot so we're finally going head-to-head with bolsef that's right we can't afford to mess this up it's now or never then now it is we've all been waiting for this day for far too long leave the plan to me in the meantime yeah you two need to do something about your outfits i have just the thing for your size stay right there okay i told you it fits like a dream i'm afraid we don't have any ren in clothing i could find you some dannon outfits but something tells me you'd rather pass is this really that important in case you need reminding i'm here because our interests overlapped nothing more at no point did i say i've given up being a renin now now let's play nice how about you ask nate and see what he says he's our one-stop shop for info around here with any luck he might just know something nath we need your help ah damn never the manpower when you huh help huh what kind is it urgent well no not exactly well in that case would you mind helping me out with something first the work's really piled up around here what is it you'd like us to do anything you can manage no one cares about us slaves that's why it's all the more important that we stick together and take care of each other check in with that guy over there for details on what needs doing and thanks in advance you see anybody around here who could use our help we can't chase after every little thing hey yes hmm i guess got it i had no idea the crimson crows were so active you sound pretty thrilled by that thrilled maybe but i'll settle for hopeful we know now that not everyone is rolling over for the rents [Music] [Music] so what they're all dead how did this happen soldiers that's how [Music] are you iron mask [Music] yeah i am dyron sent me to help hang in there i'm so glad you made it in the bushes over there hang on sean do something it's no use he's already dead damn them they've killed so many of us and it's still not enough they won't be satisfied until they've wiped us all out like pests [Music] he mentioned something about those bushes we should check them [Music] is this a cooking pot but what is it doing here if i had to guess he put it there to make sure irenin wouldn't steal it so even though he knew he was dying he chose to use the last of his strength to hide it believing somebody would come for it i guess you think it's stupid getting killed over a silly trinket huh [Music] no clearly he risked his life for something he believed in i would never mock someone for that however it will be up to us to figure out the purpose behind his dying act we'll make sure it wasn't in vain if nothing else this proves that the remnants can be outsmarted we'll carry out your will and see it through to the end and we better get going we don't know when those soldiers might be back to make another sweep of the area so this is what it means to fight the renaissance sounds like you're kind of scared to me of course i am but if i'm gonna die one way or another i'd rather go down fighting [Music] that's not your run-of-the-mill enemy brace yourselves this one's tough take it over the normal creepy crawlies aren't disgusting enough [Music] is [Music] [Music] i'm not done yet [Music] no [Music] it's over [Music] [Music] looks like it could be worth something [Music] so [Music] so hmm [Music] huh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i feel like somebody's watching us maybe there's you're back huh sounds like it was a real ordeal out there much as i hate to admit it there aren't many of us who can take on those ren and armored soldiers all we can do is make sure we remember those who sacrificed their lives for the cause yeah they won't be forgotten glad to hear it now what was that favor you wanted to ask me oh right well you see so then you're wondering if i know of any places where you can find brennan equipment huh anywhere with those damn bright eyes is gonna have tight security of course you can't just go carelessly poking around unless across the wilderness outside ulzebek you'll find the fagan ruins there's some kind of old redden castle out there what would they be impenetrable i forgot but with the renin tagging along who knows maybe you can find some way in you ask me though it's a lot of trouble for some ren and rags if i were you i'd get comfortable with dan and garbs those look like the ruins let's move are we really going in there yes now let's move [Music] looks like we get to sleep with a roof over our heads [Music] i'm skeptical [Music] right [Music] hmm all right got it [Music] [Music] hey shion where does your gun come from what do you mean where does it come from when you're fighting it looks like it just appears out of nowhere oh that's transferral technology when i don't need my weapon i submerge it in empty space and when i do i summon it make sense not really but it sounds pretty amazing huh well that way you don't have to carry around any heavy weapons or worry about enemies trying to steal them right it's a pretty cool invention you realize you're praising the technology of your enemies right so technology's technology it's not good or bad in and of itself i guess that's true try to be careful not to stand out too much you're the only renin around here you know i know i was just thinking about how communal it feels here even though it's only supposed to be slave quarters huh oh yeah when you put it like that i guess it is different from heavily patrolled mosul were you expecting something more depressing it's likely a sign that balset doesn't think you guys can do anything to him what i mean if balsa thought the crimson crows actually posed a threat to him he'd figure he'd be trying harder to suppress them you ah no you're probably right about that all of the other dennins that aren't with the crimson crows except the renan's rule as simply a fact of life from the day we're born no probably even before that it's been drilled into us that the only purpose our lives have is to help select the next sovereign if they don't like the status quo then they should fight it otherwise they're endorsing it either way i see it differently but that's just me speaking of renin's do all of them think about things the way you do i won't deny that among my fellow renin's power and status are everything however that isn't what this is about for me i have something i need to do and i'll do whatever it takes and use whoever and whatever i need in order to get the job done to hell with power [Music] am i really doing this for some lousy cloak there are sugars here too hey [Music] right [Music] just a minute [Music] [Music] with that blade and your strength the average zoogle shouldn't be a problem right i'll give it a shot [Music] here i come [Music] this one's mine i'll shoot them down where are you going [Music] i'll flow you to smithereens [Music] this one's all mine now one more you picked the wrong fighter you're mine i'm your gun this one's mine [Music] is [Music] huh [Music] looks like it could be worth something you can hardly see anything from here why don't we climb up higher and see if we can get a better view [Music] [Music] these little ones are hardly worth our time less talking more pummeling cut them apart it's over your mine [Music] you're mine it's over slush take it i'm only getting [Music] i can feel my power growing [Music] what's this thing [Music] so these are the fagin ruins how do you figure a place like this turns derelict your guess is as good as mine i didn't even know this place existed until we heard about it all that matters to me is whether i can find anything to wear in there why does she care so much about her appearance there [Music] [Music] should stay on the ground this one's mine just watch and see our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion an opponent like this should be easy [Music] this one [Music] well then let's keep moving [Music] let's dispose of the trash [Music] here i go [Music] [Music] rising [Music] looks like we won [Music] no choice i'll take you all off less talking [Music] it's over rising liver you're mine [Music] hear me take this it's over [Music] onward and upward [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] out of our way rising come one come on i never missed [Music] nicely done [Music] what's this thing [Music] [Music] no choice how about this [Music] [Music] nicely done so [Music] so [Music] [Music] i wonder if those are the fagin ruins below us shouldn't be too much farther now if that's the [Music] uh i guess it's been a while since i had a bite to eat don't worry about me i'm used to working while i'm hungry it's no big deal it is a big deal you should eat whenever you can the last thing i need is you keeling over in the middle of a fight just because you didn't eat never thought i'd get lectured on eating by a renin of all people yeah well some of us renin's know what it's like to go without food believe it or not what do you mean i thought this isn't about me now are you going to eat or not i would if we had anything to eat but we don't actually i have a little bit of food on me you've been carrying that stuff around this whole time not sure it's gonna be enough for the both of us though that's why we're going to cook it instead [Music] cook i've never done anything like that before me neither to be honest but we've got to make something out of all this so might as well try [Music] what are you staring at me for your clothes are all about function over form you should think about sprucing them up a little why what purpose would it serve i guess you're right i just think you'd look good with a little blue thrown in somewhere hmm all right i'll think about it [Music] [Music] all done come and eat [Music] you really do eat through that mask of yours huh i'm impressed you can manage so well huh oh it's nothing you get used to it after a while still i'm glad we decided to stop and fill our stomachs i've got a newfound respect for cooking now but i guess that's easy when you're used to eating everything raw it would have been perfect if it had any flavor sorry it didn't live up to your palate oh no that wasn't a knock on you i was just sorry that's not how i should thank you for cooking for me you've got me curious now is it just pain you can't sense are your taste buds shot too oh sure my taste buds work fine although apparently what i like tends to be a little out there how so what's so unusual about what you eat well one time i couldn't get enough of these things i picked off a plant but everyone else said they were way too spicy doc thinks maybe i crave spicy food to compensate for the lack of pain i feel maybe it's best i take charge of the cooking you know just to be on the safe side i can't guarantee it'll be to your tastes though i said i'm sorry look i'll learn to tone down my tastes in the future so let's just put that slip of the tongue behind us already [Music] [Music] [Music] well off we go [Music] this must be it looks pretty ancient but i recognize renin architecture when i see it it's seen some beatings if it stayed sealed all this time it's not cuz people left it alone it's not just their technology the renins build their structures out of special materials too strong enough to withstand assaults from dannon tools and weaponry anyway so how the hell are we easy [Music] i hate that i can see what's on the other side i can't just walk in it's a defensive barrier that's how it works if we want to get through we have to find the mechanism to lift it [Music] looks like this place used to be a supply base of some sort it probably even dates back to the great conquest of three centuries ago [Music] get lost [Music] [Music] getting started [Music] [Music] barely a blip on our radar [Music] [Music] no choice [Music] all yours [Music] take this that's what i like to hear [Music] what's this thing [Music] what a rush we've been walking around for a while now can we give up already what you're tired tired of something all right i'm not giving up until we search every inch of this place she's really determined to find those clothes phew that may not have been a fancy feast we just had but i don't remember the last time i felt this full do the renins often not give you all enough to eat it's never enough the renins decide exactly how much we'll have and when we'll have it and that's that we do our best to get around it everyone has to grow their own food and such behind the renin's backs in order to get by thinking about it now i wonder if they've always kept it meager so we wouldn't ever have the energy to try to resist what they've done to us yeah an empty stomach takes its toll on the body and the spirit after a while how does a renin like you know what it's like i may be renin but they don't like me either i could be squeaky clean and they still wouldn't give me anything [Music] did your stomach just i didn't hear anything but you just ate how are you already i said i didn't hear anything i still have some i haven't eaten yet do you want it sure [Music] no choice [Music] it's over here [Music] this could be useful [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's gotta break through don't fight someone else [Music] stop [Music] don't take your eyes off the prize i'm quite aware without you reminding me it's over you're mine i'm knocked out this one's all mine rising [Music] i won't rest until i'm the best i can be still striving to be on par with the lord you simply can't be too strong when battle is a part of your everyday [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] is this a chest of some sort a renin kind yeah we should definitely hold on to what's inside [Music] like this should be easy you picked the wrong did you just hear me yeah i need you remember it's in the sky [Music] i'm only getting started [Music] [Music] [Applause] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] is this renin technology i'm amazed you guys can pull something like this off for us sites like this are completely normal [Music] this must be the former owner's old wardrobe yeah i wonder how long they've hung here they don't look like they've aged a day the designs are a little dated but it'll have to do listen i get it you care how you look but we've got places [Music] what is it no i nothing we've kept zephyr and the others waiting long enough we should head back [Music] okay let's head back to back you're in a good mood were you that happy to find a new outfit i don't know what you're talking about i'm the same as ever [Music] you said before that this probably used to be a supply depot right that nay thought it was a random castle i wonder what it actually is who knows who knows what can't i not know something you didn't think i knew every last thing about my own kind did you i didn't say that [Music] from what i've heard a lot of the materials that were initially brought over from rena 300 years ago were repurposed for other things over time so it's entirely possible that this place used to be both a supply depot and a lord's castle at different points in time they're not mutually exclusive i couldn't tell you when the lord's castle moved to its current location though well satisfied [Music] yeah thank you you know for telling me about all that ah it's not like i mentioned anything that useful come on let's keep moving [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] we want to get back to ulzebek yeah we better we don't have time to waste someone's in a hurry [Music] we've reached our destination crap what [Music] no way damn it just where do you think you're going you know where moscow what good is it going to do to i don't need your permission [Music] [Music] [Music] let's dispose of the trash you're mine demons [Music] i'm not done [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you there are fewer soldiers stationed at the garrison than usual they must have gotten deployed to mosul duck everyone please be safe [Music] it's gotta break through [Music] [Music] i've got this marksman all yours [Music] [Music] any injuries [Music] [Music] what's this thing [Music] let's dispose of the truck [Music] [Music] onward and upward [Music] [Music] i won't forgive you this one's mine [Music] let me help thank you your mind [Music] [Music] well then let's keep moving [Music] you think it might be useful we should try it and see how it turns out [Music] no choice i'm only getting [Music] here's barely a blip on our radar [Music] [Music] what's this thing [Music] looks like this place opens out into the ocean the water's so much cleaner than what's on the surface i even see fish swimming around yeah and boy do they look delicious what never mind [Music] gonna break through where are you going eat dirt here you're finished take this hear me [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion [Music] [Music] they really don't give up dude you're [Music] [Music] here i come here [Music] any injuries [Music] what's this thing [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] i won't forgive [Music] take this [Music] any injuries [Music] what's this thing [Music] oh [Music] i'm surprised there are owls here too yeah there are more of them around than i thought [Music] [Music] you just crossed the wrong line oh [Music] hey hang in there hey damn it [Music] [Music] [Music] am i too late stop please don't hurt the children damn it i can't reach them in time get that cold duck cool stop but if i can help it no no you're mine getting started [Music] are you all right what about the others are those bastards still here iron mask take it easy it's all right now most were able to escape and we've survived honestly we got off lucky it's often worse when a resistance group pops up lucky do you call people getting slaughtered like this lucky this is how things go when you're a den en slave you're dead if you stand up to them keep your head down and do as you're told at least then you have a chance to survive you only have one life that's why i should wait for the right moment yes so someone else dies instead while we live another day is that what you're saying doc you're willing to risk everything on the chance that things will get better if we wait long enough but what's the point of waiting if others have to die so that we can live what do you think happens when someone tries to resist it'd be one thing if the rebel died and that was that but it never ends with only one death you've seen it for yourself everyone suffers for it knowing that are you really going to tell me our waiting has no meaning but that's i understand not wanting to throw away the same lies we're trying to protect that would be senseless but if you wait too long if you get too used to waiting then eventually you lose the will to fight i don't want that to happen to me i've already met the crimson crows people who risked their lives to fight the renin's rule people who know they might not live to see us win but fight anyway to give those who come after a better chance if my life is at risk either way then i'd rather spend it fighting so you've decided to take up the sword yes but not just any sort it's a sword that only i can wield but one that's also too powerful to use on my own i doubt those who fought the remnants in the past ever had something like this on their side that's why i'm willing to bet everything i have on this sword i know it might mean more people end up in danger but okay if that's how you feel then forget what i said it's clear your time has come iron mask currently you and that sword are the only things capable of driving the renin's back it's because of you that we're still alive right now if there's a way through this for all of us then i'll put my trust in you to find it doc thank you now remember what you said and don't ever abandon that conviction of yours all right right i won't you've grown so much since we first met and you've met some good people too maybe you have a chance after all so [Music] you're back hurry on in we've been waiting for you you're not gonna ask what happened i can tell enough by the way you look right now i see zephyr i need to ask you something would you have invited me to join you even if i didn't have the blazing sword of course why though there aren't many folks out there who are crazy enough to resist the renin's like we do so when i find someone with a knack for it i make sure to keep them close plus you remind me of another guy we lost maybe deep down i'm trying to help you as a way of making amends for what i couldn't do for him but if you don't want this just say the word i'm not going anywhere if it weren't for you i wouldn't even be here if you say so all right come on in thanks yes what's wrong got it we've reached our destination [Music] hey yeah [Music] [Music] thanks good good [Music] is this something you're into yeah these ingenious structures and gadgets never cease to amaze me check out these handle grooves i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be seeing here [Music] you see anybody around here who could use our help we can't chase after every little thing all right everyone it's time remember eyes on the prize we're after balsa nothing else cut off the head and the snake perishes hit them head on however and we won't make it through the castle gates let alone reach bolsef himself luckily we have an ace up our sleeve we need to do everything in our power to make sure that ace reaches bolseft's jugular to that end i'll be splitting us up into separate forces you just said all of us hitting them head-on would be useless why would we divide ourselves up because we're the decoys we'll buy our ace in the hole the time they need to get in we only need to cause enough of a ruckus around the castle to distract the enemy that said we need to look like the real deal which is why i'll be tagging along too you two zephyr so who's going to take on balsa the iron mask i'm counting on you and shion to make your way to wherever balsa is hiding once there you drive that flaming sword right through him you aren't seriously sending in just those two are you one of them's a renin no one said the plan was perfect by far the biggest danger is the one you two will be facing the fate of this quest rests entirely in your hands which is why you get the final say you want out now's the time to say so and if we say no then you say no just means we're back to square one that's all and i go back to being a slave it's your life no it isn't balls in your court soldier what do you say i i want to fight but for what what are you fighting for to free the damage from the yoke of their abusive oppressors to no longer die at the whim of another to break the shackles of our enslavers to live and taste freedom now you're talking i believe we have our ace in the hole people hold on to that belief and we just might break through that wall yet and what about you i was born ready now can we get this show on the road there's a gate on your right once you leave here go through it and ride the elevator you'll find i'll send ahead a few friendly faces to keep watch on your way if you get into any trouble look at them for support we all clear good may this battle herald the end of the renin's bloody three-century reign [Music] dear battle stations everyone i wonder if something happened [Music] castle should be just above us all right and let's use that elevator thing [Music] [Music] zephyr and the crimson crows are supposed to be distracting the remnants from the front then let's go around and sneak in elsewhere i still can't believe this is happening we're really about to face off against a wren and lord well you're in pretty high spirits for a guy going into a life and death battle i'm not saying i'm not worried but you have to remember this is the first time any of us stand ins have really had any hope what about you are you scared at all i don't have time to be scared this is only the first step in a long long plan of mine you want to take down all five lords right it's hard to believe it'll ever happen but it will i know i haven't forgotten our deal see that you don't that said if we lose we might suffer a fate worse than death you know that's probably true but instead of worrying about it wouldn't it be a better use of our time to figure out ways to avoid that and not lose i suppose whatever happens i'll put everything i have into winning you can count on that [Music] [Applause] [Music] is now really the time to be worrying about him we've still got a job to do i'm surprised there are owls here too yeah more of them around than i thought [Music] [Applause] kids of fire sure look intimidating once you see them up close we can't say this place is truly liberated until we do something about them what are you muttering about stay focused we still have to take down falsetto [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i'm surprised there are owls here too more of them around than i thought [Music] what could this be [Music] [Applause] [Music] we should be getting close to the service entrance good let's get in there and kick their asses this someone's idea of a bridge it looks like it don't follow her this will be a pretty short story [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's already started we need to hurry hold on you should take the blazing sword are you sure yeah we don't know what might happen up ahead it's better to have it and be ready than to be caught in a fight without it [Music] the flames i took the liberty of cutting the flow of energy from the master core i may be giving you the sword but you still need me to unleash its power try not to forget that [Music] [Music] where the hell is bolsef if we don't hurry up and find him you're too close try to stay farther apart oh right sorry about that was i really that close i guess i'm just not used to standing right next to people you mean because of your thorns you're a surprisingly nice person what you don't think so i mean you just made sure your thorns wouldn't you can keep your opinions to yourself you don't know the first thing about me i'm not saying i know everything about you sheesh i need to bite my head off you just can't take a hint can you what i'm sorry you're right i i don't know what sorts of hardships you've been through after all what could i possibly know about pain i know you didn't mean anything bad by what you said the throne room is up on the next floor that's probably where we'll find balsa hey what if there's something you want to say just come out and say it huh i hate when i feel like people are laughing at me on the inside especially someone like you where i can't read your expression what why would i laugh at you what are you talking about my outfit as soon as you saw me in those ruins you wanted to say something didn't you oh it's not that it's just just what nothing you're a truly awful person you know that an awful hey you're the one jumping to conclusions about what i think you're not one to talk then prove me wrong and tell me what you were really thinking it wasn't anything mean about you i promise i don't believe that for a second and it doesn't matter what the hell i tell you you'll always doubt me [Music] just a minute [Music] where are you time to see what this blazing sword can truly do i won't show you any mercy one more here i go try this [Music] good [Music] oh consider yourself finished amazing [Music] hey got it how'd you feel my power group [Music] [Music] wow sure [Music] we can cross through now good we're pressed for time [Music] looks like there's still some soldiers inside the castle but still less than it would usually be the diversion must be working everyone stay safe having second thoughts no i was just thinking about the blazing sword whenever i hold it i feel wrong somehow is relying on a sword from a renin master core that repulsive it's not about that it's just that's hard to explain it's like the sword is almost too strong i don't know what's got you so worried but in case you forgot that sword is the only reason we have a fighting chance against a lord i know you don't need to keep telling me well good that said the longer you use it the more you get burned by it too we need to remember to patch you up quickly when that happens a double-edged sword in every sense since you can't feel pain you'll need to be careful okay are you actually worried about me is that a problem look i need you if i'm going to take out the lords and i can't have you dying on me before that happens that's my only concern [Music] [Music] i won't forgive you barely a blip on our radar [Music] that equipment should come in handy [Music] [Music] let's dispose of the trash our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion [Music] it's so hot i can definitely believe they're harvesting fire astral energy out here is it that bad i forgot you can't feel the heat i don't think i've been more jealous of anything in my life no choice now you'll learn oh here [Music] i need to be stronger [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] i won't forgive you i'm only getting i've got this [Music] barely a blip on our radar [Music] what's going on over there are those armed soldiers ganging up on a kid they're attacking him we have to save [Music] you will kneel before our [Music] [Music] here i [Music] we're [Music] are you okay what were you even doing here working most likely dan and slaves that can't handle manual labor outdoors are put to work in the castles as servants i'm surprised you didn't know the soldiers got really mad all of a sudden and everyone ran away i was the only one that got caught and it's good that we found you but it's still not safe here you need to get out of here before any more soldiers find you understand yes ma'am thanks for saving me oh here you can have this don't touch me [Music] i'm sorry i only wanted to to it's not your fault kid don't sweat it can i take it instead sure it's the key to the elevator here will it help you guys at all definitely thanks kid now get going and be careful on your way out [Music] so not too happy about a slave touching you huh this isn't the time we should keep moving [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] seems about right to me [Music] this place looks damn near the same on the outside as it does on the inside nothing but fire and rocks i figured a renin castle would at least be a little more elegant instead it seems this one was very dedicated to a theme is that your idea of a joke don't lump the rest of us in with someone like balsa then why is his place look so grungy i guess you could say that's just the majority of what he's into he likes fire and he likes rocks he's an egotistical brute without a single shred of class he even makes everyone call him by his stupid nickname the wild beast i feel sorry for everyone who's stuck having to work beneath him huh interesting why i used to think all renins were like him terrible people obsessed with their own superiority who were only out to make us miserable but now listening to you talk makes me realize that maybe there are some good ones too maybe there are a few of you that are different listen i don't know what kind of renin you think i am but i have no intention of getting friendly with you we clear crystal believe me i wasn't about to suggest we go hang out and have a drink after this that's for sure [Music] what the hell is that thing a spirit vessel it's what the renin's used to harvest astral energy from denons so that's where it all ends up huh damn them [Music] [Music] let's dispose of the trash [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion [Music] what are those things i sometimes see you chuck out in the middle of fights what you mean my bombs bombs as in the things people use to clear out rocks but i could have sworn i saw something other than fire burst from some of yours that's because these aren't ordinary bombs they're specially made ones filled with astral energy hmm okay and why do you shoot the bombs after you release them it's a part of my strategy the effects of my bombs change when i fire bullets of a different astral element at them it makes it difficult for enemies to predict what effect they'll have or when they'll go off one moment you're using powerful bombs the next you're using powerful healing hearts they're kind of on the opposite ends of the spectrum aren't they think of it this way if you ever get caught up in the blast of one of my bombs and you manage not to die i'll be able to heal you using my arts [Music] i'll do my best to not die then [Music] [Music] i'm surprised there are owls here too yeah there are more of them around than i thought [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] guess this thing needs a different key to activate [Music] [Music] what's this thing [Music] let's dispose of the trash right [Music] you're finished [Music] looks like we won [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's not your run-of-the-mill enemy [Music] i have a bad feeling about this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] try harder [Music] i'm only getting started [Music] take it down [Music] [Music] consider yourself finished hear me [Music] this one's all mine it's over here let me help birthdays i'll try [Music] david hear me rising wipers [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] is consider yourself finished [Music] [Music] [Music] we won [Music] [Music] yeah i bet that garish-looking key will come in handy for it [Music] [Music] that equipment should come in handy [Music] [Music] get lost [Music] hey oh [Music] i'm pretty worn out wanna rest up for a bit [Music] this area seems different we're getting close balsa should be right up ahead that's what i figured time to introduce ourselves finally it's time to face bolsef speaking of bolsef how much would you say you actually know about him what do you mean he's just a lord that holds power over calaglia isn't he just a lord he is far more than that bolsef air woolsey tell dillis is one of the five lords that sit atop all of ren in society even without his fire master corps fighting him won't be easy i've seen that man butcher who knows how many zukuls just to blow off some steam with sheer braun like his he can knock you out with one hit and it's practically suicide to go up against him when he has a weapon got it watch out for his attacks that's only the beginning you can't expect to beat him by attrition first we dodge then look for an opening remember that sounds like our teamwork is really going to be put to the test indeed don't screw this up and get us both killed [Music] don't move so the vermin scum you call kin stirred up enough trouble for you two rats to make it all the way to me huh what a pain in the ass although it was pretty impressive of you to deliver it straight into my hands the master core you really think we're here to hand it over [Laughter] why of course not you see i'll be taking it back no matter what you say in any case this is the end for you you won't be getting out of here alive [Music] the two of you were fools for coming here now die a common thief believes she can usurp me don't make me laugh you can keep you're a perfect we this isn't looking good [Music] up this one's mine it's like a brick wall but he's wide open when he's in the air i'll shoot him out of the sky make sure you don't miss think again we did it just give it up i never missed i'm not done [Music] stop trying here let me help [Music] this ends now consider yourself finished [Music] [Applause] [Music] iron map escaping come on [Music] [Music] up here i've got more than enough space to crush you this time your math won't be the only that is enough uh what the hell is that it's manifested astral energy not only that it's alive astral energy from the spirit vessel but wait that was harvested for me and that energy is supposed to be mine [Music] this one's mine that monster's attacking look out [Music] play reload [Music] stop trying to resist is getting ready to attack let me take a crack at it ready here it comes down you go you really don't mess around swallow blade [Music] i can't end here [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] we need to stop him here's a healing art stay away from my friends the power is unbelievable are you okay on just worry about yourself consider yourself finished but why do you not possess the blood of a renin why then would you turn against your own kind it's always been the way of the renin for the strongest to survive and yet you have allied yourself with a filthy talent you traitor tell me why why bring ruin and devastation to your own kind things like you should join [Music] a monster made up of astral energy how do we even if this sword is made of astral energy as well foreign iron mask your face is exposed no huh [Music] [Music] my name is [Music] flames i see flames my name is alvin where am i what happened the rage surging within me fueling the sword where did it come from this twisting fear that clings to me holding me in check the melancholic voice calling out to me who am i who was i this is wakey wakey sunshine about time too a week you mean that whole time i was [Music] a cold yeah just as well too when you blacked out you were on your way to becoming a pile of ash shion's the reason you're still here shion you healed me in case you'd forgotten we've still got four lords to defeat you dying would have only slowed things down [Music] what about bolseft's troops we've got him on the ropes while you've been getting your beauty sleep most of the remaining renin's have either surrendered or fled you slaying balsa was the catalyst we'd been waiting for thanks to you galagly is finally free you have my gratitude we couldn't have done it without you i just did what anyone would have done [Music] iron mat forgive me alfin it's good to finally see who i'm speaking to half of him anyway so if you like telling us who you used to be i i wish i could memory's still giving you grief eh i see still no sense in beating yourself up you've remembered your name the rest will come in time so what happens now no just everything the realm may be liberated but we're still destitute you name it anything and everything starts from scratch but enough of that you've just woken up you should get a sense of the scale of what you've accomplished head over to the gates of fire and take a look at the view it's a sight too many danons died only ever seeing in their dreams the gates of fire i'll be your chaperone last thing we need is you tripping on a pebble and missing another week remind me to laugh next time [Music] hmm [Music] you
