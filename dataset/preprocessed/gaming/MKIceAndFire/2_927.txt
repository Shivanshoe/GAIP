he always finds new ways to humor himself i'll keep that in mind you smell that jailbird the stink of jealousy of our budding friendship i think [Music] what is jail wolf's son doing in repton at all it's jailwool's way of proving his loyalty and there's no safer place for a traitor and his son in the middle of a pack of days say from who you and eva seem to have brought this shire to health beards are with us common folk poor great still has his soldiers all over mercy devoted to him they'll die defending [Music] you sound different than the brothers good ear lord most in england cannot tell the difference but not i didn't know there was land north of there what are the people like you ever see a herd of sheep follow each other off the edge of a cliff like that the ones who remained anyway couldn't have said it better myself was this a mass exodus from norway then it was and always now the province of a young king harold by name a boy wise beyond his years are you not angry that he has displaced you and so many others i was for a time without weeks at sea have softened my brow fire if i'm honest i realize i quite admire king harold my words and by weapons both he has pacified the country i call hope for the first time in any man's memory or any scald song norway has one king just one and that is quite a feat that is impressive truly england is half the size of norway and yet we have four kings for our four kingdoms you see how could i not be impressed no harold is a good man with grand ideas i can see that now i am only six years his junior and have yet to see my first battle i cannot imagine the skill and cunning he has your first battle is coming young gelbert from this day on you may see rapid progress i'm not sure i want so swift to rise in truth gilbert it is my father who bears the heaviest weight of my anger not king harold my father gifted my birthright to harold without my consent or knowledge as easily as if he might hand over a battle of me it was not merely a deception it was a betrayal of trust the prick of which still stings me be it a blessing or a curse family is always first a good line boy were you not an adeline i would hire you as my skull scold it sounds something like scott our court poets is that what you mean right again fascinating the harmony between our words and yours is quite something as if we were distant cousins separated by an ocean of time as well as space i like the thought of that i do uh [Music] look at these pagan rats ravenous unseemly beasts teeming over holy ground have a care lord these pig and rats are numbers i can see that fool what do we do about them i advise we strongly consider that a man's lord we won't survive a fight is that you leo frit how quickly you recover i'm beginning to wonder

ivar's ex that stopped him that is a poor description of a perfect 30-yard toss enough joy heathens speak your peace we've come for your crown lord with or without your head attached i admire your ambition pagan but what you ask is impossible no dane ever has or ever will occupy murcia's sacred throne would you settle for a norse we're not as gentle but we're much better poets nor stain you're all the same to me oh godless my king may i suggest a more measured approach to this i grow weary of this pallava you have trampled our lands toppled our monuments we've given you silver fed your people and yet in spite of all this your encroachment on my kingdom continues no more we will die defending what is ours whatsoever the cost if you want my crown uber ragnason you must pry it from the hands of my bloodless corpse man the walls back to the camp round up the men we're taking tamworth tonight tell the captain we're ready to march eva and i will round up the men you know your way

luck nothing you this do you know that simple toner sigil it seems she's been dealing with burglary as well the wretch she was the mercenary barking at you and repton yes she's playing both sides of this war she could have told him anything sold him secrets about me about repton our plans why bother with all this pageantry fashion a new crown and stick it on your melon there you have it you're the new king that is not how it works not in mercier you were one of bergrid's things you must have some sense of where he'd be bergrid had his secret haunts but he never told me of them kept me quite in the dark for good reason i suppose toner is our only lead we talk to her find out what she knows i would sooner launch my face into my axe than face her that might improve her impression of you we have the same father evor but his mother was a sow meet us at thonas kemp when you're finished here and bring your patience and your axe evil a word if you would go i'll catch up i will join the brothers savor meet us at thomas my son told me what happened earlier with eva pressuring him to fight he said you intervened you would be mourning your son if i hadn't he's not a fighter no but he should be by trial all by training he'll come around in time but keep him from evar if you can he's the furthest thing from a mentor [Music] hmm so i better sweden shhh [Music] so [Music] so [Music]

good is there a problem we'll go see tomma just the two of us eva and ubba will wait here better if tomna thinks we've come alone the truth is i don't think any of us can stop evil from cleaving her hand open it's all he was spewing the whole way over here right shall we we'll return shortly a small fortune for whoever sent tona to hell i'll hold you to that from what i overheard in repton the brothers had an arrangement what happened she's a mercenary uber used her for man and information but that relationship soured now that bulgaria is all but defeated from what i heard tana has a hunger for two things soft silver and a stern hump neither of which earns you true loyalty if she can't be trusted what use is she that is for us to find out we may be able to satisfy her and if we can't eva did tell you to bring your axe and here they are as expected if she takes a liking to you keep talking she's more your type i think no no this is your challenge come now don't drag your feet what brings you strolling into my camp this birthday i suspect you already know yes the emperors on the air betray you and yet if you are here talking to me king bergeron remains at large and who are you lovely duff want to perch your ass on my lap call me amore or wolf kissed lovely dumb will get your throat cut come now you are too clever to run with those ragnars on dogs plenty of room on this side if you want to earn some coin we came for your help not your flattery where is king berggret that is what you want and what makes you think i have the slightest idea we found letters records of trade the two of you have a history what can i say the king pays well for my services if only i could say the same for those two ragnarson clutch you're dealing with me now and i want to know what you know name your price very well i could use another cow and you can cover the cost you take me for a fool i take you for desperate beggars i can smell it on you like donkey now that's my press what say you you heard me the first time but i'll get what i need one way or another no no you have shut your chance and if you show your faces around here once more i will tear you limb from them well that is not the result i was hoping for i hope you have another idea tona keeps a close eye on whoever she deals with if bergford is keeping records so is she somewhere behind those walls see what you can find i'll go back to the brothers keep those gates locked if they come within a foot of here kill them oh [Music] what happened out there the ragnar suns came through just like torna said they would i suppose they didn't reach an agreement but gave it away [Music] don't see anything here oh oh so i should have a look around what oh my god oh foreign ah so keep my music oh [Music] huh bad idea lovely dove now i'm going to make you regret it straight to hell i might find something useful though done for now clever let's see what secrets you keep toner so this might be something looks like bergwood once paid toner to steer their acnes away from two areas burkitt's private hands perhaps he could be at either one shouldn't have been so greedy toner right back to the brothers so i've got your court avor tell us you learned something letter chester and temple broth fought what do you know about them later chest is a large village and temple brock it's an old military fort not much else berkret could be at either one we should check both as soon as possible and what do we do with tona i would bet the sweat off my sack she's writing to porgrade now offering silver for a warning about
