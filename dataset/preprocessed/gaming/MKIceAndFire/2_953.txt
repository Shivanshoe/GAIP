this is my fault i underestimated the repair now the whole project's at risk hyperdrive's break ardo it's not your fault i should have suggested you send more engineers to yavin then this never would have happened it's fine vanguard is ready they'll get there in time won't you i know i know but i'll reach out to hosnian prime and requisition a few more engineers just in case get moving pilots we were just talking about what happened to the victoria man keo had one of those uh what do you call them it's just a hunch for us that's all so what do you think happened i feel like it was the imperials they probably sabotaged the hyperdrive before our soldiers could get them off the ship i know it sounds wild but when keo has a hunch they're usually right don't listen to him it's really not that big of a deal on muriel we're taught to respect and listen to the force i can't reach out and touch it like well like others could but sometimes i just have a feeling about things i don't like to talk about it these days you never know who in the galaxy is listening now let's get serious huh when are you gonna have a premonition about the carillion lottery really people are waiting for us to save them and you're thinking about credits look you see any numbers just tell me okay they gotta be good for something we really should get going a wings go as fast as you can fly them their hauling shields are too light to take on capital ships but imperial starfighters won't stand a chance with you in this cockpit we have a few options to make your tie hunting more efficient big fan of the rapid fire lasers on barrage rockets myself guaranteed to satisfy attention here okay what happened here who cares our star destroyer is in trouble vanguard good to see you again think you can keep those bombers off us we're on it victoria sit tight five intercept those time bombers we need to buy our crew brisk sometime i will handle the rest of the star fighters these bombers are coming in fast you might want to activate turbo lasers no can do their ion weapons knocked out our systems we were defenseless until you arrived understood we'll put an end to their bombing runs yeah you'll lose your controls or worse there's always more so farmers don't stand a chance obama's destroyed great just need time to restart our systems work fast imperial shuttles headed your way hold them off if even one imperial shuttle reaches us we'll be overwhelmed you heard him vanguard intercept those shuttles we should split up to take him down on it you handle the other shuttle i got the shuttle you took him down detecting two more imperial shuttles they're trying to flank that us shoot that another shuttle group is coming they have ties into [Music] that target one shuttle is all they need transports are done for that's the last of those plastic shuttles just in time systems are up time to fix the hyperdrive support they'll lead a bombing run on those carriers don't let any tie fighters near them all right y wings are here vanguard if we lose our bombers we're done for take out those ties i'm breaking off to intercept their fighters watch your tails those ties have missiles blow that up got a lock on me blow that to be the up hey you did your job wings that's one carrier down don't worry vanguard has you covered squadron take down the rest of these ties that's the last of them your timing couldn't be better we're almost done our bombers are out of here thanks for the backup we're doing our final test vanguard spread out and keep watch nice moves back there keto you gotta teach the rest of the squadron that drift you want to learn right now yeah i'll watch five figure it out first okay follow me i learned this racing in the koshi star circuit first transfer all power to your engines and fly as fast as you can yes now we're gonna buzz the bridge of the victoria be ready to boost when you're ready turn as hard as you can then cut your engines to drift yes you got it five hey let's buzz it up bridge someone the empire is never gonna catch again sorry team it's for the greater good of the new republic i'll uh practice drifting later without spectators [Music] hyper drives operational vanguard what do you say we get out of here regrouping on your position victorim join it up somewhere classified just send you the coordinates got them punching them in now jumping to hyperspace in three two one punching [Music] no oh man well we gotta get there now i don't know what happened everything was fine and then our system is just shut down sounds like your nullifier is blocked run a system flashlight restart it should be fine more imperial ships do you really want their star destroyer back no they're here to destroy it vanguard protect the victoria this is taking too long don't tell me this is too much for you frisk no trigger fingers getting tired is all do something about those bombers blast that target keep it up may i join you operator just arrived [Music] shoot that last batch much longer they got more bombers than us it ain't fair right they're up against vanguard squadron it is advanced for the empire blow that up you've got proceeders blast that target destroyers boss okay great just do it splash them wake don't have to tell me twice [Music] they have to run out of ships at some point right not likely let's get the hell out of here [Applause] this is where the boss keeps his secret project who'd want to get this close to the ringali nebula i believe that is the idea [Music] [Applause] now that is a battleship that's why we've been gathering imperial ships to build this we call it the star hawk and it's going to help us end this war general syndulla hello vanguard welcome to the nadiri dockyards i'd give you the tour but the empire knows we're up to something now they'll be looking for us which means we have work to do [Applause] an old enemy has finally surfaced one of my spies has linked the attacks on our star destroyers with the new republic starhawk project a common factor is lyndon james you knew james better than anyone captain carol if i had i'd have destroyed him before he betrayed us at foster haven then this is your second chance the rebels are keeping a low profile take titan squadron hunt down this starhawk and eliminate it gladly admiral sloane but if i may ask there's a particular pilot i'd like to requisition [Applause] grey come in is it true we're getting a new pilot copy saw captain carol's bringing someone in john the treacherous slime taking our ships good more the merrier von reg remember the last time you lost your call the day i cut through a whole squadron of rebels have saved your name focus shen's right tighten it up soul and phone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] your new wingmate has arrived [Applause] sir you're our new wingmate welcome to titan squadron i'm varco gray squadron leader i think they're waiting for you in the briefing room i don't make a good first impression welcome home pilot it feels like a lifetime since foster haven doesn't it one fool betrays his squadron and loyal officers like us are reassigned in disgrace i heard they sent you to the outer rim i got the medams sector protecting fuel shipments from petty scoundrels and pirates the kind of posting that used to end careers before endor before lyndon james reappeared no doubt you've heard admiral sloane has instructed me to hunt that traitor down and end this project star hawk it seemed fitting that i bring you back to help me destroy lyndon your empire needs you pilot are you willing good for now you will be flying as titan 3. let's get to work one of our spies agent thorne has discovered vital intelligence on project starhawk your mission is to extract her from an orbital outpost above hosni and prime your job is to secure the outpost for our extraction team who will arrive aboard the shuttle gladius behind enemy lines you must be precise and swift we have no room for error titan to gain access you'll have to eliminate perimeter defenses intelligence reports missile platforms defending hosnian space destroy them the outpost itself is protected by turbo laser cannons on all sides evade and eliminate them all when you've secured the area you will escort the gladius to the outpost and our extraction team will acquire agent thorne once thorn is secure reach your gozanti cruisers and return to the overseer do not lose our spy under any circumstances that is all i'm relisol no need to introduce yourself i've already reviewed your service record it's been a long time since you were on the front lines in days past a mission like ours would have been afforded every possible resource unfortunately times are tight since endor in one battle we lost our emperor and gained a hundred warring factions if only emperor palpatine hadn't dissolved the imperial senate at least then senators like my parents could have maintained order after endor but no not that i questioned the emperor's decision of course but now that he's gone we must look to the future and reinstating the senate would help subdue all of this infighting we can talk later perhaps now more than ever the empire needs reliable soldiers like agent thorne like you unity is the only path to progress i trust you are aligned with admiral sloane's vision for the empire we cannot afford to fracture not after endor this mission is a vital step towards dismantling the rebellion and they are a rebellion don't be fooled by their new name the new republic will fall just like the last one it's time for you to play your part get to the hangar ready your ship newcomer welcome to titan call me shen before you ask helmet stays on cockpit or not too many hard landings broken neck five six times cybernetics keep me going fight fall get up fight again all for the empire another time you'll be the new pilot sergeant wait chief mechanic and head of the hangar crew don't see the appeal in flying myself but i've been working on ties since they rolled off the assembly line your fight is in good hands the overseer saw some action at pothole in jail but it's had a complete inspection and overhauled for this mission admiral sloane's orders and on my orders every tie in this hang has been serviced and test flown tighten half the rivets myself we're ready gotta say i don't know how you and titan cope out there no shields or life support just hold plating between you and space it must build character never met a tie pilot who backed down from any challenge shields or not i've prepared your starfighter to match the latest imperial guidelines but if you've got a preferred component we'll need something customized i'll take care of it just say the word your tie fight is ready good flying titan can always use another pilot so long as you're good at killing rebels we're going right into their territory hosnian prime we'll give those scum just a taste of what it was like at endor i was there you know when the rebellion murdered our emperor half my squad died trying to defend him captain carol understands she doesn't lecture me about justifiable force like my other commanders she knows all i need is a target politics are for admirals i keep it simple always shoot to kill mess with the squadron and you mess with me but do your job and i'll have your back later the tie fighter classic maneuverable flexible can't take much direct fire but that's no problem for a skilled pilot your loadout however is not standard and again neither are any of titan squadron's missions hoped you'd pick that right that'll help you out [Music] [Applause] is immediately or you will be destroyed remember we must be swift and precise they'll scramble fighters quickly no doubt they'll reinforce from the surface as well as the station rebels arrived they don't teach this at the academy attack that target here and ready to go missile defense system is activated to the station fire on my target unless you have a death wish nice we're with you titan engage that target that's what i like to see keep it up our path is clear advance on the outpost that's how it's done titan what they reached our missile defenses scramble i wish i could see the panic inside that station right now we should take out the shield generator without it the turbo lasers are vulnerable rebel starfighters inbound watch your backs changed information eliminate the rebel transport engagement target destroyed got them all attacked this side's clear attack off remains tight finish off the rest titan engage that target defenses are critically low keep it up attack that target lost shields attack the outpost is defenseless titan this is shuttle gladius inbound for extraction we read you gladius titan will rendezvous with these coordinates titan engaged that target attack that target titan engage that target attack that target here and ready to go fire on my target attack titan engage that target viral my target attack [Applause] fire on my engage that target here we go [Applause] good riddance rebel scum let's get you to the outpost's landing platform affirmative squadron leader from defend the shuttle [Music] the shuttle is under attack fire on my target textbook that's the last of the star fighters they've reached the station initiating extraction imperial shuttle has landed they're storming the outpost squadron we're on route to agent thorn's location standby escaping with agent thorne as captain carroll's strategy we gain nothing by destroying a single outpost [Music] only to die in space shoot them all down attack that target be careful next time you save my life target couldn't have done it without you [Music] attack that target formation and looking on i can engage that top my life is in capable hands we won't let you down agent thorne titan squadron regroup with the cladius we're clear of the station cover our escape and escort us to the jump point affirmative agent thorne take out those fighters [Applause] don't let that target fall here just keep moving star fighters incoming titan engaged that target they sent some watch out another frigate [Applause] you have my thanks titan squadron and my respect shuttle gladius jumping to lightspeed we did it squadron reach the carrier and load up let's leave this wretched system more rebel ships inbound you're officially part of the squadron now [Music] pilots when captain carol said she was bringing in one more pilot i didn't know what to expect i've been flying a long time this wouldn't be the first squadron i've seen compromised by nepotism but you did well today pilot most spy extractions end with significantly more casualties if the team had any reservations about you joining titan squadron you certainly put them to rest now let's go captain carol is waiting before launch you
