that now oh you want to blow up [Applause] gotcha [ __ ] come on [Music] [Music] all yeah hmm [Music] oh [ __ ] i'm on my way when it comes to power they don't see the chair all right one two drop him one move and he died check who needs help and bring in some medics and make sure there's no more of those [ __ ] renegades in the area yes commander you you're right boy jackman come on frank you all right i saw your fight what's your name aidan if it weren't for you a lot more would be dead come on boys search the area sir i have a question we're looking for a gre database most gre equipment has been dead for years what do you need this database for your knowledge of the city you know gre places inside out aidan and i need to find this database will you help us loan he's your friend aiden you could say that i've never heard of you aiden where are you from i'm a pilgrim i came from outside the walls so you've seen a lot you probably became thrilled vilador too right all right what do you want to know a lot has been going on there lately we lost our commander and the bizarrio has tried to cut off our power source they say most of our people have been killed either by the infected or by those from the bazaar i also lost contact with the new commander aytor in his unit know anything about them we found walt but he overpowered us and escaped what where in the tunnels near the car plant waltz decimated ater's squad i barely managed to escape i shouldn't have left them like this we need to find out what's going on there as for the gre equipment you're asking about you can ask lieutenant ro if something's working he'll know about it lately he and his unit have been securing the culvert islands and new dawn park areas but because of the butcher's raid we had to go radio silent so you have to look for him yourselves if you find him give him these what are they orders for him and the other units move it boys let's go come outside let's talk please my house got hit by a renegade missile where did you learn to fight like that where on the road as a pilgrim i had no other choice on the road don't you wonder sometimes what they gave us to make us like this stronger rather [ __ ] in the head but yeah [ __ ] up and stronger maybe i'll figure that out when i find mia what's next well you heard it yourself row might know where you can access that damn database here take these orders to him just don't lose him or jack will gut me what about you i'll join you but first i have to see frank you saw him he's barely holding it together so uh frank he's not exactly the most reliable source of help you don't know what you're talking about he was a night runner even though these days he can't even say the name properly when he's drunk aren't the night runners ancient history history can repeat itself for good and for bad legends can't say what you want i believe that when the time comes if the time comes frank will rise to the occasion who knows maybe he'll even invite me to join the club and jack the commander do you trust him jack matt he's a smart guy but a bit of a narcissist what do you mean well he's only a major but refers to himself as commander in chief but he gave us rose location and a chance to find the gre terminal i don't care about the rest what about this rogue guy you know ro too [ __ ] well i do he's a great commander and a [ __ ] hothead for some reason people say we have a lot in common once jack sent his squad to a spot that turned out to be a dark zone people panicked and they probably wouldn't have made it out of there but roe kept his cool makes them all back out and suddenly starts banging a stick on some barrels attracting the [ __ ] it was a suicidal plan but the vital thing was it was a plan that's what makes soldiers think clear again if the night runner still existed frank would have recruited him for sure okay good start with culvert island the pk have an outpost there hey luanne you should know that in old vilidor i came into conflict with ader i blew up the peacekeeper's windmill and we really don't like each other are you afraid they'll figure out what you've done didn't you hear what jack was saying take it easy nobody has contact with old villadora here and even if there was someone by that time we'll have already found what we're looking for and stay on the radio all the time sure thing partner [Music] one day they might just blow up the damn and flood the entire city pilgrim stay frosty there might still be tangos in the area [Music] god we can live safely in the powered areas luan i'm nearing culvert island great frank stored it out so i'm on my way if you get ro to tell you where the terminal is let me know you'll find your sister i'll find the missing names of [ __ ] for my kill list everyone will be happy except the people you shoot they won't be in any condition to care what the hell good uh i hear the butcher's men are high hey i'm looking for the lieutenant got orders from matt matt you're not pk does it matter he gave them to me and here i am delivering him a steady let's call someone and clear this up okay hey you there don't move a muscle for all i know

believe in our mission but if no one else believes we should stay protect the civilians everyone i'm going to new dawn park apparently roe went there i still don't understand why the renegades attacked them they've got their camps but butcher hasn't attacked the fisheye since never even he respected the night runner so no [ __ ] clue what's going on in his head are you kidding me butcher tell me more about him [Music] [Applause] i'm sorry i'm not saw my dad once in my whole life and if mom was good at anything i was drinking she abandoned me that's how you ended up in walt's program

fighting my side since before the fall they gave their lives for that scrap of the city and now what i'm supposed to pull back listen yeah i'm just a messenger just calm down and talk oh you don't think i'm calm i'm a [ __ ] oasis of zen nirvana [ __ ] walking bartesa's husband how's he gonna keep calm huh when i leave her body on this godforsaken turf sierra and brosco's mom she's not gonna be calm to learn a boy's died here in vain what should i tell him all this for nothing just cause matt signed a piece of paper and sent it to me we do the real work out here and it's nothing to matt to take it all away with a smear of ink [ __ ] total [ __ ] i'm looking for access to the gre database i hear you know where i can do that yeah i do but why the [ __ ] would i tell you under the circumstances i got important if idiotic business to attend to get out of my sight okay gentlemen gather the dog tags of the fallen it [ __ ] sucks but an order's an order bro wait lawn you come to piss me off too you know me ro aiden and me both are looking for that gre database and you're gonna tell us you want to drag this out or take care of it here and now [ __ ] why are you after the database i've heard it was stored on servers in the observatory command center but that building was destroyed in the chemical attacks years ago the bombings came one after the other like we were the [ __ ] vietcong nothing was left understand nada if you want check for yourselves gentlemen we're going [Music] what's next next didn't you hear that database sounds long gone so much for discovering the mystery of our childhood i'll go back to looking for the shits on my hit list and you you can enjoy life in the center maybe rose wrong maybe something survived intact after all the butcher dropped chemicals the place was reduced to toxic rubble you given up are you deaf or dumb those chemical bombs destroyed everyone and everything they touched was a [ __ ] waste of time frank was right i am [ __ ] naive what's the deal with those renegades why did they attack the canteen how would i know williams is a [ __ ] lunatic a butcher and a murderer he killed half the city with a chemical weapon strike now he's ordering his men to attack civilians in the center right after waltz turned on the power walt and that psychopath are buddies i wouldn't be surprised if they planned that together as well i'm going to the observatory then you're going alone so we're splitting up all good things must come to an end the butcher and the pricks from my list they'll find this out soon enough i'm going back to looking for them you shouldn't stay here either aiden i'm sorry you didn't find your sister yeah thanks you've always got waltz he probably knows what happened to her if i find him i'll let you know good luck gotcha take care everyone go there's nothing more to say hello hello we're under attack surrounded us on the island we don't stand a chance i'm begging you help who me hmm yes i could i could definitely paint you but but no no i have to avoid distractions not if i want to finish my greatest work the greatest work what's that a grand fresco my magnum opus a painting of epic proportions the world is not prepared to see but i can't finish it i i don't have the proper shade of red red yes the reddest red i need it badly and all these idiot merchants have is some kind of pale joke without the reddest red my project will remain incomplete and my art will not find the expression it requires of course i could get my hands on but but no that's just such a crazy idea it sends shivers down my spine let's hear it oh my uh are you sure that okay then i i have to admit i already experimented in secret and what i need is blood of the infected but not just any infected i find the blood of a goon is the only one that is apt to give me the true deep red i need i've been observing this particular goon in a certain area and have taken to leaving out red wine for it to drink wine should make its blood an even more intense shade it becomes rather aggressive after drinking the wine do you think you're up to the task of bringing me the creature's blood sure sounds like fun go then come back when you've acquired its blood [Music] come on out peggy [Music] [Music] you see that the [ __ ] [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] you can come out they can't bother you now what happened here when we were just working then they attacked went for our supplies and cut down anyone in their way yeah but not everyone the others where are they i didn't see anyone else he must have been taken oh god maria robert they took my friends have they been attacking other camps survivors from the camp to the south said that they were attacked today too they took food and the able-bodied young men forced them to join them apparently we all knew the renegades are nasty sons of [ __ ] but they kept their distance from us until now you know where they would have taken your friends the border between the butcher's turf and ours is close to here that's where the renegades have their camp will you help them please there are no peacekeepers here no one to help them i'll try thank you be careful they might have outposts along the route i'll guide you over the radio my name's casper yes me hmm [Music] um that survivor was right something is really [ __ ] wrong here i'm at the first outpost there's no sign of your friends well they must have moved on toward the camp uh further west on fulton tower road catch them before they get there i'm on my way no i don't understand they said the renegades are dangerous but the cease-fire lasted for years it's as if they no longer fear the peacekeepers what changed that maybe we're about to find out i'll be in touch oh my favorite is something wrong no nothing talking to myself that's all i can see something's the matter but okay it's just there's nothing that can be done there are too many of them too many who renegades degenerates six months ago they kidnapped my son rook and they forced me to produce drugs for them i was the chemistry teacher in school before the epidemic i held one of them back great but what about your son they're holding him hostage if i'm late with the next batch of drugs they'll kill him maybe what these bandits need is a lesson but there's a whole band of them i've faced far worse odds than that i'm not a fan of kidnapping will you help me yeah i'll try wear the keeping rook in the military building overlooking the canal south of muddy grounds near culvert island the entrance is on saint paul boulevard past the red car carrier just be careful i went there myself once trying to frame my boy they caught me [Music] then later brought me one of brooke's fingers as long as these bastards are alive they'll never leave us alone i'll be careful i'll follow you wait outside for you to come out what's your name aidan thank you hayden [Music] what are they doing with my son in there come on uh there's no one here either they might have stopped at the overlook by the windmill on garrison boulevard hurry up if they reach camp it'll be much harder to rescue them i'll catch up to them i think i saw who was commanding those renegades it was elias he was a survivor lived in the area two years ago he was a lawyer before the epidemic of man of principle and he disappeared there was a lot of talk about it it disappeared a year ago this guy keeps sniffing around here one of the butcher's men they said and that he worked for the gre back in the day he tried to talk people into going to the dam promised them weapons the ones who did never came back [Music] when i saw elias just before he looked strung out like he was on drugs his eyes what was terrifying i'll look into it [Music] [Music] yeah i made it all i found were some renegades here so they made it to the camp there's no saving my friends now i'll scout out the camp and see what i find but we can't give up help them please yes [Music] weird [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] you see that i think [Music] [Music] maybe what are you doing here let these people

juan would rather use caviar hey you he's gonna envy your purchases that's for sure uh what did they serve yesterday yesterday hulk biomarker oh you again you don't recognize me ah the guy with matt's orders bravo report to meyer in dispatch the commander is on his way back from the field does matt often go out on field missions he used to be he was hardly ever on the ship i was in the field i was helping that's why i joined the peacekeepers but lately matt's been acting weird i'm not sure what that's about it's been this way since before old vilidor and the renegade attack there now this [ __ ] with the withdrawal i i don't get it whatever's going on i hope he addresses the men soon helps us understand this [ __ ] withdrawal he's probably got his reasons whatever they are innocent people are gonna get killed go see meyer thanks you can go [Music] [Music] hey where's dispatch [Music] there [Music] all right man we take care of the uv lamps and head back to base it should be on point fast and easy go go they've already attacked two of them everything we can to arm you if needed if you could intervene why'd you leave in the first place this is [ __ ] wasn't your father some famous war hero i bet he's rolling over in his grave watch your mouth civilian things are tough all over you know that [Music] ah you i remember you from the canteen yeah i guess from the fight in the canteen uh maybe don't sweat it you can really hold your own i respect that aiden right commander told me to brief you about faction matters missy welcomes you uh who's missy it's the name of the ship you're standing in she played a key role during the revolution missy was meant to deliver drugs masks and other critical medical supplies then return home but by then home was gone she and her crew had nowhere to go and what about now now she serves as pk headquarters in command central all directives are issued from right here smart easier to defend than a building exactly what did those survivors want talking about our little argument they want what everyone wants safety which i understand but we have to keep our eye on the bigger picture here and it pisses me off when people mention my father i don't mean to pry but uh what's the deal with your father ah this again since you're new here i'll tell you the short version classic story saved a bunch of his fellow soldiers some civilians and got a medal what was this long time ago back when people were only fighting each other and not each other and infected at the same time joe is he why you joined the military pretty much he must have been very proud sure why not where is matt in the field he came across a lead in old vilidor you gotta wait see that board i got plenty that needs doing and not enough men you want to pick up some of our slack we pay well [ __ ] that's major math something's happened bankroll the other way he's bleeding out [ __ ] haters in really bad shape take him to the infirmary summon the medics we have to save him hang on tour we won't let you go you hear me get moving better hope ader survives we lost too many people in old villadore jack will do all he can to find out who did this juan would rather enjoy his caviar than take care of that lamb delivery you're siding with the enemy someday those chickens may just kind of lost move along [Music] here the pk engineers are working on alarms and electric traps i recognize your uniform um you're one of those carriers right sure need a message delivered no i'm in the market for information not sending it and nothing i can do for you yeah so i hear but uh and maybe your boss can help me our guildmaster driscoll maybe i don't know he has the authority but you'd have to be a very special case i don't know about me but what i'm after is important you can try to speak to driscoll but don't get your hopes up story of my life where can i find him in a headquarters on downtown court inside the metro station that bears the same name you'll know it when you see it and driscoll you can't miss him sounds good thanks a lot [Music] i hope that knows what he's doing hey you want to be sent back to the outlands keep that bio marker in plain true what's the situation know what this is these brass knuckles belonged first to commander lucas then they passed on to etor what happened in old villadore it can't happen again we have to save the city aiden from the plague from the butcher and his men whatever they're planning okay but over the radio you said you have information for me yes but before we get down to that tell me aiden what do you need this database for what does it contain i'm looking for my sister what happened to her long time ago waltz heard her he took her from me and i want him to tell me where she is if she's still alive somewhere that's why i was looking for the gre command center to access walt's database on its servers so we have a common enemy meaning waltz that's the butcher's right hand man he pumps his men full of inhibitors we can get them both i brought you here because i know that a few gre scientists are hiding out in the city we picked up the trail of one of them right before the renegade attack sounds promising when i find a scientist we'll see what they know if they're of no use we'll find another and another until you get the answers you're looking for why are the former gre in hiding they're afraid of the wrath of the people people angry because the gre spread the infection so it's true the gre brought in the virus who else they say they performed experiments in their bases they brought in containers from haran at night in secret from the government and then everything collapsed in revenge people captured the scientists and hanged them from land posts and killed the only people who had a chance of finding a cure there is no cure and there never will be aiden that's gre propaganda fine what do you want in return what do you think i want maybe the same thing both of us want the city has electricity again the renegades are on the attack for the first time since the war ended they attacked her outposts in the city center but new possibilities have opened up for us as well thanks to the electricity we can fire up the biggest antenna in the center on the vnc tower spire what you want to defeat the butcher using radio in a way the signal will let me reach a larger number of people communication between settlements will be improved we'll enlist more recruits and defend the city and then it will be easier to find the surviving gre doctors you need i'll do my part but what guarantee do i have that you'll help me after you don't trust me aiden i haven't been here that long but i can already tell that kept promises are rare in this city if we don't find any of the gre scientists i promise i'll get waltz for you you're working with luan which makes me think you're looking for him too okay i'm in good the butcher attacked for a reason i want to make sure this city is safe no matter what you all right sir maya will share our plan with you go see her as soon as you can oh and aiden you don't have to call me sir to friends i'm jack okay jack god damn renegade these renegades it seems they're everywhere not for long once we get the transmitter on top of the vnc tower the butcher will have to retreat i'm not sure it's going to be so simple jack simple i heard you're doing a hell of a job clearing the city of rats do you think they might be looking for something in the center i mean they keep coming but it's not like an organized attack of course it's not organized because it's being led by a madman if williams is really crazy why didn't he just flood the city with the toxic water instead of sending in random excursions crazy is as crazy does aiden given how easily he could do it destroying the city isn't his goal not all at once at least by sending in bloodthirsty renegades the butcher's just creating chaos for his own sake so the good people of the city become steeped in fear as he sits there in his high throne in white [ __ ] gloves and listens to classical music that sounds pretty [ __ ] up to me but we can counteract his terrorism with our campaign of enlightenment that's why it's so vital to get the transmitter operating so the people know the true enemy then we can defend ourselves properly nothing i think i know everything i need good luck then until today i thought our chances against renegades were pretty good but now okay [Music] move along citizen what the hell is supply doing delivering no stephen a filthy herb brother will decide my husband's fate is that why you got a medical degree to go running to quacks for magic cures listen we don't have medicine herbs are our only chance my husband has fought for you for years you must get medicine for him not some herbs that might poison him time to go kids how is he ator is strong but he needs medicine and that unfortunately we don't have we did the best we could with what we have after the chemical attack some plants gained healing properties they work like an antibiotic but still i people here have strong opinions about healers but you can hardly blame them the folk healers give sound advice but it can prove difficult to follow correctly misremember something gather the wrong herb or use the wrong dosage and instead of medicine you administer poison which has happened plenty because if somebody messes up one of the steps of the recipe it could kill him exactly but it's enough to listen carefully to the healer's instructions and follow them the herbalist i know she's talented she's aytor's only hope and what's his wife's problem superstitions die hard margaret has helped many people everywhere some just don't want to admit it think i can help you'd be doing us a big favor what happened in old veldedore is terrible we've lost so many people as far as i know ator is our only witness so if he dies we don't find out what happened there exactly where can i find this healer on covet island don't worry you can trust margaret [Music] so you
