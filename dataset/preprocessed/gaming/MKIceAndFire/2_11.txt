premier comrade mielekov comrade agents thank you for coming here's what we know so far ten years ago the united states government covered up an invasion by an alien race known as furons the primary agent was this mira cryptosporidium 137 dangerous unpredictable loud deceased so what is being problem the problem content is that neurons can clone themselves and pose convincingly as human and they've used these abilities to put cryptosporidium 138 into the white house and the american people are not noticing all right pull the other one even worse this new crypto cloth contains pure neuron dna harvested from human brains by orthodox 13 mastermind of the invasion he also bears a mysterious new mutation referred to only as the package these aliens pose entire threat to the soviet union comrades that so must be destroyed as we speak president crypto is in bay city attending a new cultural festival [Music] there's only one way to live with such men [Music] revolution oh that can't be good greetings comrade mother russia sends her regards [Music] you expect me to beg human no little furon i expect you to die mine uh are you receiving the mothership has been destroyed you must come to my aid immediately follow the distressed beacon to my location [Music] crypto these kgb agents are trying to freakish hurry up um what's wrong one [Music] crypto the mothership has somehow been destroyed and i've been blown to smithereens luckily i was able to download a copy of my exquisite mind into this holopox unit just before the ship exploded gee that is lucky virtual pox huh kinda constricting ain't it well vegas can't be choosers i need to bring in some big guns i know where i can get my hands on some i did manage to jettison some data cores before the mothership was hit you might be able to recover some weapons from them if you can find any but it certainly won't be easy okay so where are the data cores that's just it they could have entered the atmosphere at any time in any place and therefore landed anywhere on the planet i've managed to locate only one it was ejected after my hollow box unit so it landed quite nearby what's a data core you never studied did you a datacore is a device used for storing weapons or other furon technology the outer casing is extremely dense and should have easily survived the fall to earth the only real trick will be finding them i didn't bring any with me figured uh heavy artillery ain't exactly the smoothest way to charm the jeans off a pacifist hippie chick oh i knew it i knew your unnatural interest in humans would bring us nothing but trouble whoa whoa whoa you're harsh in my buzz mellow out proxy easy for you to say you weren't blown to pieces just seconds before restoring your own genitalia well i guess there's nothing left to do but scout the area and find that data core you cannot stop revolution oh maybe some kind of jet pack first [Music] yes what is this some sinister capitalism just like you dreaming i am choosing life get out of the way i could be having you deported [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] whatever it is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] is well that wasn't a complete disaster now get back here we have much to discuss and by discuss i mean i have your new orders [Music] i don't understand it we blew that alien spacecraft out of the sky and yet the shriveled geriatric ones somehow survived this showpass must be harder to kill than we thought i spit on them nonetheless inform the kremlin we shall proceed with the operation as planned tell them we need as much revelations they can ship as quickly as they can ship it ah agent orange and our american distributor he suspects nothing in fact he seemed quite enthusiastic about whole idea he thinks he'll be spreading revolution in a paper cup and so he will but not i think the sort he expects idealists they spit on them stalin he understood ideas may start revolutions but guns and gulags finish them well no matter soon the citizens of bay city will be embarking on a very bad trip [Laughter] [Music] uh-huh [Laughter] jeez box my head's still spinning what the hell is going on around here why are those ruskies gunning for us frankly i'm more concerned with how the kgb managed such a successful twin strike they're not usually so organized we need to find them crypto before they spring any more surprises i should have known the drugs the alcohol the loose chicks the signs they were all there it's obvious those hippies were trying to lure me in so i'd let my guard down nice try hippies but i'm not just any mindless hedonist i'm the best don't worry pox i've got this covered i'll wipe out every one of those bastards for what they did to my guns and you slow down crypto i doubt hippies had much to do with ambushing you and destroying the mothership oh damn on the other hand their brains don't provide much usable dna anyway so knock yourself out if you're so inclined okay so what i just start knocking on doors and doing the slice and dice you do not the kgb are hardly likely to hang around if you just start indiscriminately blowing away humans yeah well i was just brainstorming well stop i've done a little research in the criminal files of the local constabulary apparently there's one informant in main city who always knows what's going down on the streets they call him the freak the freak huh yeah i've heard about him cat's got connections all over town he's kind of a burnout though from what i hear he doesn't even need drugs anymore he lives in his own personal mental lava lamp but if any of those stinky monkeys knows what the kgb are up to i bet he does and i suggest you locate him and find out what he knows all right enough chit-chat i'm off to find her little hippie friend the freak hmm oh nobody saw that that should be we got him 10-4 all units stand down that freak at the park should be put away for good her friend promised me some of the primo stuff if i visit him on the hill later on he's kind of creepy but i do love his fine colombian the queen promised me some of the primo stuff if i visit him on the hill later on he's kind of creepy but if i see that freak down at the

your efforts to your decadent nation you shall not have died in vain but in charlotte no no i wanted to save america not destroy it oh man what have i done excuse me sometimes it's kinder just to put

foodle shall rise newly born to prepare ye for that day when ark foodle shall come again wait a minute it sounds incredible i know but crypto what if it's hmm i did take a red pill this morning okay just for the sake of argument let's say you're right how the hell am i supposed to bring about the second coming of art poodle the scriptures say ark foodle will return when enough seekers believe in him again you mean like tinkerbell is something like that but crypto this is ideal humanity is desperate to reconnect the physical and spiritual all that's needed is for you to spread the good pickup line of hog food they're bound to follow you you want me to start a cult basically religion is the opiate of the masses i like it but how do i do it well humans tend to sublimate their individuality into tribal units bound by social and political commonality such groups are full of darphil sheep ripe for conversion to the way of the sacred crotch hail arc [Music] time to get religious hallelujah before you do it would be wise to go and seek the blessing of ogfoodle himself what you mean one of those statues with a pigeon crap on it precisely seek the blessing and your cults will prosper if you say so but i'm gonna feel like a putts foreign [Applause] there's a floyd song in this somewhere [Music] and the population's nerves are frayed then shall the ground be fit to sow and the masses shall follow thus space are true [Music] down [Music] everything is take the sacred crotch to the masses oh [Music] goddamn flashbacks [Music] can i help you [Music] there's someone there we've got
