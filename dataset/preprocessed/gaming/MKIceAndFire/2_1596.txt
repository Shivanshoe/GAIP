Satan you mean it wasn't killed with everyone else there's no killing that guy huh let's just leave him here no I think we better take him with us I've been watching him from commies lookout he's a good person deep down there's some clumsy way actually [Music] [Music] ten day you're alive so glad to see you mr. Popo he threw me down here before majin buu could kill me we owe mr. Popo a lot thanks to his quick-thinking we have a chance hey what's wrong with the kid his face is all green kid what do you mean kid he's a guardian over the Guardian huh it's majin buu something's not right what is he up to [Music] hey you little ruts come over here I want us to finish our fight What did he say well no you don't Fuu you're still fighting me yeah hey first I want to finish the fight with them then you and me can fights why why do you want to fight them first what happened to all that talk about you wanting to kill me [Applause] for good trunks now you're talking wait something isn't right here don't you find all of this kind of strange just that kids power and that piccolo guy's brains [Music] what No what do you think Gohan looks like my plan was a huge success you have just witnessed the birth of the ultimate Marjan are you dirty slimy I can't believe you actually absorbed them you have only yourself to blame after all you made the mistake of surpassing me I've been planning this from the very first time I felt your power from far away I knew what I had to do as I fought that super coaching sprats I figured out that absorbing him would make me completely untouchable but the kids power hadn't Iblees he told me so himself I couldn't have him returning to normal so i bided my time go treat said it would take another hour to fuse again so I lied in ways and tell me so that's what you were up to [Music] you know if you really wanted to obtain the ultimate power you should have absorbed me you still don't get it do you what's the point if I have no one to rifle me didn't you hear me when we fought before I am going to kill you that's my ultimate goal huh I see so that's your angle makes sense [Music] die that's surprisingly rational soare being piccolo [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah [Music] you're no match for me as you are now a mess I'm starting to get bored time to finish this you [Music] what no way he can't beat him he's not strong enough hmm I certainly did not see this coming well then that settles it Goku you're going to go help him huh but I can't that's right elder Kai Goku is no longer able to return to the world of the living I'm fully aware of that that's why I'm going to offer him my life he can then make his way to go on you're gonna give me your life are you serious I can't allow that if you don't let me the entire universe is history then I'll offer him my life it's the least I can do to help that's enough of that you're still young me on the other hand I've only got another thousand or so years left for cramps farewell and good luck thanks Gramps I promise try not to waste the life you've given me all right now don't get my sacrifice being gained right okay I'm out of here wait just a second I forgot something take my Patara wear one on your left here when you get there way to say so wearing this will make me stronger in a sense yes if Gohan where's the other on his right here you two will combine into one warrior what what what are you serious yes and the effect is far stronger than that other fusion technique those Patara earrings are considered a sacred treasure among the supreme Kai's I never knew about that your younger generations are truly hopeless go on try it for ourselves you in Kabuto use your own Bottari earrings [Music] Wow this power it's incredible huh huh with this power I can join the fight too don't get carried away you don't neither of you were much on your own infusing isn't going to change that I see wow you weren't kidding Gramps that's awesome oh yeah by the way how long does the fusion last the Patara don't have a weakness like that the fusion lasts forever it's permanent [Music] well as far as I know there's a shock I'd be fused with go on forever well I guess I can live with that [Music] quit your incessant babbling and get out of here do you want Gohan to die right all right I'm off oh and thanks for everything you I will destroy everyone that dad dad is that you what are you doing here go on take this dude pick it up hurry put it on your right ear the two of us are gonna fuse and take booth down watch fuse [Music] found it what was I supposed to do with it again dr. hopper no not go on no it's gotta be kidding me come on yes I'm even more powerful than before I can't feel the gun what will you do now you tried to fuse with Gohan but it looks like I beat you to it there's no one left for you to feel come on man think you're tricky huh absorbing everyone like that believe this this energy it's it's what's wrong giving up already and it's time for you to die this headset transmission [Music] this is as far as I can go King Yemma was kind enough to return your body but only so you can be here to fight that monster you do understand that right I'll be fine whether I'm dead or alive it makes no difference to me I'll do what I can Vegeta I knew it was you Kakarot listen up Vegeta I need you to wear this on your right ear we're gonna fuse no we aren't why the hell would I do that because this is our only shot of breeding margin boo I'd rather be a race from existence to become one with the likes of you Vegeta forget your pride just this once the whole universe is done for if we don't do this you've got some nerve you hid a great deal of your power from me when we last fought didn't you Kakarot what is this Super Saiyan 3 you never cease to piss me off you know that I will not fuse with a bastard like you I'm sorry Vegeta I can't stay in that form very long I was saving it for when I really needed it I don't want to hear your excuses you've disrespected me by holding back I've never been so humiliated maybe this will change your mind then everyone's been eaten by Buu even Bulma and Trunks who's on his way here please you want to save them right give it to me now there you are Vegeta just a heads up dispute is permanent there's no going back after this got it well what did you fight damn you why would you wait until now to tell me that this is what I'm supposed to do right yep thanks for Tita just happened rivals unite against majin buu since I'm the fusion of Vegeta and Kakarot I guess that makes me the Jesus [Music] impressive [Music] come [Music] how dare you talk me director [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] I'm just getting started [Applause] [Music] I'm still waiting for you to take this seriously alright I'm starting to get bored so let's go ahead and end this I'll give you until the count of ten say your prayers if you've got any 1 2 3 4 what are you doing now's your chance come on you've only got one move left when you're in this kind of position at this room wait that's it I can use the part of me that he cut off earlier 7 8 so he finally figured it out it's about time this is the whole reason I cut off that ridiculous tail thing on his head fairly good he's not paying attention 9 all right time to see if this is going to work [Music] I did it I [Laughter] [Music] you
