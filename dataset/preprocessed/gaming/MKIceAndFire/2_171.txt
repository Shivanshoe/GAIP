looks like something is happening near walker's hat perhaps i should take a look i can hardly believe it's you the one fated to save my people that woman seems to know me oh it's you valka said we would meet but i can hardly believe the great evil is fated to save my little isle of skye who are you a hat of yourself has always eat it ever edith is an old friend and a seer she contacted me for advice her people are plagued by nightmares to the point of madness i wasn't aware people settle from the isle of skye there are small settlements but it is a place of passage for many making it perfect for dreams to wreak havoc until now i've mostly been deciphering if my cousin's feasting on feathers in her dreams means she should marry a farmer or a baker you've lost me again it needs your help and it's not just her people being affected as someone deeply in tune with the spirit realm i have also begun to lose sleep i fear it may spread to our settlement soon i will investigate but it is not as if i have experience chasing away bad dreams there is more you're not going to like this avor but i believe somehow randy is involved perhaps even responsible i know randy's whereabouts better than most and she isn't um what i mean to say is she couldn't do something like this ever since the nightmare started here i began asking the spirits for clarity and the vision came to me though it was cloudy i know what i saw you will find randy amidst a scene of death on the isle of skye the two of you will fight before you are forced to pathways forever that just can't be true believing is your choice the only way to find the truth and stop the nightmares from spreading is if you go to the isle of skye i must tend to my duties but edith can take you when you are ready so are you ready my people can't go without sleep any longer i'll find out what's plaguing your people whatever or whomever it may be [Music] oh [Music] so here we are the isle of skye beautiful isn't it any idea where i should go first investigate kilter ragland first it's where complaints of nightmares began my hut is there too if you need to find me nothing but [Applause] [Music] are you all right i'm here too an eagle an eagle will bring ruin to us all i saw it in a dream the nightmares certainly seem bad here it started [Music] [Applause] [Music] you what can you tell me about the nightmares everyone is having tell you tell you i don't need to tell you about them they will come for you soon enough these nightmares spread like a plague worse than a plague sickening your mind vivid but not useful is everything all right you seem find the warrior woman with the braid she is our undoing stealing our dreams a warrior with a braid i can't be randby where is she at a church northwest of town that's all i saw in my dreams find her and please let me speak having dreams of my ex-lover ruining it to start a fight her vision was cloudy was she seeing randy in this aura and his graveyard or as walker put it a scene of death oh god's right brandry [Music] no cassandra [Music] and you are [Music] your opponents so is this randy good with an axe she is much better than you ah i prefer a spear [Music] are you favorite other weapons too where'd you get that blade [Music] [Music] looks like there are some things to talk about fine if we must so opponent do you have a name abel i take it you're one of the hidden ones not exactly but i admire their work you're not going to talk straight let's go back to fighting i'm not a hidden one but i have friends that are and often my goals align with theirs i assume the same is true for you yes i've made friends with the hidden ones and i agree with their goals and perhaps we might have more in common than we thought you haven't told me why you're here after coming all the way from where i've traveled so much it's been a long time since i've been from somewhere but the greek world was my home long ago i came here looking for an ancient artifact that's causing this island a great deal of trouble you mean the nightmares i see it told me that the person i'd find amidst death on this island was causing them the same one that mistook me for someone named ranvi maybe your seer is having an off day you're telling me you're not responsible for all these bodies i watched these people tear each other apart out of madness and lack of sleep it's the artifact i'm looking for causing all this normally i'd be quick to track it down but this fog is making things difficult almost impossible if you're so easily blocked by a curse how do you expect to deal with the realm of spirits and dreams a curse you know the secrets of this land well then i do you hear something no no listen something tells me we should work together and what exactly is telling you that the obvious you want to stop the nightmares and i want the artifact causing them help me get rid of this fog so we can find it after such a strange encounter i'm really meant to believe you're not causing the nightmares i swear to you i am here to stop them we can work together for now hey can't do this alone you're quite strong you should know i had you cornered in that fight just moments ago and an even stronger ego to match not surprising what an interesting church and all my travels i've never seen one quite like this are you here to see the sights i'll get rid of this fog i have to take in what i can it's not as if i plan to stay long the curse is fading it'll be much easier to find the artifact now glad i let you down nice work nice work the curse is painting it'll be much easier to find the artifact now glad i let you tag along to help i did most of the work you're getting on my nerves you know these close quarters probably aren't helping let's find a way out let's see you old friend is going on just like the men i saw tearing one another apart it really seemed like someone was talking directly to you in the fight the artifact i'm seeking does cause strange things to occur but i should track it more easily now that the fog is gone as if a foreign i could search these hills hmm ready to commit to being my guide i didn't say that if i'm going to help i need more information like what exactly is this artifact you're seeking the less you know about it the better the better for you you mean you want me to trust you no the artifact is an object of great power left here by old gods left on this island it could wreak havoc on the world why aren't we under whatever spell or curse this artifact seems to have placed over everyone else it is difficult to explain but artifacts like this can affect people differently many are corrupted by them perhaps we are of a similar strength but even if we're not having nightmares we should still be wary of its power if this artifact is ancient and was left here who knows how long ago why is it suddenly causing problems now loki got bored so serious truthfully i'm not sure these artifacts can be activated maybe someone tampered with it after all many are drawn to its powers it tempts them how exactly are you planning to track it down leave that to me finding these artifacts has been my calling for some time now i've developed a knack for tracking them down with the oregon it should be even easier to find let's not waste time what's our next move now that this fog is gone i should be able to better track the artifacts location before that though i'm going to take another look around the church see what i can learn of these foreign lands meet me in topta it'll take more than studying one church to become familiar with this island but fine we'll meet again soon [Music] cassandra is certainly odd i wonder if i can truly trust her took you long enough i was beginning to think all this talk of gods and nightmares might have scared you off i said i would come so great artifact hunter did you track it down as easily as you said you would not quite but after studying this island i found our next step i'll lead you to it if you're ready on to this next step a shared expedition is starting to feel tedious spoken as if finding an ancient artifact long hidden away was supposed to be simple i take it you've been hunting these artifacts for a long time though yes quite some time what led you to this strangely enough a vacation gone horribly wrong now it has become a destiny of sorts what exactly are we going to do with this artifact once we find it i will take it far away from this island for safekeeping to a place where no one can maliciously wield its power power so it's a weapon of some kind in the wrong hands it is the kind of weapon that should never be used a weapon that shouldn't be used that sounds like a sentiment spoken by someone too weak to wield its power it might sound strange to you but trust me its power is not to be taken lightly the survival of your world depends on that this is it somehow this stone formation will bring us closer to the artifact i think it's a riddle of some kind well of course it is since you're clearly an expert at playing with rocks get to solving it then i feel something hide and eat nothing of course you don't see it you don't have my gifted sight that gift wouldn't run in the family would it who might your parents be mind yourself and focus it looks like the isle of skye but there's several markings on it could it no it couldn't be a map [Music] i didn't feel the need to state the obvious [Music] so what are the markings there are several triangles and one x not too far from here what are we waiting for x marks the spot so do you just spend your days attacking strange women in graveyards or do you have other duties i take care of my people we have a settlement ravenclaw that must be nice i've traveled alone for what feels like a lifetime now you speak as a how old are you exactly older than you think but everyone tells me i have a young face that's a very pretty bird flying above you her name is sunan i had a bird once a long time ago an eagle named icarus i prefer ravens eagles are too godly gaudy you're quiet you're thinking of throwing another axe at my head are you no i'm just not compelled to feel silence like you are good that fight took a lot out of me not sure i'm ready for a second you kept me on my toes as well what's that a compliment there's nothing here stand right here why can't you trust me or at least pretend to so this goes faster fine how did you know lots of practice another ambush they must be drawn to the temples are they speaking your language neither left talking or come fighting i've seen this before we'll need shards keys to place on this pedestal that should open no we need to talk those people that attacked us were they speaking your language i already told you the artifact has made them go mad cassandra ava when are you going to see that i'm here to help no you're lying i'm sure of it have i been anything but helpful to you since i got here in the first ambush those men seem to know you and now they're speaking your language you can't take me for such a fool there's a chance that my arrival on the isle of skye might be what activated the artifacts powers but it's not certain and even if it's true that's all the more reason for me to remove it no that's all the more reason for you to leave so i can remove it myself you've done enough i can't trust you cassandra you have no idea what you'd be dealing with you need my help i know what i must do from here and if those men are after you it'll be even easier for me to continue by myself ever please the powers of this artifact are unlike anything you've seen nothing is too powerful for me besides i'm sure i'll make better use of this weapon than you ah fine i've had enough of you anyway you're impossible you're too brash avor and it will undo you i need to find all the shots before i can open the door better get going oh yes could you please be a dear and wade into the very pool so i can sacrifice you to the fairies you're asking if you can kill me since the nightmare started the fairies have whispered in my ear promising power if i find sacrifices for them they've even led me to one of their treasures from my hard work the prettiest shard so please into the pool now fairies are tricky creatures are you sure that shard isn't muddling your mind i haven't quite felt like myself lately you could be on to something take this shot far away from me please time to unlock the temple and end the nightmares [Music] what a strange place who could have known this was on the other sky ah look alive there are more coming i know my presence makes things complicated these people are attacking [Music] activating the artifact and i know me being here makes reaching the artifacts harder harder no one would be trying to kill me if you weren't here right now i know but trust me you will need my help once we reach the artifact these people are nothing compared to its power i'm not getting rid of you am i don't worry i'll grow on you i've seen mechanisms like this before i'll get the light working you direct the beams to those plates near the door there it's opening finally those parts and weapons are so strange they're from my land what are they doing here it's an illusion caused by the artifact and you've been narrowed that mask looks unique i've torn many of those masks from the faces of cultists even knowing their illusions and to see all these things from my my home i don't have a home not anymore [Music] uh that can't be phoebe [Music] [Music] [Music] now oh ugh all that trouble for this you keep it [Music] admit it we make a good team you're not so bad to work with after all terrible at following orders though give me a little credit it's my first time working with another person in i don't know how many years that must get lonely it does from time to time but it's the path i'm meant to walk anyway i should get going it's not good for me to stay in one place long thank you for your help truly wait the north celebrate the victories and since in the end you did help why not come out for a drink with me i don't know about that it's not really good for me to be seen by too many people if everyone drinks enough no one will ever know you were here all right what can it hurt hopefully you'll head tomorrow morning if we have a great time meet you at the longhouse in kilteracle see you there [Music] um there you are ready for that drink let's head inside what is it there are a lot of people i haven't been to a party in some time i guess i'm nervous it's not as though you're going in there alone i'll be with you i guess you're right let's go inside [Music] okay well i'm ready for a drink what about you [Music] what do you say we find out who the real norseman is with a little drinking say you don't know what you're getting yourself [Music] [Music] we're sweating [Music] going to oh you can really hold your meat now if we had been drinking wine i would have won wine that's child's play not if it's for marcos's vineyard let's welcome paint from advanced marcus who's marcus an old friend that made truly terrible wine well look you really are drunk now you're just spouting nonsense [Music] no no it's a greek swear word it's my luck that's it you got it now let me teach the bride and groom are here [Applause] [Music] are we crashing a wedding it was arrogant to assume these people were here to celebrate us saving their asses come let's join in their revelry [Music] what do you say we make that bright day and get rid of that [ __ ] don't you mean that indeed ah [Applause] oh thank you you saved my wedding we actually saved it twice all in a day's work aren't you the heroes who saved the island and our wedding i did a little more than she did but yes we would love it if you both gave a toast at our wedding we hardly know you what would we say but your exploits have made our wedding a day to remember please regale us with your tail i could be up for that what about you ivor all right but if we're going to do this together cassandra let's make it interesting what do you suggest a flying competition of course ah never tried it myself i should warn you though i've battled with great philosophers stop posting and prove yourself my day began the strangest way an axe thrown at my head tending to slay there stood evil hot-headed and brash to see us now you'd not believe our clash it took an ambush or two and one dusty old temple forever to say that i could be helpful but somehow i've melted his and despite her transgressions i'll give her a fresh start i really thought this would be better avor did the heavy lifting left the tracking job to eye in the end we triumphed chasing the nightmares far from sky and to the bride and groom on this historic day if your love survived this nothing stands in your way oh that was wonderful you've really made this a night to remember it's been a while since i've been the center of attention how did it feel strangely familiar i'm glad you invited me here tonight it was nothing no really thank you i needed this more than i knew foreign [Music] eat it did you come for the wedding i couldn't miss it my cousin is the bride and of course i should thank you clearly you were able to help my people otherwise we wouldn't be here celebrating i can't take all the credit i had some help [Music] true falca put you on this path after all was she right by the way did you part ways with that girl randy as she foresaw no randy was never on the isle of skye ah well even barca makes mistakes still it's good you didn't need to say goodbye to a friend foreign [Music] what an unforgettable night ugh [Music] you
