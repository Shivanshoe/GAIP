[Music] [Music] let's see if the junky kid sent us a letter [Music] you have a letter it would see a personal request he's done a lot for us we should see what he wants off to the junky thing hey there your weapon is ready to go great thanks [Music] you know with a weapon like that you were going to say i need to ask you for a favor oh yeah i want you to avenge my brother that is a rather ponderous favor it's my mission it's the whole reason i've been creating these weapons for the past four years i don't care about money i only care about making a weapon strong enough to kill those bastards witch bastards the ones in the mountain that little shade in his robot a shade has joined forces with a robot there's a shade in there yes and what have we decided um we're gonna kill it [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] i detect not a wish of intelligence from within that clump of iron who cares if it's smart when it can smash you into a pancake no mere machine can hope to prevail against our intelligence and skill wow thanks book i feel so much better [Music] already [Music] okay [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] i've never heard of a shane living with a machine what's that about don't know don't care all that matters is that we kill them [Music] both [Music] it seems we have found the entrance to our robot friends hideout right let's head down are you mad we've no idea what lies below beats going the long way around come on [Music] hello [Music] so intruder detected scanning scanning exterminating [Music] looks [Music] look at the shade that thing is commanding the robot somehow aim for the legs knock it down take out the shade exterminating must defend my vision [Music] oh damn it that's a shade it's a shade [Music] mmm so [Music] exterminating [Music] this thing can transform watch for falling debris look out escape escape escape escape go see the world early must protect must fight where do you think you're going so [Music] error [Music] [Music] [Music] oh must defend my mission you [Music] you stupid machine you killed my family you took everything from me [Music] hey come on that's enough i did it now that this goddamn thing is dead i can forage wherever i want just wait you goddamn freak now i can make all kinds of powerful weapons just leave it to me leave it all to me [Music] [Laughter] look we get it okay really hatred and madness will never heal a wounded heart maybe it's just all he's capable of right now revenge is a fool's errand yeah i know [Music] [Music] maybe propolis found some information about the shadow lord let's drop by the village very well [Music] hey poplar ah you're back have you learned anything more about the shadowlord's key i'm sorry but it's going to take me some time yet i see well can i take something off your plate in the meantime hmm oh how about this you know the ferryman with the red bag right well he's been skipping out on work lately can i ask you to go to seafront and check on him sure thing [Music] this feels alarmingly familiar i'm sure that couple is merely having another one of their inane spats let us do our utmost not to get dragged into it this time [Music] the forest totally cursed him that's why he's sick everyone told him not to play in there but he did anyway it appears something happened to the child when he entered the northern woods i believe that area is more commonly known as the forest of myth you think there's actually a forest curse i will withhold judgment on such things for now we should visit the place and see for ourselves all right to the forest of mythic [Music] oh it's you eh hey you don't happen to know where my boyfriend is do you sorry lady no idea right of course you don't i'm so silly sometimes see my boyfriend just up and vanished five years ago i keep waiting for him but i have no idea where he went or if he's even hey wait you're that kid who does whatever people ask him to do right well then go find my boyfriend hey sorry right of course you just sick well people usually ask nicely and i have no idea what your boyfriend looks like much less where to find him well he always wears this flashy gold necklace so maybe you can start there and so we find ourselves off on a hunt for a man with a golden necklace not exactly the strongest of possible leads say are you available to discuss a certain sensitive matter what is it people are saying a shade has managed to enter our village i was hoping you could track it down this isn't a very big place wouldn't we have seen it by now i had my own doubts at first but there have been too many witnesses for me to ignore this matter any longer [Music] i saw a really scary monster she saw it too apparently i can't say for sure who's seen it or not i saw the monster right around here you did huh can you it was over at the river and it was huge and scary i didn't like it over by the river huh let's go take a look the foul tendrils of the shades have finally extended into this village fine then we find him and kill him will it be that easy i wonder what do you mean would you be able to simply slaughter the people you lived amongst for so many years would you truly murder friends if you suspected them of being shades i wouldn't have a choice jonas not coming back to a village full of those things when the time comes i pray you can follow through [Music] oh sure the guy with the necklace i don't know where he is now but i've heard some pretty sordid tales about him [Music] [Music] impossible who knew the shades had grown so large come this close to a human settlement no less you probably ran out of stuff to eat up on the mountain [Music] keep your guard up i want to make sushi out of this bag such frightening enthusiasm dammit your heart is too strong they seem to have developed some manner of bodily protection it seems these creatures too follow the prescripts of evolution and i'll just have to overpower them [Music] yes we've avenged the postman let's go report back [Music] so [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] oh god it's over my life is over what's wrong hey i remember you back when seeing as we've come all this way i suppose we had best ask what is the matter i had a fight with my husband and he ran away from home mm-hmm yes yes you may call me utterly flabbergasted but it's all that idiot's fault i was saving up a bunch of apples and he went any ten of them that's actually sort of impressive sure i may have lost my temper a little but i can't believe he just up and left he's been gone for a week now and it's all right all right we'll help you find him really oh thank you so much and here we go again don't we begin by asking around at the tavern like before hey there i'm looking for the guy with the red back you seen him around lately really is that couple fighting again yeah the guy took off and hasn't been seen since i take it this isn't a surprise hardly their arguments are legendary we're actually considering selling tickets as a tourist attraction anyway i think he's from that village with the library maybe he went back home i think his brother is a guard there or something thanks for the tip i'll see what i can figure out say you're pretty handsome care to buy a lonely woman a drink yeah i'm good [Music] to think that couples petty squabbles have become something of an attraction for the locals doesn't surprise me in the least seeing people like that puts a little spring in your step you know you humans truly are a maddening bunch such buffoonery does little more than wear this old tome out [Music] he searched the southern plains back when the wife ran off too right i believe we did yes lot's changed since then so it's kind of nice when we find something that hasn't the fact that couple is still arguing almost fills me with i don't know hope i guess if you asked me that particular couple could benefit from a little change [Music] [Music] what's up you're related to the ferryman who carries a red bag around right yeah he's my little brother haven't seen him in a while though a shame have you any idea where he may have absconded to not a clue like i said i haven't seen him oh that's unfortunate oh but the last time i did see him he said something about using his ferry to deliver letters maybe you should try talking to someone at the post office i guess we could ask the postman over in seafront just once i would enjoy receiving a quest that can be sold in the general vicinity of the [Music] asker [Music] i cannot believe how many trips we have made simply to track down a single man it's all right to do this kind of thing every now and then i only pray this is not the calm before some manner of storm you say there lad have you ever penned a missive you mean a letter no i'm not big on writing it always takes me forever to figure out what i want to say what's to figure out one simply takes quill in hand and unleashes their soul upon the canvas of the page whatever you said [Music] hmm hey post oh sorry you're not him i'm sure as hell not i just swung by to pick up a letter and wound up running the damn place anyway you here for a package or something no there's this couple who's always fighting and the husband took off so i'm trying to track him down ring any bells sorry pal you're asking the wrong guy still that's pretty weird my buddy's daughter took off too maybe running away is the cool thing to do now i find it exceedingly unlikely this pair of runaways is mere coincidence any idea where she might have went that is the question isn't it actually you know what i bet she went to check out the huge shipwreck that drifted into the inlet the other day not often something like that comes around it's all the kids have been talking about a shipwreck is it i suppose we might as well investigate seeing as how we lack any other tenable leads right let's head for the inlet emile what's going on i haven't seen you two coming to seafront and well ever i guess sorry for the surprise kaine said she sent something strange in the area strange how like a shade maybe not sure there's some kind of sound or something coming from up ahead what an incredibly specific piece of information the hussy has graced us with what is it kenny nothing let's get moving [Music] we're gonna need to figure out some way to get inside that thing this ship is in a state of want and decay surely we can find a hole or some such if we put our minds to it hey this is one of the pieces of cargo that washed ashore [Music] sorry lady but i need to know what i'm trying are you sure this is really something whatever it is it's been this is some rather dangerous cargo we've been asked to find drugs and explosives again just what is all this for a supply this size could provide for the military of a small country it seems you humans are incapable of learning from the mistakes of the past [Music] these planks seem to be covering a rather large hole you can probably get in if we move them out of the way i'm worried about whatever it is sensing we should make sure we're really prepared before going inside this ship is in poor condition indeed do try not to thrash about and bring its timbers down around us hussy whatever you sure you're all right connie you really shouldn't push yourself hey i've got an idea how about you and me search outside and get some nice fresh air in the process sure let's do that sounds good take care of kanye for us emil emil is on the case come on kaine let's get the lead out [Music] this place is pretty gloomy i'm having a hard time imagining any townsfolk hanging around here well as we've no other leads let the search begin look there on the floor i believe we've found ourselves a lantern and there's still some oil in it nice [Music] we require a key in order to proceed let us fumble about and see if we cannot find one wait did you see that girl just now i did indeed how on earth did she manage to get behind us perhaps she is the runaway we heard tell over the post office best track her down and take her back to town with us [Music] there's no one here weird it's like we just saw a ghost oh what foolishness i am certain this room merely contains a secret passageway or the like [Music] what is with this ship anyway there may be clues some other tell of how it ran around [Music] it looks really dark up ahead then perhaps we ought to make use of that lantern we just found [Music] what's this an apple it's a bit bruised but it's not super old or anything i waiter it was dropped by that fruit-loving ferryman with a red bag perhaps he absconded to this ship to wait out the storm after yet another spirited debate with his wife oh goodness what a troublesome couple let's keep moving what was that sounds just now sounds like it came from the floor above us this barrel's been knocked over and there's flour everywhere surely it was toppled by the girl we saw at the entrance wait cast your eyes to the floor lad the missing child left white tracks in her passing should we follow them i expect we will find our way to her man this book's wonder what it's for it would seem to be this ship's log book let us avail ourselves of a gander hmm records of the roots it traveled the weather it encountered and the places it made port all in a painstaking level of detail i would expect no less for a vessel of this size until the day the records suddenly cease what the hell happened on this ship we've no time to stand about deciphering [Music] the white handprints on the wall lead in the direction of this door that's weird how is it locked if the girl just used it unless she's actually i demand you cease your interminable chatter about ghosts at once the simplest explanation is that she locked the door from the other side i didn't even say anything yet in any case we want to use the door we'll have to find a key [Music] did you see that light on the other side of the shelves a shame we cannot investigate further with these blasted things in our way i would like a word with the interior designer who thought to put them here hang on i think i can move these hey there's a notebook on this desk oh wow this thing is crammed full of information a record of the cargo they carried no doubt by my pages this ship was used by slavers how simply atrocious wait you're telling me they sold people and made out quite handsomely from the transactions it would seem how could they do something like that i do not know nor do i care to ponder it let it suffice to say there are monsters who trade coin for misery in all corners of this accursed world [Music] there's a breeze coming through these shelves that white vase is rather conspicuous try giving it a nudge [Music] a hidden room are delightful [Music] these chests are pretty huge and what do they contain treasure perhaps i wish looks like a bunch of iron tools those are no mere tools lad they are instruments of torture i shudder to think what evil transpired in this room don't seem to be any shades around at least fortunate for us now let no more time be wasted in our search for the townsfolk [Music] the white tracks end here wait i hear something [Music] whatever that sound was it stopped i swear it sounded like a girl this is a voice pipe a contraption by which one's voice can travel to a far away location which means the girl is in whatever room this pipe connects to hold a moment i spy a chart of the ship's layout on the wall yes this pipe connects to a cabin in the ship's stern onward and uh inward i guess this little lantern has brought us quite far hasn't it yeah and the light it gives off makes me feel i don't know safe somehow well aren't we the romantic it's [Music] the kitchen is it heavens look at the size of this saucepan this must have been where they prepared meals for the crew there's a note stuck to the counter extra rice hold the peppers looks like the crew had some say over how they ate to be picky about one's food while at sea is a luxury indeed thinking back on it the cuisine we were served during our visit to the bickering couple's home was quite particular in its choice of ingredients was it not tell me about it i feel like i've sampled every single recipe in the apple fanatics cookbook once we track down the ferrymen we should invite them to a meal at our place a fine idea lad [Music] oh damn the hell is this smell perhaps it is wafting from further inside [Music] another apple just how many apples does that quibbling husband keep on his person while he's out and about let's keep searching [Music] uh vice i think the floor is speak to me lad are you hurt i've been better but i'll live i can't see a thing down here and what is that terrible stench i suspect we may have fallen into the ship's hold the lantern got away from me during the fall we'd better look for it is that have you still not found the land nice that's it we found the lantern about time might i suggest you cease the celebratory fanfare and light the blasted thing already oh dear look at the bodies they are all people from town and i fear we're missing ferryman oh no this can't be real why why did he why did everyone have to god damn it pull yourself together lad remember the presence kane sensed the culprit who murdered these poor folk likely awaits us further within i won't let them get away with this that's enough lad avert your eyes hey there you two hey i didn't know you guys came back inside did we ever found a nice hole in the wall to slide through but then we heard a bunch of noise coming from that super dark floor downstairs you sure had us worried yeah sorry about that you feeling better kane a little yeah sorry for the trouble good that's that's good jeez you seem really down in the dumps did something happen tell me kaine that presence you sensed it's on the floor above us i feared as much it seems we've little choice but to press onward there's a bunch of crumpled up paper here letters maybe they all seem to have the same words written upon them but the penmanship is so poor i cannot make heads not tales of it [Music] be the final room yes the culprit who murdered the townspeople may be behind this very door let us proceed with utmost caution [Music] it's that girl we saw when we first entered the ship old lad this is a lone child sitting inside a hulking ship littered with corpses something is clearly amiss there could this girl be the presence you sensed kane oh hey it's you been a while wait you're the postman what are you doing here oh i've been coming here a lot lately i think this girl was on the ship when it drifted in i've been keeping an eye on her until she's well enough to leave hey so this is kind of awkward but the girl is you know bleeding i brought a bunch of bandages with me but uh well how exactly does one deal with a woman's time of the month sorry sorry clearly crossed a line there forget i said anything stay the hell away from her she isn't [Music] camille we'll figure something out you just find a way to get the hell out of here the two of them will be fine but you and i must withdraw the ship is collapsing we must leave at once very much aware of that thanks let's go shake it they're in the way [Music] looks like we can get out through that hole up there [Music] [Music] glad you two made it out in one piece yeah we're good but that poor postman is still trapped inside we'd better go help him out no shade would dare pursue us into sunlight such as this we should use the opportunity to ready ourselves what on earth [Music] why isn't this shade being hurt by the sun that is not precisely the case it most certainly is being burned by the sunlight however its regenerative abilities far outpace whatever damage the light is able to [Music] that's inflict something is coming get out of the way at once [Music] i can't believe that little girl was actually this thing this monstrosity is unlike anything we've faced before remain vigilant aim for the tentacles with faces on them don't stop now focus on the next one the town will be in grave danger should we leave this creature be we must end it here and now let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now is our chat attack with all that you [Music] have [Music] huh do we get it [Music] oh hell that thing's huge [Music] foreign [Music] the think it could recover from such a grievous wound ordinary attacks aren't gonna do against this thing here it comes dodge is this thing turning its body into spheres and shooting them at us i can't believe such a huge shade even exists [Music] [Music] that thing ain't normal so stay smart unless you want to get dead this thing will destroy the town if we don't stop it the number the spears flying our way is increasing yeah you can see them do it [Music] my word if this continues [Music] hey over here [Music] this guy's important to you isn't he oh [Music] here [Music] [Applause] [Music] is this thing immortal how can it withstand such an onslaught i i'm really scared guys we will be in grave danger if it unleashes that attack we must stop it [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i think we're in trouble my body won't damn it stop no [Music] what are you doing you're gonna get yourself killed [Music] oh it stopped focus on the source of its magic aim for the head [Music] we can never be together you disgust me [Music] smooth [Music] [Music] is [Music] thanks you really saved our bacon you've all done so much for me offering i don't have the words to express how sorry i am we all knew townspeople were out there being eaten by a shade but i never imagined i was taking care of it this entire time the fault lies with that foul creature alone postman not yourself i i hope i can believe that someday all right well we'd better get going there's someone else we need to break this news to fair enough i hope to see you out there on the old letter trail again soon [Music] hey did you find my husband uh yeah the thing is wait why are you hesitating is he all right please tell me he's all right come on say something already [Music] your husband was killed by a shade i'm sorry we tracked him down but it was already too late no it can't be true that big idiot always carrying his bag around thinking about me all the time oh god this can't be happening [Music] [Music] it saddens this old tone to think we'll never hear those two at each other's throats again [Music] for me i gotten to him sooner damn it do not let it burden you so lad you did the best you were able [Music] uh [Music] hey connie yeah when you were threatening that shade on the beach the other day how did you know it was trying to protect the postman just a feeling i guess all right [Music] is [Music] positions shades on the coast the ferryman dead you've had quite the rough trip that poor ferryman used to tell me stories of the epic quarrels he had with his wife he found the whole thing quite amusing he loved her though he loved her with all that he was i'm very sad to hear that he's gone still you made it back safe and i'm glad for that have you any new information about the key to the shadow lord's castle i'm still working on the decryption but i'm afraid progress has stalled loyal cerberus might refer to a dog but i've never seen anything that would fit the bill it must be pretty complicated if even you can't decode it well you're our last hope so please keep trying okay i will by the way i was walking by your house earlier and i noticed you had some mail you might want to check it out thanks i'll do that [Music] oh one last thing since the ferryman was missing work i arranged for someone else to handle the job i'll make sure they know to let you use the boat as before gotcha [Music] even without those we have lost the world relentlessly continues to turn [Music] ugh the king is getting married why does this old book good to see a boy become a man probably not a good idea to turn down a wedding invitation from a king let's go to facade [Music] does it not strike you as curious to find walls in the desert should it they normally live in forests yes deserts would seem to hold little sustenance for them well we can certainly guess what they've been eating [Music] [Music] six [Music] good i didn't save him so much as just find [Music] him [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] we hear your days of bachelorhood are coming to a close king congrats forgive my prime but we are all eager to know the identity of your lucky bride [Music] hold on fira you have grown into a fine example of womanhood i'm sure you will make a splendid queen kina's gonna want to see this to make your acquaintance your royalness congratulations on your wedding hack um i'm sorry kaine's not here [Music] of course how could we refuse [Music] to think they even have rules governing the timing and water temperature of a bath what's it to you you don't even take baths honey what is the matter i don't like this weddings are festive occasions you know should i even be here we were invited here by the king remember sure but what about everybody else this city isn't like our villages it's all about the rules here and since there isn't a specific rule about you i honestly think they won't give a crap yeah maybe will you at least procure a new set of lingerie for the festivities some spring colors perhaps keep talking [Music] book oh what's up just having trouble getting to sleep something bothering you no the opposite in fact i'm just so excited about the wedding that i can't settle down i bet it's gonna have streamers and dancing and bears on unicycles and everything i'm sort of jealous i wish i was fiera you'll find a nice bride someday emil huh oh right uh bride you must be tired indeed if you misunderstood that simple social nicety [Music] yeah that's not exactly item everyone needs to blow off steam and celebrate once in a while indeed your people have earned a moment of rest and respite you want to make fira happy right anyway life is better when you have someone to fight for [Music] thai [Music] uh-huh weddings are the best there's flowers everywhere everyone's happy it's just great i'm kind of jealous aren't you jealous kaine oh come on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] did [Applause] sarah that wolf is a shade the leader seems to have the power to reflect magic [Music] the wolves appear to be targeting you [Music] [Music] [Music] kiss [Music] m [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] poison [Music] i would rethink this course of action king a headlines a battle you cannot win [Music] foreign [Music] foreign the king's grief is strong i doubt he will stand down at this point yeah i'm guessing he'll run off to take on the wolves anytime now will we let him go by himself of course not now i eat the wolves too then we must prepare for the fight it will not be an easy one i know [Music] see are you ready for battle yeah time to avenge fira [Music] is [Music] i'm not doing it for you dumbass it's for fira kaine you can't speak to a king like that if this is indeed the plan then let us make haste we can ill afford another tragedy [Music] um uh here foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] let's move foreign the wolves appear to be targeting the king sit in the crazy he seeks the king of facades [Music] these beasts hold so much rage the smaller wolves are not infected with shames as for the leader if even one is here then i have to kill all of them above you stay on your guard [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh huh [Music] a [Music] yes [Music] [Music] i believe that young fiera was perfectly content with the life she had of course does this not sound like what she would say to you she was terribly proud of her king and now you must do all you can to honor [Music] is [Music] this is the last of them now we can find the shadow lord and yonah we certainly can hold on yonah i'm almost there [Music] [Music] [Music] oh there hopefully told me about you just tell me where you're going [Music] i marvel at how relatively simple a task this retrieval process proved to be it is almost as if someone deliberately set us on this path you're overthinking again vice but i don't care if it's a trap iona's waiting for me and i'm going i see you're really gonna do it the whole village is buzzing you know they say you're gonna go rescue yonah i guess it's really happening huh i'll bring her back i promise um about that yeah nothing never mind hopeola just loves to worry anyway you be careful yes do be careful thanks [Music] oh there [Music] are we ready let's all make it back alive okay it's a plan [Music] so uh [Music] [Music] [Music] dude [Music] [Music] [Music] so huh [Music] so so [Music] hey there's shades here uh [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so good [Music] that's the last of them now let's get a piece of that tree root [Music] this should be enough root let's get it back to that guy [Music] [Music] so [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] i wonder why the shades are getting so strong they were never this powerful before it seems the shades are continually expanding our forces looks like they'll just keep pushing us humans back huh no i'll find a way to stop it [Music] [Music] so such an ominous sight and yet i find it strangely nostalgic yeah this is where vice and i first met and first fought together wow this is where you used to live vice well yes i suppose in a technical sense pretty nice digs for a floating magazine at least it was free from annoying hussies like yourself and now the path is open [Music] [Music] to whom does the true voice speak to whom does the true form show itself you must answer it can talk i ask why did humans disappear from the world the hell is this i believe this is some manner of password password yes the correct answer should grant us access to the castle i feel confident i have heard this somewhere before to whom does the true form show itself i ask why did humans disappear from the world [Music] you must answer [Music] i answer because of a black disease i ask how can humans extend their lives [Music] i answer by separating body from soul i ask what is the destination of souls [Music] i answer they are placed in their corresponding shells very well you are acknowledged as master you may enter well there deems the way it's open [Music] so [Music] it's the twins from your village poplar devil what are you doing here hey any chance you'll just go back to the village this is a very dangerous place even if you can find jonah here you probably can't get her out how did you get here we're asking the questions right now what are you two doing here i'm not going to answer that you can figure it out yourself [Music] we're here to rescue yonah no dice huh well i guess we don't have a choice then no i suppose not how sad we didn't want to fight you we really really didn't want to [Music] devil what's happening sorry but this fate was predetermined still we spoke to truth we really wanted to avoid this impossible we were hoping to put it off for a hundred years or so until the next generation came along what are you talking about are they shaped i don't think so it's a lie i don't believe it [Music] we never thought you'd grow to be this powerful this is madness why do you block our plan you have no cause to speak so with us for more advice you are a traitor [Music] of course we can the power came from us in the first place you were simply loaned a small portion of it are you all right why are you guys doing this why are you siding with the shades [Music] [Music] [Music] the answer to every riddle lies within the heart of the shadow lord shadow lord so you've been on his side this whole time you must search for that answer yourself you've got to face your own truth now please enter the shadow lord's castle yes they do seem to be putting us through a great deal you okay voice how odd for long years my mind and tongue have been my greatest assets but now the latter seems to be do not look at me like that i am grimoire vice i am [Music] i think i hear a waltz [Music] it certainly is a grand affair bunch of dancing bastards they're all shades i think we're locked in it's not like i was planning to leave yeah it's a bit late for that [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] damn it it
