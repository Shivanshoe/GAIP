[Music] nazi germany the final push into the heart of darkness the soe had recruited the six of us under my command for one reason to retrieve files on the top secret project phoenix the last gasp of the third rank a coalition of allied commandos thrown together and aimed at where our enemy was most vulnerable this was meant to be our first and only mission would you look at that hello let's go shoot we have a chance stay close remember i don't want them to see us uh foreign she's predictable door's locked look for another way [Music] those crowds [Music] get together is bear out the other train [Music] [Music] [Music] of course [Music] oh that was so cute [Music] the tracks are splitting jump what's your uncle [ __ ] me dead now that will be properly shot at might the officer in charge tell us what the hell we're doing here that submarine base is our final stop once we're in we move to secure the objective he wants us to secure it but you won't tell us what it is kingsley can dance around there since the get-go this ain't just another easter egg hunt is it here mate what's a bloody story you don't quite know you mean the eso [ __ ] he doesn't quite know you know what i'm gonna go pull the prince all we have is a name phoenix oh so we got no idea what we're up against that's the mission to find out soe says the krauts are moving something big out of germany it could be a document stash the holiest is the police we are here to pinch it if this is so important why did they not send an army they did there's six of us mate we're not from the same army hell we're not even from the same continent quiet get back why would we chose this [ __ ] suicide mission brass handpicked six specialists hit the crowds fast and get away clean mommy can't do that too loud too slow which is right they won't see us coming in and out with those papers before they know it do we understand the plan i shoot nazis they die that's my plan [Music] let's get those papers before jerry's

lugging that chest i bet you london to a brick that is what we're after so what are we waiting for time to bring the heavy start now we're talking wait we can't go in loud arthur whatever's in those papers is the best kept secret in the third reich and the crowds kept them here in the ass end of nowhere so why it makes no sense it's like leaving the crown jewels on the front porch with hardly anyone watching them the entire german army should be guarding this place we're not the only ones who don't know what phoenix is you're saying nazis are keeping secrets from nuts i'm saying the ones in charge of the secrets are the most dangerous yeah that's why we brought the guns to shoot them are we done here those papers are about to piss off out of germany you three take the catwalk and make your bloody noise buy us time web know that you're with me we'll take the boat [Music] don't shoot us or we'll leave without you [Music] [Music] there's the hatch this is it lads let's find that crate

proceed your rhineland accent you must be from oyster during the occupation you saw french soldiers who look like me carry guns in your streets marry your women that's what i hear when you speak german show me we thrashed you once hear those bombs that's us thrashing you again threshing thresh with an interesting choice it worked i told you already get on with it yeah that's what you were to sacrifice yourself to be a leader i am not here to give you what you want quite a concert [Music] dispose of the rest in the track [ __ ] novak jesus christ people die people die when command [ __ ] up how exactly is this arthur's fault this is on him and on wade and bastard abandoning his team well you're right about wait if he shows his face again i'm bloody killing myself oh yes let's keep blaming each other instead of the germans is that supposed to impress me relax it does not matter verizinger is going to kill us all surprisingly the nazi the one who kills novak old friend of yours is he we have history oh yeah what kind of against fryzinger arthur will get us out of this what because he's your mate he wasn't always but i've seen him in action you lose men that's war sometimes the only way to honor a fallen soldier is to finish the mission but try remembering that while their blood stains your boots if you're meant to lead you have to learn what it's like to lose men to have them die trusting you there's only one way to learn that lesson first time i did was on d-day objectives and it seems like the crowds already know where to come now we've got one chance to demolish the coastal artillery but if we don't the invasion tomorrow will fail now i trade you all for this let's not let the navy show us up so take the case mates blast the artillery and fire your flesh and let them make you know the jobs done all right this is it you know the drill stand up okay stand by [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] what [ __ ] [Music] thunder thunder don't shoot damn you kingsley we picked you as a crowd lucky we didn't fill you full of lead nice to see you gents where do we stand captain didn't make it so we're on our own now i say we dig in and wait for the rest of the sick airborne to assemble henry said we have till dawn to destroy the artillery if we don't the invasion fails so you fancy yourself the captain now sun-up's an hour away at best there's no time for a sit down yeah there's also no muscle and no cavalry coming to save the bloody day the only thing we could do here is to die or try not to you two scrapping over who's got the bigger bollocks ain't gonna solve nothing those german casemates aren't that far away i think we can get to them in time so why say they take them out the companies scattered were pissing in the wind at this point i know what a stake you all do this is madness hey we're beyond madness look i'm with arthur we finished the mission all right kingsley looks like you're in charge now casemates and valhalla are that way we should get moving what's the plan kingsley let's get a park cleared you heard the sarge clear that debris those lights on the cliff that's the coastal defense battery the bridge is well guarded and the bank's too steep we secure the bridge then it's our only move you're the boss keep low watch that truck we have an opportunity here stay quiet multiple targets we got options sergeant at the fence [Music] they're falling back we need a grenade on the mg yes [Music] [Music] well that was a [ __ ] kerfuffle hey sarge got it done [Music] still here aren't we i suppose eight men standing against the nazi gunfort richard said i got mad sometimes a little madness is called for i think deep down he understood that and realized we were cut from the same cloth i think they're waiting on you sarge they're waiting at the table up here how's it looking sergeant let's see for yourself let's get you the lay of the land our targets are the guns housed in those casemates and we can only get there through a horde of germans armed to the teeth i think you can handle taking out the lower gun i fancy my chances that bunker's our way in but it's packed with mgs it'll be a hard push first job's getting across that minefield but that anti-tank dish could be useful i've got an idea i'm all ears we can punch a hole through the mines with those blitzes there and the bunker will make minced meat out to us as soon as they hear the engines coming we're going quiet then no engines better the last second let gravity do the work that should get us to the ditch at least well i love it i think you should go first all right then as soon as you hit the ditch get the men ready tommy you with me oh yeah drive through the minefield take the bunker strap some thermite to some highly explosive weapons piece of pissage you get a second sun burning in the sky if our ships don't see that flare if they don't know we've won they'll fire on the guns and risk taking us with them i don't know about you but i think i'll take very little consolation in knowing that the fire that killed me was friendly don't worry gov i won't forget to warm up the truck's ready we'll be right behind you godspeed uh [Music] time to move go go chicken running on the door just waiting on you boss you take the lower case mates i'll take the upper ones don't forget the flare let's move up research all the way boys this is it you're on me drag it back we need to clean the door alright now bloody hell it stinks in here science torch over here look at that [ __ ] monster never seen a 125 up close before let's blast the pasta sergey [Music] one down one to go that's the last of the thermite zones i barely see a thing in here take it slow oh god that was sounds like um i'll feed it at bangalore let's get up top before this thing explodes you have the flare target bombardment's close go sergeant the flare bombardment's any minute damn players ruptured god [ __ ] joke where's we need to run for it what what where the hell have you been funny time to take a camp i was just waiting for some outcaster to come and save the day well unless you and i signal our boy shall we [Music] we lost our captain but we'd won the day and we'd honored the memory of all those we lost the only way we could by completing the mission you look at the soldiers under your command and hope that they can do the difficult thing the impossible thing that flare told me i'd been right this is what it means to be a leader [Music] from all the flags waving on the streets we'd never have known the nazis were about to lose the war but bullies are always loudest when they're scared and when they're desperate they get stupid commander herman freisinger had killed novak they'd given us a free ride right into the lion's den the shores of europe the fewer arts concerning people read the field report twice this ally team is fascinating they have been captured but it was too close i want you to find out everything you can about this unit it will be my pleasure sir you will speak of this to no one else and report directly to me hallelujah this prison is our battlefield christ what is that smell chlorine dioxide they think it hides the smell of death so iron well this is the nicest [ __ ] hole i've ever been in is anyone else hungry unless you got room service for us and i have questions for you yeah we can always bloody questions i'm the commanding officer you'll speak with me even then richter was easy to read uniforms at high rank no compact medals office rat the perfect mark surrounded by three guards all armed and all rikers in all my years studying allies i have never come across such an unusual unit kingsley arthur lieutenant service number 25232642 tell you a story i have spoken with zafura on exactly one occasion he recommended a book to me the passing of the great race by an american a man named madison grant zeefura had nothing but praise for him [ __ ] madison grant and everyone like him the book reveals under extreme duress or unfavorable conditions your people do not deteriorate so easily in that moment i knew what i had to do right to the suprasternal notch below the clavicle once we had what we needed from this racist bastard that's where i would put my knife my plan began to take shape we were being held in the basement of gestapo headquarters around and above us was a treasure trove of classified nazi intelligence project phoenix had to be there somewhere and richter was our ticket he thought he was the interrogator if he was to be of any use to us he'd have to keep thinking that that arrogant nazi in his clean pressed uniform loved the sound of his own voice the hard part wouldn't be fooling richter into spilling what he knew of project phoenix the hard part would be convincing the others not to kill him first the allies somehow knew about project phoenix we must have a traitor amongst the officers i put their files take care of them with the other non-essentials mm-hmm lieutenant kings they mentioned a project phoenix likely allied propaganda the negro thought he was protecting his team no doubt to prove himself to make him their leader the allies must have been desperate he said it was their first mission that his sixth man is dead he's probably lying i will uncover the truth but the other teams like this one how did they learn of hamburg his temple half at risk of being compromised these are the things i need to know there's more stake here than i'm at liberty to discuss just know that i'm counting on you here i understand thank you well i see 10 fingers that's a good sign at least don't make a bus i'm fine listen they know about wade but they haven't caught him yet i told him he was killed didn't you on the train to hamburg i don't think they'll fall for it but the hope is it'll buy him some time to get us out he isn't coming back for us she's right kingsley we can't count on that [ __ ] drongo bring out the girl [Music] jenna y'all know him right i'll just get out of my way is [Music] every person on this team was a hero in their own right long before their files ever reached my desk but to say they were strong personalities would be a vast understatement particularly when it came to petrova julia again it's bad enough i have to wear this thing at all no it's flammable last year's teaching me how to shoot wasted stuck in a med tent don't be in a rush to fight dodgy glory is worth nothing when you're dead but this fight it matters you matter you and me are all i have left [Music] hey be nice i'm always nice what you got there empty bottles i'm training fresh parties our cameras already know how to drink these will be motives is it wise to give explosives to civilians you worry too much [Music] sit oh there isn't that nice a real family breakfast bombs and bullets best way to start the day you know you're gonna get yourself killed having that old rifle in the house now who is worried too much so the germans are approaching the front line is that where you're off to no they told me that's not what i'd be the most useful i'm training recruits at the old poster it must be nice it would have been nice to have a choice in them at least you get to follow don't tell me at least you what's it you're both doing your part which reminds me if any of those who bloody get past you you know where to send them of course they will never get through never leave i need to run they're waiting for me miss i swear he would forget to keep his own head screwed on without us we really are saints honestly i'll make sure he gets this on my way to the med you help your country much more than you know and you make your old man proud [Music] [Music] we should replace your old chair never it's comfy enough for me misha and i were so little in this photo seems like just yesterday so many impressive medals papa it's your mother she always insisted we display them it's been a while since i played this you were a natural i miss hearing you play be safe out you there believe he's taking the children it would be crazy to say he has taken uh half of russia at this point this is crazy of you i'm killing you nobody is going to take russia [Music] seems like nobody really knows every day it's a new information yes yes [Music] [Music] the new partisans and training will crush them before they get close i believe good luck out there save some of our men today huh [Music] something smells good over here oh paulina i saved the loaf for your family you're welcome your father has been

anything i wouldn't do i couldn't even if i tried my anus it's too bad we can trade places that would look great at least try to make it back from your bone making one piece several pieces it's fine i'm pretty good at putting people back together yes you've made me late again i'll have to take the rooftops you're gonna get yourself killed climbing around i promise you can say i told you if it happens now go uh [Music] good morning morning paulina how is your father's leg thanks [Music] have you been hearing don't worry the red army will handle it well be careful out there [Music] ugh truck

[Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] i should have been here [Music] take care of each other laughs tell mom i'm off to save misha as usual i think they're dead can you cut us free now it was incredible we're going now i i was so scared that you and me you're the one tied up take care of the others we don't have time for this we have to get your recruits out of here if we stay here much longer we're trapped you're right you're right okay let's go misha we need to get to the volca how do we get out of this building nisha focus how can we escape to the river there's an exit here we could make a run for the sewers but the germans are blocking the courthouse it'll be tough do you have any extra supplies weapons anything i can use i know there were soldiers defending on the roof they had the radio there might be supplies too all right i'll lay down cover fire from there while you get our people to the sewers if you're sure sister maybe you can reach the roof climbing up there i should get you to the roof i'll give you a boost i'll find a good place to cover you i know you've always been a better shot than me the posture is with me now and i know he wouldn't want us to die in this post office to a bunch of obliterate he would be proud of you he would be proud of us get our people to this door i'll lay them fire from the roof don't miss okay i never do okay once we're out on the side stay here do you see the one on the roof can you hear me at him not receiving boy porsche i hope you're listening to me for once we are pinned down in the crater by the trolley none of you are leaving this prayer alive oh surviving stalingrad was no small feat escaping even greater but no one really escaped something like that the nazi war machine had touched all our lives burned away something important i think that's what made us attracted to the soe in the first place but for polina the wound was narrow deep she was destined to return the favor and that had made her the deadliest member of my team [Music] such a touching story you couldn't even save the life of your own father so tell me why isn't ivan with an old rifle part of a top-secret allied operation you do not scare me little mouse you misunderstand me for a line i do not need you to fear me i need only your screams that will convince your friends to talk why because i am a woman [Music] tell me what other missions the allies have in germany nothing what it's argument so what is worth talking about foreign go fetch him i'll confirm my story together take her back send me all the records on a commander steiner and any photographs of the russian sniper lady nightingale yes that one and wait yeah freshener i was just coming to see you we have confirmation from the woman the sixth ally is dead is that soul an american arrested a temple half trying to steal a plane this makes no sense the prisoners made a fool of you richter and now you have made a fool of me the american is being brought here now if i must interrogate him myself then i have no use for you you hurt are you blind just trying to be nice what did you tell them we try to torture tips relax i told the same lies as you did he believe you i stopped asking when i brought up frisinger when we get out of here the first thing i'm going to do is head to the pictures [Music] break my heart all over again then you lucas what's the first thing you'll do when we're out of here me when i get home i'm eating lamingtons for a week all cakes all the time i know what you miss yeah i'd like to have that sweet bird barbara pull me pints of my local until i forget this infernal war ever happened i don't even know if she's still alive everyone i love is dead and the only time i feel anything is when i watch a german beg for his life so i am exactly where i need to be wade showed up just as i'd hoped he played his part well without even knowing my plan that team had written him off but i was counting on him being his usual charming self try that again crowd and we're gonna have a real [ __ ] problem your team lied about you lieutenant now is that so hard finally some respect i know you're a sixth man what did you want with that plane you nazis you make me miss fighting in the stinking pacific i want to know what else they've lied about wade had talked himself out of worse situations if you heard him talk about midway you could tell he was no stranger to hyperbole every time wade told the story it was a little different he added a wing of zeros or another aircraft carrier to his tally but i read the reports about what happened that day if wade was exaggerating it was only by a little remember our primary objective is destroying the two japanese carriers vs and vb squadrons will each take one fighting squadron six will provide cover if the weather holds we'll be in and out before they know what hit them this win will give us the pacific now go out there and get the carriage as if this operation wasn't hard now enough entire war's on the line relax hernandez i was born for this i'm too sure i was promised they finished repairs on the plane this morning she's waiting for us on the flight deck she has a name you name the plane our plane and you didn't say anything you never asked you think the intel boys got the fleet position right you better if we pull this off they'll be writing about us in history books yeah well i'd rather not be history today so do us both a favor and keep the crazy stunts to a minimum stunts ouch money in there you ever wonder why you haven't been promoted yet why is that smart ass because this isn't the way jackson show amigo this is war all of us just want to win and go home you worry about keeping the zeros off my tail and i'll get us home hey hold the elevator i got you jackson take us up how many medals you think will win if we pull this off jackson after today they're gonna have to name one after me miller just remember we're a team up there and stay in formation this time of the sack will have both your stripes that formations just slow me down you see what i have to deal with look at that let's up the stage that way it's time i'll let you awaken come on man don't encourage them radio check for hear sugar loud and clear intercom's working fine hey they're signaling for pre-flight checks check the elevator to the back all right elevators are good okay jackson let's check the ailerons right wing's good great now the left aileron left wing's good all right do an engine run up make sure she doesn't blow out okay let's get her in the air ready hernandez as ready as i'll ever be strapped to you all right here we go full so power felt great no fancy tricks you're no fun this isn't supposed to be fun dale [Music] so you're gonna tell me her name or what which one the plane this plane still hung up on that well what do you want to talk about fine keep your secrets [Music] victor aircraft who's out of formation [Music] [Music] get on those [Music] [Music] i need some help [Music] three i'm almost there the second time climb and get to the clouds [Music] [Music] get as high as we can do the second dive they're right on our tail oh [ __ ] like it feels killing it all ass almost out of range can we lose him i don't see him take him out [Music] you gotta push [Music] zero coming right in [Music] down see any more of them we need to get that second carrier who has bombs s 18 does bob s3 has one that's 17 has one anyone else okay that's 17 and s18 is all on you come up behind us and take the shot that'll be by the skin of our teeth isn't it it'll be close enough all aircraft draw a fire from s-17 feeling steady [Music] wade would rather have been called a hot shot than a hero that was his contradiction he is one of the war's greatest pilots but he needed a team the problem was getting him to admit it hey guys don't everybody rush over at once i'm fine isn't this a nice little reunion you lied to me for all we knew he was dead so you can [ __ ] off really do not lie to me again what is going on hitler is dead what how i know was it alex reports indicate he took his own life but without the fury we are lost hardly i trust you have new information as you suspected the american was the sixth man but i believe i have finally broken him it saddens me to see the fatherland defined i feel the irrations there's nothing left for us here if the reich is to live on i must know their safe passage to temple half i was counting on you richter but if proven non-essential no no no sir no i will get you what you require i swear your time is short i understand my fear i'm gonna kill him the rector is on to us we're out of time i uh i tried to navis a getaway plane but that didn't work and by the time i got here you guys were already locked up so i uh i borrowed a bomb from the rooskies and turned myself in we got about uh about an hour before that wall blows wide open and we waltz right out of here if we live that long i can't trust him he's just a [ __ ] pilot a [ __ ] ace pilot is what you mean i'm with the lady what the hell do you know about explosives yeah well [ __ ] you too then i'll tell you why we can trust him here we go wade's more than capable of getting us out files in hand [Music] get out of here hang on back there [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] when wade was airborne he was the most dangerous thing in the skies but if you fly too close to the sun eventually your wings will get burnt um all right okay i'll get you out of here but it's gonna hurt like hell when are you gonna get into that thick skull yours you can't just hey hey wade wait you stay with me wait come on man don't get up wake up wake up wade no today's not the day i need to find out where we are so i'm gonna have to leave here think about the yankees [Music] i need your gun i lost mine in the crash the one you caused what am i supposed to do keep yourself bandaged up i don't want you bleeding out and missing all the fun they gotta sight till i get back [Music] ugh [Music] within range of this transmission lieutenant wade jackson requesting immediate support any americans on this damn rock yep

[Applause] [Music] now okay we need to get to that tree line into the grass and stay low regroup under the trees if you make it to the other side [Applause] i might get behind one piece what the hell why the ropes these crazy [ __ ] up in trees what are we doing out here anyway rash shipped in the 93rd to help the 23rd take this rock this japanese base not far from here it's protected by a hollowed out ridge the rest of my boys are stuck behind a locked door and we're the key the hell does that mean clear out that bridge move on that base how are we going to get into that ridge knock loud hey how about we play these fools from duke ellington everybody loves the cotton club you find me a trumpet lewis and i'll take you up on that man [ __ ] this place ladies and gentlemen our obligations to our country never cease but with our lives that doesn't sound like money if someone give linda's gun to john adams nazis and japanese well hitler ain't got nothing on mama howard is that the ridge that's the one holy [ __ ] you're kidding are you insane help hernandez you're with me welcome howard you're a dragon once we clear the wire we'll build a heavy fire i need you to turn up the heat on these bastards you got it sarge jackson a word yeah you're gonna help private howard get that fire and then you're gonna keep him covered on the other side understood look in the sky i'm your man but this i'm not the die face down in the mud type then you shouldn't get yourself shot down there's a difference between suicide and sacrifice low and quiet boys howard jackson to the left jackson give me a hand john you got your hand dude quick all right jackson glass keep the distance is for the rest of my mind can they finish the job check out the hangar near the radio tower val dive boom slow down the japanese with the james [Music] [Applause] we'll push you out of the hangar take this cover us while we get you in position find this runway and we'll handle the rest those legs thank you oh anymore here we go [Music] stay behind the tank [Music] [Music] come on let's go men of the 93rd changed wade they showed the flying daredevil from the clouds what war looked like in the dirt down there he learned the only way to win was to have each other's backs if you get past this talk and you see his actions you'll know who way jackson really is i don't care what he did before wade abandoned us in hamburg i still don't trust him i get it but we're not in this [ __ ] because of him in this [ __ ] hole because some sodding krauts think they can crack the best team i've ever worked with now we need a plan to get us out of here we're surrounded by nazis even if we escape we're gonna be dead before we reach the door maybe not what an idea [Music] we were going to put on a show for richter it was a gamble but we'd come too far to give up on getting those files perlina being next gave us time to get ready we knew she'd hold her own nice to see you again fallen [Music] please please this is exactly what i imagined your weird little office would look like [Music] tell me what your team is planning lady nightingale [Music] [Music] stalingrad the city that arrested the nazis eastern expansion had the city fallen russia would have crumbled the germans underestimated russia's will to survive they underestimated the city and her defenders [Music] the people looked to polina as a symbol of hope but she didn't want to be a hero she wanted only vengeance [Music] the arrogance of the third mic was to think they could achieve with great napoleon did not yeah heard stein has been creeping around the commercial district makes sense it's never far from the slaughter let's go and wait we should see who they are speaking of their families short it's a sniper shot precise you think they might be okay there's more cover this way come on so how will you kill steiner lady nightingale i told you to stop calling me that the name gives the survivors hope paulina hope would win this war in bastards to followers of lady knight again anyone who gives asylum to this terrorist will face the most severe penalties let's go up this way do you think the sniper could be one of steiner's jager models we should be more careful do you hear that take a look he's driving towards the commercial district you may be right about those jaeger murders let's misha before we lose sight misha be careful get down what do we do try drawing fire with my knife do what just trust me ready to shoot took them out let's go well we should be safer now two jager motors you

no stranger to a prison cell that's lucas you had to credit the soe they were very good at spotting talent in the unlikeliest of places and lucas had talent he was a skilled demolitionist with an explosive temperament and a sharp tongue out there in the desert the rats of debris were like a family unfortunately they never did figure out how to get along with the brass today princess i'm savouring the moment i'm so sorry of course you are your highness hey bluey wake up you're going to want to see this one oh [ __ ] me play the damn cards all right wait him and wait oh you [ __ ]

blood follow it [ __ ] genie's idea jacobs that's served to you private the name's dez and that's lucas and neither of us give a [ __ ] about your rank we all know about you jacobs us rats pay attention more than you think quiet do you hear that who's he shouting to this way are you mad you got me and lucas here we go nobody saw that all right search the area but then we're leaving hey i found something you ready turtle of course he does it looks like one of romney's officers checked through here to visit a camp up the way i don't know what kind i don't recognize these symbols and we're gonna take a look the crowds just lit up the sky more could be coming no we return to base report to the major we can't report a thing if we don't know what it is that wouldn't be good soldiering jacobs fine we'll scope it out let's trade quietly this time lucas this road should take us directly to the camp the horizon must be the german cow i say we stay off the road and cut through the desert through here quickly this way hold up wait for them to pass whatever these germans are hiding must be pretty important we're clear let's go i'm sure you're going the right way knowing the only way you [ __ ] that's enough dez this isn't a joke i need a drink talk with your man hams he's got plenty what he's never shared a sip from his fancy flask well there should be plenty to go around he's a bloody lightweight if i ever get my hands on that wanker's flask hang on there's a light up ahead looks like we found the german camp where is everybody probably out looking for us i reckon what's all this look at this i think the chap on the left is wrong who's the fancy bugger seriously we're gathering intelligence something you obviously lack private hilarious you sought your papers you know what i see i see a ton of [ __ ] outside that goes boom and what do you suppose we should do about that well we should blow it the [ __ ] up that's what i call target rich voter on the left ammo dump just ahead gas dipper on the right just ask go go [Music] [ __ ] me that was glorious lucas wait you guys hear that hit that donkey now while he's still searching shoot that [ __ ] skywanker [ __ ] [Music] [Music] okay let's go he's circling around [Music] [Applause] on the coast of italian libya an australian private and a group of rats had given rommel a huge black eye their action should have earned them medals and maybe even a shred of respect pam's didn't see it that way their reward was some time in the brick however all richter seemed to care about was rommel and his connection to fraizinger that fool would listen to lucas as long as we needed him to [Music] what was the rest we have very little time tell me what did fry singer want with rommel i thought you wanted to know about our team answer me now or our deal is off okay okay don't get your undies in a twist lucas piled it on like a chap he didn't have to tell richter anything more than the lies that nazi already told himself that was the third reich for you their reality was delusion [Music] you'd think we'd need a miracle for lucas to pull this off the thing is he was like a magnet for that kind of luck there's that saying about lightning striking twice yet lucas had managed to find himself first and to brooke and then at el alamein the world knew of an allied victory in north africa but it wasn't because of british commanders or mighty tanks lucas had the untold story and richter was eating it up [Music] after the intel that we dropped on that plane this is the plan that he comes up with buckley's chance is going to work what's he saying jacobs well he's personally thanking you and dez for being stand up chat it's stuffed it's king and country it's always king and country bloody hell is that what i think it is where'd you swipe that from i found it lying around he catches you with that you're a dead man i'll drink to that move up protect the tanks on the front line i think german infantry are swarming our tanks well then let's mess with their infantry oh yeah we'll just waltz our way through a field of death well we're not here to [ __ ] spiders [Music] hurry keep your head down make sure to keep least good oh [Music] look at my that our air support here take this you clear this black cannon shoot this player nice and high then i know to radio up bombers good luck let's go i'll hope jake gets you want it done right right imagine the look on ham's face when we pulled this off you're joking he'll just say it was all his idea [ __ ] that was close as soon as i fire it every crowd within the k is going to be up in our friend you're going to have to hold them off until the bombers are right help me with this mg there's fire the flare [Music] i didn't expect today to end like this [ __ ] it why not let's do this okay [ __ ] how many does it matter just [ __ ] [ __ ] come on [Music] is [Music] sometimes the only way to honor a fallen soldier is to finish the mission but try remembering that while their blood stains your boots that's what i told lucas when we first met [Music] the rigid hierarchy of allied command would look at lucas and see only character flaws insubordinate childish no stranger to a prison cell he was perfect even if he does have a mean right hook [Music] lucas played his role perfectly he had rico distracted and doubting everything he thought he knew are you all right mate you you're looking a little bit pastier than usual please this was this was never about winning the war this was never about winnings at all this
