ghost calls these whites some kind of prankster spirit I'm not a fan of their sense of humor they set you up for a great punchline when their energy draining beams snag you if they want the iron suit so bad give it to him go in swinging looks like ghosts not an eventual draining beams of the undercarriage probably courtesy of Arthur Park a laser is cool her integration into the chassis is masterful quite a team I got a hand it's a ghost she spiced up my most Manila weapon she cloaked an aerial mine and gave it a freakin gravity well I'm shy and her gravity well oh hey mamas fancy seeing you here what have you got the world at my fingertips check this out any of these hotspots lead us to ghosts now I complete radio silence from her but check I put together some combat

field but he was helping himself even more as my Arsenal grew so did his ego and I had to wonder but this has been me if I had never ended up in that cave no time to waste boss see me at the globe where you can hey boss good news in coming in five four three as it turns out our friend Arthur Park is slummy you news behind a trail of photonic residue wherever he goes now it's not entirely his fault he is in fact a living laser and as such it can be difficult for him to maintain a low profile how I bear me the back of the napkin okay okay using our infrared satellites I discovered farce unique energy signature here it's a long Sun mining facility rocks you think Park is working with one of my competitors so no he's working with ghosts they're planning a heist my orbital laser wiped out half our army she'll need more drones it's a billboard Ron she needs palladium exactly and Roxxon sitting on the mother lode mmm grab a gear boss let's go crash the party all right it's gel exam hey we're not killing anything you hear me yeah you're killing my buzz listen gunsmith I need you steady and on point out their luck boss I talk a lot cuz that's how you build me but at the end of the day I got you cool [Music] systems check sand in our servos nothing I can't handle [Music] we should be coming up on the rocks on mining operation keep the collateral damage to a minimum I was

something to do stealing palladium how utterly predictable parks levitating the palladium cargo containers if he takes them up into the storm we won't be able to track it let's take him down seems like that did the trick cargos loose loss not for long warm up the magnetic gauntlets [Music] I'll take this per catch boss we can see all the carbon containers in the mines [Music] thanks the

through [Music] hakama firing blind [Music] plan to stop me you can't hurt me this time what if that gunsmith wait sorry what had to be done damage assessment on the day really some structural damage pressure is seen sustainable levels blah blabbity blah blah blah we need to relieve the pressure we need to take out ghosts should have thought about that before you got our trigger happened you can get into that control pressure I have to get this big door opener it's a chain attached that'll lifted start first I need to get this thing out of the way gunsmith anchor my feet magnetic boots engaged doors open now I just have to lift that sluice gate who cares about the damn loss it's rock songs problem I care about the hundreds of workers who lose their lives in this Canyon floods start a disaster relief in their memory it would be a relief if you didn't start a disaster in the first place wow that actually worked it'll hold until rocks up and get some engineers out here we can still catch you let's go we need to have a serious talk I agree my missions not the iron the real man you are a lot more fun before your conscience got the way of your aim [Music] how are you still here good title for a memoir right boss boss [Applause] catch me starting that's not how this ends you're gonna get away you'd have done it it's the storm there better plays havoc with there's some space

not coming back anytime soon he's gone scatter his component boats are still out there bouncing around that sandstorm that was reckless thank you now in case you didn't notice ghost is getting away not this time [Music] there she is miss rounds under filter fire sorry us she brought a knife to a gunfight [Music] chuckle tracking her boss get close [Music] you're getting in my way George in life ghost would be toast just let me do this my way stand down [Music] when we get home you're getting out there you can't cut me off boss you [Music] our suits got it blow on power I think we have the truth she can still hide for us yeah until her Airlines I doubt that suit that's agreed solid rock I'm done hiding my sensors picked up which wasn't real and which are Holograms I know the way to find out she can't move or else she'll tip her hand boss once you find her you left clear shot where you get last economy's resonances should be you'll do anything besides me to bring you to justice [Music] [Music] even I felt bastard boss kind of got my hands full here not to worry [Music] that guy where'd she run off to I'm reading a weak signal dear bye [Music] the mask tossin ghost [Music] we got her dead to rights boss she's surrendering that season fool hey hey we are not killing her you don't have to do anything Hey still doing this for pepper you let her escape I gave you an order she deserves a job where's your holoprojector by upgrading to a special light modulator you're always talking about self-improvement so guns Meath you're fired you can't fire me I quit see on the other side shirk [Music] I'm back and I'm alone that's right [Music] maybe I'll give pepper a call she always cheers me up this is Virginia pots I can't take your call right now but leave a message and I'll get back to you well I am hungry perhaps about to eat oh and II guess Friday always handled the grocery orders still superhero work to be done I'll check out the globe doesn't anything work around here are you talking to sir myself be slightly more mature version I see and where's our loose cannon Bizu who the hell knows I thought an AI based on my old self could somehow do the right thing maybe sir but you were a changed man changed enough to have made me not to based on you or perhaps based on the man you want to be well actually you were based on old babysitter then she must have been quite special yeah when I was a kid she was the only grown-up I could trust and I hope I've earned your trust as well sir Friday I owe you an apology maybe more than one I'll put it on your tab in the meantime there's a world that needs saving [Music] why'd you come back Friday because I know what happens when you're left to your own devices fair enough speaking of that what's going on here it's living laser he's attacking shield but Parkes brazenness might be to our advantage since he practically glows in the dark if I can calculate his energies rate of decay I can pinpoint the exact time and place of his origin we find where Park was reborn there's a good chance we find ghosts what do you need from me give him what he wants sir fight him [Music] you're listening to stark raving the show money would listen to if money had ears we've got a special return guest who specifically asked to come on Dario agar CEO of rocks on energy mr. ager I assume you're here to personally thank the stark family after my cousin Tony's saved Roxanne's palladium mine from complete and utter destruction I think you mean did enough damage to shut it down for weeks Morgan costing Roxxon billions pretty convenient don't you think considering stark and rock song compete for energy contracts are you freaking kidding me if iron man hadn't been there that mine would be shut down permanently he saved it from ghost so he says all our eyewitness reports indicate is that there were explosions ray blasts and bursts of energy everywhere listen agar your people would sell their grandmother's to the salt mines for an extra buck and they learned that from watching you you're a dinosaur pal and my cousin is the asteroid well that sounds like a direct threat from the stark family the Tony Stark yourself to make us extinct and judging from the big smiles on the faces of my lawyers they agree thank you for giving us the basis to sue Stark Industries Morgan I knew I could count on you if Tony cares he's got more lawyers than he has mustache hairs you know I bring it on pal and if any of Tony's lawyers or listening call me okay my lawyers not available well technically disbarred you got here quickly clearly you're tracking me one might say obsessed I'd say laser-focused Friday patch me into the comm tower Korea everything okay on your end hey Tony afraid we got a bit of a nightmare scenario Arthur Park has himself a laser with global targeting abilities don't know what we did to get on his bad side but he's targeting us on my watch let's get him Tony mark still has a lot of drones at his fingertips that's the ghost let him keep up at the divorce fingertips pumps energy signature a spoon over these strategies if you destroyed them the source is ready to take it back to its origin point to some sleep [Music] practicality holds her back to bear job you need [Music] has been damaged park to see you're graduating from theft often destruction oh sorry I had you all wrong totally sane [Music] suits you'll see we've added a sample collection meter to your heart the more drones you down the more we can fill the needed sample sized parts energy signatures collected by your continued attack on those drones sir [Music] [Music] [Music] some damage taking effect systems failing evasive maneuvers you know game is online I showed the goat professional courtesy but she helped me back now nothing [Music] you are good darn but your own you can't span the globe at the speed of light fans tonight others would feel like to find breath just tryna stop Iron Man shield jet tango Oscar Sierra requesting assistance he's trapped a pilot says I took part to free that shield Jets [Music] great work Tony your direct attack on park resulted in a swift increase in our sample size well done sir I take no pleasure in it Friday I'm doing this for science oh yes of course sir enemies inbound my body's dark [Music] below optimal but not critical on my side unibeam is college keep at it sir I'm gathering quality data this way [Music] [Music] Joe hit get me out of this Jam and a leggy support fire so that spark is exposed again create that shield jet will secure us more of his energy signature come on bunch of white cell head we've made great progress sir just two feet more drones to gain its enough of its own hope since he's running out of them we may need a different approach [Music] you mean it online unless that only a few more to go that's my concern [Applause] the amethyst sustains damage done [Music] unity is online [Music] could give us enough of his energy signature looks like he gives us no choice he's firing blanks to stay moving we can't afford to get hit normally I'd agree he seems to be missing me and the Helicarrier by a wide margin true he's quite lousy at his job isn't he sir another shield jet reporting one apart blades occasion iron man did you get it is it enough Friday not quite but we're so close he'll move your jets into position that's what I'm talking about care to fill me in on this plan sir [Music] but my victories no one can stop a guy away from I returned with fear and trembling what kind of God runs away when he's defeated Park Park living laser yeah you called me by my name help now why are those happiness everything you've got sir Parkes photonic presence seems to have entirely vanished from Earth it's as if he's up and quit then his brighter than I gave him credit for what's more I've connected enough of his energy signature to trace it back to his place of origin sir we may finally be able to bring the fight to ghosts door good work Friday heading home [Music] with Friday back on board I felt a renewed drive to catch this ghost which hadn't happened yet because I'd left it up to you know who the gunsmith had a knack for predicting where ghosts would show up but he had no interest in figuring out where she came from I did sir see me at the globe as soon as possible thanks to you I was able to determine living lasers origin point by now it contains only the faintest trace of his energy but I'm certain he was there once you think it's ghosts operating base it's quite possible sir that's great what are we waiting for Friday show me our new destination that's just it it's not entirely new do you recognize it sir yeah I recognize it it's the cave my origin point birthplace of Ironman [Music] perhaps ghost has gone somewhere else by now moved on no she hasn't moved on she doesn't want me to either [Music] [Music] you
