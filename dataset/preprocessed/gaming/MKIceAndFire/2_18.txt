light right here there you go perfect thank you the sooner we get out of here the better just picture yourself curling up in front of a big old fire pit singing campfire sing-alongs i don't think

step taken you tread a path of your own matched with its very own consequences there will be moments throughout your stay that show you that the choices you've made the path you've chosen could have gone another way at hackett's quarry there's no such thing as the wrong way but be warned some paths are more dangerous than others yeah um we um uh something jumped out right in front of the car and

a romance apocalypse i mean you never know the universe has a kind of way of uh working these things out the universe yeah like the the cosmic space gods space gods you heard me okay spell it nothing a spell you know we're cool oh so cool we are super cool so she dumped dress huh hi emma hey okay this is um you've heard of spatial awareness before right spatial awareness is for nerds uh be aligned and grab the last couple of bags boy yes boss say hi to emma for me you're a bad person yes i am hey what are you uh what do you listen to before good to know jesus christ hi hey are you guys going to help with the bags or what oh um you know i was actually just working on fixing uh the door it's broken dylan please i can't it's it's i got to get the last bags and they're coming with this thing it's just feeling sleek sorry bro cool thanks guys oh skill ugh horror i hate horror okay really dude locking me out okay in my defense a it was dylan's idea and two it was really funny oh yeah right is that is that right i don't write the rules man okay whatever look you can help me with the bags or what no i got to stay here and wait for mr h to return our cell phone sorry jesus christ okay and why are the stairs blocked well apparently it's to keep raccoons and other pesky violence from ransacking the place mr h's words are not mine oh boring is that you dylan i can only deal with one [ __ ] at a time jacob this place needs a serious overhaul oh jesus hmm all right got the bags great all by yourself huh yep i guess you have to get used to that oh my god you are so mean at least i'm honest oh okay here we go okay you're not telling me the whole truth about you and emma are you son oh okay so now i'm the one who's not telling the whole story huh oh well this is the bait i just gotta take jake oh sorry i just got so distracted about that rhyme i forgot what we were oh no no uh you were telling me how you totally have the thing for ryan wait are we talking about ryan the sailing instructor with the sexy brooding loner thing that totally doesn't do anything for me at all ah sexy huh how does that camp by far okay sure look it was all settled by the girls in bunk seven like second day of camp it goes ryan me of course then dylan emma abby okay nick and then mr h okay are you almost finished please yep that's it that's everyone so she really just dumped her ass huh i don't okay her whole thing is like how are we gonna make this work different schools blah blah blah my whole thing is like you know maybe long distance blah blah blah blah blah and she was just like jacob she gave you the look huh yeah do not pass go man just got you wrapped all the way around that dainty little finger of hers how does she do it okay okay you know what maybe you're right maybe she does have like this super power over me but you know what maybe i like it oh licks it check totally not in denial check okay wow the um the fumes of of jealousy are just stifling over here excuse me i'm just saying i guess some girls don't have what it takes to hang with the big dog you're a real charmer you know that look i'm just saying i don't know why you didn't make a move on ryan you should have seized the moment well kansas a moment that ever happened yeah well you can't wait for it to come to you you got to make the moment happen yourself oh right chase the moment around all summer like a dog with two dicks until it dumps you on the last day of camp okay not going to miss it okay so are we sure that this old rust bucket's roadworthy we'll take a look it better be one more night in the great outdoors might actually kill me hey it doesn't kill you will make you stronger well i haven't killed you yet and you're still pretty pathetic hey shut up uh okay so um total hypothetical but if i was like a huge [ __ ] and i wanted to break down the van so we'd have to spend another night here uh what exactly would i need to do well you'd probably break the fuel line or i don't know rip out the rotor arm and yes that would make you a total [ __ ] okay and what does a rotor arm look like again it's like a arm that's all rotary you know it's under the little black dome with the leads poking out jake you do realize that even if we somehow did get stuck out here one more night with emma wouldn't make a difference trust me chicks made up our mind yeah sure i guess we'll just have to find out wow this looks important [ __ ] i will hook you right back up tomorrow okay thank you promise [Music] up here my dudes why did they look like they're up to something hey jacob what no dude please don't dumb oh dick oh there it is oh man good side freak oh oh oh i wish i had some singles freaks i'm surrounded by freaks oh thank god i'm gonna get the whole new technology thing but take me back world you would have thought mr h could have like charged up our phones like a little bit nothing's ever your fault is it you know you should really just save it for emergencies only unless of course is being dumped an emergency back off [ __ ] i'm sorry i peace and love man i i didn't mean to hurt your feelings you all ready to bounce where's everybody else why why would i know that sometimes you know stuff i don't look i don't i don't even know how to respond to that you say nick you're way smarter than me and you're a super hot star who gets any cheeky ones okay yeah keep dreaming junior hey there party bear status report we are officially empty nesters high five up top oh boy you're about to get your phone back aren't you let's go collect our bags and away from this mosquito infested backwoods dump door is locked bags inside [ __ ] me yep what it's obvious what we have to do here find someone with a key shape our destiny then by shape our destiny i mean shape our way through this crappy lock and grab our bags okay let's do it we better not get in trouble i won't tell if you won't tell mr hackett's gonna find out so what he'll just think it was a bear or something have you ever seen a bear in these woods no but that doesn't mean they're not out there fair point all right let's do this on three one two three uh all about the power of positive thinking why do i ever listen to you because i'm always right are you sure they're gonna think it was a bear oh my god relax it's not like we killed someone all right well i'm just gonna take another look around make sure we didn't miss anything go nuts oh this was little izzy's i want to play a game yeah you can probably just stay here you creepy little thing why would this place be in the news can't believe i'm actually gonna miss all those lumpy loose springs ugh it's gonna be weird not waking up to dylan's morning announcements um hey you stopped that dylan is not gonna be happy i'll tell chris about it when we see him everyone likes a scavenger hunt and at hackett's quarry that's no different there are secrets in these woods fun secrets that should you uncover them could help protect you from criminal prosecution after all the stories you'll take with you are only stories without the proof to back them up so it's time to dive into the mystery take pictures or find pieces of evidence and you may just prove your innocence ouch so jacob hasn't seen ew what this that is it dylan's i don't think anyone knocked caitlyn out of first place all summer ready to roll let's do it finally time to let loose and vamos this caboose how are you so dramatic annoying confident it's just acting that's what people want so you're faking it and in a way faking it is just being yourself but louder you should try it sometime you never know who you might impress no it's too late now anyway for what you nick you never know unless you put yourself out there [Music] oh wow oh nice steering tech jinkies okay so hypothetically if i were to put myself out there what if he ends up being a dud kind of like you and jacob it's actually really sweet that much you couldn't summer fling we're going to school like four states away he gets it yeah sure but that's us you and nick could be different when you get his handle hit him up oh i already have his email it was in the packet that they gave to us on the first day email are you 93. what's wrong with email i'm really gonna miss you abby oh hold up oh but the lodge is that way go right here why come on scenic route one last victory lap around the camp yes sure what's the victory two months no technology i kind of thought it was nice to be offline ugh i didn't plus my subs need me oh how'd they even get by for two months without you i will have you know that i have a very loyal and engaged subscriber base i provide very important and educational lifestyle advice in the form of entertaining and hilarious video monologues they rely on me oh totally you're a big deal uh yeah i mean i'm sure they're gonna be like really heavier back my favorite spot the fire pit the island mad secluded right is is that smoke should we tell someone um it looks pretty contained it's probably just mr age burning some stuff before you know he closes camp for the summer yeah speaking of which we should we should probably yeah get back oh yeah worried nick's you know we're gonna leave without you well no they're probably like all waiting for us everyone's waiting for us everyone yeah nick waiting for you all everyone don't worry jacob i got you i got a full tank of gas so oh [ __ ] me [Music] oh idiot does nobody own phone chargers anymore there's no signal out here anyways dude okay this place is like patchy's balls

alluring somewhere i'm here what are you doing under there having a little knee party i was listening to a podcast actually oh podcast nice that's cool what's it about yeah what's it about is it about

that bag um no they're still good oh my god they're like 20 years older okay look they pre-date expiration dates you're gonna love them well i saw a wheel barrel out front so we can load up all our booty in there uh i'm sorry what booty oh it means like um like treasure or buds no before that wheelbarrow uh yeah um okay uh it's like um it's like a barrel with wheels you can put stuff in it and just wheel it around oh i see ladies first which way [Music] [Music] all right the inner sanctum it's just an office this is where the magic happens okay yeah let's just make this quick sure just give me a sec to get this going and engage podcasts yeah all right uh what's it called the one that you're listening to right now uh bizarre yet bonafide so like ghosts and stuff it's like um yeah like the the weird and the wonderful digging up weird mysteries and discussing if they're well bona fide banner fad get it your wood knows no bounds so should we check out what mr h keeps in his private den of sin uh i don't know man i feel a little weird going through his stuff okay well i don't i mean come on what kind of dirty secrets is the owner of a summer camp full of impressionable young children gonna have anyway not mr h i know he's cool it's always been cool to me kaylee and kayla packett weird kids huh i like them yeah me too um they are pretty reclusive you have to admit whoa look at this old thing hey give me your number i want to try it out why oh no reason i just thought it'd be nice for somebody to call you for a change good burn thank you i thought it was pretty good hello what who is it hello it's weird i thought i thought i heard someone maybe we should stop touching stuff fine well hello what is this [Music] you hear that is that a trap door i knew that there was a secret sex dungeon around here somewhere oh yeah yeah i bet you mr h is into some real kinky [ __ ] i doubt it weren't there a couple counselors who never showed up uh-huh why secret sex dungeon it's not funny it probably just goes to the basement or something open it up all right well it looks like a pit of eternal darkness so you're being dramatic climb down take a look look you can squeeze through there you opened it you climbed down what's down there oh my god ryan you will not believe this what what what it's nothing oh i had you go in there for a second didn't i no maybe just shut up [Music] it is uh pretty spooky down here though and it smells very unnatural so yeah okay i'm coming back up oh that's a nice chair i could get used to this you better hope mr h doesn't catch you taking his baby out for a joyride oh sorry bud gotta take this one second hello hack it's quarry summer camp what doesn't kill you will make you stronger what can i do for you on this darn tootin doozy of a day is that your impression of mr h uh yeah uh-huh yeah yeah i you're absolutely right he does need to be nicer to dylan and uh what's that you want him to give dylan his phone number that's a little forward but i can see what i can do smooth oh laura kearney and max brindley oh yeah those are the ones that never showed up yeah it's because of these goobers that we had to work extra shifts this summer uh hey what's the gun for uh chris mr h told me it was for um bears bears here yeah yeah he said they don't really come around because he's got the gun to yeah just leave it alone leave it alone dude what if we're out partying tonight out in the woods and we end up in a sort of most dangerous game situation like when people hunt other people yeah yeah well i mean think about it it's camp is over and hunting season has just begun true what what if okay bear with me here what if what's on the menu tonight is us well then i guess we would need to protect ourselves exactly that's why we need the gun for protection yeah not gonna happen what about for fun no okay yeah yeah totally [Music] well we know where the gun is if we need it your call man so got anything going on when you get back home school or uh jerry's out i understood girlfriend uh not exactly boyfriend free agent cool yeah me too are the uh phones uh they could probably use a little while longer ah okay can't you like speed it up at all i can try to encourage them go for it you guys can do it it's not working dudes we're gonna have to wait [Music] yo my guy toss me the keys uh so you can poke around in chris's private area i i'm sorry is that something that only you're allowed to do party harhar come on what's the harm in looking it's you're not a little bit curious i'm not gonna touch anything fine don't let me regret it you can't promise that but nothing but nat you're using that wrong oh huh fashion icon [Music] mr h knows what he likes i'm sure he does wow there's yo hey hey maybe we shouldn't [Music] uh brian whoa what the [ __ ] these monitors this is the camp huh is mr h spying on us no no i mean no no he can't be these are just they're all different trails in the woods around camp sure most of the cameras are pointed away from camp so it's not like he's spying on the kids unless they wandered out into the woods you know these are just probably just trail cameras what are trail cameras people set them up to catch weird random [ __ ] okay yeah like what like bigfoot sightings you know that kind of thing so okay i'm going to upgrade mr h from super creepy pervert with a spy cam to you know super crazy conspiracy hunter to be fair bigfoot's not a conspiracy okay fine how about an aspiring cryptozoologist hey maybe he likes the podcast that you listen to sure yeah let's go with that okay but why go through all the trouble of hiding this room through a secret door in the closet uh i mean it's not exactly secret right like it's just hidden by stuff yeah that's what a secret is ryan it's weird it's majorly weird i don't disagree with you but it's it's got to be something juicy in here dylan it's it's none of our business and if you really want to know you can ask him tomorrow sure that won't be an awkward conversation like at all okay yeah maybe i will all right i i'm leaving the secret layer have fun hey you just admitted that it's a secret layer okay these are boring [Music] huh [Music] [Music] well there's some pretty heavy-duty stuff in here yeah maybe let's not touch that yeah there's nothing fun nice full up hey dunza all right cool let's go thank you this would be a lot easier with mr h's chainsaw it's really very pretty out here when there's no kids around they can get kind of obnoxious huh yeah they always seem to listen to you during painting class you've seen my class just walking by the art gavin's all the way out of the way yeah well there's this shortcut that i take that goes by [Music] which way should we go why don't you choose [Music] good choice better sticks this way better sticks like burning or whatever think we've got enough uh not yet so this place was an actual quarry uh yeah apparently some of the caves are in pretty deep it's like a honeycomb under there cool [Music] are you sure this is safe what are you scared no are you no ah [ __ ] it's all right calm down [Music] so so you ever think about what's next like after we die it's heavy man no i mean like the future yeah sometimes all the time it's overwhelming i know what you mean sometimes i just try to like let it happen you know what like whatever happens is what was meant to happen like it's all predetermined fate i wouldn't call it that exactly a predetermined future maybe the direction stays the same but the details change like it changes as you go you're still in control of your own fate yeah i don't know seems a little defeatist no i see this way i can do whatever i want and not feel bad about it within reason guess that is a little freeing in a sociopathic kind of way oh i know where we are yeah up here here hold this this view is just wow oh do me oh sorry i'm i'm just trying to get this down right sorry dumb idea i just want to finish this take your time uh you hear that huh it's probably nothing no listen there's something there [Music] look it's so tiny my god he's so hold on hold on [Music] you're in danger hunted by a creature of indeterminate origin don't breathe you need to stop breathing tricking the beast into taking you for nothing but a corpse and where's the fun and hunting then which is already dead watch the visuals alter or listen to the sound change as the threat approaches when the danger has passed run pick the right moment and run for your life be warned exhaling or running at the wrong time manages to mark you as the creature's quality causing serious consequences um [Music] geez that was close almost just moved me to death i'm sorry i'm sorry oh little piggy at least we gave her a good story to tell her pig husband how do you know it was the mommy pig i got a pretty good look ew i think she was coming on to me oh got yourself a little girlfriend she wasn't that little all right guess we should head back finally get my phone back and it's just a big dumb brick hey caitlin guess what mr h is a voyeuristic creep he has hidden cameras everywhere and a secret room no that's not uh well no backup what his eyes are everywhere he's always watching us knock it off man he he's just got trail cameras set up you know forest surveillance that kind of thing oh you don't think that's weird well he's got a perimeter to check kids should protect he'll probably just to keep track of wildlife guys i have no imagination so uh what's going on here everything ready i did see a weird light in the treehouse across the lake yeah that was pretty spooky maybe it's your girlfriend brian the hack of hack it's corey i told you never to say heck of heck it's corey again what's wrong with saying hack of hack is corey are you done you know i just realized we may never see each other again after tonight you can't have just realized that just trying to set the mood what mood mood the vibe you know speaking of setting the mood i have work to do okay because playlists don't make themselves i mean i guess they do but all right right guy time to get wood yikes wording oh i know what i said abby nick just in time we got wood we've already done that joke it's mostly just kindling oh that's all we need there's already a big pile of logs here we could have gotten more but there was a hog or a boar but nick was very very brave and took one for the team oh my gosh it can't be the hog of hack it's corey what i thought you hated that phrase big jokes take big sacrifices you're so brave oh i just want to shrink you down to little pocket people and put you in my pocket and peep it to where i need a little pick-me-up okay special delivery whoa whoa where the hell did that gun come from dude relax okay it's not even real uh well i mean it's a real gun but it's just for shooting back we found it in the storage room okay fine fine we'll put it down thank you guns are no joke [ __ ] and and we bring you a hand-picked selection of only the finest that hackett's quarry has to offer no freaking way yes freaking way peanut butter butter pops i didn't even know you could still find these anyway hey cool your jets there cowboy all right these are spoken for dude you can't just shove those in my face and not expect me to want to pop pop pop them in my mouth come on emma please hand me the shotgun what you're gonna shoot me over them no dumbass okay we are going to shoot for them nah dude absolutely not no there is no way i'm leaving you dill weeds alone with a gun come on look the shooting range is like right over there okay it'll be fun okay look you and me old-fashioned shootout first prize peanut butter butter pops all to yourself dude i guess you don't really want them then huh fine you're on yeah boy jacob hand me that gun now i mean nobody's handling any firearms if you're gonna act like a dick about it okay then you can be the ref you need an objective third party okay we're trying to get a party started here jacob okay well the main party's not gonna die just cause you're offering a little side quest come on all right guess we're gonna have ourselves an old-fashioned shootout look there's a clearing we can use as a shooting range back there but if i see either of you [ __ ] around i am turning this car around oh be good okay so just so you know i was an expert marksman third class three years in a row ranked highest in camp each year i'm just letting you know that your goose is cooked nick but if you back down now i might let you just have one little peanut butter butter pop if you're lucky no way you've never even seen me shoot yeah it's because you've never shot before yeah nothing you know of okay i think i would know if you're actually boys i'm gonna have to stop you right there as much as i'm enjoying your charming machismo the moment we step foot on the shooting range we're playing by my rules okay and what i say goes got it okay good now i'm gonna go set up some targets and get more shells do not move a muscle or touch his gun until i'm back all right so is it just me is it kind of hot when she gets all bossy like i'm always hot pencilled okay thank you bye bye so um how's your little one-on-one with abby in the woods fine how was your little one-on-one with emma ah dude it's incredible she's totally still into me really yeah just got to figure out this whole long distance thing is that what she wants which she wants i mean you could ask her [Music] that's funny speaking of let me show you how a real man shoots his gun are you guys seriously still thumping your chest at each other no i think he's got brain damage okay please just give me the gun uh-uh you'll have it when i say you'll have it all right huddle up boys this is how we're gonna do this you're shooting the one on the left nick first then jacob's turn keep your fingers off the trigger till you're ready to shoot you got it aye aye all right two things remember the spread remember the recoil this is a shotgun we're not sharp shooting here the flashlight shows you where you're aiming i'm sorry to have to say there may well be times during your stay at hackett's quarry where you'll have to defend yourself using potentially deadly force when engaging in combat simply aim your weapon and shoot where the flashlight is pointed take note if you're up close and personal with your target you'll do more damage the farther away the larger the spread and injuries may not be fatal there's a time and place for the use of weapons and you may want to consider all your options remember it's not always wise to pull the trigger that's how people get hurt all right nick one point okay we're too far back to do any real damage let's scoot forward a little and uh [ __ ] these guys up okay you're good all right nick this time for real nice shot i'm lucky point to you nick good job nick all right let's see what you got all right you might want to uh avert your eyes nick i don't want to give you any more performance anxiety all right all right just shut up and shoot jacob i thought you're an ultra elite pro marksman yeah with like a rifle okay not with this cannon blaster that is how you get someone shot no it's okay you probably would have missed me anyway hey disqualified for being a dumbass no oh what's that jeggy huh huh peanut butter butter okay i get it i get it blam you thought this was over what whoa pop pop peanut butter butter pops so okay new idea party game come on people we might never see each other after tonight let's make some memories well what do you have in mind how about the ultimate game of secrets and lies truth or dare but dylan's style okay house rules are someone asks you truth or dare then you choose and then you do and there's no ifs ands or buts so like normal truth or dare yes so we can like make people kiss if they choose dare yeah as long as everyone can sense of course cool beans i mean keep it in your pants until it's your turn but well who does get to go first well it's house deals so abigail truth or dare um truth really dodged a bullet huh all right here goes have you ever slept with anyone oh um i hey take it easy man that's too far come on i i'm not finished um have you ever slept with anyone at this camp no nope sorry all right abby it's your turn all right okay um oh abby oh my god just pick someone okay okay um i don't know oh ding ding ding too late my turn ryan truth or dare dare give me what you got okay ryan your dare comes with a choice can't you do that i can do whatever i want and i dare you to kiss either caitlyn or dylan wow i mean i guess both is off the table sorry i don't make the rules i mean you literally just did but okay let's do this caitlyn shall we always happy to please all righty who shall i pick well uh me and jacob haven't got no turn yet good point all right jacob let's see what you're made of oh there there man come on

you like kissing my girlfriend [ __ ] it was just a guy i'm nobody's girlfriend the [ __ ] it was just a game yeah the [ __ ] it was man jacob grow up well i guess i should probably go after him you should probably go find abby so anybody want to play part cheesy what ah [ __ ] this welcome back i am as always delighted that you're here so then what more has been found the hanged man to be the hanged man is to surrender and by doing so gain a new perspective so look carefully and consider that sometimes one needs to be strung up in order to let go but these are just words there's more to show you if you'll let me [Music] that's all i have to say for now secrets remain buried and the night grows darker i'll see you again you can count on that be careful where the wolves go [Music] the ravens follow stupid game what are we in middle school why should i even care anybody can kiss anybody stupid stupid great when the hell am i so i took everything ah is that a trail cam yes foreign oh abby you out here nick abby shout again i'm over here i'm coming nick hey hey um hi you are not i think that game just got a little too intense for me hey yeah i know what you mean so all that stuff back there oh my gosh emma really wanted to make jacob jealous huh anything i mean yeah why the heck else would she kiss me like that true i was just playing along yeah it's just a game right right i don't think emma was the mastermind here then who well caitlyn all of them i guess but mostly caitlyn she's sneaky truthful there's a stupid game right i don't know maybe it lets us act how we really feel or it lets us act as props to help jacob and emma hash out whatever [ __ ] they've got going on so then do you have feelings for her no i mean i just meant the whole thing's dumb that's all you remember the second or third day of camp when we were assigned to take our cabins down to the island ropes course together yeah that was when we met um do you remember that camper that a little accident on the course he was so embarrassed i thought his life was over i had to take him to get cleaned up before anyone noticed except you i guess thanks for not telling anyone that wasn't actually the first time we met we met at orientation on the first day we did yes there's like a million people um but honestly you kind of seem like a dick i said hi and you barely acknowledged me [ __ ] i'm sorry i've seen most counselors make fun of their campers tease them a little jacob does it emma kind of does it too but you don't i've had my moments i'm not proud of some of the stuff i've done that'll be jacob's influence yeah i tend to just fall in love when he's around you're not jacob don't try to be jacob who wants to be jacob girls are into jacob not the cool ones who are the cool ones into then guys who are cool enough to help a camper out of a sticky situation that makes me feel a little better is it a bear it's too fast run [Music] [Music] oh my god [Applause] uh ah uh [Music]
