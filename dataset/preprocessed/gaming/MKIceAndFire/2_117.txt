like come huntress you and i should speak are you chaplain jarrah kotalo said i should talk to you to see if you need help bold move wall breaker burying dakota's pride beneath the bull walks rubble was just at ease many in the clan agree with you and marshall cotello was right to send you to me there is something you can help with a few of our soldiers followed him to the embassy at barren light against takote's orders right i remember kotalo showed up last with only a few representatives from the sky clan when those soldiers returned home to kote reassigned them to an old watchtower one we had abandoned to the machines he insisted that with war brewing it must be reclaimed but those soldiers are serving no one out there if however they were to return by request of hacarro's champion takate wouldn't have the backing to deny them especially when their chaplain supports their return tell a few soldiers to come home and give dakota another black eye sounds easy enough go to the cold rushes a long stretch to the west the watchtower stands beside the falls speak to kiva there the squad's leader good luck um but you should know outlander what's going on here the wall breaker jacka's brother here went off to get himself killed he'll finish the climb i know it not likely my brother pento left to climb the march of the ten to get his soldiers mark they were supposed to be done by now but he's not back yet jeka lataka to your training now your brother should have stuck to his cleaning duties would you mind checking up on the march if i leave my squad leader will kick my ass and i don't want anyone thinking i'm worried about my brother making the climb because i'm not i get it you can't miss the path markers thereby the waterfall west of here if i head that way i'll see what's going on thank you no slacking soldier you know the tunnel slaps our scalp i'm telling you she wants requests outlander chief acaro and marshall catalo await you within the cool route should be starting soon once it's done i'll be able to access the chamber below hikaru's throne and ether there's my sleeve to the arena it's another part of the ruins turned into a fighting ring this could be useful i hope you're right hey lloyd it seems you've had to move mountains to bring the sky clan to heal literally katalo helped yes takote reprimanded for all the klan to see you both served well but now the cool route is at hand some have come to compete others to bear witness they know regala will come from me i'll do whatever it takes to hold up my end as long as you remember yours so what's the plan cattaloo there are only two viable ways to attack the arena through the throne room you just passed and by the trail on the north end we've set up barricades at both but if regala means to assault the cool route with machines she will have to attack by the trail you will join our defenders there hold the line and i'll have my marshals you will be free of my service and receive your reward make whatever preparations you must once the cool route begins you must see it through [Music] the grove the arena it's all part of the same ancient structure yes here the land remembers the sacrifice of the ten their deeds commemorated for eternity sacrifice the visions tell us that on the ground below they gave their lives in a fight against machines we honored them by holding the cool route where they fell i know where i'll be what about you two i will be here with the chief where i belong should the fight reach us we will take the blood owed for our fallen if it comes to that the defenses will hold let's get this over with good you'll find deca at the north barricade with the rest of our defenders strike true as the ten i'll see you when this is done [Music] this is a ceremony it's found in the blades i can feel it didn't think the sky commander himself would be joining us today if there's a chance my challengers will be facing regala it is only right their commander joined in their fate or maybe you need to save face after what happened at the bulwark careful now sometimes sharp wits bring out sharps beers i'd save my spear for regales troops if i were you should be at the end of this trench we are not alone in this fight focus on the machines take them down and regala's forces become no different from our own yes chaplain watch each other's backs dismissed our soldiers are ready they will defend the cool route from below but from above not bad where did you get it one of our squads ripped it off a fallen machine the honor is yours regala may have her tricks but you will show her our teeth [Applause] [Applause] the cool route is upon us our struggle demands new blood new leaders [Applause] release the quarry challengers approach [Applause] all who take down a machine shall be named martian remember the ten strike from the air as they do and seize your glory [Music] [Applause] [Music] here they come hold them back defend the cool route [Music] down yes ugh oh oh two zero zero [Music] [Music] that can't be all of them there what is that i don't know hold the defenses go huh oh hmm oh [Applause] oh get to the weapon if i can draw that thing close open fire hey that's right over here oh [Music] keep up wow we're reloading running on the show oh people finally i hate those things we're gonna went after hikaro and katalo i gotta get to them [Music] champion get to the chief [Music] [Music] give them support [Music] oh catello [Applause] hmm isn't finished i'll be back with everything i have and all who stand with her carl will be run red at attention you fought well proved yourself against enemies both metal and flesh i name you all marshall your first order is to secure the arena from any remaining rebels go i failed i should have finished regala but now she'll be back with more machines stronger than ever i'll do what i can to help no you've done enough far more than our bargain called for when we first met you spoke of your true mission on which all depends i wasn't certain if i believed you then but i believe in you now so leave me and get to your task what will you do turn to the wounds what you need is there take it your deeds today will be remembered like those of the ten this is it hey there's below there that console come on ether time to go home elizabeth alpha prime master override activated restoring either subordinate got it now to get this back to gaia [Music] the visions and the growth have changed the words of the ten are not clear to us here this must be the vision that chief ricardo saw years ago all of the visions are changed and this one just arrived here let's talk the visions throughout the grove are different now and this one it just appeared is this your doing visions have changed [Music] that's the one that inspired chief akaro more testimony of the old ones hear now the words that reunited a people following the tragic events of the war and faraday the chief architect of the reconciliation effort addressed a nation in need of hope if we look into the future the lens of the recent past our fears loom wars waged against machines scarcity of food and water [Music] storms that drive us from our homes [Music] but true courage means facing those fears with conviction instead of cynicism leading the peacekeeping effort with these brave men and women these marshals of the new south west has strengthened my conviction that when we are united we can overcome any threat join me join us in that conviction as we strive for a nation and a world without want or war [Music] [Music] reporting for duty commander i'm coming with you but akaru needs you because of you he has new marshals and a rallying cry the clans cannot ignore [Music] so i will stand with you on your mission give whatever is left of my life it is what i choose how can i say no to that so there's someone who wants to join us i need you to meet him in the foothills and guide him the rest of the way go to the mountains west of plain song a friend of mine will meet you on the ascent i'll join you when i can a friend of yours should be interesting seems like capturing it did something to the other holograms too might be worth checking out [Music] [Music] [Music] haven't seen one since i visited hunter's gathering i didn't think the utara traveled that far east i did it for my dives i like to see how different tribes use roots and plants to make new colors it's amazing how the right hue can make armor express so much more than its mere function i have some samples if you're interested [Music] it's nothing compared to the tanakh dyers they may not be the friendliest of tribes but if you bring their dyers plants or samples they might show you their skills i'll keep an eye out for them [Music] oh i like this oh you're not waving a hammer around aaron try a gentler touch and my big sasha's fingers normally do gentle okay bring it back trace the line to your right other right i just saw it it's the one aloy found up north gotcha they call it a a concussion beat party or something anna that's music aloy aaron you're all better and you're here varl said you might need some help after all doing uh complicated things we still have much training to do of course one does not become hunter in a day each seed grows at a pace of its own doesn't mean it won't bloom you should know your tanakh friend arrived kotolo i heard their warriors drink people's blood i want to sleep with one eye open i think he's seen enough blood for a lifetime i showed him to one of the rooms he seems to appreciate the privacy uh looks like you've got things under control i should get this to guyan right we'll keep on training catch up as fast as we can i've seen glyphs in my dreams already well while you've been off gallivanting around i've been working with gaia to find out more about the land gods so from where i'm standing you're in need of some training come along uh oh uh okay oh and i delivered your message to talana she headed for that asaram camp you two were looking for to the southwest the old ones created so many wonderful inventions to help others to help the planet technology really can be an amazing thing until it gets a mind of its own and uh decides to kill everyone you're just a ray of sunshine aren't you only for you wow this place is starting to come alive yeah and gaia placed all the data she got from your focus into that archive room with the focuses you gave us we'll be able to access it at our own pace you know learn and train and if you need us we'll be there to fight at your side got it thanks paul how's uh training with zoe you know we really are training mostly look she reads glyphs faster than i can already i'd be a fool to refuse her help of course [Music] looks like i was wrong about the zeniths their ship didn't explode on its way to sirius like everyone thought we saw how they lied about creating a better future at their launch facility guess they lied about what happened to their ship too but still the tribes settling amongst the stars i couldn't put a single dent in their shields for that one zenith almost killed me that didn't stop you from resurrecting gaia won't stop us from using hephaestus against them let's hope that's enough you guys reading something over there we just finished going through all the logs you collected back in nora territory and all mother mountain it's hard to imagine that my ancestors were trapped inside without the knowledge from apollo to guide them thanks to ted pharaoh yeah i wonder how it must have felt when they were finally free the world must have seemed so beautiful not to mention terrifying they weren't much more than kids and they became an entire tribe [Music] i'm guessing you've spoken with cotello i wanted to pay my respects for those who fell when we were ambushed at the embassy told him i'd never seen anyone throw themselves at a machine like he did he said a warrior shouldn't be praised for fulfilling their duty for a second i thought i was talking to my mother never thought of tanakh than a nora warchief could have so much in common i'm guessing talana didn't stay for long you got that right makes you wonder what this a modest guy did to grab her attention whatever it was she didn't tell me must be quite a story i guess she'll tell us when she's ready how's everyone handling their focus and we all have our difficult moments errand definitely curses the most but i'm hoping ossaram's stubbornness prevails [Music] how's everyone doing just taking it all in no one's snapped their bowstrings yet think you can hold the fort while i'm gone if aaron stops listening to the same music over and over again maybe we'll be fine barrel looks happy about his training partner learning is best done together have you gone back to plain song at all i thought about it but i wouldn't know what to tell them the chorus already thinks me a thorn in the thicket if they knew what we did to fall even if they understood there'd be little they could grasp about all this no for now i must leave the tribe behind what are you up to gaia was kind enough to put together a list of glyphs used by the old ones she helped me decipher some of the data you've collected and showed me how to use the focus to help the process it's not easy but it's been working so far that's good to hear i see you've settled in gaia did say this place was built for us so we could regain control of our lands with her terraforming system nurture them like the land gods do plain songs fields it does strike me as odd that a place of life should have so much metal sounds like you met my friend talana yes the karja huntress i haven't seen armor like hers since the red raids but varl tells me that she too suffered at the hands of the mad sun king yeah she's one of the good ones trust me you've spoken with kotalo a few words tanakh don't have much use for us outsiders you must have made quite the impression for him to offer his fealty so you've been talking to gaia yes she was kind enough to take me through some of the history of the old ones including their demise and the heroic actions of her creator elizabeth sobek i was surprised to see she was you past but reborn not that i claim to understand how [Music] you've been getting to know aaron i assume of course any friend of varls is a friend of mine in this case a very loud friend did gaia tell you anything about the zenith she did though it wasn't exactly easy to believe to think that there are places among the stars where life can bloom as it does here it is humbling to say the least and heartbreaking that such life should be bent on destroying ours so how does a tribe like the utaru manage to maintain the peace with warriors like the tanakh by holding them off when our fields bloomed aplenty the tanakhs looked upon our lands with envy but plain songs dishes provided sanctuary and high ground to keep invaders at bay in the end even the tanakh saw sense in a truce the utauru promised to provide the tanakh with food from our crops every year in exchange the tanakh would relinquish one of their own a veteran to train the utaru in combat this custom was abandoned a few years after the derangement but some veterans still remain in the planes [Music] right i should probably go i shall return to our training then eloy we've gathered some supplies in that chest take what you need did you forget i've been meaning to ask what's the deal with you and the chorus you didn't seem to be on the best of terms that's what happens when you're the one who taro who insists on publicly defying them twice when the karja invaded the utaru plains they did more than just attack our villages they burned our fields took our people as slaves and murdered those who were too weak to make the trip back to meridian to be sacrificed in the sun ring i was helping the healers back then as waves of refugees swarmed into plain song the chorus was divided in how to face the invaders some saw sense in raising arms others believed the dishes would keep us safe as they had many times before and while they bickered i buried the seeds of the fallen i couldn't have been easy seeing your people suffer while the karja invaded your lands i come from a small village near plainsong my grandmother used to say there was no seed that wouldn't grow there i moved to the dishes when i decided to apprentice as a healer when the red raids began i thought about going back but the injured kept pouring into plain sun day after day so i kept putting it off one day i woke up to hear a karja raiding party had ransacked my village during the night i rushed there with the healers to help the survivors but there weren't any left the smell of burning flesh haunts me to this day i'm sorry though i made it a point to appear before the chorus as soon as we returned to demand that we take a stand against the invaders i was denied so i left to fight on my own you said you set out to fight the karja alone i did but it turned out i wasn't the only one news of my disagreement with the chorus spread through the plains before i knew it i had more than a dozen uttaru warriors ready to follow me into battle we knew we couldn't take on the karja armies head-on but we also knew the lay of the land better than they did we ambushed smaller raiding parties sabotaged their supply lines and hit their encampments at night sounds like you were a force to be reckoned with enough that the tanakh took notice when the clans began to push the karja back east they let us join their ranks we chased the enemy all the way to barren light you said you were at baron lights when the tanakh's defeated the karja tanakh's marshals climbed the cliffs of the daunt under cover of night then attacked from the other side before we knew it the gates were open and the full force of the clans burst through what happened next was [Music] not something i like to remember when all the dust and blood settled i smelled it again the stench of burnt flesh our enemies defeated what was left of my squad returned to the utaru plains i went back to plain song but even as the harvest passed it didn't feel like i truly returned at all is that when you became a grave singer i thought soothing the suffering of others [Music] would somehow appease my own then you came along and gave me a choice i could either sing at people's graves or fight for a chance to keep them alive i'm glad you chose the latter i better get going don't let me keep you hey hey a nice place well it's not like i built it or anything right i can see why you uh oh you had your doubts about bringing us along there's a lot to take in but uh don't worry that's nothing i can't handle right i was hoping you could help me with something it's about the tanakh rebels and it also has to do with the awesome really that doesn't sound good let me know what i can do to help [Music] i see varl gave you a focus well it doesn't look as fashionable on me but by the forge the things i've been able to see granted a lot of them are bad you know the old world ending and such i'd still try to wrap my head around most of it but i never really understood how you're ever able to find my sister back in the sunday and now i do sort of it makes me feel like i could be useful you know it takes some time but how are you settling in uh varl's been helping me get the lay of the land when he's not getting all tongue-tied i don't know who makes him more nervous that guy a lady or our new utaru friend what about the vanguard aren't you supposed to be back east ordering them around i sent some of them back to meridian with a message i doubt avadle mind me sticking around to help the savior of meridian so you've met our new tanakh friend he's uh quiet i thought his people were supposed to be bloodthirsty maniacs you shouldn't believe everything you hear yeah well i guess if you trust him so do i [Music] so talana came by the base more like rushed through i was hoping she'd stay for a drink at least only karjar i've ever met who's any fun but it seemed like she had more pressing matters to attend to [Music] i guess you know what we're up against by now yeah i'm not gonna lie when varl first told me those bastards come from the stars i thought he'd eaten too many of those medicinal berries yeah but i've gotten used to seeing impossible things thanks to you i just wish they weren't always trying to kill us yeah you and me both i discovered an asura militant group they call themselves the sons of prometheus it looks like they're the ones overriding machines for the tanakh rebels i thought that was something only you could do they're familiar with ancient tech and there is anti-karja as it gets so last year we stopped derval and his cronies from blowing up meridian and retribution for the red raids and now you're telling me we have another group of asaram trying to wipe out the karja with with an army of machines and bloodthirsty tanakh pretty much oh that's just great is there any way you can help me find out who they are anything to track them down and stop them yeah i can send out some messages from chain scrape get in touch with my contacts in the claim see what i can find out i'd appreciate that oh and i'll let you know if i find out anything more about the sons of prometheus the same here are you sure that's what the data says i'm telling you it's a drink but it's soft how is it fun it says here it had bubbles in it well we can't expect to make sense out of everything good door is locked until gaia can restore access welcome back when you're ready please merge ether with me afterwards i must discuss an important matter with you [Music] so what did you want to discuss while you were away i received an unusual transmission on my dedicated aluthia frequency elutia that's one of the sub functions you couldn't detect before yes the transmission occurred so slowly that at first it seemed like an accidental blip of data amongst background static once i noticed this irregularity it took some time to collate the complete message [Music] coordinates where does it lead to a mountain to the northwest of this facility a word of caution it is possible this transmission is genuine it is also possible it is being broadcast by someone or something else you don't think it's actually a lucia i am uncertain what's sos it is an old world code a distress signal a desperate plea for help why would a luthier send a coded transmission on a frequency only the two of you can communicate on i believe it was done as a precaution to avoid detection or at least to create the appearance of the desire to do so i am also uncertain why elutia would expect that i would be able to detect and respond to its distress signal at all as far as it is aware i no longer function okay so either aluthia is in trouble and sent the message hoping you were out there or someone else is trying to get us to go to these coordinates pretending to be a luthier that is my conclusion as well could the zenith be sending the transmission according to the data i reviewed on your focus the zeniths recovered the other gaia root kernel in the hades proving lab it is feasible they used it to gain access to my internal frequencies so maybe they scented thinking you'd respond and reveal your location possibly however the transmission is highly irregular if they intended to provoke me into revealing myself i would expect the communication to be more routine right so maybe it's not them then you said the coordinates lead to a mountain to the northwest what's there i have no record of anything of note in that vicinity okay and what about the other number in the message 237 any idea what that means i have queried my available databases but it does not appear to have any significance perhaps its meaning can only be understood at the indicated coordinates all right i'll go to the coordinates and check out the source of the transmission all by yourself no way i included aaron and varl in this briefing via their focuses i concur that you should not investigate this alone what if it's a trap of course it could be a trap but if it really is elutia then it's in trouble and i need to bring it back don't worry i'll be careful and we're coming with you fine go grab your things we'll wait for you at the west exit in case you need to upgrade your gear i'll check it out when i count gotta go after alluthia aarons and barrel are waiting for me at the west exit hey loy it's good to see you i'm guessing you've got a lot of questions i've been told of our enemy and their intentions your friends showed me to the vision you keep in this place gaia and gave me this focus i don't pretend to fully understand everything but all i really need to know is where to train and when to fight welcome to the team then what are you looking at over there the others have been helping me decipher the symbols the focus shows me so i thought i tried to understand the weapon you intend to use against the enemy this hephaestus it will be able to make machines that answer to gaia yes how many as many as we need such power has the world ever seen the like now that you know who the enemy is do you have any questions i'll admit i find them hard to grasp from the heavens and invulnerable for now i will leave the strategy to you i trust you will point my blade where it will cut the deepest you've had some time with the team now any thoughts i admit i was surprised to see nutaru here farmers don't make for effective soldiers i'm told she rallied some in her tribe against the karja and fought all the way to barren light interesting perhaps i'm mistaken you said the bulwark was your home a long time ago that you were part of the sky clan yes that's all you're gonna tell me fine as you wish my parents were killed in a clan skirmish so i was raised by my squad as i grew older i came to be known as an accomplished fighter decote took a special interest in me i fought by his side against the karja and led my squad on a dangerous climb into the daunt it was i who opened the gates at baron light from the east side allowing the tanakh to raise it that must have gotten you some attention indeed i was welcomed home as a hero i know i was content then why'd you leave i became a marshal why did you leave the sky clan to become a marshal i was sent to the cool root by de golte back then i would have obeyed his every order i believed in him like one would a father i was too blind to see the fear in his eyes fear of a rising young warrior challenging his command of the clan i returned a hero from the battle of baron light but to him i was only a threat never occurred to him but i had no interest in rising above my station why did dakota think you wouldn't be a threat to him if he sent you to the cool route takote knew that if i survived the cool root i'd be forced to forsake the clan to serve the tanakh as a whole i'd never be allowed to challenge his command even if i wanted to after our victory at barren light ticulte spoke to our people said it would be selfish to rob hiccaro and the marshals of a warrior like myself even though he knew perfectly well i had no intention of ever leaving it was exile guist as an honor one he knew i couldn't refuse so i became a marshal and never looked back i'm sorry you had to go through that i am not though it pained me at the time a marshal is what i was destined to be [Music] when we were at the bulwark the guard said something about the wings of the ten hecaro also mentioned it at the cool route deca too what does it mean the visions tell us that the ten flew on great metal machines with wings and lapped into battle from the sky for us to imitate this feat is the ultimate expression of martial prowess and it is why the challengers leap into the arena during the cool route many times i imagined it as a child the feeling of freedom and the awe it must have inspired what did chief accaro say when you told him he'd be joining me here you spilt rebel blood at the grove and helped reunite the clans there was little more to be said he understood well i'm honored he lent me his best marshall at least for a little while indeed i should go feel free to check in on hecaro and your people door's always open here i will i overheard that varl and errand are to accompany you on a mission do you require my assistance i'd rather have you and zoe guard the base while we're away it shall be done may the ten walk with you all right now that that was another one of those subordinates i've been carrying elizabeth's pendant with me for months but since we're gonna stay a while i think i'll keep it here or it'll be safe elizabeth put all of her faith in gaia and the guy i put all of her faith in me if i can do it all recover the subfunctions defeat farzineth heal the world i'd like to think elizabeth would be proud huh looks like someone's rearranged stuff in here companions thought you would appreciate a private space of your own i was thoughtful of them my old spear rust helped me make it and i finished my training feels like so long ago now when vorel found me after the hades proven lab i thought i saw ross i don't think he'd understand any of this or what i have to do but still wish he was here this is the rite of passage that veshav gave me at the embassy i liked him he seemed like a good man i think he was really looking forward to going home when i met hikaro i figured he was just another bloodthirsty warlord but fashion was right the kara wants peace it won't be easy but with his new marshals maybe his vision has a chance [Music] there she is you ready to head out let's go look at us three battle-hardened badasses forging into the unknown this ought to be good uh uh this distress call had to be up a really steep mountain huh [Music] man what is that [Music] what the hell [Music] well that takes the keg marl see if there's anything over there on it we'll check out the battlefield let's start with that zenith well they're obviously more zeniths than we know about can't believe you fought one of them almost didn't make it whatever the rebels did it took down her shield but why was she here i can access her last communication file but i'll use my focus to scan the battlefield too what about that crazy weapon the zenith had it looked like she can make it come and go it will what hello verbena what do you have for me well go do your i checked everywhere still no sign of the asset can we call off this pointless search already let's not forget who let it slip away in the first place now i'd like to see results by nightfall do you think you can manage that hold on i think i see something this snow's coming down heavy gorgeous breath what a mess the specter had instructions to assist recovery of the asset i wonder what this asset is [Music] you done looking around almost one of the sons of prometheus that looks like his focus was sending data on the weapons somewhere else ah my weapon's still hot i need to know how it worked but i'll have to check on it once it's cooled off looks like the rebels camped here for a while are they watching this area all right i think i have an idea what happened here i better get back to errands [Music] yeah it's kind of chilly up here all right she who sees the unseen what did you find out this was a carefully planned attack i found camping gear up there the rebels must have been staking out this place for at least a few days they were waiting for the zenith to show up all so that they could test that weapon the zeniths have a personal shield that makes them invulnerable but somehow the weapon got rid of it the awesome room that was operating it was sending data on it somewhere else it was probably just a prototype i've known tinkers to do that i'll do a little trial run before breaking out the real thing i guess it's still a work in progress if it blew up she was searching for something she lost her drone had instructions to recover something called the asset the asset is that the uh subfunction thing that you said could be here eluthia i'm not sure come on let's go talk to varro that's a long way down something tunneled straight down into the mountain looks recent whatever it was it must have been powerful that zenith the rebels killed was looking for something called the asset i don't know what it is but my guess says it's somewhere down there all right so we head down aaron stay here and stand watch that zenith isn't the only one of its kind i don't want to be caught by surprise if the others show up contact us by focus if you see anything okay any trouble shows up i'll call you let's go there's some kind of old world ruin down here you said the zeniths have their own backup of gaia right yeah from the proving lab so maybe they were after a luthier found its hiding spot so it sent the distress signal maybe looks like some kind of data center i might be able to access the facility systems for that console i've never seen a transmitter like this before looks like it's self-destructed [Music] this was a farciness research lab that looks like a lot of data was being cast from here recently from that device nearby so a luthier's gone if it was ever here then probably but then why were the zenith still searching for the asset let's keep looking around so exploring another far zenith ruin at least this one doesn't seem to have giant killer machines or anything you can blow up my stash later huh all this stuff i wonder what they were doing here well knowing far zenith probably discovering amazing things for their own benefit yeah that sounds about right find anything that might tell us what the asset is i don't think so so [Music] ectogenic chambers like the ones i saw inside a zero dawn cradle facility what were they for remember when i told you i was made not born this is how a machine that makes a person that's incredible this place keeps on going this place is huge some kind of storage room maybe maybe the asset is in here somewhere if it is somehow the zenith couldn't find it let's look around so um how is aaron taking all of this really well send this to my stash focus it's a lot but when i caught up to him in the daunt and said you needed our help he dropped everything and turned around well he's loyal that's for sure uh a control console to access the storage units can it tell us if the asset is in one of them oh let's find out 236 containers in storage please enter the container number you'd like to retrieve 236 wasn't there a number in the distress signal you're right i should check the log [Music] [Music] [Music] aloy it's you [Music] skin's like ice [Music] must have cut this from her head but why [Music] hello elizabeth apologies i don't know what else to call you um my name is veda i'm afraid i must be brief i only have a few minutes before my keepers discover i'm missing and i still need to remove this implant i had hoped to find shelter with you but if you're viewing this i i may be dead be careful when you take on farciness they are ruthless and they have a luthier artemis and apollo now but at least i don't have the
