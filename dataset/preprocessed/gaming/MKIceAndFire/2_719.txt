cool i see what you see no chatter now interface with divine well i got you here mind tell me what we're looking at get a flow map of pacifica they hunt aguero who is they netwatch they always out to focus what are they looking for exactly internal data thoughts if they crush our eyes they take our way in the entire net a return to the dark time of portmos how bad does it look i do not know how much data they pull but their map is not complete they still not have source validation okay so what's on me to do you must reach the agent easy now to find him look at the map he is in cinema step away now this isn't your fight he's gotta be jacked into the van i cannot piece his protection you must find him face him okay so what do i do once i find them i will tell you the eigenman tries to cut you off he is a gate behind the camera i will open it what's going on you have company soon scatter right away that bad huh she must have a weak spot no none of those chair jokes could have zeroed that many from my past no i didn't say that you need to hurry come on you like that ah see what's going on [Applause] do it she's had enough business so invade him we need access to the data clear you must first proceed whoa hey easy what did you do well now we can talk in private just sever the connection to the rest of pacifica gives us a little time just a second ago you tried to flatline me and now you want to talk flatline no just discourage but it looks like i underestimated you okay no more [ __ ] tangents fess up who are you bryce mosley netwatch special agent can we talk had a spectre on you didn't you saw and heard all you did you followed his orders no idea what the voodoo boys are paying you but our pockets are deeper sorry don't work with corpse come on everyone does i bet you have to could verify that right away actually but we don't need any distractions do not interested not a money job for me just needing in with mama brigitte voodoo chef brigitte and her lap dog t neptune have been frozen several days now ever since we shrouded their subnet with ice and you well you were sent here to free them do you know why they didn't tell you everything because you're a random that's what they call outsiders brought in for special jobs floor rags when you're no longer needed they chuck you a fate for all ranions [Music] rather put my trust in the vdb's than you by a mile hey i know we're unpopular in your circles but whenever there's a real problem it's ned watch not pacifica's shady hacker cult that gets the call see that right voodoos know black tech better than anyone so no think i prefer their expertise over yours clever kinda but the wrong choice know why they never answer the call if you're not pacifica born and bred you're nothing to them less than nothing [Music] you have brigitte and how did you manage that when we took the mall we knew the vdb's at semrunners t neptune breached first to see what was going on when we iced him where she dove in after used him to shield herself tough cookie that one but still finds herself stuck got anything to back that claim that the voodoos want to set me up wanna they did it already soon as you handed over your link slipped in the specter and a virus talking as if he was there he's working you so obvious it hurts ask for proof besides i'd know that so then please take a look we're on a system diagnostic fine and nothing out of place no trace of do it again then cross check the result against the first [Music] [Music] identical right because it's not a real scam it's a copy what's your b for the voodoos any idea how many attacks from behind the black wall we neutralized last year one made a guess so you don't know no one in night city knows outside of us and no one wants to know people imagine it as a great border wall a one-time solution to protect humanity forever whereas it's more like a torn open trash bag taped over a busted window and the voodoo boys will not stop poking holes in the [ __ ] thing brigitte and the other one neptune what's their condition tags are active so the vdbs must be keeping them alive from their side but they can't sustain that they cannot which in turn makes brigitte and tea less useful to us tried using their interface to breach the voodoo subnet but brigitte proved stubborn she managed to take some bites out of our systems before we secured her little taste of your own medicine the data collection why would you target pacifica's runners that's the job this is about reservable isn't it can't have an indiana where you aren't welcome to protect and serve huh no such thing as an independent net if the voodoo boys breach the black wall we'll all be [ __ ] one way or the other all right what are you offering a compromise i'll fish the voodoo virus out of your system and i release both brigitte and t-neptu they'll wake up like nothing ever happened not to worry and all you got to do is let us walk with our data thoughts clocks flipping digits i think i'll just stick to my [Music] man [Applause] hey v you all right give me a sec you look just like him a second ago thanks wasn't asking oh what happened the net pig was right voodoos were blowing smoke as soon as you gave them access to the netwatch web they roasted all the agents and you now why is my brain not a pile of hot goo you know you finally grew up there toughed it out not about to let this [ __ ] lie christ hope not [ __ ] cultists made you their kamikaze [ __ ] who'd take a job from us spooky ass voodoo boys plessy took you for pathetic gutter trash someone who no one's ever gonna come looking for so what i should have spilled the truth no we take this to precede saved her sorry ass after all wouldn't mind a quick word with placeed too shouldn't let this lie head to baddies grumpy [ __ ] hope he likes surprises [Music] [Music] you wish to talk to placid is that what you want because i can take you i'll find him sure yes problem hey veterans she the information from okada very valuable i also learned something through my own efforts we must meet will it be this time trash processing plant deserted end cart station in the south japan there is a street market it is on a foot bridge above the main street use the elevators it is easy to get lost i am on my way there do not make me wait oh go let's heat up this [Music] best thing is how you manage this that the other guy you've sent to the gym didn't make it looks like you let loose in the gym with what exactly a virus vectored electromag impulse i saw before my own fuses popped your guys shredding tags in the netwatch agents in moses grid it is called kivalemia he will swallow their light then network agents swallow it it destroyed the greed the bbs's looks like you [ __ ] up what's brigitte make of it all i say we must head under this is not over netwatch will return the hooky will not lead into the creek nothing special you see this guns you have something for me you know about the biochip don't you yes and we must check its condition how much you know for my scans more than classed recognize the biochip because you were looking for it we must examine you if you survived the gym it is at the chip's cost should have thought about that before you tried to kill me if i was here the chip would never be in danger if it is in good condition we offer you a fair price perhaps more for the emotional tone biochip's not for sale you're not ripping it out of me thing was in [ __ ] shape already before i strolled into the gym it does not function not that bad problem is no one i've talked to can yank it out without risk of death seems to commission the things theft figured you might know a way to help how do you know all this how did you find us evelyn parker name ring a bell ah the doll the [ __ ] you found us because she led you to us she has proved not completely useless after all listen can you help me or not yes of course but not here we will go to the crib where you must give us access to the gym once we have the data we need we will do our best to help you seriously i haven't done enough for you already there is no other way to remove it we must first examine it because if you [ __ ] up you're left empty-handed that it i gave my word we will help you [Music] don't think i'm that desperate yet you said no other could help you maybe i got other options i don't know about yet i hope you'll return before your time runs out you
