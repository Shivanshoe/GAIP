[Music] all right chief that was a pretty slick escape i believe you so i'll say this nigel is planning something and i don't think i could stop him on my own if dead sex everything i've heard you'll help me we can help each other there's a chance cass had something to do with the bombings what could he be planning that's worse than that no no that's not like him well not exactly see nigel's got to see himself as the hero he's an arrogant [ __ ] but he's not a cynic every place we go into he we would have some mad plan to fix all these problems with robot police or automated crop fertilizing and some [ __ ] society was a technical problem and people are just bugs in the software you know you work around them or you squash sorry chief i gotta switch proxy server so they don't trace me i'll hit you right back on voice listen i've got an inside man right a contact in albion says nigel's got this big meeting happening at white tower he'll be talking about a major project he's got planned for london what we need is an insider on the team i've always wanted to be in on a caper okay first things first we'll need eyes on the impregnable target so off you go i'll crack on with assembling the right personnel to round out this ragtag bunch of misfits ah [ __ ] i'll be inside with security sniffing my proxy ip must have traced the detonator signal i've got to deal with this [Music] okay jesus we don't even know if we could get in there i like to help fam but i just caught a whiff now before the ctos cameras you'd take him less than five died dean i ain't risking my pretty face we need an albion insider for our caper one who's willing to turn coat i've reached out to a contact who works in a nearby pub where better to find a bleakly disillusioned anti-hero numbing their conscience with drink but secretly desperate for redemption i've let our contact know what we're in the market for and she's nearby oh what lots of good in the world the hey you lot certainly know how to pick your targets you do know that albion have set up their headquarters in there right that's the point nigel cass is pitching some sort of big project that's sure to make life difficult for everyone and we've gotta know what it is so we can learn how to stop it [ __ ] nigel cass you're right nothing good can come of this luckily i hear loads of sob stories working in our pub and near this place quite a few from albion are dissatisfied with the status quo you turn on the charm and i'm sure you can get one to join the good guys even got a candidate in mind interesting let's have their information i love bagley push it along good luck love we're aware of an albion employee who might be approachable so now we have to cause you up to some ibm bastard is that it they're jack-booted thugs who regularly murder civilians if finding a disenchanted employee is really that difficult humanity's much worse off than i thought it would also be quite useful to have someone on the inside for however long that lasts nigel's real good at sniffing out spies personal experience speaking yeah not really in a sharing mood right now fam you look about as sick of this [ __ ] as i am are you with dead tech because i could use your assistance we might be able to help what's the situation my friend has a rare medical condition unfortunately with the nhs in disarray they haven't been able to get treatment in months we were out of options until this time kelly doctor said they'd help for a price i didn't know what else to do so i paid them i'm listening that bastard the drugs worked but it turned out they were addictive the second my friend was hooked the doctor inflated the price that's [ __ ] typical isn't it all right we'll get your friend his medicine you said toy well this quote unquote doctor is a real winner he was struck off the medical register for gross malpractice last year and now he's a freelance mob surgeon nice work if you can get it grand can you track him down i am quite literally always tracking everyone down pushing you as coordinates now [Music] what's up [Music] [Music] what are you doing oh [ __ ] [Music] [Music] the clan kelly doctor you're looking for is close by and he's got hyzer at your laptop with him too that should contain the whereabouts of the drug shipment the demands of being a dedsec operative are all consuming so taking app gigs is a good way to make some extra quid that works around your new schedule lots of people will pay weld have their sensitive packages handled with care and some will even pay you for deliveries

citizens are subject to searches [Music] is [Music] this time we're going to make another [Music] i'm detecting a vehicle nearby with at least two years worth of treatments inside that's more than enough to wean our contacts friend off the treatment grand there's the vehicle with the drugs in it try not to destroy it ah steady oh got the vehicle now what i found a safe location where a friend can pick it up sending you the coordinates now keep them back [Music] oh [Music] everyone all right [Music] you're gonna kill someone watch out [ __ ] did it hit anybody took care of that thing for

worry help me please [Music] [Music] a word of caution now we're inside any disturbance in here and nigel cass will surely cancel his meeting avoid being detected by your former colleagues or this operation is a bust nigel won't have anything important on this floor you're quite knowledgeable about cars aren't you yeah i was albin too if you hadn't tweaked to that me and cass were close once looked up to him he was bigger than life literally a tech genius and i was just a geared kid i wanted to be like him that's why i joined up didn't find out he was a murderous prick until later written
