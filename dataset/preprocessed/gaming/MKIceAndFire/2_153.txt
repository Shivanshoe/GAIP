helheim of all places you all right brother i will do what i must leave me be so [Music] [Music] [Music] athena get out of my head [Music] so [Applause] please ah [Applause] ah so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's nowhere you can hide spartan put as much distance between you and the truth as you want it changes nothing pretend to be everything you are not teacher husband father but there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape cannot change you will always be a monster i know but i am your monster no longer [Music] [Music] all right brother let's see what those blades can do huh on your back wow my yes those blades will serve quite well now i believe i see a door to the realm between realms over there in your own front yard no less take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple then on to helheim yeah [Music] [Music] well i'm pretty sure you weren't talking to me back there anything you'd like to get off your chest brother i can assure you i'm unsurpassed in keeping confidences well you know where to find me and for the record i'd already guessed you were greek athena dead giveaway what hey you wreak your foreign magic sweet manas nethers what are those i've never seen the like that's got to be a family heirloom no nor will it ever be son my brother and me created mjolnir for the big idiot i know from qualities and then them special hmm where's the little turd he just pulled a needle new no what happened acre no the fault is mine and my responsibility to make it right now we all got to take responsibility sometime huh say what can i do to help him i can do things when i should tag along no your work here is enough all right so where are you off to in such a hurry the realm of the dead helheim [ __ ] this is serious i'll be keeping my eye on [Music] [Music] don't worry kids are tough when i was his age i cut my own head clean off and i'm done the worst for wear now that freya has given you the travel room to helheim it should be unlocked on the table and it's done we really are doing this i'll be watching your back let me take this moment to tell you that what you're about to do is absolutely insane not even odin can survive hope those blades work is this the bridge freya spoke of no we're still in the realm travel bridge but after the bridge of the damned the dead use it to cross into their permanent home the city of hellheim the bridge keeper reminds admission he's the one we want just follow this bridge should lead us straight to him you know i'd really hope never to see this place again use the fire of your blades to burn away that hell's bramble blocking the path one of the many reasons we went back for those blades [Applause] [Music] huh oh this is all wrong only the newly dead should be here there's too many the gate must be closed and if the gates close then it's true hells flop without the valkyrie to sort and kill them hell is overwhelmed oh wow [Music] god oh watch your back when we killed the reavers near my home they came here how did they return so quickly time doesn't move the same between all realms especially where the spirit world is concerned like the light of alphine the opposite in fact the lake of souls feels faster than i'll find time but hell is much slower than midgard sorry i'm sure that's confusing if we will be back to my son all the sooner that is good ah aren't you a quick study so oh foreign valhalla is it within hell valhalla is part of asgard only the one they did go there the warriors who die in glorious combat hello and those dead of disease mishap age it is dishonorable to grow old well never too late to go out fighting i suppose look will killing the bridge keeper help the dead lead midgard i don't expect it will no i don't suppose it will make things any worse either it'll be one less obstacle for the living to reach the inner sanctum of helheim who'd be mad enough to go there hmm the bridge of the damned and there's the keeper making sure the dead are really dead what is that he holds that totem contains a powerful source of magical energy the very power of helheim itself and what you want is his heart just take it and we can leave how start some trouble you can do that right god oh [Music] uh uh uh wow ah now the heart brother you'll have to get your hands danty oh [Music] ugh [Music] wow [Music] i have the heart i need nothing more you're set not to linger here though [Music] kratos zeus my father your father was this well that explains a lot what is that place never go there understand how is he here that is not possible it's just an illusion hell's known for torturing its inhabitants with their own past we should focus on getting back to your son huh yeah ain't supposed to be here it's cold real quick give me your blades why yeah i said i'd help you and i aim to come on [Music] all my equipment's in mid cars be right back yeah you don't suppose eat necklace do you yeah now they're ready for the winds of hell just target this magical goalie bit here with your blades and throw so you're welcome and i believe this place is cold enough to freeze a pair of pigeon eggs i sometimes wonder if there was once some sort of accident in his brain we have been away too long yes oh [Music] wow [Music] cool [Applause] sorry brother i'm still stuck in what i heard back there zeus was your father not now we should focus on getting out of hell and with that i cannot argue i'll just contemplate that little nugget in silence then huh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] huh uh [Music] [Music] uh foreign [Music] oh [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hmm [Applause] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] hmm yes so ugh you made it better get home to your boy already say hi to the pimple clap for me when he's better so so we shouldn't delay brother it's straight back to midgard with that heart your father was zeus i finally understand i'm dangling from the hip of the bloody ghost of sparta do not call me that don't mistake me brother from what i heard the pantheon had it coming it's still a bit to take in i knew you hate gods but you really can't stay away from them can you you must say nothing to the boy he must never know paul likes brother respectfully he has to know you'll never be whole without the truth look i get it you hate the gods all gods it's no accident that includes yourself and it includes your boy can you see that he feels that he can't help what he is can't begin to help it because you haven't even told him it's all connected man you will tell him nothing very well hey so you know that shortcut between realms well i made it better or i might have broke it we use that i know what you do so i took a few cuts from them winds of hell and made it so it ain't just one way now you can use it to travel to and from if i didn't breaks it then we can take it to freyja here's an idea brother well you gentlemen certainly know how to get around [Music] well this isn't right yeah but close enough he did say they were kinks we must hurry the heart you have it yes [Music] back of your hand [Music] he's too ill i can break the fever but to heal he must know the truth of what he is yes it is not so simple help me prop him up did i tell you that i have a son too it's been forever since i last saw him at his birth the runes foretold the needless death the babe in my arms was so small so helpless i knew right then i would do anything to protect him [Music] no matter the sacrifice of course everything i did i did for myself i let my needs my fears come before what he needed and i couldn't see his resentment until it was too late don't make the same mistake have faith in him i know the truth isn't simple but nothing is when it involves your child it is a curse the boy has been cursed don't leave without me i will not [Music] i'm better now i see that is he well enough to travel for now it won't happen again i promise you see that it does not prayer i will not forget this thanks your father did the heavy lifting you should stay recover you have done enough you know my door is always open to you that's venom isn't it you figured that out did you well the window looks like by frost crystal and i know that's not what's on the other side of the wall and well it makes you sad you are wise for one so young yes this is a window to a home i left long ago but it is only a few i think that happened to you an alphon you can't leave big guard can you a gift from my former husband upon our separation why would odin trap you in midgard petty cruelty would be reason enough for him but as with all his rash decisions he's driven by fear the van near were the greatest threat to the acer until our marriage broke her to peace many of the vanier now think i betrayed them the fruits of my sacrifice to be hated by my own kind to trap me here is to ensure i can never make it right um someone was wondering why do you live under a turtle he was my first friend here in midgard he offered me shelter and in return i provide him with protection against the evils of the forest holden boar giant turtle you sure have some interesting friends now then before modi so rudely interrupted us we were just about to explore tears vault yes to find the black rune boy do you know the way from here oh i don't know sure you do lad we need a boat i don't know i guess we need a boat okay then ugh [Applause] oh i don't think anything can get through all that he'll ramble huh [Applause] [Applause] uh uh [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] yep ah see the boat washed ashore someone did call assessment earlier nope still kinked get in i will pull you are quiet are you not better guess i know you overheard my talk with freya you think you understand but you do not why do you say nothing you said i was cursed you think i'm weak because i'm not like you i know i was never what you wanted but after all this i thought maybe things were different you do not know everything boy no but at least i know the truth now the truth the truth [Music] i'm a god boy from another land far from here when i came to these shores i chose to live as a man but the truth is i was born a god and so were you boy have you nothing to say um can i turn into an animal can you turn into an animal [Music] no [Music] no i do not think so i'm a god mother knew she was a god too no she was mortal but she knew my true nature i'm a god why did you wait so long to tell me i had hoped to spare you being a god it can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy that is the curse what sorts of things can i do can i fly turn invisible i don't feel like god i do not know the reach of your godhood but over time you will learn you sure i can't turn into a wolf you are welcome to surprise me is this why i hear voices sometimes are you sure you've never heard any not as you do that's no surprise every god is unique so maybe i won't get strong like father but i'll have abilities on my own you already do laddie your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young time alone will tell what else you'll become capable of so you knew all along i did lad but i've known more than my share of gods me too apparently i wonder who else knew i was a god prayer for sure concentric they do not need to know calder does he know is that why he's after us do you know him from before the day of your mother's funeral was the first i ever saw balder that is the truth hey we don't have to go right back to chairs well really i mean we're gone we can do whatever we want right what do you really feel like doing right now i will show you right there [Music] done [Music] oh [Music] hmm uh [Music] prepare yourself [Music] look here another this one is a frost giant game correct a cunning one as well is that me on you did he kill thor's hammer hi a lot of these seem to end before killing them imagine that [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] another name it's the name of one of the valkyries that's quite curious hey if i'm a god maybe i can fly no no god's two must stay on the path i promise you so what do you think my mirror what does baldr want with us well let's look at what we know walder is odin's finest tracker bar none if he wants you you have to consider the possibility that odin wants you and as for what odin wants on this i have some expertise what could we have that odin doesn't he's like the king of gods of the acli but his reach is not unlimited and where he cannot reach he is preoccupied with going he certainly tortured me enough about it over the years one more thing we can translate those knee flying rooms let's try this again without interruptions here we go again read it death itself i swallow to spring forth life tomorrow oh i like that one i wonder if i wrote it is that the answer there it says earth hmm swallows death brings forth life go yeah i wish i had known i was a god and alphon i wouldn't have felt so bad about killing somebody else well i'm not sure that's the lesson you've done nothing to regret the elves forced their affairs upon us no i get it now we had god things today and they were on the way dragging us into their little problems again are we just leaving that there i mean just knowing we're gods makes me feel so much stronger maybe you feel a little too good right now with power comes a big choice lad you can either serve yourself or put your godhood in the service of others like tyr did people really loved him huh i the god of war but one who fought for peace had a reputation for being heroic and lawful using his power and knowledge to stop wars rather than start them so there are good gods once in a moon it's been known to happen yes this one mentions places i've never heard of seems tyr really liked to travel dear believed the mind not might was key to preventing war and chaos and he also knew visiting other cultures would give him perspective staying in one place could not while odin always hoarded knowledge guarding it jealously tyr was open and sharing with his learning and his wisdom for this mortals adored tyr showing their love by bringing him gifts the world over so whatever happened to deer odin came to regard him as a threat to his rule he suspected tyr of collaborating to aid the giants instead of helping to steal their secrets for the asia same thing he accused me of frankly though in tears case i believe he was right you think cheer was helping the giants i do he felt responsible for the suffering visited upon them by odin i suspect he had something to do with helping them cover their tracks they're missing your hometown correct whatever happened to it i believe it could only have been done with tyr and the giants working together [Music] [Music] where is this black roof oh no i've never been in here the stone that has to be naturally i didn't think it would be that easy no it's kind of open though so what now rather a trap for the winds of hell but where do you think the winds are the ones of what oh we forgot to mention that when you were sick we went to hellhound to get your cure you did terrible experience by the by your dad picked up a new trick though with a little help from brock brock was there too i but we'll get back ah a skiing dew from my homeland used to have watermelon back in the day you should take it boy yes boy take it we might need to butter bread somewhere in our travels this is why no one likes you move it or you may lose it brother well that's unfriendly look small passages on either side perfect for the boy it's too small for father though go i will be fine careful brother there's not here to bring you back uh [Music] wow look at that so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what'd you find enough distraction do not forget why we are here okay [Music] that's from a great desert land very far from here the gods live there oh my yes many many gods good or bad and not as simple as that i'm afraid ah uh thank you [Music] yes [Music] uh [Music] what did you see in that vault that set you up it is not important it seemed important to you it was a rash impulse you need not dwell on my failings wow that was almost an apology well i guess you do like to smash pottery look i just want to know the truth now okay i don't care if it hurts me or not i want to learn just because you hate being a god doesn't mean i have to more small i can't passages brother good luck and i thought those saws were scary look it's the wolf giants skull and hearty that's right the bringers of day and night ragnarok begins when they catch the sun and moon right i don't know like them well enough to cover a massive wall in his boat with them though don't you enjoy it at all being a god on an adventure in some amazing place maybe your mother wanted us to have a little fun everything we've seen and done maybe it was her gift uh oh good keep it up it is over one of these thought is faster perhaps this isn't about speed at all is that someplace else the winds can go you know for someone so loved here sure was paranoid ah thanks to odin with good reason look there's the track ah clever uh the road stop it's lower bull chains on the wall but there are three of them what do i do adrease focus you can do this please honey i don't know yet to [ __ ] drown okay thanks party's the silver one he hunts they have to eat them these are out of order good boy so the moon goes on the left side on the right with midgard in the middle but which bar do i pull middle bar the left the right boy love the middle right wait i love you boy you have to stop that chain ow i i do not know [Music] wait i know what to do a knife there's no other way [Music] [Music] a knife i know but it saved you that was cunning boy the road's free i think we did it all right let's go see what tier's got for us oh no raised protection it rubbed off what should we do we keep going there it is we've got it boy on the day you were born i made two knives mixing metals from my home and from this land one for myself and when you were ready one for you today is that day [Music] so i'm a man like you no we are not men we are more than that the responsibility is far greater and you must be better than me understand say it or you will be better the power of this weapon any weapon comes from here but only when tempered by this by discipline the self-control of the one who wields it that is where the true strength of a warrior lies you must never forget them good then come on blank wait did you see it yes are you certain i got it trust me good day aim for the face bye [Music] [Music] but no match for us gods yeah i'm turned around which way is the sandball back up hmm room uh uh god oh we're so close to the end sit wine the island of alumnus near the place of my birth lamb knows do a journey's end really smells like rotten eggs is it still good possibly ugh father why did you leave your home and come here does it have to do with the other gods there it's just you hate the god so much but tear proves that gods can be good and you're good you only killed those deserving right [Music] yes ah but who's worthy enough to judge quiet head we are we know better uh-huh sounding more like your da by the moment ready ready come i think i'm gonna like being a god [Music] we do what we want and now we're gonna go see the giants hi having learned that travel room to yottenheim we can now head back to the gateway on top of the peak and put that magic chisel to good use nobody's getting our way this time come on hey look who's back up and about didn't i tell you it'd be fine [Music] son let me be shorty i'm sure you'll grow into it what else something for the boy you hitting the road or chewing the fat look don't be mad but i've seen those blades of yours before they were under the house when i was hiding is that why you never let me down there where did they come from they are my burden from a life that is behind me well they're in my life too and i'd like to hear that story those days are dead to relive them is needless how can i be needless if it's the truth one day you will understand i'll take your word for it so odin wants to go where he can't reach are you saying he's trying to get to your time too hi it ranks among his foremost obsessions but that doesn't make any sense my mirror oh when did i stop making sense you're saying balder tracked us down to find the way to yoda but that was before we knew yodenheim is where we needed to go that's crazy except for one thing you are headed for your night so he was right i'm so confused well then clearly you've been listening petraeus to me okay there sure is a lot to see here [Music] uh where to next think before you act are we prepared to face such a powerful foe i'm ready if you are i see him here if that counts for anything [Music] [Music] all right [Music] uh my god [Music] [Applause] uh gonna be all right uh um [Music] thank you for releasing my physical form i have only gratitude why are you trapped i am uncertain my mind still fragmented the rockstar it is the last thing i remember the what valhalla awaits i must return [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a council chamber of sorts hidden away in midgard the valkyries would often need a place to confer outside of odin's prying eyes they thought themselves properly concealed but the all father sees all so the saying goes where is it we weren't far from it on our way to plummer's chisel the entrance is to the left of the two oarsmen statues you failed to mention this at the time didn't think we'd be hunting down valkyries at the time brother think we'll find out why the valkyries are like this that chamber held a special significance for them we'll find something there i'm certain of it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so uh okay tell me again how old knew we were going to yoda9 before we did odin is extremely clever you see nearly as clever as he thinks he is and he's a collector of prophecies if it's about the future he adds it to his collection helps him style himself as all-seeing and all-knowing but of course the idea is control control of the future control of his fate he control every realm of every land in every world if he could every potential pocket of resistance he seeks to eliminate even if you've never posed a threat before he may think one day you might so you see it's not important how he knew before you did it's important that he was right whoa what's got you all bum-fuzzled over there get going oh almost forgot brock this is our new friend mimir we've met oh why didn't you say so he knows why i know why you know why wyatt no more of this know what i'm sorry i brought it up can't you and syndra just patch things up whatever happened couldn't be all that bad your family now don't be lecturing me about family ain't the one what forgot what our name stood for what we made the weapons we made were legendary across nine realms for more years than i can count you just don't throw that away on account of one bed one bad what your one bad nothing ain't you got somewhere to be come on in then so much for peace and quiet you hitting the road or chewing the fat oh i'm gonna tell syndra i'm a god i'm glad to see the look on his face no i may have kept your secret too long but now you will keep our secret huh i still can't read these [Music] [Music] right behind you what's the poison [Music] [Applause] oh why should we hide what we are secrets are on this way shouldn't we be open like tear tear kept secrets too for good reasons to protect people it is wiser to be discreet that doesn't mean you should lie to your friends or your family i'm sure sundry would understand and do the same lad don't fret so what excited to finally see the land of the giants yeah but also sad the journey's almost over oh what if we get to odenheim and there aren't any giants there either makes little difference to us fulfilling your mother's wish is what is important ah oh don't go anywhere be with you in two shakes father can i tell him no tell me what did you put this wheel in your mouth oh god i'll vomit i'm not kidding i'll throw up on it it is nothing a family matter oh oh i can tell you a thing or two about family matters let me guess your brother isn't as talented as you and his work is junk um those things are accurate your point it's all you ever talk about over and do something about it we're shut up right i see yeah we're sick of hearing about little people's little problems um all right that hurt a little let's have a look at your gear then can't guarantee you'll like my work today [Music] [Music] oh oh um they thought that was gonna stop us okay which way up whoa so broken again you know i'm starting to question cinder's skill maybe brock was right all along [Music] huh why did you speak to the dwarf like that aren't you sick of hearing about him and his brother of course but it serves nothing to make an enemy of him he should know the truth even if it hurts it was needless and unkind truth is more important than kindness your mother would disagree she wasn't a god ah why don't you let me carry her up from here no no you're almost there you know i can handle it can you after the way you spoke of her i questioned that you shall not dishonor her fine care yourself [Music] uh wow i mean he knew all along that we were gods i come up with a story about odin trying to follow us before we get there isn't it a lot simpler if they want us dead because we're gods and they think we're a threat i suppose we can't rule attack but odin's ways are subtle his purpose is uh [Applause] [Applause] is uh you and mother always said all gods were evil but we're not peter wasn't praying neither the acer gods that's who's evil and you know what odin's right we are a threat because we know what they are and we know we can beat them well not all of them not yet magni did his worst he's dead they're no better than us and they're gonna be sorry they picked this fight thought blame me me for what you did to magnet my own father called me a cop [Music] looks like he did more than that move it world pick up where he left off i'll kill you no he is beaten not worth killing he should pay for what he said about mother i said no but we're gods we can do whatever we want [Laughter] that's what i said to your mother right before i gave it to her what are you doing this is a much better knife than mothers you killed against my wishes you lost control haven't you been teaching me to kill i've been teaching you to survive we are guards boy and that makes us a target from now until the end of days you are marked so i teach you to kill yes but in defense of yourself never has an indulgence nobody cared about him anyways what's the difference there are consequences to killing a god why how do you know how do you know watch your tone boy whatever oh go keep your wits about you boy if modi found us balder cannot be far good i have a few words for him too no you do not you will leave him to me so you can kill him because that's what we do to our enemies right because he'd do the same to us i will do only what is necessary and i'll help no oh oh oh yeah this room we need a new way up oh have you forgotten your training oh are you talking to me i thought you didn't like my tongue huh ah wow i can't learn if you won't teach me you do not heed my lessons i've done everything you asked and all i wanted was the truth where did you get your fireballs why did you hide them you said there are consequences to killing the god you use the blades to kill one who else did you kill before maggie how many do you hear me i heard you and these are not subjects for discussion do not push me boy fine come here guess what i know everything i need to know now i have nothing else to learn congratulations oh boy whatever ah wow [Music] [Music] [Music] what does this say it says don't wake him whatever we've killed everything else in this mountain who else wants a taste right see what you get [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] brothers be warned the tunnels i'm seeing in the walls up here show signs of recent dragon activity we already killed that dragon don't do that look here whatever [Music] whatever come on this will be easy not yet there you go good oh uh whatever good [Music] oh [Music] [Music] whatever [Music] huh guess i'll stop what i'm busy with now can't guarantee you'll like my work today i'm glad my expensive tools and stuff can help oh i'm glad i'm still useful to you it's almost like having a thick skin good advice hmm oh [Music] huh [Music] ugh uh come on youtube the silence is getting unnerving don't worry about it we're focusing so um [Music] nearly there now finally boy the room carve along that [Music] wow yo we made it [Music] beautiful isn't it why i remember once bubba lookers [Music] really turns out the boys no you broke the gate that was the only way to unite stupid [ __ ] [Music] get out of here boy yes by all means junior run away let daddy do all the heavy lifting for you let's go calm down boy you are not

[Music] my god [Music] i will break your [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] [Music] [Music] uh who's activated the bridge hey i asked you a question it's locked in and when the bridge opens the full world of ascot will come crashing down on you it's over [Applause] no listen to me let me out let go of it now or i will kill him you know i will what did you do [Music] boy i'm here stay still you will listen to me and not speak a word i am your father and you boy are not yourself you are too quick to temper you are rash insubordinate and out of control this will not stand you will honor your mother and abandon this path you have chosen it is not too late this discussion is far from over we are here because of you boy never forget that wow it's cold this is hell not just hell worst place in hell you could have put us i see a ship get us there it only takes us halfway to tears temple but at least it gets us far from here for a thousand mortal lifetimes the bridge keeper kept the living out of this place but now that you've ripped his heart out here we are funny how it all comes around you should pay for what he said boy that wasn't me right uh [Music] was me [Music] that's what i said to your [Music] do not dwell on those thoughts not here we must keep moving yeah [Music] hey what was that not just the old and sick come to helheim so do the criminals hell must not draw a distinction between us and those whom these visions are meant to torture how do we stop it escape hell as soon as possible i'm not gonna let it bother me like you said ramire it was just an illusion i wasn't there no but it is who you have become a plate i know i got us into it but i'll get us out i will get us out you will follow orders but maybe that's not who i am it had better be now let me focus let me think uh green ugh [Music] uh robots i would never [Music] this room [Music] feasting drinking women it's all god you've never got to feel pain again death has no power over you now you would

such a thing a secret there's the boat we will speak more of this soon [Applause] oh [Music] such chaos i will have much to do after i kill you we must hurry oh whew huh oh uh uh not entirely sure this is sea level give me space to work you have done enough the stairs just bear in mind this boat can only take us part of the way tears temple is near the top of a tremendous waterfall which sadly we are downstream that means even if we get there intact we'd still need to sail up a waterfall somehow the vineyard built the greatest ship that ever was and it can fly excuse me yeah because it was designed to fly this was not nevertheless this is the boat we have on perhaps the biggest iceberg i've ever seen at least the fire's making me what now i'm trying not to be impatient let your father think so now the sales are loose just watch but how they gonna catch the wind we're floating the heat from the fire we're actually floating and we're stuck again not for long stay with a boat i can't believe it you just made a huge skylander go our ships lodged on this bridge sure i can't help i said stay on the boat this ship stuck on this bridge over here huh hmm wait for me there is we need to talk brother you do realize it's over don't you even if we make it back to midgard you and boulder destroyed the only gate to jottenheim we are out of options and that boy up there there's nine kinds of pain his head's turned so far around petraeus is not your concern well he might become everyone's concern if you don't do something you don't have to be the smartest man in the world to see that atreus i can help together now we did it we're free we are going to get out of here face me father it is time to end this here's my son it is time no it's that voice again do you know who that is i do not know hold on huh right putting out the firewood [Music] i will free up uh [Music] [Music] great how long before we reach the temple yeah it's freezing as long as we maintain this speed and those fires don't go out we should be there in no time lads uh guys we're gonna hit that bridge uh [Music] i'm not ready oh how's the fire staying lit can you believe magic or those blades [Music] wow uh hmm we need to lose that oh it is time my son look around at what you have done um [Music] [Music] uh come on we gotta go you saw there's no time look i have a plan jump [Music] [Music] that was your plan you're both tracked we are leaving this realm now as long as we didn't wrap our way back i think this is where odin brought all his best clues about yodenhan [Music] foreign uh what is this place this is odin's i'd recognize his atrocious taste anywhere look at that it's the missing panel about here one must have stolen it but why he always has his reasons might i have a look [Music] well this is most unexpected why what does it mean we're having the foggiest isn't that unexpected clearly that tear traveling somehow perhaps magically but what's that to do with the giants that they should avoid a shrine to it i'm afraid that is none too clear what are those rooms in the corners not runes symbols from different lands they mean or i how do you this one i know too well oh his eyes they are jewels like yours no doubt signifying the gift of sight the giants granted us give me a closer look [Music] interesting [Music] very interesting what is that secret plans concealed by tears so none could access by him and those few others the giants trusted and right under odin's nose i did promise i'll get you to jungheim what do you mean head you said we were out of options don't you see brother odin never gave up hope and neither should we he knew there was a clue in here but we are the ones who found it these plans are for a key to some chamber tears kept hidden i don't know where it's leading or what we'll find but it's a path how do we make this key i suggest we ask a dwarf that symbol on the temple door it's a bunch of rooms together peace unity hope other things too tia's own design he made this door himself boy before when you saw i didn't see anything you did not see me with someone an old man what old man can we go yes very well all right let's get back to midgard and see about making that key where's that dwarf now head why did you not tell us baldur is the son of freya he is it's shocking every time i hear it and yet obviously i know it when i think about bolder and freer the mayor yes lad freya how's that brother hey tell me baldur's vulnerability balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical wait what is happening he is bewitched not to speak of what he knows i am i am oh that's it precisely i wonder how long that's been sold since she had my head at her mercy but back when i figured out baldur's weakness guess what you just said you figured out baldr's weakness did i but baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical enough this means there is a way if he troubles us again we will find it can you make it is it a weapon armor or likewise an instrument of war of which i'm a master at chapin no then forget it even if i wanted to make such an insignificant google i'm liable to change my tools working on something so delicate and ladylike then shingle it how to weld the item with scaps like keep the layers thin alternate the overlay okay smart guy and where do you propose to find a lump of quality scalp slag last time i saw one i could still get ridgid down south shut your mouth is that where did you i had to get my hands dirty [Laughter] well don't just stand there let's do this what you you're fine with working on something that's not a weapon oh hell why not what i can grow too watch the spine keep your wrists loose don't you keep your wrists loose yeah i need more heat here coming up you gonna temper that steel longer you don't need to i triple quenched it with drago see how inventive and sanitary you clever little beaver never too late to learn a new trick is it no it's not yeah here it is nope don't forget this no quit your grinning it's downright unsettling it's just nice to see you together but now the ruin on your brand looks different yeah impressive reforging something what broke i knew it you two love each other i'll cut it out princess you're gonna get me all wheat i like the new one better don't you we have work to do [Music] no what's got you all bum fuzzled over there get going something else we can do for you no just glad you guys worked it out ah well i could say the same to you i guess i was getting a bit full of myself i told him what he needed to hear how's it sounds to me just the same i'm sorry for how i spoke to you sendri you forgive me already have like you said it all worked out now let us get back to work before i get sentimental so what'd you find out there [Music] bring those banks so i got plans [Music] [Music] now we just need to figure out what door this key opens it has to be somewhere around the temple so tears roon this is it we're inside but what is this place your guess is as good as mine the tree we're underneath the realm travel room but why is the floor on the ceiling those realm doors seem to mirror the ones above up there dear use the same magic to protect the black rune the clue we seek may be inside huh right next to the yodan door interesting can we reach it not from here what's behind there well one in our sanctum within another looks like more giant whatever tier did for them must have been big whoa who are they boy this is the room for your night that's right and look we're on the other side of the door the upside down door what are you thinking stand back okay it's moving what's moving extraordinary the whole room is built on some kind of axle there's chains on both sides without those we can flip the temple oh what now oh things are happening [Music] okay i don't think they're attacking boy on the statues it says hmm ominous go on read before the first after the last nothing between no shadow cast are you quite sure flipping the temple is the only way to reach them whatever it is you said there would be a path the temple can be flipped therefore we've put the temple the logic is on this hill not sure what happens when we recklessly append a room that's rooted to eight other realms i'm curious of course but it's a leap to imagine it gets us to your knife i don't mind a lead well who knows perhaps you and dear are the same kind of mad an army of statues i don't think they're the kind that come to life if that's what you're worried about dear often said that in the world of pc envisioned the only soldiers in need would be statues that's his heart but the bugger did take himself rather seriously didn't he there where the chains meet we must find a way around another one here it says his name is i think mother said he was the king of the giants i that he was and quite a bit more looks like he had a lot of kids that little brother is what we call an understatement he's dead but nobody killed him do giants die from old age they may though it's rare among the legends again with the death traps i'd have thought brother why don't you let the lad carry me for a while and let you miss this no you're enjoying this aren't you [ __ ] we made it time to do what you do brother until gods grow good could be no they're just waiting for us i'm not ready oh uh yeah that was tough me [Music] [Music] here we go go come the other chain waits ah it's the other kind variety is so important right i truly i can't believe we're so close i for one never doubted right leave them in peace obviously not referring to us oh uh [Music] luckily ah light up on your side [Music] yes uh [Music] hey boy yes sir time to flip the temple yes sir just agreed to stop saying split to the temple it's starting to sound normal you brothers i know what i promised but in case this doesn't work just remember tyr had good cause to create these obstacles he's kept jottenheim out of odin's reach but the world is hardly at peace no but it's got hope we're all working together now we have unity that's what the rune on the door to this place was telling us we're on tears path lift with your legs brother he knows just trying to be helpful [Music] standing on the day that brute force is the answer i'll be quite happy to be on your side brother and we're not dead that support see that mimir nobody could do all this alone all these obstacles they're just chances to prove are the ones who can beat them we may argue me and father you and freya brock and cindy but when we all work together we do make a good team and that's tears test that's why we're going to make it deodorant do you hear that brother lads found his equilibrium what's that mean he means you speak wisely atreus and that is good to hear huh i guess the temple was made to be flipped look the tree's upside down or are we i'm not sure anymore boy your knife well what have we got some sort of travel stone let me see great outdoor lazarus that's the unity stone you know it i wasn't sure it existed if tear possessed this that explains how he could visit all the realms and other lands to boot he held this in the panel in owens library yes yes that's it i understand now it shows tyr walking the realm between realms you know how you must never stray from the path well tyr always followed his own path if you catch my meaning the realm between realms you're saying tear shrines show them stepping off the branch of the world and you're thinking to reach the secret path to your non that's what we need to do i am oh dear that is what you're thinking isn't it what's got you all bum fuzzled over there get going sure i'm open [Music] anything else for you well see you next time you need something [Music] [Music] if you're thinking about howling us all into the void i hope you're quite sure wasn't your idea find your own path right bollocks this is where tears stepped beyond and the unity stone protected him ready ready well this is it lads it's been an honor our faith head this is incredible oh how can i be so nauseous without a stomach come on that was great look the tower i knew there was something down here amazing how do you hide something that exists in all realms cast it out of any realm to the space between clever old tear is jodenham on the other side can't be that it's not like you go through vanaheim to reach the midgard peak but how do we use it i'd suggest we look inside but stay alert tears little challenges are never as simple as they appear i have noticed well this is sparse the pedestal oh no it took the stone tower it's absorbing the stone's energy something's happening is it moving it's moving it knows what to do the stone served its purpose we're fulfilling to your spell what happens now no idea brother but after that fall i'm sure we're past the worst of it oh no this is considerably worse [Applause] oh yes not a fan oh wow that's over right [Music] yes hmm that was tough where do you think it's taking us next i do not know oh no we're back in hell oh dear here they come [ __ ] this up boy [Music] uh huh surely that's enough of that [Music] this won't be good [Music] oh is oh you stop i think it's over hi but where are we look we're back in midgard there's the bridge we did it the tower's back where it belongs now tears travel room can take us to yotenheim how did you do this odin suspected the giant secretly possessed some remnant of primordial jutenar creative essence the stuff all realms are made of the unity stone must have been fashioned from that essence to trust an outsider with an even tear tells you just how desperate they were and look now we can finally light all the braziers and see what happens another name another valkyrie that's no coincidence but who'd have etched them on tears braziers huh you fellas sure love to make a racket don't you i don't know what we'll find when we get to your nine but we must cover our tracks odin's ravens will tell him of the tower's restoration and we mustn't let our efforts be to his benefit very well this is it here we go hold on wait a minute this isn't going to work what there's no travel crystal gear must have used his own eyes to reflect the energy it was his final fantasy and i won who didn't what don't mother i precisely to keep me from traveling sorry lads thought that would work what did odin do with your other eye you'd have kept it in any of a hundred places i'm afraid we've come so far there has to be a way look a bit of a long shot but for years i've ceased injury sometimes brought looking around in that mountain when odin came for his visits maybe they know something rocket's injury hey guys question for you anyone know where we can find my mirror's other eye oh yeah yeah that's yeah i'm sorry as a matter of fact odin asked me to ho he wanted me to build a hulk he showed it to me you see and i oh the coin sorry will you excuse me well that was useless you know it was about that same time that odin came around looking for me to build a statue with some sort of hidden compartment now that not being a weapon in the ace here being a bunch of box speckled cockers i too saw fit to decline but i know we got it built just the same oh what was the statue it said one of thor out there flashing his sack to the lake the statue that the serpent ate sorry about that feeling much better how are we supposed to look inside the snake inside we'd better go see what the world serpent has to say about that well lads i don't know what lies ahead but now would be a good time to make sure your gear is ready what's more to the horn wow [Music] oh [Music] what's the statue lost to us ah he thinks it might still be in his stomach um and he's open to letting you go into his mouth to look inside ew really by the by he's no wild about it either so are we really doing this letting the serpent swallow you do not have to come well i'm not gonna miss this oh you sure this is a good idea no well brothers i've been to many strange places but this will be a new one i've never been in this guy's belly either how about you father never one that was not trying to eat me usually should expect that sort of response at this point here we go funny i used to dream about getting eaten dreams are nothing i'm not afraid it just reminded me of a way i used to feel when i was a child let's find that statue ah smells not as bad as i thought it'd be a bit like heather ale fermenting rather pleasant actually you're so weird the water kind of burns in here that is water isn't it all right there the hammer hey yeah over there go any idea where odin hid your eye no it's not like i can still see through it yep that's an eye maybe you should stick that in my head for safekeeping gently now gently thank you brother you don't miss depth until it's gone [Music] how's that feeling well i wouldn't say i'm feeling whole again but it's a right improvement the by frost is intact it'll serve then we have all we need finally we're going to unite there's no stopping us now laddie have you ever heard the town tempting feet so how do we get back out what's going on well that was mildly terrifying maybe our presence is upsetting yourmangander's belly no something is wrong nothing good glad that's over is he getting hit what is that we must hurry couldn't agree more brother hold tight and watch your balance the board shifting i'm gonna [Music] boy boy i'm good i'm getting kind of used to this what happened to him something we did no something else a dead giant why would the serpent leave us here look freya we can still trust her right until we know for certain keep a distance the world serpent what's happened here we hoped you would know you are far from home i'm looking for my son the two of you you helped me see things more clearly you do not know where he is then no but the woods and fields speak his name i know he walks here in midgard when you see him last long ago before you were even born why are you standing so far from me what's wrong something's happened there [Music] i had a feeling hurting the big snake would bring the two of you out in the open do you have any idea any idea at all what you have cost me my boy mother [Music] i'm here don't run away oh i'm not going anywhere mother i know that you're still angry i know that how you feel hasn't changed but i i want you how i feel how i feel i've spent the last 100 years dreaming of this moment i rehearsed everything i ever wanted to say to you every word to make you understand exactly what you stole from me but now i realize i don't need you to understand anything i don't need you at all back off cradles this has nothing to do this path you walk vengeance you will find no peace i know you i'll deal with you later but family first [Music] this again [Music] stop fighting oh oh you might want to turn away boy this won't be pretty i won't let you hurt him no boy fine stop no betray us you're bleeding breathe boy not breathe blood what is that i can feel this i can feel everything [Music] he's vulnerable now you will not do this what's going on is freya trying to kill us no do you hear the wind we in the quiver strap yes mistletoe harmed him freya said it was wicked he's more than harmed the spell is broken he can be killed i'm certain of it it's all coming back now now he remembers she controlling that thing stay out of it i can reason with him no woman you cannot he needs to kill you you can't stop me no one can where is he i don't care if he kills me i will protect him i will not let him die i'll touch it this will all be over soon oh i feel crazy [Music] oh weak mother [Music] [Music] uh [Music] boy crystal dress address and i'm doing wonderful i've never felt so alive incredible [Music] uh ugh more more i'll kill you [Music] stay away from my son you don't have to do this there stop him [Music] there has been enough pain shut up oh yes [Music] [Music] [Music] before you die i want to thank both of you you've done what even the all father himself could not i've never felt more alive ironic isn't it what [Music] me [Music] yes oh ugh [Music] well done boy stop please he's being father not a threat you will not come for us again you will not touch her i don't need your protection [Music] help yourself can you mother [Music] no matter what what i do or say you won't it won't stop interfering i was just trying to protect you i've made mistakes i know but you're free now you have what you want try to find forgiveness we can build something new [Music] you still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me i have paid i have paid [Music] but if that alone will make you whole [Music] if seeing me dead will make things right i won't stop you [Music] in milk [Music] [Music] i love you [Music] why why do you even care you than this [Music] [Applause] [Music] no no no no no my boy my dear sweet boy [Music] freya he chose this i will rain down every agony every violation imaginable upon you i will parade your cold body from every corner of every realm and feed your soul to the vilest filth in hell that is my promise he saved your life he rubs me off everything is everything you are just an animal passing on your cruelty and rage you will never change and you do not know me i know enough does he [Music] boy listen close i'm from a land called sparta i made a deal with the god that cost me my soul i killed many who were deserving and many who were not [Music] i killed my father that was your father in hell is this what it is to be a god is this that always ends sun's killing their mothers their fathers no we will be the gods we choose to be not those who have been who i was is not who you be we must be better [Music] well guess we are the bad guys now in her eyes yes but she could never make that choice we should finish this journey while i still have strength i don't understand i know saving her was the right thing she seemed all evil at the end not evil you killed her son lad her son the death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily but he was gonna kill her she would have died to see him live only a parrot can understand so you'd let me kill you if it meant you would live yes look there was no easy choice for anybody brother but i think we can all agree you did the right thing the world's a better place with freya in it just give her time lads she'll come around back to tears temple then one last time i yachtenheim awaits odin must have convinced him that following you to yacht 9 would bring his cure lies i'm sure why did mistletoe break the spell bunny or magic is powerful but its rules are slippery and elusive i'm sure it makes sense if you're a witch oh but it's also bloody tragic balder was the greatest gift odin granted freya the one thing she treasured from their marriage she only hoped to spare him pain and spare herself loss but such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions what's got you all bum-fuzzled over there get going here we go i can't believe we're gonna see the giants well if things work according to the plan go ahead and lock in yachting time and we'll be on our way probably boy ahead get ready oh right got god let's hope this doesn't cause you to explode or anything oh i hadn't considered that maybe we should talk about this a bit more nah i'm sure you'll be fine ready that's unpleasant now boy we must be close well what are we waiting for think it's far we will see i want please before we continue listen the last thing you two need up there's a decomposing heat ruin in the moment but i'll wait for you here this is between you and the boy true but if someone were to fight my lady sips soft perfect slushers you done did it sorry we had to see this oh no no no no no no no fine damn it fine watch the head till we return i can do this no no i can't oh okay ready come yourself [Music] look we're on the giants fingers i can see the highest peak ahead right over there we did it [Music] we did [Music] so [Music] what are you doing [Music] i have nothing more to hide [Music] can we go now we're so close boy [Music] [Music] carry her [Music] so hmm boy it's nothing i just thought i'd hear voices by now hello anybody here what is this place they must have all come through here when they left midgard what was left of them why carve all these faces what if this is all the giants that got out of midgard alive not really many at all odin and thor ruining everything for everybody where are they now the giants came back home so they could survive but i'm not sure they did huh who's the guardian i should feel them but i don't this place is dead what happened though why'd mom send us here one question is answered and two more tickets place wait father something's happening [Music] it's your axe it's mueller look she's arguing with a bunch of giants she new giants [Music] that's us the first time we met the world serpent but how [Music] and our fight was balder but that just happened wait they knew everything that was going to happen [Music] the dragon in the mountain the stone mason all these drawings this is our story no this is your story but what does it all mean that i was not the only parent with secrets you didn't know [Music] she was a giant i'm a giant [Music] why didn't she tell us she sent us here knowing we would find this but why not just tell us the truth mother would have had good reasons walder was never sent to find me he was tracking her all along not knowing she was only ashes if she had a plan for us i trusted whatever it is besides [Music] she hasn't been wrong yet come on we're so close to the end now yes yes we are [Music] look it's mother's she was here she saw every step we took before we took it like she was always with us watching over us leading us home let's finish it oh [Music] father no we do it together suddenly so in a minute [Music] you my friends [Music] the giants they really are all gone there's nothing for us here come so i get that mother was a giant which makes me part giant empire god and for immortal right i guess there's just one thing i don't understand my name on the wall the giants called me loki loki what's the name your mother wanted for you when you were born she must have called you that to her people but why a question for another day let us go home [Music] [Music] i guess it all makes sense though why she want to end up here kind but did she know it's gonna be like this here is this what she wanted us to see did she want us to tell the people or keep it a secret i do not know so what should we do i trust you to decide that oh so why do you want to name me atreyus i know it can't be for a god no he was a soldier a spartan a great warrior all spurgeons are great warriors we trained from birth our lives were discipline duty battle and death life was grim and we greeted it grimly but atreus of sparta was unlike the rest of us he was smile even in the worst of times he was happy he inspired us to hope that though we were machines of war yet there was humanity in us goodness when the day came for him to lay down his life in battle his sacrifice saved countless others and turned the tide in our favor i carried him home on his shield and buried him with all the honors of spartan custom his memory was a comfort in dark wow you actually told a good story oh you missed it [Music] i understand if you want to go home but i bet there are still some corrupt developers out there that can be set free some other health people maybe helping people as part of my mom sent us out here too i mean what atreus [Music] would loki is huh that's a weird name i'm glad we went with yours last am i glad to see you i believe i've reached my limit for dwarven charm what happened they took an uncomfortable number of measurements and then proceeded to bicker about the weather where do you want us to take you how about the warm confines of anywhere bloody else so before we return to midgard i should warn you more time has passed than you like to realize and when it's done vagnero begins ragnarok from snow aye snow lots more snow and then the end of the bloody world in that approximate order another prophecy no brother prophecy doesn't expect this for a hundred more winters at least you've changed something prophecy didn't count on you i'm telling you it's thimble winter i can feel it in my scrotum this is the big one stop saying that oh you're making me very nervous it was bound to snow sooner or later that ain't just snow when you know it it's the end times how dare you make me the voice of this guys just discussing the weather bit of a old snap lately what he means is thimble winter's upon us boys the winner to end all winners i can feel it in my screw yeah we heard so if you're heading home try to keep moving and also to not die or if you're not heading home same advice oh man the tower ate the unity stone didn't i wanted to fly again yes that's a terrible pity amir what else did the serpent tell you when you spoke kinda sounded important i'm sure it's nothing he just said the boy seemed familiar to him me that's impossible do i quite agree unless perhaps he refers to something yet to be it is said that when yerman gander and thor battle at ragnarok their clash so violently shakes the tree of life that it splinters casting the serpent backward through time even before his own birth what that is madness well i did say not to concern yourself we're finally home feels like a lifetime ago quite drafty maybe it's a right improvement over having tree bark in your target time to rest i'm gonna sleep through winter okay this'll do sleep way ahead of you the ball who are you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] betray us are you ready yeah but i had the weirdest dream family winter was ending and thor came for us here at the house it was only a dream but it felt different it felt real it felt like the future then we will worry about it tomorrow today there are still things we can do come oh [Music] you
