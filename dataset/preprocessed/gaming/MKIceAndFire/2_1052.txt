it's good to have some extra hands around here are the others ready to follow wherever you lead the sensei told them you're the only person on tsushima who can kill the khan i can't do it alone or without a plan of attack and we know he's at port izmi surrounded by an army we need to know the weakness in their defense how to get past them and where to find the khan sounds like we need a hawks view of the place i know where we can get one we'll have cover of darkness if we leave now port is me we'll have a better view from the lighthouse just need to get up there without being noticed let's move why would the con come up here he'll sail for our mainland he'll sail for our mainland attack it just like you did here this is our last chance to stop him these flowers the same ones i used to make my poison mongols have been here picking them to use against us did we do the right thing at your uncle's castle i took a risk and my poison saved thousands but if it kills thousands more you have to stop the con before it comes to that you're right we need to kill him soon we can't get in the front but we could climb around the cliff and sneak in through the back lead the way [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm okay [Music] hanoi [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] good [Music] foreign [Music] foreign now [Music] [Music] uh what's in all these barrels supplies flowers poison one barrel holds enough to kill hundreds khan will use this against the mainland we can't let him leave tushima [Music] real scout port is me from the top of the lighthouse right behind you [Music] look at the waves they're flat unkind you see before a storm that could work to our advantage now i'll leave the lighthouse dark make sure the mongols can't use it when the storm hits you can re-light it once they're gone let's get a look at the port [Music] over here let's find our plan of attack [Music] the mongols left that area empty too open can't defend it but a good place for an ambush that ridge has an open sightline to the mongol fleet imagine what we could do to their ships if we are their own watchers we could place archos there force the mongols to fight uphill ah cordon would send horsemen out flank us see how the birds are circling like they're scared of something on its way the stone preparing to fly inland for shelter the harbormaster's estate the car may have taken it for himself close to the docks and his fleet makes sense khan is almost ready to sail for our mainland with ships full of men explosives and my poison if we don't stop him here the shogunate will fall storm is our key to beating him when it comes the khan will have to shelter his fleet in the bay that's when we strike destroy his ships and everything on them to do this we'll need mongol weapons a simple task for a master thief we'll need fighters too a small force could distract the mongols while i get inside port izumi kill the carmen it could work let's get back to jokaku and prepare so hmm huh i've got some good news all the plans coming kenji found where we can steal watches from the mongols i'm heading there now that's a good start but we need more fighters no my uncle wants to con dead as much as we do he'll join our attack he'll throw you in prison i'll write him a message leaving in his quarters in a castle full of samurai i'll be gone before they know us there there let's hope my uncle reads it i'm not letting you leave without a good horse you can't replace what you lost easy there it's all right i'm a friend what will you name this one swift as a wind good choice how will you get inside your uncle's castle i grew up there i still remember every hidden path through those old walls even as a boy lord shimra couldn't keep up with me hey [Music] look [Music] hmm gin why did you run away i wanted to catch an eel for your dinner were you planning to catch it with your bare hands jesus said you'd get rid of me as soon as you had a son of your own gin come here your friend is wrong [Music] a path ahead may take a lifetime but i will walk it with you [Music] [Music] always [Music] so okay they won't be watching the cliff face colder than last time be careful ghost the samurai are watching for you if i attack the gods i will prove on the monster they think i am word lord speech he wants to rally the men maybe we're finally going to watch against the kung uh oh is uh i am not used to doing this just wait for the guard to finish checking it [Music] thank you my lord what was that all about lord simra can't be too careful the mongols turned the straw hats against us you can't be sure who to trust but we're not warriors we're merchants remember odarataro the silk trader i hear he got some of the ghost's poison and used it she was his own business now she's a bloated corpse the poison made her bleed from her mouth that's why they search i'm caught who knows what we might be bringing i would never hurt lord me neither that's just how things are now wow [Music] need to get inside the main keep leave my message in his quarters there he is inspiring his new samurai we will be he will march north [Music] we will remind our people i will uncle you can't know i'm here we should have delivered that speech together damn eugene [Music] [Music] it is duty to ensure their threat never reaches the shoulders the khan now wields the same poisons of course these quarters are on the top floor now's my chance to get up there the mongols have suffered defeats at granite pass and jogako temple we believe lord the ghost is responsible for both what do you wish to do we will deal with the ghosts the shogun's orders [Music] and their leader of course lord have you learned the scouts we sent north never return i fear they were calling if i'll ever be welcome back ugh [Music] [Music] leave the message where you can see it he's here gods uncle forgive me for not facing you in person the khan's fleet has gathered at port izumi his ships are loaded with poison that will devastate the shogun's army but when the next storm arrives i plan to kill the khan and sink his fleet i ask that you join me i hope we can meet again if not as father and son then as warriors who have walked different paths whatever you believe i've become i will always be your family [Music] [Music] huh yeah we'll get through this what took you so long you had us worried i thought you'd been caught delivering my message wasn't easy did you uncle read it will he help us defeat the khan i hope so but we can't wait to find out wind's getting stronger the storm will be here by morning do you secure the siege weapons enough to cause plenty of damage also found some deserters from your uncle's army who want to follow the ghost we're ready tell the others we attack the dog i'll spread the word but you should check on them they want to hear from their leader [Music] uh it's good to have the head of cedar temple with us i would never claim such an honor for myself i know that's why you deserve it my friend tomorrow we avenge your brother and the warrior monks of your temple i just want our home back stay safe quickly sakai it's good to have your boat with us
