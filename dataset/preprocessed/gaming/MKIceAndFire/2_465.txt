so critical startup error virtual intelligence user interface offline manual boot required stay alert being cold being dead so hey um um [Music] it looks like you're trying to restore this facility would you like help you're the virtual intelligence that runs this place this system is monitored to respond to the name mira may i ask your name commander shepard i work for the citadel special tactics and reconnaissance one moment please council authority confirmed you are entitled to secure access of all systems please note that queries relating to corporate secrets require privileged access privileged access is only available to binary helix executives this system is ready to process queries you may access me at any holographic interface within peak 15. i need to find matriarch benezia lady benezia departed on the passenger tramway to the rift station subsidiary labs user alert the tramway system is currently inoperable what's the situation here one moment please diagnostics in progress critical failure main reactor shut down in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required critical failure landline connections are disabled passenger tram systems are offline report complete do you have an additional system status query [Music] do you know why the reactor was shut down i'm sorry but i was offline at the time shutdown could occur if reactor breach seems likely or in the case of catastrophic laboratory containment failure emergency guidelines suggest the frigid environment will kill biological contagions it may also damage mechanical ones turn off the heat and hope the cold puts whatever you've unleashed to sleep what do i need to do to get the power back on the valves to the helium-3 fuel line must be opened this can be done at the controls on the reactor assembly proper what are the land lines and why are they disabled the land lines connect my main frames here at central station to the various sub-facilities of peak 15. this allows the crew to remotely access my databases from the comfort and security of their labs when emergency protocols were implemented within the hot labs the cabling was automatically ejected how do i reconnect the land lines the land lines are designed for easy reconnection the router for the land lines is on the roof of operations simply activate the controls and the hardware will reconnect and reboot automatically tell me what happened here i'm sorry but i need a more specific query tell me what occurred immediately before you shut down stage 1 alert issued at hot laps contaminants released from laboratory pod gamma emergency protocols implemented stage 2 alert issued at hot labs isolation 2 breached tram shut down landline to hot labs disconnected stage 3 alert issued locally contaminants and tram tunnels station shutdown an evacuation initiated code omega sent what sort of contaminants escaped i'm sorry commander inquiries related to our research require privileged access only executives of binary helix have that level of clearance the creatures we've encountered here did they come from the labs i'm sorry commander inquiries related to our research require privileged access only executives why were you taken offline in the event peak 15 must be sterilized for security purposes my program and data are purged they kill you if something goes wrong my systems are permanently disabled to be killed i would need to be alive i am merely a database program that's all i need right now very well commander logging you out user alert main reactor shutdown in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required user alert landline connections are disabled passenger trams are offline now exiting to the roof user alert landline connections are disabled passenger trams are offline so main reactor shut down in accordance with emergency containers passenger trams are offline online how may i assist you that's all i need right now very well commander logging you out user alert main reactor shutdown in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required turians don't like the cold shepard did i ever mention that i need to get my blood flowing find me something to kill [Music] shut down in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required now entering main reactor user alert main reactor shutdown in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required i hate the cold user alert main reactor shutdown in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required so user alert main reactor focus with emergency containment procedures manual restart required [Music] so in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required so [Music] so user alert main reactor shutdown in accordance with emergency containment procedures manual restart required [Music] few stay alert being cold beats being dead i need to get my blood flowing find me something to kill turians don't like the cold shepherd did i ever mention that so [Music] i've never seen so much ice and snow i hate the cold i need to get my blood flowing find me something to kill they're locked in control group loosen them you can he killed himself because he was part of whatever happened here among my people a suicide's body would be left for scavengers the nathan will get to him eventually online connected to subsidiary facilities what's this about loose contaminants dangerous biological agents are present in the tramway decontamination chamber the tram station has been sealed in the interest of crew safety activation of the fail-safe plasma jets is recommended prior to access override open the doors now very well commander releasing safety seat at your discretion that's all i need right now very well commander [Music] so minute you'll deploy [Music] um departing central station destination rift station now arriving at rift station binary helix research facility oh [Music] so stand down sorry we couldn't be sure what was on the tram can those things work a trains controls hell if i know i'm not assuming any goddamn thing look you're human and that's enough that i won't shoot but i'd like to know who you are my name is shepard i'm a spectre huh i won't look a heavily armed horse in the mouth the aliens overran the hot laps last week only han olar got out and he ain't all there anymore first we knew the bastards were clawing into my command post we had a lot more staff then you were taken by surprise and had civilians to protect you did a good job captain yeah sure as hell doesn't feel like it the board sent in a sorry to clean up the mess she went to the hot laps yesterday we haven't heard from her since i'm not gonna let any of your people die all i can do is hold out here and protect the civilians there's an emergency elevator out by the trams this card will let you activate it can take you down to the hot laps oh if you need any first aid dr cohen's downstairs in the med bay you're certain the matriarch is still in the hot labs she hasn't come back here you came through central station so she ain't there did the aliens come from inside the facility or did they attack from outside you want my personal opinion labs like that exist to do stupid crap that gets people killed tell me about the structure of the hot labs it's built into one of the glaciers further down the mountain real old thick stable something goes wrong they heat it up and sink into the ice normally the crew gets to the labs using a tram from central station got an elevator that connects directly but it's for emergency use only uh listen i'm not sending my people down there it's too dangerous you understand yeah i hear that [Music] hell man the perimeter thanks for the help every few hours a group comes up the tunnel it's actually better since we locked down the elevator i'll do whatever i can i don't know why they keep throwing themselves against our defenses even animals should learn not to stick their noses where it hurts [Music] [Music] turians don't like the cold shepherd did i ever mention that are you here to secure the situation how are you holding up you must listen to me if we do not contain our mistake they will drop bombs from the battle stations you understand wait is there an asari matriarch here sorry i have not seen one she must be a rift station commander this is not important you must be listening binary helix found an egg it was on a derelict ship thousands of years drifting this was ragna ship inside they find many eggs in cryogenic suspension rachni the krogan wiped them out a thousand years ago that is so billions of lives lost in that war on both sides they brought it here to wake it up binary helix plan to clone ragnay mass produce them create an army but when they get here they find this egg is not a common ragnay it is a queen after she lays eggs they move her to lift station they are thinking that without her they can raise the babies to be obedient hold on don't you need a male to get eggs queens are born carrying the genetic code of their fathers eggs are carried away from the colony to hatch alone queens can lay eggs in hours and have a colony in days this is how they spread so quickly separating them from their mother didn't work this was exactly the wrong thing to do i am thinking that without a queen arachnid do not develop properly her mind is shaping theirs these ragnay are uncontrollable then all we need to do is bring her here no i am sorry but this will not work these ragnay are beyond saving it is a sad thing but they must be euthanized i am thinking that the neutron perch must be set off i'm not familiar with the purge system it creates burst of neutron radiation kills everything within the station things beyond get genetic damage a varying degree once the purge is armed we'll have to fight our way out give us a minute to patch up and rearm sure sure i wait here i am not so much good for searching now yes mother always say i would meet a bad end connecting i have full access to the facility and am at your disposal i need information on the neutron purge the neutron purge is a fail-safe system installed within the isolation tube area in the event of irretrievable containment loss it is used to resolve the situation what exactly does this thing do the purge is a neutron burst weapon two volumes of fissionable materials are brought together to form a critical mass of the energy is released in the form of high-speed neutrons this radiation is instantly lethal to any known form of life within 500 meters ah just a pleasant afternoon in the sun for a krogan purge is lethal to all known forms of shut up last thing i need is some virtual wench questioning my fitness is there an asari here there are no asari visible to my remaining internal sensors are there any survivors in here yaroslav tartakovsky director of operations is on the operations deck there are no other living crew members within the lab structure activate the neutron purge i'm sorry but i can't do that without proper code authorization who would have the code director of operations yuroslov tartakovsky or any executive officer of binary helix we're moving on logging you out commander i am feeling not so well how do we set off the purge arming controls are nearby all you do is insert the key then i will keep [Music] online how can i help you activate the neutron purge i'm sorry but i can't do that without proper code authorization code input 875.02079 code omega local execution verified code omega execution in 120 seconds [Music] so so so i hate the cold [Music] [Music] huh i'm sorry about this shepard we've got orders from benezia open fire no so [Music] this so [Music] shhh you do not know the privilege of being a mother powering creation to shape a life turn it toward happiness or despair her children were to be ours raised to hunt and slay saren's enemies have you faced an asari commando unit before few humans have we don't have to fight you can return to the citadel with us i think not [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] my [Music] [Music] this is not over saren is unstoppable my mind is filled with his light everything is clear the rack and i didn't cooperate with you why should i i will not be you will you [Music] you must listen saren still whispers in my mind i can fight his compulsions briefly but the indoctrination is strong why are you able to break free of his control now i sealed a part of my mind away from the indoctrination saving it for a moment when i could help destroy him it will not last long so you could turn on me again yes but it would not be my will shepard people are not themselves around saren you come to idolize him worship him you would do anything for him the key is sovereign his flagship it is a dreadnought of incredible size and its power is extraordinary sovereign's not like other ships where did it come from i cannot say the guest did not build it its technology is far more advanced than that of any known species the longer you stay aboard the more saren's will seems correct you sit at his feet and smile as his words pour into you it is subtle at first i thought i was strong enough to resist instead i became a willing tool eager to serve he sent me here to find the location of the mu relay its position was lost thousands of years ago how does something that big go missing four thousand years ago a star nearby went supernova the shockwave propelled the relay out of its system but did not damage it its precise vector and speed are impossible to determine as millennia passed the nebula created by the nova enveloped the relay it is difficult to find any cold object in interstellar space particularly something solved in hot dust and radiation can i assume you found the coordinates two thousand years ago the ratna inhabited that region of our galaxy they discovered the relay the rachni can share memories across generations queens inherit the knowledge of their mothers i took the location of the relay from the queen's mind i was not gentle how did the rachni find it they searched patiently they are territorial creatures driven to close any possible way into their systems why does saren need the new relay he believes it will lead him to the conduit i would tell you more if i could but saren did not share his counsel with me i was merely a servant to his cause you can still make it right give me the information i was not myself but i should have been stronger i transcribed the data to an osd take it please knowing the relay's location isn't enough we need to know where to go from there saren wouldn't tell me his destination but you must find out quickly i transmitted the coordinates to him before you arrived you have to stop me i i can't his teeth are up my ear fingers on my spine you sh you should ah you should [Music] died [Music] [Music] i cannot go on you will have to stop him shepard hold on we've got medigel maybe we can no he is still in my mind i am not entirely myself i never will be again no light they always said there would be ah this one serves as our voice we cannot see not in these low spaces your musics are colorless we filled you with enough plasma to pop a tank this vessel is at the edge yet she struggles you cannot see her magnificence we are breathing on the embers we are the mother we sing for those left behind the children you thought silence did you order your people to kill the science team no we were locked away here the children are beyond our songs they have been lost to silence you are not in harmony with those who hoped to control us what will you say are we to fade away once more there are acid tanks rigged up on that thing set them off millions of my ancestors died to put these things down don't let them come back if you kill her you can sign an entire race to death we should let the citadel council decide her fate europe companions hear the truth you have the power to free us or return our people to the silence of memory if i let you live would you attack other races again no we i do not know what happened in the war we only heard discordance songs the color of oily shadows we would seek a hidden place to teach our children harmony if they understand perhaps we would return you could have calmed them if i hadn't set off the purge no our minds are not as yours we can only learn to sing in harmony without a mother children are lost to silence you should not sing of them in gray and violent we would have stood them ourselves are you a survivor from the war a clone we do not know we were only an egg hearing mother cry in our dreams at home from space hushed one voice after another it forced the singers to resonate with its own sour yellow note then we awoke in this place the last echo of those who came out from the singing planet the sky is silent i won't destroy your entire race you'll go free are you stupid your people didn't fight these bastards so maybe you don't get it are we any better if we kill them all do what you want my people will clean up this mess later just like we did for the solarians you will give us the chance to compose anew we will remember we will sing of your forgiveness to our children great bugs are writing songs about you mark my words you'll regret this [Music] so [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] what's our next move commander head for the mu relay the new relay could link to dozens of systems unless we know exactly where saren's going we'd just be wasting our time the commander is right we cannot rush off blind we still need to learn more about saren who put you in charge did the commander resign when i wasn't looking we're all on the same team here williams she's just trying to help sorry commander this is a tough mission we're all on edge everyone go get some rest crew dismissed ovarian report is away commander you want me to patch it through to the council patch him through joker setting up the link now commander is this report accurate commander you found rachni on navaria and then release the queen do you have any idea what you've done how many generations until they overrun the galaxy this queen is different she understands why her kind had to be wiped out last time around i hope you're right shepard my children's children will pay the price if you're not we'll be waiting for your next report [Music] commander why am i glad to be off in novaria i don't know which was worse the cold or the corporations one will freeze your balls off the other will sell them out from under you with all due respect commander i'd like to know my crew mind if i ask you a few questions i can see where this is going you did a background check on me didn't you well i'll tell you the same thing i told the captain you want me as your pilot i'm not good i'm not even great i am the best damn helmsman in the alliance fleet top of my class in flight school i earned that all those commendations in my file i earned every single one those weren't given to me as charity for my disease i'm sorry joker i didn't even know you were sick you mean you mean you didn't know oh crap okay i've got vrolic syndrome brittle bone disease the bones in my legs never develop properly they're basically hollow too much force and they'll shatter even with crutches and my leg braces it's hard to get around one wrong step and crack it's very dramatic but i've learned to manage my condition commander it's for you just don't ask me to get up and dance unless you know you like the sound of snapping shin bones i need to know more about this rolex syndrome if i'm putting my ship in your hands yeah of course you do it's an extremely rare condition nobody knows exactly what causes it genetic maybe it's treatable but there's no cure to classify my case is moderate to severe i was born with over a dozen fractures hip thighs ankles my bones were already breaking in the womb 100 years ago i wouldn't have survived past my first year lucky for me modern medical science has turned me into a productive member of society you're not going to break a bone trying to fly the ship are you i don't fly with my feet commander so i'm fine as long as i'm in this chair i gotta be real careful when i get up to take a piss though i can do my job as well as anyone on the ship better actually so don't worry about it i'm not trying to make you uncomfortable let's talk about something else whatever you want commander why does everyone call you joker it's a lot shorter than saying alliance flight lieutenant jeff moreau plus i love to make little children laugh you're dodging the question look i didn't pick the name one of the instructors in flight school used to bug me about never smiling she started calling me joker and it stuck why didn't you ever smile hey i worked my ass off in flight school commander the world's not gonna hand you anything if you go around grinning like an idiot by the end of the year i was the best pilot in the academy even better than the instructors and everybody knew it they'd all got their asses kicked by the sickly kid with the creaky little legs one guess who was smiling at graduation how'd you end up joining the alliance look if you're looking for an inspirational tale of the crippled kid overcoming impossible odds you're gonna be disappointed my mother was a civilian contractor working for the alliance i basically grew up on the arcturus station back when they were building up the fleets spend all that time around alliance ships there's a good chance you'll end up going to the academy i have to go all right see ya [Music] anything you need commander just trying to get a sense of where the crew's at thoughts is this an official evaluation commander or off the record elenco when it's just you and me you can consider it off the record that's a generous attitude okay i think there's something wrong with all this this sarin is looking for a lost mass relay to who knows where but we can't get back up from the council sorry commander there's writing on the wall here but someone isn't reading it the council doesn't want to believe anything's wrong i'd call it human nature but i hear you it just seems like a group that's been around as long as the council should see this coming sorry if i got too informal protocol wasn't a big focus back in bot tell me about it biotic acclimation and temperance didn't last past the airlock to the kids they hauled in it was brain camera sorry all day and is unkind we were encouraged to commit to an evaluation of our abilities so an understanding of biotics could be compiled there are worse results of accidental exposure to element zero in the womb beats the brain tumors some kids grew up with is there some question about how you were exposed my mother was downwind of a transport crash it was before there were human biotics a little after the discovery of the martian ruins it only gets iffy around 63 when kinetics was running out of first gen subjects until then they'd relied on accidentals a bunch of guys in suit show up at your door after school and next thing you know you're out on jump zero jump zero is gagarin station right what's it like yeah that's the official name biggest and farthest facility we had for decades right on the termination shock the outer edge of the solar system it's where they did all the goose chase ftl research before we caught on to using mass effect fields it was a sterile research platform and i was there there were other kids in the same boat right at least you weren't alone out there that's true we did have a little circle to get together every night before lights out we didn't have much to do though it was a research platform then and kinetics kept jump zero off the extra net to prevent leaks then you must have had plenty of time to get to know each other yeah we'd sit around and bowl every night after dinner play cards or network games there was this girl named rana who had a little circle grow up around her she was from turkey her family was very rich but she was smart and charming as hell beautiful but not stuck up about it i think you'd have liked her sounds like she was special to you she was maybe she felt the same but things never felt together training you know you know of any intentional exposures for certain no one knows doesn't mean they didn't happen as big as the exposures were it was hard to track down accidentals it was different than no one knew the potential so there wasn't a lot of regulation anything kinetics did was gold i'm not saying they intentionally detonated drives over our outposts but in retrospect they were damn quick on the scene jump zero is a long way from home what was it like the grand gateway to humanity looks a lot better in the vids but that's my own baggage commander no bearing on this it's a big galaxy lieutenant who knows what will come in handy if you say so sir besides i've got my pass squared away if you are here to talk about benezia's death you need not bother she brought it upon herself don't pretend it doesn't bother you she was your mother she was but she was not i prefer to remember benezia as she used to be before she was corrupted by sovereign's power the best of your mother lives on in you her determination her intelligence or strength that is kind of you to say i appreciate your concern but i am fine benezia chose her path just as i have chosen mine i am with you until the end shepard tell me about yourself liara me i am afraid i am not very interesting commander i spend most of my time on remote digs unearthing mundane items buried in long forgotten prothean ruins sounds dangerous and lonely sometimes i would run afoul of indigenous life forms or stumble across a small band of mercenaries or privateers but i was always careful until the geth followed me to artemis tao i never found myself in any situation my biotics could not handle as for the solitude well that is one aspect that most appealed to me sometimes i just need to get away from other people you don't like other people i suppose it comes from being a matriarch's daughter people expected me to follow in vanessa's footsteps they wanted me to become a leader of our people matriarchs guide their followers into the future they seek the truth of what is yet to come maybe that's why i became so interested in the secrets of the past it sounds so foolish when i say it out loud it sounds like i became an archaeologist simply to spite benezia all children rebel against their parents it's a natural part of growing up aha you share the wisdom of the matriarch shepherd that is exactly what benezia said when i told her of my decision but there was more to it than that i felt drawn to the past the protheans were these wondrous mysterious figures i wanted to know everything about them that is why i find you so fascinating you were marked by the beacon on eden prime you were touched by working prothean technology sounds like you want to dissect me in a lab somewhere what no i did not mean to insinuate i never meant to offend you shepard i only meant that you would be an interesting specimen for an in-depth study no that's even worse calm down liara i was only joking joking oh by the goddess how could i be so dense you must think i am a complete and utter fool now you know why i prefer to spend my time in the field with data discs and computers i always seem to say something embarrassing around other people please just pretend this conversation never happened do you know why benezia joined up with saren benezia was swept up in events beyond her control and lost herself she fell under the spell of indoctrination and became part of the very thing she wanted to stop but i will remember and honor how she lived not how she died my mother was strong kind and beautiful and now she is gone are you going to be okay you are kind to ask shepard i do miss her and i grieve for what happened to her but i will not let my grief interfere with what we are trying to accomplish i'd like to know more about the asari we were the first species to discover the citadel we were instrumental in forming the council and we always strive to be the voice of peaceful cooperation and galactic disputes my people believe we are all part of a single galactic community each species contributes something to the greater whole although we seek to understand other species it seems few of them seek to understand us the galaxy is filled with rumors and misinformation about my people like what most of the inaccuracies are centered around our mating rituals my species is mono-gendered male and female have no real meaning for us we still require second parent however may be of any species in any gender i don't understand your species can mate with anyone mating is not quite the proper term not as you understand it physical contact may or may not be involved but it is not an essential element of the union the true connection is mental our physiology allows us to meld with other beings we can touch the very depths of their minds we explore the genetic memory of their species we share the most basic elements of their individual and racial identities we then pass these traits onto our daughters it is how we learn to grow as a species and how we develop a greater understanding of other races what happens to your partner after the union every relationship is different some unions are a single encounter with both parents parting ways afterwards others can be more long-term sometimes an asari and her partner will stay together for many decades do you know who matriarch benezia chose as her partner she rarely spoke of her partner though i know my father if you want to use that term was another asari thought you always needed another species to serve as one of the parents think about it shepard if we were not able to mate with our own species we would have died out long before we ever mastered space flight and left our home world union with our own kind is no longer common not for the purposes of reproduction most asari believe it weakens our species asari daughters inherit racial traits from the father species if both parents are a sorry then nothing has been gained or so conventional wisdom would hold i am what is sometimes called a pureblood though no asari would ever be cruel enough to say the word to my face it is a great insult among my people it is possible benezia's partner was embarrassed by their union she may have been too ashamed to publicly acknowledge me as her offspring maybe she wanted to meet you but couldn't something could have happened to her maybe she passed away you might be right i hope you are but i have no way to know for sure benezia never spoke of her partner whatever happened it cost her too much pain to dwell on it she raised me by herself though that is not uncommon many asari raise their children alone particularly if the father species is short-lived often the partner will pass on long before the child reaches maturity usra lived for a thousand years what happens when your partner dies a few sapient species live as long as my kind we have learned to take a philosophical approach to our unions we do not focus on the inevitable loss of our partners instead we enjoy the time we spend with them and even after they're gone a part of them lives on in us the union is a connection that transcends both time and space do you know who matriarch benezia chose as her partner she rarely spoke of her partner though i know my father if you want to use that term was another asari benezia never told you her partner's name union with our own kind is no longer a sorry daughter it is possible benezia's partner was embarrassed but many asari raised their children alone particularly if the father species is short-lived often the partner will pass on long before the child reaches maturity i should go goodbye shepard yes commander is there something you need how well do you know the lieutenant i'd never worked with him before this mission but he has an impressive service record over a dozen special commendations tends to keep to himself though maybe because of the headaches it's not easy being an l2 what does that have to do with it well most biotics now use the l3 implants lieutenant alenko was wired with the old l2 configuration sometimes there are complications what kind of complications severe mental disabilities insanity crippling physical pain there's a long list of horrific side effects caden's lucky he just gets migraines how did you end up serving on an alliance ship i enlisted right out of med school earth always seemed boring to be too safe to secure i figured the colonies were teeming with exotic adventure i wanted to travel the stars tender and sensitive souls turns out military life isn't quite as romantic as i'd imagined but humanity needs the alliance if we want to keep expanding through the traverse and the alliance always needs good doctors so i stayed on to do my part ever think you made the wrong choice sometimes i think about opening a private practice back on earth or maybe taking a position at one of the new med centers out in the colonies but there's something special about working on soldiers if i left the alliance now i'd feel like i was abandoning them i should go goodbye commander you
