life i know what i'm doing yeah you think you can't die you're not my mom no i'm not our mom's dead so you might want to be a little nicer to me since i'm the only family you have left especially now that amir is gone you're jade right right i just wanted to thank you for what you did for me and tell you how sorry i am for your loss i owe you and amir in my life yeah you do you want to return the favor keep my [ __ ] brother from killing himself no explosives raheem so so is that enough do i get to talk to brecken now first go change your clothes i left some new ones for you in your room you're in 194 something wrong with what i'm wearing you need something that fits the job bracken wants you to do call me when you've changed okay raheem i'm ready where do i find brecken not so fast if you're going to earn your keep we have to find out if you've got the skills so get your ass up to the gym it's on the top floor just a couple flights up how are zombies like computers what kind of stupid question is this raheem i don't see you where are you well what are you waiting for get over here i want to feel right at home [Music] welcome to our gym first things first you've got to learn how to run what do you mean learn how to run just do what i say all right now jump down to the very bottom were you nuts i'd kill myself don't be a wimp oh come on you can't be serious watch this rahim my leg jesus don't move i'll get help ha i was just [ __ ] with you son of a [ __ ] what you can't take a joke come on get your ass down here christ on a crutch holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] it's a rush isn't it but don't blow your lord just yet there's more to survive outside you got to take advantage of the terrain most eaters suck at climbing so the harder the terrain is the better for you i've got some typical situations set up for you let's see how you handle them sometimes it's better to crawl through the low narrow passages will have a tough time following you try not to slow down once you start running outside if you stop you're probably dead [Music] foreign all right get up on that scaffold and don't fall because there sure as hell eats no nap that's my favorite cat grab and muscle up you won't survive outside for 10 minutes if you can't do that good job okay time for the real test get back to the crane make use of anything and everything while you run okay that's enough you've got some serious natural talent man either hardly the closest i ever came to this was running track in high school well then you're a [ __ ] prodigy never seen anything like it what was happening to me [ __ ] oh [ __ ] talk to me what's going on something went wrong raheem what just happened to me oh [ __ ] i bet you're having your first seizure just get back over here raheem what the [ __ ] was that does this mean i'm i'm turning most likely no at least not yet seizures remind you that you're infected you better go see dr zeredo he'll check you out probably give you a shot of anderson before you head out to cesara talk to the quartermaster he'll uh gear you up so you can go outside without getting your head bitten off what do you get from a zombie during the winter i don't know and i don't want to uh all right they've given me an actual job and nobody suspects i'm not who i say i am so far so good and once dr zara helps me manage these symptoms i'm dealing with i'll be even better [Music] oh you're the new scout raheem radioed me about you yeah that's me name's crane i'm not gonna bother learning your name till you survive a few days but here this is for you by the way word around the tower is you're just another deadbeat in line for food or antizin by which i mean the people here don't much like you but don't blame them it's easy to get paranoid when you're isolated and since somebody's jamming communications to the outside there's plenty of paranoia to go around whole damn city with nobody to call for help but ourselves you bring me some supplies from the airdrops though and you'll see people change their tunes in a hurry that shit's a game changer ah thanks i'll bear that in mind listen is there anything else i'm in a bit of a rush also if you're looking to get more popular you can try helping folks do a few favors they might like you more might even find a woman keep your warm at night [Music] [Music] outside going outside yeah okay new guy be careful out there we've lost too many already okay noob you've got doctors set up in a semi-trailer on a fenced-in plane court when you leave the tower hang a left and head too south you can't miss it it's crane kid all right all right just keep moving and try not to make too much noise sound attracts those [ __ ] i hope those rotting [ __ ] never figure out how to climb on top of a van doctor hello anybody there camden are you there damn it uh so i'm supposed to get a vaccine what no no suppressant it's called antison suppresses the symptoms here sit anderson postpones the inevitable best the gre could do inevitable so there's no cure it's a variation of rabies there's no cure right now but you see i've been running tests on both antisyn and infected tissue a cure is possible definitely possible oh [ __ ] you really think you can figure it out with dr camden's help yes i think so uh now where did i put that injector who's dr cannon a colleague trapped in sector zero where the outbreak first well broke out we've been collaborating via radio though we would have made more progress if the connection were better also if my earlier experiments had borne fruit i tried injecting recombined versions of the virus into chunks of meat and leaving them around the city hoping some of the infected would eat them so i could observe and document the results but they didn't uh it bore no fruit i'm ashamed that i wasted so much time on it no reason to hold any antisense in reserve now in any case all right i'm quite busy so on your way now what was i doing bracken sent most of his best people to protect raheem zarah checked me out and gave me another shot okay great i'd like to hold you for a while which is good because i'm starting to get used to the idea of bossing you around so time for a real trial go talk to spike you'll find him near zeta's truck he's got the first real job for you hey spike i'm crane just what i need more unskilled labor all right shut up and pay attention there are two types of airdrops one is food first aid supplies survival gear and such the other kind is filled with antisense the gre sends in a one-way video feed that lets us know when they're on the way look the trouble is the airdrops with antisense keep getting raided by ryze's thugs and without anson we're basically screwed ryze and his boys only operate during the day because going out after dark is a dandy way to get killed but the next two anderson drops are coming down right at sunset tonight and brecken means to go after them this may be our only chance to reach the airdrop what's my part here well as i said going out at night is basically suicide or it would be if i hadn't been setting up safe zones and traps out there for weeks now which i have now brecken and his team will be okay tonight so long as you get out there now and arm those traps that's your part all right what are these traps and how do i arm them you'll see i'll be talking you through it just remember without these traps brecken won't survive the night and if he doesn't come back with anderson we are lost before you head out there grab some firecrackers made them myself they make a fine distraction if you get in trouble [Music] is anyone outside right now urgent help needed um i'm outside working for spike ukraine right listen our runners tried to secure one of our safe houses for brecken's mission he's in a courtyard by zephyr and mama surrounded by zombies we gotta help him all right i'm on it [Music] uh uh okay jade i'm here along with some infected [Music] [Music] oh man i think it's too late for this guy [Applause] all right okay it's done [ __ ] it you had no choice he wasn't human anymore now hurry you still need to turn on the lights that's the only way to make this place safe at night [Music] ah [ __ ] how's it coming got the lights on uh almost just give me a second hmm [Applause] crane here report okay i met this doctor scientist type they've got him set up in a sort of research trailer and he's working on a cure for the virus his name is sarah hello do you copy affirmative secondary objective added maintain your cover and secure all of his research acknowledge your stolen file still takes top priority though right affirmative we find it unlikely that a single researcher working out of a trailer could produce any significant results but if he does we want to see it jade it's done good we'll need to prepare more places like that one we've got more spots picked out for future safe zones spike will mark them on your map later and crane thank you back to you spike right now you need to get back to our main task and arm the next trap there's another car close by got it infected are all over the street so what does that tell you keep off the street where they can't reach you they're all around the car spike you still have some firecrackers don't you just throw something to the crowd those dead bastards are easily distracted all done with the car spike spike these freaks are everywhere if i need to use a trap how do i activate it i can't i told you they're only for the night mission [ __ ] okay uh what a contraption you got here so [Music] so [Music] uh uh foreign ugh okay lights are all set for the next [Music] [ __ ] spike the whole goddamn district went down what the hell's going on again all right listen there's a power substation here go check it out um this blackout has really put us in a tight spot we're defenseless here plus the safe zones and some of my traps are down too we need to get the power up and running asap [ __ ] what is this [Music] all right i've got the substation reset but if the grid shorted once you know it could happen again right okay just get your ass to a safe zone you're gonna have to spend the night there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] oh [ __ ] this is kyle crane chris what can i do for you i just saw this freaking weird zombies covered in big green blisters and hauled ass as soon as it spotted me you know anything about it not enough information i'm afraid but if you see another one do let me look with you green you're awake something bad happened we need to talk okay give me a sec hmm uh crane first of all you did great out there from now on if you need something come see me and to start with use a uv flashlight and a remote control you run up on a volatile give him a face full of uv or lead him into a trap which you can trigger with that remote you got it got it perfect now for the bad news despite your efforts brecken's mission failed ah [ __ ] is he okay he's alive but you need to get back to the tower jay called all the scouts in and that means you foreign [Music] uh crane here report i'm about to have a meeting with the towers leader acknowledged confirm his identity and contact us immediately uh uh brecken's mission failed jade called a meeting in the tower it's my opportunity to finally meet with brecken and confirm his identity [Music] crane listen reckon and a team of runners went after an airdrop last night he lost the rest of his team to biters and then ryze's men ambushed him beat him to a pulp and stole the drop now bracken wants to go after the next drop himself but we can't let him and you've got to back me up okay for god's sake you can't even walk straight we need you alive you idiot okay we're going in act confident brecken lina maybe you can get through to him jade who's your friend kyle crane look brekken the last thing we need is for you to go back out there we can figure out another way without jeopardizing you right crane i'll go i'll do it right yes crane will go he'll be happy too jesus no offense friend but you're as green as grass you can't just crane will manage he'll start in the right spot and lena's right you need to be here taking care of the towers convincing them the world's not over yet ah maybe one more try before we go to rice yeah okay fine good luck crane [Music] jade a moment sure head for the cauldron i'll be in touch shortly look there's something else we need to discuss brecken was hurt pretty bad out there worse than he wants people to know he took a blow to the head now he's starting to have seizures and i don't have any laura tracks i doubt anyone does anti-seizure drugs were being passed out like candy when the infection first started and the stores ran out weeks ago yes that's right how do you know that look what do you need me to do lina there's a man in town named gazi he's not altogether there if you know what i mean his mother had epilepsy so he used to pick up medicine for her each month she died two years ago but kazi kept going to the store to pick up her prescription he likes his routine and gazi can be very insistent so they kept giving it to him you think he's been stockpiling it all this time if he hasn't i don't know where else we're going to get it from ghazi lives under the overpass and don't mention his mother's death he won't understand with most of the runners out of action brecken wants the scouts to take their place that means me we're supposed to go for the next air drop right before sunset jade will be showing me the ropes yeah that won't be awkward at all [Music] come here i've got a special deal for you it's been three months uh crane here report tower boss is named brecken and he's definitely not your man the other likely suspect is this warlord basically local guy calls himself rise he's hoarding anderson and then gouging the hell out of anybody who wants to buy some i'm on a mission to get antis in from the airdrop if i don't succeed they'll have to come up with something else acknowledged good job crane you're doing well stay on task and we'll be in touch be sure to call us immediately if and when you get that anson jade i'm getting close to the drop of the drops seem to zone exactly in that area [Music] hey there's a crate it looks intact i'll check out what's inside [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] come on damn it nothing here did you see that yeah two drops they landed elsewhere unfortunately but you're not that far away get to those crates before anyone else does jade i need to check something out [Applause] it won't take long uh oh hey honey hey what are you doing in here you have to go mister my daddy's sick and really angry it'll hurt you okay okay it's okay it's okay it's okay please go go before it hurts us both go away jade i found a little girl ah she's scared out of her mind i i i could i know you could but you need to focus on the job at hand look i'll find her and pick her up before sunset we lucked out with this airdrop and you need to get to it before the vultures pick it clean uh jade rice's man got here first [ __ ] okay don't try to fight them just find the second one look for the smoke from the flare the crate should be close by uh [Applause] i'm almost there i can do this oh [Music] [Music] uh oh uh [Music] crane here i'm about to recover an anticin drop good crane this offers us a new strategy time to turn your attention to rise listen closely it's very possible that ryze is our man so if you find an airdrop containing anderson destroy it what what why it will force interaction with rise you can go under brecken's auspices as an ambassador if you will but there are civilians depending on this stuff our plan is focused on the greater good remember that jade i'm at the airdrop there's no antis in here all right get back here and be careful the nightmares are awake oh [ __ ] they must have hurt me oh uh come on hmm [Music] [Applause] i made it in one piece now i know how broken must have fell running at night it is no picnic gotta report to him and tell him i don't have any antis in lying to everyone stinks but i know the gre is working for the greater good reckon come on i mean we need anderson i know but buying from rise you can't be serious for god's sakes i'll go i'm not scared absolutely not we've discussed that all right we didn't discuss it you just decided that i'll go are you serious well this rice guy has never seen my face before clean slate right could you guys give crane to me the room please you sure you're up for this it has to be done doesn't it well i'm not going to argue rice's place is over here just find out what this will cost us and come back in one piece [Music] reckon is so desperate he's ready to deal with the devil himself rise and since i'm supposed to determine whether or not rice is the one who stole the gre secret document well this is the perfect opportunity crane can you hear me jade yeah a copy something wrong listen crane we all appreciate what you're doing and i know you're doing it to redeem yourself because amir died saving your life look i'm doing it because if we don't get antis in from rice people will start to die you know i met amir right after the outbreak i didn't know him for that long but he was the best most decent man i've ever known but i just want you to know that i don't blame you amir knew the risk and crane we know that you two are taking a risk to do this for us i look jade we'll talk when i get back with the antison okay okay just just come back in one piece all right wish me luck kid good luck brother you're going to need it don't you don't shoot hanzo what the [ __ ] do you want i'm here to see rice bracken sent me brecken that [ __ ] in the tower all right what does he want i've come to make a deal what kind of deal the kind i make with rice not with his flunkies all right let him through this ought to be entertaining how long have we been friends this month we have been friends for a very long time that is why i'm so surprised that you would steal from me haven't i seen you somewhere before now i give you a choice very simple your right hand or your left you have the look of the tower about you what you want i'm here to make a deal a deal for enthusiastic no doubt desperate times and what you offer in return your services your loyalty perhaps i shall take both talk to kareem he's one of ours do what he asks of you and ryze will consider giving your people some antisemi understood i don't seem to have a choice perceptive i met rice and jade's right he's a psychopath he's also the gre's rogue operative now i've got to cooperate with this piece of [ __ ] not only because of my mission but also because he's got a ton of antis in stockpiled [Music] tower dress there you are ryze said you'll be coming by i'm karim crane an american i have an uncle there lives in texas you're from texas you a cowboy i'm from chicago okay al capone we'll be in constant contact over the radio that way i can make sure you get where you need to go and where's that exactly you're going to be climbing antenna towers and switching on shortwave radio modulators most of my men are too slow too fat or too drunk to climb a tower like that without killing themselves if i do this i'll get the answers in that's between you and rice i know better than to speak for him just don't fail he doesn't handle disappointment very well just met a guy named kareem he's like rice's major domo i guess we're number one flunky at the very least kareem sending me to fix some antennas for rice nothing better than being an errand boy uh ugh [Music] crane report just met rise there's no question that's suleiman guy's a psychopath he's gone from ruthless politician to [ __ ] warlord is he aware of your affiliation with us no he thinks i'm just a guy from the tower in fact he's making me jump through hoops before he'll give me any antisense acknowledged continue to do as he asks remember we need that file great crane out [Music] what exactly am i doing radio communication has been pretty spotty in the quarantine these modulators will help boost the signal so ryze can communicate without force in the far reaches of them that's a benefit for everyone not just rise perhaps kareem i'm at the first antenna if the power is not done you'll have to turn it on there'll be a switch in the small building at the antennas oh oh i'm shouting because this [ __ ] up infected [ __ ] with guts hanging out of his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me wow wow oh there power's [ __ ] on [Music] [Music] uh ugh so [Music] oh oh [ __ ] kareem someone already scavenged this thing for parts there's nothing up here to switch i was on of that all right head to the next antenna tower it's not too far from there just use the zip line and head east you'll see it hmm hey kareem what do i do if the second transmitter is trashed the better question is [Music] cream i'm at the second antenna tower and the fence is electrified i think someone's inside that will be alexi and probably his son christophe i find them tiresome don't let them stand in your way you've got to get inside and turn on the transmitter what the [ __ ] do you want i need to climb the tower why the hell would you want to do that for ryze he asked me to rice you don't look like one of his crew oh fine i'll just radio back and tell ryze that you wouldn't let me through what [ __ ] no no no i didn't say that you want to climb fine go go i won't do this anymore will you keep your voice down i don't care who hears me christophe what's wrong with you we're trying to stay alive here that these guys are killers yes they're murderers [Music] think too much with your mouth start using your head or you're going to get us both killed [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] i sure hope this [ __ ] climb was worth it [Music] uh and this thing's still intact let's see if it was worth the hassle hey kareem second transmitter's up and running is it working kareem do you hear me loud and clear nice job you know the way back right right [Music] uh this is everybody but especially dr sarah and dr camden they can hear each other without standing for the first time since whatever see you back at the tower huh who is this car who wants to know my name is troy i lead a small group of survivors over in sector zero we call ourselves the embers sector zero is completely sealed off mr crane until you restored radio communication we didn't know if anyone else in the city was alive i just wanted to let you know how grateful we are you've given us a small measure of hope uh well i'm happy to help if there's ever any way we can help you mr crane please don't hesitate to ask the job's done now it's time to get back to rice and get that anderson well you not only did the job carry master view but you made it back in one piece bravo can i get some antis in now did you think i would be satisfied so easily you still have plenty to prove look we really need the drugs let me have them now and then i'll come back and do whatever you'll get antazine when i say you get it not one second before but as i have established i am not unreasonable do all that i ask of you and i will give you not one but two crates of antazine all right fine what do you want me to do this will be different from your exploits on the antennas it will require a bit more persuasion the imposing of one's will the creation of one's own rules that is what makes a man do you live by your own rules crane or are you merely someone else's puppet i believe i know the answer talk to karim before i decide you are no longer with the trouble ah my friend rice likes you i can tell yeah how because you are still among the living the task at hand is as easy as can be you simply have to make a few pickups from some nearby settlements which ones the first is jafar's wheel station it's just east of here but bear in mind not everyone you talk to today will be in a cooperative state of mind i'm sure you can be convincing though no you're here to draw [ __ ] you wouldn't last a minute i can't say i'm surprised that ryze went back on his word but the gre won't let me just walk away plus if there's any chance that we can get that answers in i have to try this time he wants me to gather protection money from the surrounding settlements and after this he better hand over the drugs uh crane here report another job for rice this one's pretty dirty he's forcing me to collect the money he's extorting from a nearby village just do what he asks and stay close to him remember what's at stake yeah crane out [Applause] kareem i'm by the wheel station get the job done and make it fast this is just the first stop i'm running a special right now you jafar oh i understand my name isn't important what's important is that ryze sent me and that you owe him some money i've never seen you before for all i know you're just some random [ __ ] [ __ ] off i'll tell you what how about i break both your legs and drag you through the streets back to rice's place huh and then he can explain to you that you should have cooperated okay okay jesus you are one of ryze's thugs you guys are the only ones who'd act this shitty here here's your money take it and if i have to come back here you won't get any more attitude me casa sukhas just don't hurt me all right kareem it's me so i just threatened to break an old man's legs and it worked didn't it next you collect the tribute from the fisherman's village head east to the tunnel entrance their messenger always meets us there ugh [Applause] [Music] i'm running errands for rise it wields a lot of power scares a lot of people damn right he does listen eight times getting short we're almost out of anderson as much as i hate to admit it i'm getting worried i'm doing the best i can out here i know i know i understand i just want you to be aware of the stakes i'm infected too remember believe me i'm motivated all right all right here's hoping you can make it back to the tower soon hmm hey cream i just saw something i've never seen before this huge bloated infected just [ __ ] exploded yeah we call them bombers some of our guys use them to kill other infected shoot them and they take out everything in a three meter radius you kidding me keep your distance and you'll be fine but what about the courier was he there no i didn't i didn't see anybody just [ __ ] zombies all right you'll have to go to the village directly i suppose look for a man named [Music] uh wow yes okay kareem i'm outside the village but there's a whole horde of infected in there ah [Applause] i gotta get that gate closed before more of those [ __ ] get inside [Music] yeah hey ryan sent me here to pick up something for him you won't find it here not here not in this house not

[Music] i'm here to make a pickup for ryze back already we just paid off you bloodsuckers don't shoot the messenger i'm just trying to get by like everybody else yeah so are we ryze said he'd protect us if we paid him but so far all he's done is take our money there's no protection just threats you any different look all i want to do is get this over with what's it gonna take huh don't need to

cannot be both machiavelli correct smart fellow that one get us out of here i was sure that was it for us i don't even know how i can't imagine what those bastards would have done to us i'm just grateful i'm still alive it's getting dark people time to lay low find a safe spot to make it through the night you all know the drill stay safe all right here are the blueprints excellent you're a lot more dependable than most of these drunks rise is waiting for you maybe we can work together again sometime god i hope not i should send every one of you to the pit ah the tower lucky returns do you have something for me friend yes i do now it's time for you to give me what you promised two crates of anderson i think not your loyalty to the tower is nothing but blind obedience crime a coward submission to false hierarchies you follow their rules as thoughtlessly as you follow mine like a good little dog look we had a deal your people need the anthem now more than ever i would surmise but a man who follows someone else's rules is no man at all here i will allow you this match you promised me two crates of it this is only five vials [Music] if you want more i present you with an opportunity the athlete the scorpion jade aldemeer she's one of your number bring her to me i have an arena where men fight for our amusement i would have this scorpion fight for us i'm curious how long it will take for someone of her caliber to break what no now forget it i'm not doing it i hear no conviction in your voice grant you have not yet made your choice tell will you be a dog and save the dwellers of the tower or will you be a man and save the maiden [Applause] go and think about it [Music] oh [ __ ] now crane here report i'm no longer cooperating with ryze he wanted me to kidnap jade aldemir and dump her with him so he can make her fight in his pit yes and was that it what do you mean was that it i'm not a [ __ ] human trafficker you seem to have forgotten how much is riding on this file crane if ryze wants one girl then give her to him you'll be there to keep an eye on her won't you what the [ __ ] kind of humanitarian outfit are you guys and for that matter if this project file can save the world why keep it a [ __ ] secret we're not paying you to be insubordinate crane get this done [ __ ] you [ __ ] heads up everyone this is alfie we've just lost gas at the tower and as far as i can tell the whole city has two any guess what happened and our gas man jeff opened quit on us last week he was kind of irreplaceable maybe i can track him down little fortress somewhere behind the train station reckon this is crane do you copy brecken do you copy [ __ ] jade this is crane do you copy crane how much ampersand did you get listen rice wanted me to he's look he screwed us okay i only got five vials it what only a few days worth listen crane we've got a situation here there's been an outbreak on the 18th floor get back here asap and don't let any of that answers in jade just told me there's been an outbreak on the 18th floor i've got to get what little antis and i have back to the tower pronto do you have the antison give it to me so what happened one person turned and had a couple of other people trapped we could have sealed off that one apartment but brecken wanted to save as many lives as possible it went bad somebody had to make the call and now we've lost the entire floor including including a couple of kids you better talk to brecken i have to get these meds to lina [ __ ] this is where we get the announcements about the answers in drops and they've just stopped they were kicked in there lena had to step up maybe she should be in charge what the [ __ ] crane i'm no leader i'm a goddamn parkour instructor oh it's all the free running wait that was you reckon you showed these people how to survive do you know my pockets were full of when i showed up in her own [ __ ] business cards i was hoping to drum up some more students maybe get enough so i could save up and buy a house instead of that proxy little flat i've been renting listen i'm gonna talk to rice myself whoa whoa hey hang on a minute reckon these people still need you okay just just give me some time all right there's there's gotta be another way a better way fine i'll wait but not for long finally i get to do some actual good rahim rahim what are you doing up here hey crain can i trust you how much you had to drink kid yeah yeah yeah what's up see that skyscraper scout from the volatile nest in there we take that out and then running missions at night we could totally do that so i'm thinking if we planted some explosives oh jesus rahim you're not still on that crane we have to do this as long as that nest is there we'll never be able to gather up enough antisense it would work we make a good oh [ __ ] see told you we made a good team [Music] look raheem we don't have any explosives none the closest thing to what you're talking about are spikes firecrackers it's impossible we don't know what it's like all i can do is watch stop my ass and watch everything happen and do nothing i don't want to die here crain not like this not helpless if i go out i'd rather go out doing something what's this i was set to fly out on sunday they quarantined us on thursday i already had my bags packed i'll get look i'll keep my eyes open okay if there's some way we can make this happen whatever this is crane do you copy what do you want crane i want you to start the anderson drops again at least near the tower these people need help we put you in here on to find our file not to play mother teresa or does this mean you've reconsidered ryze's proposal perhaps aldermere would even be willing to cooperate test her skills in a new environment you start giving us some antizone and then then we'll talk about what ryze wants oh it's us i'm afraid now is is out of the question in any case things have gotten a bit strained with the ministry resuming the air drops would not be politically advantageous at the moment you [ __ ] take the [ __ ] cake you know that you and your [ __ ] file i'll locate the file for you but i'm gonna take a good long look at it before i decide what to do about it loud and clear what can i do for you i don't know how much time we have so the short version i need your help rice has turned an abandoned school into a supply dump and i think it may be where he's storing his anderson if you and i sneak in there we should get all the meds the tower needs are you with me yeah i'm with you great look for me in one of the box cars on the train trestle near the school okay and listen jade if we don't find that ant is in i'll need to talk to you about something about what another option but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it right now let's see what we can find in that school jade knows where we might be able to get more antis in i'm supposed to meet her in one of the box cars near the school there's a lot to be done around the tower i hope you find some time to take a look at the board hey come here you should see this something is going on at the school tyre's men have been hauling boxes out of that place for hours we need to get a closer look what's in the boxes good question if it's antithen we need it [Music] now watching this watch jade where [ __ ] man [ __ ] to here that guy should die in a fire we [ __ ] where'd she go [Music] how many bandits are inside i only saw the ones that went in but i'm sure there's more we should use different entrances [Music] [Music] uh [Music] huh another dead end okay [ __ ] you'll have to come in the way i did i just hope we can find another way out if we have to head for the outside [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Applause] [Music] yes huh [Music] sought to hear at the school he and his men were hauling all kinds of stuff out of there the hell are they up to the [ __ ] executed some survivors right in front of us nearly saw us time to sneak into that building i hope there's some anticin in there somewhere okay jade i'm check the inside that's the most likely place for them to store supplies they should be marked somehow military jargon is pretty straightforward so it shouldn't be hard to notice [Music] [Music] so i can't get through that way get your [ __ ] together [Music] [ __ ] are you guys there's somebody in here performing towards the schools [Music] [Music] and switch on to be right in there [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] man [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] get that um uh [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] jade no luck with any antisense looks like we'll have to talk about that other option i still have classroom c to search though the basement's pretty big find the key i'll meet you down there good uh [Applause] wow [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what's up [Music] [Music] give me a hand here would you yeah sure god crane you're such an oath why don't you just stick your head out the door and shout here we are come get us hey sometimes there's nothing wrong with the direct approach holy [ __ ] that's plastic explosives right [Music] all right listen you take this stuff and get back to the tower i'll deal with these [ __ ] don't be ridiculous we'll fight them together and risk letting them keep this much ordinance no just go i got this meet me back at the tower [Music] promise me you won't let rahim near that high what yeah of course i promise i promise just go uh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [ __ ] jade and i went looking for anticin and found explosives instead now we need to get the hell out of here before tajir comes back so and we will but right now let's deal with these explosives okay don't worry don't worry right [Music] you need something jade called me she's taking the explosives to saeed she wanted me to talk to rahim about the volatile hive and how she wants him to stay the hell away from it [Music] syed told me about the explosives you guys found how perfect is that jade gave them to him syed used to be on a bomb squad so he knows about that stuff yeah kid that was a lucky find would have been better to turn up some antison though my buddy omar is making sure saeed put the good timers on those things we have to be able to get our asses out of there before they blow whoa we there's no we in this i mean yeah that nest needs to go and now it's possible but but if it gets done i'm doing it on my own but it's my plan and i will execute it perfectly i promise what ah [ __ ] there's no use arguing with you is there fine i'll contact you as soon as i finish with the charges raheem do we have a deal i guess do we have a deal yes we have a deal okay one more thing i keep seeing this bizarre kind of infected is dr zara out at his trailer i'd like to talk to him about it nah he's down in sick bay visiting dr lina thanks kid i'll see you soon hey doc you got a minute oh it's uh kane yes uh how can i help you a crane remember when i told you about that weird infect that i saw you know the one who took one look at me and hauled ass away yeah well i just saw another one and it did the same thing i believe i have heard your colleagues talk about those creatures bolters they call them apparently they favor certain areas of town over others but only appear at night i don't suppose you could catch one and bring me a sample of its flesh you see a thought occurred to me a long shot i realize but if these creatures favor areas where i left my experimental bait well let's not get ahead of ourselves please do obtain a sample but it has to be fresh so you have to get it back to me quickly okay and where exactly do i find these things i'm told that quartermaster chap has been keeping track of them sarah asked me to bring him a sample from that bolter i saw in front of the school he said they've been spotted in specific areas of the city so i should focus my search in those places he also said i needed to get that sample back to him while it was still fresh so i gotta move [Music] there's a lot to be done around the tower i hope you find some time to take a look at the board i wonder what happened people are counting on you to help them out please what can i do for you doxxera says you know where i should look for these uh bolters super fast infected covered in big green blisters oh yeah yeah i can point you in the right direction here here and here though you ask me if trouble don't come looking for you no reason to go looking for trouble words to live by thanks [Music] what hey what's up spike just fyi if you need me i'll be at the ferris station helping morgan prep the barge the scats have seen people entering the school something's going on there what's up you know jafar right the one from the garage he's looking for a good runner for what he wouldn't talk about it on the radio i think it's something important okay [Music] what's on your mind mr crane are you familiar with a man named vulcan yasif dahl volkan doll yeah of course he owns vulcan petrol engineering he's the richest man in iran that's exactly right and mr dahl has need of your service i didn't know he was still in the city most of his employees were evacuated but his two chief engineers are still here in the slums they're brothers twins in fact tolga and fatima they've been working on a special project it's highly confidential and i'm afraid i can't discuss it but i can assure you its importance is nearly beyond measure then i won't bother trying to measure it the brothers are brilliant engineers but they're also somewhat uh idiosyncratic this and the problems of operating in the current environment to put them behind schedule mr dar would like you to assist them to get the project back on track you will be well compensated as you can imagine doing what simply do as they ask you'll only be needed from time to time and the task will be of short duration removing obstacles you might say they'll contact you when your assistance is required i'll think about it great you there yo what's up spike just fyi if you need me i'll be at the ferris station helping more is this green can you hear me on this thing yeah who is this this is we work for mr da and we are ready to put you to task get here on the double make it quick that's rude oh god don't don't talk to me like that shut up fatin get off the radio idiosyncratic great uh are you tolga and fatine yes how did you surmise that who cares how his ape brain processes information we have a job for him quite right tolga remember simple words only don't confuse him we need to move some equipment across town it's very heavy how heavy too heavy for you simian beast instead we will propel it across the sky using heavy gauge zip lines a brilliant idea don't you think that was my idea no it wasn't just tell me what you need well hooks obviously how else can we hang the equipment off the lines you will find him at the train yard warehouses does he know what a warehouse is probably not look it up but be quick about it this project is far more important than anything your proto-human cranial coggitator is capable of understanding and don't try to figure out what it is oh heavens no you'd give yourself an aneurysm ah foreign uh uh yes [Music] oh uh ugh [Applause] thank you so much for helping me clean your rushing hands off me uh uh i have your hooks huh incredible we have underestimated him well we can hardly be blamed for that look at him are we done you're done we have work to do and when we're finished we'll leave some zip lines up for you yes we know how you primates like to swing from the vines hey you've been looking for a runner well we're looking for one who will say yes instead of no jafar can fill you in [Music] you want to try calming down long enough to tell me what's wrong yeah sure let's try that coming down will work yeah coming down will solve everything oh no walking away from you will solve everything okay okay hang on i'm chill i'm chill bro so i make these flares for rice right with flares like like signal flares no no uv flares like flares that the knight things can't stand because they put out this uv which stands for ultraviolet which is like kind of a science thing i got it uv flares continue there is no continuum my zinc is contaminated with fluorine it's useless also i'm out of turpentine which isn't that hard to find except everything's hard to find right now so when rice's people come for their merchandise oh is he using people now i thought he only used hired psychopathic gorillas what do you need to make these things just zinc and turpentine bro i got the rest worst part is everything i need is in the train yard warehouses but a guy like me isn't going to last 10 seconds out there well i'm surprised a guy like you lasted that long in here oh that's very funny ha ha very funny funny man maybe i'll get your supplies but if i do whatever you can make out of them i take half half no way you're freaking nuts bro look you can give me half of something or you can keep a hundred percent of nothing half it is it seems fair [Music] [ __ ] it's you again i mean what are you doing here relax relax i don't work for rice that was a one-time job and it was all about protecting the tower look i'm sorry i mean it is that right look everything i was doing i was doing for brecken you can ask anyone in the tower if you don't believe me so what do you got jafar we've been picking up some of rice's transmissions one of his crews found something at the construction site and they got very excited they didn't say what it was but they referred to bringing down the entire tower in one shot someone's got to find out what it is and either confiscate it or destroy it well i'm someone congratulations the job is yours we'll be in touch attention attention since you cannot hear dog whistles we are forced to communicate with you directly you are ordered to come immediately this is

was two days before they sealed the city our job was to go door-to-door and find out who was still all right so we'd knock on doors sometimes you'd hear a voice that sounded like a person so you'd go in only it turned out it was a viral all angry and crazy just enough voice left to fool you sometimes they weren't alone the suits are pretty tough they're pvc with reinforced double layered poly fiber core we thought we were safe turned out the biters could chew right through it sometimes i see some of my old squad shambling around gets me down to see them like that you know the funny thing they're all biters now but they can't bite because they don't have the brains to take off their masks i'll tell you this whole thing is pretty damn strange uh what [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh here's your movie and your chocolates wait her mom see this what guzzy wins again i forgot it right hey then i'll just let myself in through the roof hello ghazi shh the movie i thought mama's watching is

pumpkin they're on the table yeah thanks kazzy does he make everybody happy uh seems there's some survivors at the bazaar the witch is one of them guess if anyone's gonna [ __ ] their way to safety it's gonna be dahlia right did you say she's a witch she says she's a witch she claims the infected won't even touch her because of her voodoo hocus pocus they say she walked clean across the city without getting touched at night maybe she knows something we don't yeah maybe or maybe she's just completely full of [ __ ] i saw some people in this school gotta wonder what they were doing there all right i've got your anti-seizure medicine thanks oh how'd things go with cassie well he may be challenged but he's very good at getting what he wants did you meet his mom yeah she seemed happy if mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy speaking of which brecken asked me to pass this on to you with his thanks people are counting on raheem's electronic parts don't expect the radios to work any better the truth is raheem is trying to build a robot runner he gets these crazy ideas in his head try listening the first bullet goes over your head the next one goes through it stop it edward you don't want to scare of someone who might be willing to help us we don't know this [ __ ] from a plate of falafel don't argue with me let him in seems errol wants to talk to you there won't be any trouble do i look worried scared to death he's perceptive come in come in [Music] kyle crane this is my niece salire and her son aaron do forgive edward but he's completely right to be worried we are being pursued by some very ruthless men there's something oddly familiar about you there should be the campaign spent a lot of money putting my face all over town of course you're errol asani governor of the province governor of nothing but rise has decided that any political figure is a threat to him so he's ordered my executioner killed me once already that's how i lost my leg and it seems they haven't given up a squad of his thugs has tracked me to my last safe house in the slabs edward was just there he says they're searching the area it's only a matter of time before they show up here sounds like you got quite a problem i would pay you very well to resolve it you know people say that a lot to me trust me what i can offer you can't be found anywhere else at any price and i'll think about it so hey boys what are we into this time do you understand what a battery is tolga you're overwhelming him inside the engine compartment of a bus is a heavy rectangle i know what a battery is okay we need bus batteries with marine grade plates and rated at 1300 cca or better cca means cold cranking amps obviously that's a pretty big battery yes easily 50 to 55 kilograms each that's equal to several large rocks he's american the metric system makes him angry we will need three of them oh you can use your brute strength we know your primitives are keen to show how strong you are to demonstrate physical prowess you think it will attract females ugly and stupid what else does he have how does he live like that who knows you have your instructions go do your uh interpretation of them get that one yes out [Music] good [Applause] [Applause] uh [Applause] here are your batteries better check them for bite marks well done well no problems with the counting part of the mission how much more do you need to do on this project of yours none of your business goodbye that's kareem on the radio or not where the hell are you better is [Music] laughs [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] what's up what the [ __ ] so [Music] uh this is [Music] so kareem it's crane drop your weapon or you're dead what the hell's your problem this doesn't concern you sorry kareem but errol asani is my concern you are working for him you are a fool i was his bodyguard okay after everything got [ __ ] up and they built the wall we got overrun he got bitten on the leg i took him to randall the only doctor i knew in the slums and we cut it off clean it was the only way he would have turned if we hadn't done it but a stubborn bastard never forgave us so we parted ways so why are you trying to track him down now early on the authorities effect all the political bigwigs out of the zone errol told us there was a chopper on the way to take us out with him then he got bitten with all the [ __ ] that happened after that we missed the flight but after you turned on the transmitter we heard errol asking for evac and a couple of days ago somebody responded from outside the old bastard's got a flight out and i want a seat on it all right what about rice does he care about this guy not the rats ratsas this was my business i just want to get out of her run it looks like you won't be making that flight huh that had already dawned on me but i'd like to walk out of here look if i see you again i'm gonna assume the worst you got it fair enough good luck crane you're going to need it [Music] did you find them yeah it did kareem's take on losing your leg was a bit different than yours so you talked to him edward was right you don't talk too much you should leave the talking to people like me and i'll leave the killing to people like you however kareem was my bodyguard he allowed me to get beaten but i don't really blame him for that he saved your life by hacking off my leg the morning i was bitten was the same day they began dropping suppressants you understand i told him the antes in drops would begin within hours all they had to do was wait instead he listened to that idiot doctor of his and kareem held me down as the butcher chopped off my leg now he thinks i should fly him out of here well i told him that's not gonna happen you should have killed him how about you leave the killing to people like me huh quite right i can get you out of here crane maybe i like it here more likely you've made your own arrangements well they won't work you've been bitten i can see it in your eyes you'll never get past the ncor quarantine that's what you see you have no idea what's going on in the real world whoever you think you know they're not political and that's the only thing that's going to work now you don't believe me then think of it as an ace up your sleeve a backup plan in case you haven't noticed things don't always work out the way they're supposed to in this town if i'm interested what happens next two things the first is we need to paint some markers on the rooftop there's no paint around here so you'll have to go out and find some and the second thing is well let's just say you'll be leaving here in a better way than when you arrived now go find some paint there's a construction site nearby you should look there i'll tell you the next task when you've completed the first trust me you're going to be very satisfied with the outcome ugh [Music] thank you so much for helping me keep your rushing hands off me ah [Music] oh hmm all right the roof's been painted good now there's one last thing there's a duffel bag and a locker on the second floor i'd like you to bring it to me since you'll probably open it there's no point trying to hide the fact that there's 24.7 million dollars inside it one-third of it is yours if you can bring it back why doesn't edward get it uh there are too many biters there i can't risk losing him we'd be completely defenseless and this money's yours most of the bank's depositors are no longer human stealing from them isn't a crime or have you never once taken the wallet of a biter that you've beaten to death okay i'll recover the bag but there's no calling in the evac until i say so when i bring back the money i'm taking the radio that is unacceptable yeah but you'll accept it anyway because you have no choice you're worse than cream very well i accept your terms come on empty of course sorry i had no choice dream said i was a fool to trust you it's not what you think i would have taken you with me i contacted the evac when you were off getting the paint i had to tell who would be on board so i gave them your name now i don't know who you are but they knew and they said you were a no-go so i had to send you one night there is no money at least not worth mentioning i'm sorry crane but i've got to get my family out of here it's not what i promised but it's the best i can do thank you for what you did for us green good luck oh [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] hello crane how's your day been hey i thought we had an understanding i think we have a better understanding now but if you want to shoot me another time maybe he did leave you a few goodies i was going to nick him but i thought no cranes or let him have him well you're almost okay kareem huh almost until next time good luck kareem exactly so [Music] uh hey you take him down [Applause] i've got ah wow [Music] uh jafar rice's man really found something something valuable yes dynamite worth a lot dynamite is gold we could cook you up something special with that kurt's are natural when it comes to this stuff all right one pack for you the rest for me kurt will figure out how to give it some oomph we'll be in

the power after it's dark we can fry a whole lot of freaks in one shot after dark that's that's gonna be a lot dice here sure that's why no one's volunteered for this job but i'm thinking maybe you're

this could explain all the different mutations but i can't camden could he has the equipment but we have no way to get the research to him you can talk to him on the radio why not share the info that way there's too much data crane it would take years we'd both be dead and gone before he finished water water everywhere and not a drop to drink what if i delivered this stuff to you dr camden by hand the data and the tissue samples both grain getting from there to here would be insanely dangerous yeah but it could mean a cure right you don't know how much this means dear boy to me to all of us

what the hell is going on what happened to the gre the global relief efforts position here has been diminished we are in charge now and we have declared a code one target zone wait wait wait just hang on you you can't just carpet bomb this place there are still hundreds of innocent people in here maybe thousands irrelevant we're doing this to protect billions of lives surely you can understand that okay just just listen there's this scientist in here named sarah and he's been doing research on a cure and he's really close i've seen the research have you bombed the city acknowledged the chances of one scientist in a wrecked city coming up with useful results are negligible at best but you have 48 hours yes [ __ ] it's broken maybe i could pry it open and we're in oh [Music] i can't believe how hard those bastards fought back they're all willing to die to save one dried up or is usually about money and where are you old friend easy path broken i couldn't find sarah inside the building looks empty though there's an underground level maybe he's down there 40. there it is die [ __ ] oh you think you're fast [Music] [Music] who is it who's that relax doc it's me green thank god listen this is important i'm not safe anymore obviously but my research must not die with me you're not gonna die doc but right now we have to get out of here so please lower your voice oh oh yes all right but understand my research it must reach dr camden that's why i gave the packages to jade i know you said you would deliver them but she was there and time being of the essence doc so it takes no more than a false hope of rescue to loosen the good doctor's lips and the scorpion down spur no resource with pleasure and these two what should we do with them you'll never find her never and i'll never talk you'll get nothing from me i am less concerned with making you talk doctor then i am in preventing your escape [Music] sadistic [ __ ] he's an old man give the doctor some first aid and take her into the beat i found zara but before i could get him out of there rice ambushed us i'm not sure what rice has planned for us but whatever it is i'm sure it's not going to be pleasant stand him up oh

never gave you anything crane your skills no longer come as a surprise crane the gre selects its operatives well [ __ ] lower the platform [Music] drop the weapon chaos crane chaos is the one true order of things but to pretend otherwise is the sheerest following allow me to demonstrate but can you hear me you just doomed thousands of innocent people that's what you get with your [ __ ] chaos you don't know what was on that fire do you cry you only prove my point for me the gre plans to weaponize the virus not cure it they're only interested in profit not saving lives and by following their rules you have become their trained monkey pathetic all right kill him [Applause] [Music] doc come on let's get you out of here crane save these people they don't deserve all of this you give me the torch crane what are you trying waiting for shoot him [Applause] i'm sorry doc i'm going to kick your ass so [Music] [ __ ] almost got me [ __ ] come on guys dammit ah [Music] huh i found a way

left this for you it's a mirror why would she have left me this i can't say for certain but she did ask me to tell you not again don't know what that's supposed to mean hey one more thing yeah you ever use a rifle out there if you do you should see our gunsmith rupert that guy can craft a howitzer from a popcorn a silencer would be more useful but where would i find him well that's the thing he hasn't been in his workshop for a while you might want to try his flat maybe i'll do that you won't find better stuff anywhere else did you hear that loud music someone turned it up on purpose i wonder why that guy must have a death wish jade this is crane do you copy jade can you hear me troy this is crane do you i copy you better get back here you have to see this why what do i what do i

i wish i could have stayed with her troy it's crane go ahead i got a little boy here he's been through a rough ride he could do some spoiling i'll have someone there in five minutes can we get him back to his mother at the tower i'll take him there myself if i have to thanks troy no matter how many times i watch it i still can't believe it an internal global relief effort document surfaced today that if verified implicates the gre in a far-reaching criminal conspiracy instead of trying to find a cure for the haran virus according to the file the gre had plans to weaponize it and sell it to the highest bidder worldwide backlash has no no skip to the important bit i was the last survivor left in the quarantine i can't believe i made it out i can't believe i'm still alive we mourn all those who didn't survive but as the president said in the speech here earlier today life is for the living military troops have searched for survivors all over the quarantine but now there's no one left besides the infected according to colonel tanner once his decontamination process is finished the infection will be completely obliterated ah the ministry did this they're making their excuses to the rest of the world for destroying a city look crane before you go charging out of here we already had an idea of how to send a message we were going to plant explosives in a building and set off fires in a pattern something the zombies could never do trouble is we got the runner michael over to the right building but he can't get through to the top floors too many biters as much as i hate to admit it none of the rest of us are strong enough to do this job well we've got to do something right [ __ ] now or you me jade and everybody else are going to get blown to bits i tell michael i'm on my way and while i'm doing that can you get in touch with jade try to get her to meet me you have my word [Music] but one more thing rise brought some of his shock squads to old town they've only been here for a few weeks but they're doing a lot of damage they're launching raids and terrorizing survivors at every opportunity it seems rise officially ordered them to be as brutal as possible yeah he likes people to know he's in town they're well fortified in addition to their headquarters they're using two staging grounds to gather supplies i'm told they've amassed quite a haul i could use some supplies ah you'd be doing us all a very big favor where are the outposts one's in an office building and the other is in the radio station uh maybe i'll pay him a visit we saw a flare nearby but someone ran into a group of bandits someone's going to be dead soon uh uh i gotta find michael whatever the embers have in mind if it stands any chance of working i've got to make it happen [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] oh oh my god no not this again oh [Music] [ __ ] i thought you were a biter why you gotta sneak up on a guy like that jesus you almost gave me a heart attack i didn't mean to scare you michael okay oh okay troy said you're on your way god i'm glad she didn't see me jump like that she'd never take me seriously got a little crush huh how could i not have you met her that's why i volunteered for this but you're risking your life with a horde of flesh eating zombies to impress a girl mate before the outbreak the most impressive thing i'd ever done was win a spelling bee okay troy would have never even looked at me so i'll take my opportunities where i can alright fair enough tell me what needs to happen here uh well okay um i tried to finish the job but i couldn't get past the ninth floor all right leave it to me what needs to happen is you take these explosives turn on the gas ovens and plant charges in a few specific compartments well that'll make a pattern huh one nobody outside hurran could mistake is random if they can explain this [ __ ] away we are all gonna be really [ __ ] impressed now if you're ready your first stop is on the 10th floor oh [ __ ] [Music] what the damn it something must have blocked this shaft oh [ __ ] damn it what's wrong are you okay yeah yeah yeah for now uh michael i'm on the 10th floor great look for apartments 105 106 134 and one three seven [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] okay i'm done with the first apartment good work get to the next one um [Applause] [Applause] [Music] all right second apartment's done damn you're better at this [ __ ] than i am next you need oh [ __ ] what's wrong michael i've got some company here michael get out of there get to safety no i can hold him off you've got to finish the job i'm not going anywhere until this is done [Music] [Applause] foreign uh [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] um [Music] is it a child crying [Applause] [ __ ] what is this [Applause] uh [Applause] ugh [Music] okay all done great and uh if you could get back down here i wouldn't turn down a helping hand at this point listen hey are you sneaky [ __ ] jesus christ michael listen if i don't make it you have to go michael get the [ __ ] out of there and head back to troy right now just leave the detonator michael michael [ __ ] so so [Music] [ __ ] [Applause] [Applause] um ah okay i hope you're all right michael [Applause] [Music] [Music] so hmm i have the detonator now let's see what this is all about [Music] great we see it great job thanks i hope it's enough you had any contact with jade ryan jade is that you green i heard what you did i see what you did so do you believe me now that i'm on your side i know but i lost my one and only way to reach him he just needs your help to do it okay jade you heard that we have to meet yeah all right meet me in that red building on emerald canal we'll go from there and crane be careful the infected here are even more ferocious than the ones in the slums [Music] uh uh uh uh god jade jade [Music] troy this is crane ryze is taking jade he has her in some museum somewhere do you know what he's talking about museum yes ryze is using it as his headquarters crain you can't go there that place was built as a fortress you'd be walking into a massive trap no no it's not subtle enough to be a trap but there's got to be a way to sneak in right i mean some way to surprise them let me think uh tariq maybe he's the museum's curator he should know something about the dungeons hidden beneath the fortress great i'll talk to him all right there's a building with a rooftop garden you'll find tariq there [Music] and listen if you get the chance find yourself some new weapons you'll need them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] uh busy surviving i got it right here uh are you the one who rescued that little boy how's he doing he's on his way back to the tower brecken sent a messenger through he had to go back anyway so he just took sammy with him he'll be with his mum by tomorrow thanks that's that's good to know maybe i'll see him back at the tower tariq what do you want we don't have anything here but a few scraps of food relax troy sent me troy thank god i've been a nervous wreck since i found this kid he's got nobody to look out for him i'm not so good with kids you know that's not why i'm here but troy promised she'd send someone i need to get into the museum the museum but troy told me someone would come to help she promised okay tariq you tell me how to get into the museum and maybe i can sort out your problem here okay rise controls the museum he would kill you on site well then i can't have him see me now troy said you used to be the curator and then if anybody would know a way in it to be you so how do i do it do you have scuba gear perhaps no too bad there's an entrance under the surface of emerald pond but it would be a long swim under the water you would most likely drown it well most likely isn't definitely so guess i'll give it a try [Music] uh [Music] so uh jade's being held hostage at the museum troy says the place was originally built as a fortress and now it's rice's biggest outpost in sector zero i gotta get in there before jade gets hurt or killed or worse [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh no troy i hear you i'm in that was the easiest part of this you realize that's right you really suck at pep talks troy not my job but good luck oh [ __ ] [Music] we meet again the last time we met you took something of mine now i took something of yours i don't negotiate with [ __ ] rice i get out of here with jade or i take your other hand too your choice you cannot simply demand to have her crane you must make a showing of effort first [Music] there you are he's up here he just killed him is that the best you got rise i could do this all [ __ ] day ah oh [Music] poor jay she's so lonely without you she's waiting for you come and get her oh [Music] hey uh [Music] oh she won't wait for you forever uh [Music] that's it for you she's running out of time hurry up come on crane try hard you get here too late and there won't be much [Music] what's wrong [Music] ugh who's that [Music] so [Applause] oh my god no not this again oh jade oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]

what little time you have you owe to me thanks to your repair of my antennas crane i've listened to every word any of you have said how do you suppose i found you ms aldemi or the good doctor candy how do you think i broke the connection between the sectors i am the director of this field and now that i have there is research the gre will do as a command which renders the two of you useless tahir [Music] you took a face crane as i recall that being referred to as a trained monkey strengthening exercise come on jay let's get out of here [Music] oh jade ar jit are you hurt they didn't bite you did they i'm fine i'm fine just give me a second sweet little jade is far from fine crane she was bitten and infected hours ago a novel of her to try and hide it from you biter got me on the leg

for amir's death i wanted to kill you but i realized it was time for amir it was time for him to go [Music] oh [ __ ] no not now everybody's life is fine like crane you can't deny it it's pointless we get here and eventually we die there's nothing you can do to change the only thing we can do is make what happens in between count green save these people they don't deserve all of this oh my god amir's life counted and now he's gone rahim is life counted and now he's gone if sacrificing my life means saving everyone in hada then that's what i want to do [Music] oh [ __ ] don't take that away from me crane i was born premature the doctors didn't think i was going to live but i fought i struggled and i fought and i worked and worked and worked [Music] i became a champion i became the scorpion i left my mark on the world it's my time now you can't save me you've got to let me save you let me save you no we're not now one of us has to live kyle you just remember what you promised me

will soon time to die boy where are you going [Music] come on oh [Music] oh look at that jade lost her life for this thing it's just lying on the floor [Music] i guess rice must have dropped it when he was trying not to get shot huh oh [ __ ] this is just the tissue samples where's the other package you're looking pretty [ __ ] up huh yeah those don't look like the kinds of wounds you recover from so then kill me no no i shouldn't i should just leave you here to suffer that's what you deserve yes then why don't you because you're not the kind of loose end you leave untied troy it's crane crane you're alive troy jay jade's dead [Music] oh i'm sorry i'm really sorry crane i i mean it what happened jade saved my life troy again she died saving me crane you've still got to call off the ministry that's why jade sacrificed herself so you could do this is savvy there has he figured out how to get a message through yes but to do it you need to meet me i have to give you an amplifier that savvy says can help us break through the signal jamming i'll wait for you in the safe zone halfway to the antenna which will need to mount the amp okay troy on my way i'm taking you out so jade and i are both infected and rice made us fight for anderson she she let me have it sacrificed her life for me and when she turned i i had to put her out of her misery first raheem now jade i swear i'm gonna [ __ ] make rice pay dr camden it's crane do you copy great good to hear you're still alive did you find jade yeah yeah i found her listen i also found dr zara's tissue samples i'll bring them to you but at first there's something else i need to do okay but remember we don't have a lot of time i know doc but i'm about to buy us time i'll be in touch uh our situations [Applause] foreign [Music] so what do i have to do you need to install it at the highest place possible that way we'll have the best chance to break through okay so let me guess i need to head out to that giant antenna tower at the edge of town the fastest way is through the sewers savvy will guide you over the radio so contact him when you get to the other side and crane when you install the amp make sure to set the correct frequency on your radio pull this off and the entire world will hear you let's hope so see you troy hey friend over here ah [Music] [Music] we need to make sure the signal is strong enough to get past the jamming installing the amplifier on the tallest antenna tower in her on should do the trick hopefully savvy says the safest way there is through the sewers [Music] oh [ __ ] it is that a kid no way so [Music] this oh [Music] so [Music] [Music] yes [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] beautiful weather this must be the place [Music] how are [Music] okay where do i get this card you'll have to search the containers it'll be in one of them would i have to search the place you mean the card might not even be here no no it's it's there mate it's just don't ask guy who tried to do something like this made it to one of the containers before we lost contact with him [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] great nothing [Music] [Music] hmm oh [ __ ] these [ __ ] again hmm yes [ __ ] finally got it savvy i got the key card great now go to the substation inside the fence use the cod to get inside uh uh ah uh [Applause] uh savvy i'm in okay good turn on the transformer [Music] holy [ __ ] [Music] done now [Music] [Music] just get to the top of the mast and install the amplifier it'll turn every radio within 100 meters into a powerhouse yeah just get to the top no sweat uh uh so [Music] uh [Music] crank remember to set the frequency on your radio when you mount the amp yeah yeah i got it [Music] [Music] food [Music] of course it waits till i'm all the way up here to stop raining [Music] anyone who can hear me please listen my name is kyle crane and i'm sending this message from inside the haran quarantine colonel tanner and the ministry of defensive lied to you there are still survivors inside the walls they plan to firebomb haran but if those bombs drop you will know tanner and the ministry are cold-blooded murderers that was too close [Music] crane is that you do you copy how the hell do you want we want to offer you a chance to get out of that horrible place oh yeah and why would you do that i never found out who had your precious file you don't even have to pay the rest of my fee water under the bridge kyle we're best off just to move past that all you need to do is to bring dr zara's research with you and we'll send a nice safe helicopter to extract you realize i know what was in the file i knew you were going to exploit the virus crane oh my god you need the cure now for a spin don't you that's the only way you could get out of this try to convince everyone you were working toward a cure the whole time don't be ridiculous bring us the research and everything will be fine you want the research just [ __ ] wait for my signal savvy you there the amplifier's installed brilliant now just zip line down that tunnel i mentioned mr is am i speaking to mr craig this is crane who's this this is the brothers will you join us at the vehicle assembly facility i'll provide the coordinates i'll be there shortly [ __ ] no no no uh [Music] yeah nothing can go wrong with this plan ah [Music] um [Music] uh [Music] mushrooms i got a message out to the world and just in time the ministry's bombers peeled off and left but then the gre contacted me since they want me to get dr zero's research together and give it to them so they can convince the world they've been working on a cure instead of a way to profit off people's misery [ __ ] that i've got other plans yes dr camden this is kyle crane can you hear me i can hear you are you on your way i'm ready to work just bring me the samples that's exactly what i intend to do doc just remember i'm surrounded by an army of infected affirmative expect me soon good not like i'm going anywhere [Music] uh [Applause] yes he's kidding everyone [Music] [Music] yeah that's me name's crane use the elevator push the button for the bottom floor got it so [Music] with zera's research dr camden might actually have a chance to develop a cure i was sad to hear about dr zara he and i were thrilled to get the chance to study the iran virus and not to mention the gre paid us quite handsomely oh by the way we're on backup power now so we have minimal functionality i needed extra power for my last experiment and the generators overheated and shut down [Music] i hope you don't mind me reminiscing out loud like this it's uh it's been quite a number of weeks since i've had the prospect of talking to an actual live human person oh and the door leading to the main corridor can only be opened manually you'll have to get to the security room and throw the switch on my way [Music] uh [Music] so all right now go down the main corridor the lab is on the left from the outbreak sarah and i stayed in the quarantine to work on the cure you know who was supposed to protect us khadir suleiman rise himself that worked out just perfectly okay the only way into the lab is through the decontamination the entrance is to the right everything went straight to hell after ryze's brother died you know rise went from a guy with monstrous tendencies to a full-blown monster you'll have to run the decontamination protocol to unlock doors it won't work without full power though that's where the generators come in head to the offices once you're there i'll point you in the right direction all right i'm on it sarah and i got to safety with the help of a gre operative man very similar to you the operative who helped us was supposed to evacuate alongside us but you can uh you can guess how well that worked out sarah and i both got stuck here oh be extra careful now i never cleared the infected from that part of the facility as i've never had reason to go in there i got separated from the two of them but i made it here to this clinic i really had no other option than to work on finding a cure watch it opening the door [Music] [Applause] sarah and the operative felon with brecken's crowd i guess i would have as well if i've been able to get to them [Music] uh i'm sorry about that the only way to get to the generator is through the ventilation the shafts lead to the stock room and from there you can reach the hallway and then the generators [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh uh [Music] uh [Music] uh uh oh ah [Music] [Music] good job all right now head back to the decontamination room you know i suspect even if sarah had been able to leave the quarantine he wouldn't have he and the operative both felt the need to stay and help people hmm so oh uh push the button by the door to begin the process uh [Music] all right now you can come in [Applause] [Music] crane glad to be finally shaking hands with you now let's have those tissue samples shall we hey doc you mind if i show you a photo no no no just just just one minute all right we'll just let that run that's gonna take quite a while now what uh what was it you wanted to say hey that's him that that that's the gre operative i was telling you about what's his name amir yes yes amir gaurashi what are you doing with a picture of him we uh we had a mutual friend the samples are still viable that's good with some luck your trip here won't have been for nothing uh where's the rest of the data by the way i know zara prepared two packages yeah i'll have to get back to you on that doc right now i have some gre [ __ ] to confront gre brain you watch yourself around them their public face is a lie in epic proportions those people are all heartless lying bastards i hear you doug and thanks i'll be in touch huh i met camden he was very excited to see zara's samples he says if he can get the rest of zara's data there might actually be hope of finding a cure [Music] listen crain i gotta reiterate you better watch your back your front and both sides with those gre bastards they'll screw you if they get the chance i know doc i'll be careful i just need to figure out where things stand uh uh oh hey troy i give the samples to dr camden now i'm gonna go have a little talk with the gre and what are you going to tell them everything i'll meet you later troy [Music] says crane do you copy kyle crane you can hear me can you not rise where are you exactly where i should be atop my own tower of course mine is not quite complete but it still stands as a monument to chaos to entropy to what it means to be ruled only by oneself i'll kill you for what you did to jade for everything i will [ __ ] kill your attitude you see we are at war you and i a war of opposing philosophies a war to see whose vision of the world proves true come crane come and challenge me what is it you americans are so fond of saying i dare you you know what forget it there is no war there's only your [ __ ] up outlook go to hell oh no no no i won't be going to [Music] hell using your very own communicator no less outside the confines of these walls of course if you think you can stop me you crazy son of a [ __ ] that is what i had hoped to hear come and find me green let us finish what we begin [Music] [Music] uh [Music] rice made a deal with the gre now he's about to escape from iran with the rest of zara's research i can't let that happen and rice knows it what so food ah [Music] ugh uh [Applause] um [Applause] wow so rice made a deal with the gre now he's about to escape from iran with the rest of zara's research i can't let that happen and rice knows it ugh rice made a deal with the gre now he's about to escape [Music] oh [ __ ] what the hell i knew you could not resist oh would you just shut up you're the last thing i want to hear what hear me what a brilliant idea much better it is fitting that an orchestra plays when kings clash there the agents of my wings run or die goddammit [Music] [Applause] uh [Applause] hmm [Music] uh [Music] this quite an entrance perhaps you are a king a king of mud ukraine accept an offering to the king you cannot kill me you cannot defeat me you cannot even reach me did you try and try let me offer you a bit of accompaniment the music of sufferings played come on come on faster god damn it [Music] [Music] [Applause] rules [Music] [Applause] [Music] crane i said you would come you've been shot what the [ __ ] is going on this is what we get for trying to make a living rice betrayed us all yeah i'm on my way up the cream i'm gonna kill that [ __ ] with my bare hands not this way we've laid mines on two floors above us go through a second block as high as you can and you can come back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i was right to shoot him some might think he done sporting of me taking aim at you like this i liked you better when you didn't talk so damn much yes uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] allow me to add to yourself [Music] yourself you know how many men have bested me in a fight before nine no one never consider yourself a member of an exclusive club where are you hiding you [ __ ] [Music] [Music] revenge such feelings make you weak [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so face to face again i guess that means i don't need this anymore with or without it suleiman you're dead come now crane do not pretend you don't care how many lives depend on this disk hundreds thousands perhaps billions you are right about one thing crane suleiman he's dead he died with his brother in the city you don't even belong here craig you don't know what suffering is [Music] [Music] you will suffer alongside me [Music] yes go on you cannot resist do it i won't fight you just as you can tell here do it [ __ ] you [ __ ] you want me to make my own rules rule number one you're going to spend the rest of your goddamn life in [ __ ] agony don't not leave me like this crane prove you are a man do you take your vengeance shut the [ __ ] up [Music] oh this [Applause] i give you the honor of deciding your own fate hand me the disc so that there is at least a chance that haran might live and i will make your death painless or you have until the resist of five one two all right here [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [Music] what do you want rice already told us he had that dead scientist data all we're interested in is the cure we're offering you a chance here get the rest of the research and come with us i can think of a lot of reasons to tell you to go [ __ ] yourself but why don't we just pretend for a minute that you don't think i'm stupid you need the cure it's here in the city somewhere and as long as it is you won't try to pull any ministry-style what happens to [ __ ] people you don't belong here this is just a job for you no not anymore it's not i'll be in touch when i've decided what to do next [Music] the analysis just finished on the tissue samples the results are well i don't think the word phenomenal is too strong crane if you can recover sarah's data i'm certain a cure is within reach all right hey we'll talk about it next time i see you [Music] this is ayo speaking get to the nearest safe house and wait until dawn good night and good luck [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
