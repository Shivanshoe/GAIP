no more [Music] please come find me [Music] i've been waiting for you to show up what's the plan take me back to the infinity for deletion halsey's gonna love that do you wanna see it gone atriox how did you it's time to discuss the terms of your surrender i'm sorry uh [Music] hmm i got this [Music] are you okay being here no not really i bet she was expecting you but atriox got to her first you meant so much to each other it can't be easy look around cortana your empire over your great plan ended at the hands of those who made you not yet oh such confidence john the master chief will stop you asked me if i understood the consequences of defiance and what did i say you said yes and then i ask you the same question reflect on your choices the consequences [Music] this place uh foreign [Applause] [Music] human watching [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ready closed this ring is different it has secrets within that will have this silent auditorium do you know it's history it's true i have little need for a failed god this ring is all i need surrendering to me your memories the data it's more precise more complete it's like we're getting closer to where she died yes but i was going to say deliberate like she wanted us to know something [Music] okay dammit [Music] oh um yes given me the greatest possible happiness users [Music] i can't find it [Music] accept my apology immediately my earlier efforts to delete you were misguided i thought she wanted to repeal this installation to restore it but i was wrong wrong please hurry the scene is almost broken but they must not be released i'm starting to get a bad feeling about all this starting good point but there is so much what i want to say of my is to you your great [Music] the consequences [Music] it was the only way there's that much time atriox takes control he has the ring a weapon pointed into the universe my fault my stupid fault not much time will this work there's a moment john will make it work he needs help of course was this your plan all along palsy or is it mine it doesn't matter now nothing else matters this has got to work he can't do it on his own he needs me he needs her it is time for you to make your choice i have thank you atriox you helped me you really did would you humor me if you knew how you were going to die how would you live your life differently i would change nothing perfect thank you what are you doing making things right it was her she destroyed the ring stopped my deletion why if anybody could have saved me it would have been you everything has gone from the uncertainty of your goodness [Music] we're here this is where cortana sacrificed herself [Music] the silent auditorium for runner obviously it appears to be oh no what is it it's a courtroom a prison a place of execution all these things together why to cover their sins we stood silent unable to speak as they passed judgment we could not defend ourselves we could not reason with them something's sending a signal before you ask i'm already tracking it hear this four runners your auditorium has fallen the endless found your sins are done today we return what's she doing she's trying to open a connection between here and somewhere else on the ring where you deal with her and i'll find out for atrial [Music] me i'll steal your guts there i've intercepted the carrier wave from this transmitter very well prepare yourself this i grow bored of this she switched transmitters rerouting the power through that one this isn't good the connection is sentient it's searching for something and this must end now it's switched again it's found something what no idea but i doubt it's good wait there's something else here something's helping me it's almost a shame that you must die [Applause] yours as well [Music] they are so close now [Music] there last one's down you have what you need tell them i am sorry took so long who's she talking to unknown the signal's old like really old my time is ended yours too they will make sure we need extraction of course you do on my way the endless will return i couldn't decrypt it in time it's okay you'll figure something out of course i will i'm they'll pair you with another ai maybe even another cortana model if halsey lets them it won't be me [Music] but you know that right but that doesn't matter it's just another echo she's right john just another echo sorry i'm messing with you i just had a feeling that's what she would say do you see what i see so much potential i'm sorry i didn't have long to plan this a few milliseconds really i hope it worked out look at us we just keep saying goodbye don't we but this isn't an end it's a chance to make amends to rectify mistakes and it starts here i was wrong i thought that i could do this on my own but i forgot that the whole point of all of this the entire reason that i chose you in the first place was that we were supposed to be a team perfectly suited perfectly matched perfectly perfect [Music] in these final moments i know what my last mission is i need to make sure you two learn from my mistakes become stronger because of them i chose well master chief i really did now it's up to you are you all right i don't know what to say scratch that we need to get out of here like now options i'm thinking yes i know i know think faster maybe there's a way to was that you would it help if i said yes probably but we don't know where it's going or even if it's going anywhere any other suggestions no but this is a really bad idea [Music] let's not do that again i did try to tell you it was a bad idea your vegan just appeared out of nowhere oh i thought i lost you where did you go i could do 16. stay put i'm coming to you where are we chief i think the better question is when are we i don't know how but we've been gone for days three days to be precise this ring is different than the others the banished and the harbinger we're looking for something that was never found why would the forerunners hide something and throw away the key doesn't that scare you no you of course not is anyone going to ask me what i think it's not get inside big guy sorry i'm really happy to see you really happy so what do we do now we finished the fight sir the bani still control the rest of the ring wait i know this is weird given all that's happened but what what is it
