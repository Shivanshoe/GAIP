job the world may have ended and most of our loved ones have turned into bloodthirsty monsters roaming the streets but that doesn't mean people have stopped being lonely i mean [ __ ] that's exactly why they're lonely these days you mean to tell me there was a time when people weren't lonely imagine a world where people actually went out to work shopping walking their dog and on top of that they had dating apps um uh apps okay okay never mind what i'm trying to say is that before the [ __ ] hit the fan we used to socialize there were parties you know when people got together just for the sake of being together and of course to get laid now everyone just stays home behind closed doors because well meeting new people can result in getting clubbed in the skull for a bucket of water so let me get this straight your cards help people meet basically yes people who want to meet other people come see me my draw them i'm pretty good at that or at least that's what i'm taught then i put their portrait on a card and display it on my dating board if someone's interested they get in touch with me and voila a romance is born not always for very long but i guess that's something that hasn't changed but right now i'm in deep [ __ ] and i desperately need help of course you do some [ __ ] trying to imitate me forged several sparker cards they scattered them around town that's infringement it's ruining my reputation and disorienting my customers i need someone to collect these fake cards for me and bring them back i heard that talentless hack was killed in a dark zone so he won't be bothering me again and i managed to find most of the fake cards but there are two left i couldn't get hold of bring them to me and i'll give you the card i've made for you check the map on the wall

don't have any other choice but to do as they say they have anything to do with lucas's death what no i mean god i i hope not that would be terrible but i swear i don't know so you've sent others before me and and then they've all been murdered what have you done damien i didn't know at first but i couldn't do anything about it once i found out i couldn't how many damian how many people have you sent to their death stop it aiden stop i'm sorry i had to i'm trapped believe me they have my brother your brother i talk fast they took him and threatened to kill him if i didn't do what they said i just figured if i did good they'd eventually release him i'm being played and i'm tired of it i just want my brother back will you help me find him you sent me to the slaughter and now i'm supposed to forget that and help you find your brother you're mad i get it but look at it this way he may have heard why they're looking for you if he could tell you wouldn't you want to find him all right fine then but you better pray that he knows something [Music] hmm nope he's not here no signs of cliff here damn it you don't think they he's not he's not dead is he don't jump to conclusions but where could they be keeping him damn it this is all my fault i'm such a fool sending people here yeah that's on you as for your brother i'm not certain where did you last see him we were in east quarry and close to devil's bridge when they attacked us they took him hostage and have been using me to carry out their orders ever since i only did this to keep my brother alive aidan i didn't know others would die when this started what's devil's bridge it's the name of this building in the middle ages they said devils haunted it but then times changed and no one believed in those things anymore before the virus it was a car repair shop now it's full of bandits and i guess i'll search the area around devil's bridge aidan you serious you'd do that for me not a chance i'm doing this so that no one else dies because of you [Music] i know i didn't exactly make a good impression but please save him [Music] ugh ain't going away [Music] uh yes [Music] i don't like the duck i'm always afraid of someone lurking out there uh [Music] damien damien nah i'm cliff wow resemblance is uncanny guards wait stop damien sent me how did you escape escape i have no reason to escape man i see you're not you're working with him aren't you well duh listen cliff what i really want to know right now is about the murder of commander lucas the pk commander what about him did you or your people kill him no [ __ ] way we're not suicidal anyway we got bigger fish to fry like you for instance me what the hell do you mean you and damian haven't figured it out oh well i love my brother but he's a dope always has been [Music] you tricked your brother to send innocent men to their deaths because you wanted to find me waltz can run it all down for you himself or rather for what you've got from dylan wait waltz where is he danielle they haven't filled me in all the details yet hayden you there have you found cliff yes but you won't like it damien bro unfortunately now's not a good time to chat and as for you you've finally found dr walls downside he's found you that's him fellas the one who took the doc's toy [ __ ] what what do you say the dogs [Music] you're done [Music] [Music]

you're practically one of us now what's what's going on where's damian [Music] he locked himself in the tower [Music] and what's that all about beats me just started raving about something being all his fault he was in a bad way he's not answering his radio he didn't look like he was in a talkative mood any other way into the tower not really not by ordinary means people have tried to climb the wall but those who have usually end up getting scraped off the ground yeah i'll give it a shot [Music] and forget the fall even happened i feared things would go differently [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] damian stop her i jump wait okay i've stopped relax damien let's both relax what do you want to talk about what how about cliff about your brother what about him for one i i should apologize for what what happened to him hayden well i look it's only fair that you know know what that it's my fault i killed him not you oh so you want me to jump is that it rub salt in my wounds of course you killed him do you think that changes anything for anyone it could maybe take some of the burden off of you nice try but no aiden no i brought all of this down on myself on me on those poor victims on my brother and even you and maybe i should just live with that but i don't want to at least not for very long only for about say 15 floors i can handle that goodbye aiden [Music] about not finding out the hard way that you can't fly maybe if i weren't such a weakling and a coward i'd have jumped already but you didn't something is holding you back fear fear has always held me back it helped me back from refusing those [ __ ] after they took my brother it held me back from telling those doomed guys to run like hell instead of sending them to their deaths i won't be held back anymore aidan i won't hold myself back you ready for this aidan because if i stop holding myself back i think i just might be able to fly after all check it out i don't know about life [ __ ] you that's what you hung up on but you're alive and so many aren't now because of you damien i killed them all of them look man it was a bad deal all around you aren't evil okay you were trying to save your brother they backed you into a corner but my brother is one person one person but i've killed so many no sent them to be killed you didn't kill them yourself what choice did you have believe me i've done plenty of bad in the name of good and then i just plain bad but i'm not an evil person and neither are you damien i am i could have found another way but did i try i can't close my eyes without seeing the face of every kid i said hey you're new around here too they're all dead and now so is my brother because of me i can't take it anymore sure you can you can prove how strong you really are live your life and use each day to make it right it's too much to fix i can't i it could never be enough i'm sorry aidan i have a message from your brother wait what before he died your brother told me something you waited till now tell me it's not something you yell damien come over here and let's talk if this is a trick hayden it's a lousy one and it won't work i'll be over the side so fast this isn't a trick seriously he said something to me before just come on will ya all right step back take it slow yeah talk come closer so we can talk for real man talk okay fine so he said your brother cliff said that that he loved you and he didn't want you blaming yourself he took the blame you were a better person than he ever was he said [ __ ] cliff never talked like that he was a dick my brother but a serious [ __ ] he said that he wanted you alive he didn't want you bearing all this i swear well there's only one way to find out for sure i'll have to ask him but he's dead exactly make room i'm jumping with you are you crazy why not we can go together now it's one more death added to your tab why would you no you would never try me jump go on jump i'll be right behind you ever hear that most jumpers change their minds midair no it's true they're falling and think oh [ __ ] maybe this actually wasn't the smartest thing i've done in my life soon my head's gonna smash open like a watermelon and i'll ride around with no control over my arms and legs and beg for someone to finish me off but nobody's gonna finish you off here damien except maybe the infected they'll eat you foot to forehead damien slowly i'm going see you on the ground wait let's talk about what i i don't know about life maybe sure but i guess i don't have a life anymore all the guys that died they died because and quit being a broken wrecker will ya you'll get over it now pull yourself the [ __ ] together and back away from that ledge or you really will fall you feel bad about those deaths that's great means you got a conscience there's not many left in this town with a conscience but you got one and that's why you should live to make up for what you did it will always be time to jump tomorrow day after no rush look i won't stop you but keep this in mind like i said before make it right keep living at least till you make it right so how many deaths do you think you're responsible for don't make me say it aidan eight maybe eight even better better yeah because now you have to save eight lives deal but gotta balance those scales damien we have a deal deal smart move i better not regret this you won't i got a job for you hey that's my line how about that damian's got a sense of humor gallows humor i guess yeah it seems appropriate all things considered aidan yeah thanks no problem i saved your life kid now don't [ __ ] it up okay jesus damian what's up with you were you about to jump i was but aidan what's with this it's all my fault business talk to me yeah the people from the bazaar my brother oh wait hold up don't confuse yourself again damien just relax and shut up for now wait he was just talking about killing people or

i was just about to take a nap oh look at your face huffing and puffing who knew you were such an old man is this a race or are you aiming to turn this into a fight calm down calm down it's a race in fact how about we up the stakes say five to one what do you say all right you're on and we're off [Music] [Music] uh [Music] much [Music] hmm um [Music] [Music] i thought i was a goner hey wait wait wait a minute what's going on here babel are you okay you [ __ ] well [ __ ] me the two of you were twins no wonder you kept winning when i started a race with one of you the other was already at the finish line look at him babel his brain finally caught up to his legs you don't know when you stop do you wait we're not bad people okay i mean we're probably not all that good either but my point is everyone does what they do best right and this is just what we're good at we tried to do other things you know things we were not very good at and we ended up getting in debt serious debt and now we have to pay it so you scam people nobody gets hurt we're not bandits listen what if we gave you back your wage and forgot about the whole thing huh surely my silence is worth more all right all right this is all we have okay let me know when you want to race again you numb scope you had to let those biters catch you didn't you what you think i did that on purpose give me a break so [Music] get out of here detected you here dodger sent me uh [Music] yes ugh hello you again how'd you find my secret entrance you call that a secret it was supposed to be you're out of luck though buddy i still don't know anything about anything the dodger sent me dodger who oh he told me to say sayonara that help okay [ __ ] you should have started there dodger's looking for the order you owen i'm not bad you see that busted lake that's why i don't have dodger's order you need help nah wait don't go back to him he finds out i bought the job i'm done around here then what should i tell him don't matter he won't give a [ __ ] he'll think i'm [ __ ] him over hi can you go for me check out this storage area in an underground parking lot on st joseph street cross the fence right in front of the massage parlor enter the building and head down the elevator shaft well hey slow down first what would i be looking for if i did this for you gre containers according to the rumor the reach dodger there was a military installation here set up in the first days of the outbreak and where there's military there's usually a healthy stash of supplies and what kind of supplies don't know for sure but usually good stuff from before the outbreak it was only the finest for the military medicine booze whatever no wonder dodger wants this delivery so badly yep here take these bangers and give it a try will you it'd be a big score for all of us but i'm out of the running now literally so this is a military base yeah they sprang up all over the city at the start of the outbreak the base has a military side and a civilian side military side is a good stuff the civilian side probably has more infected than loot look for the military entrance and you can't go wrong well once you're inside be careful getting to the storage area won't be easy the setup usually includes generators find them to fire up their uv lights that'll help against the fighters that'll be camping out there happened to your leg got jumped by bandits as i approached the side barely managed to get away if you don't do this dodger will kill me why do you work for dodger you need to ask same reason as you we got to do what we got to do to survive dodger tips me off or i might find valuables and i go there if i find some good stuff i take a cup a tiny one a sliver you know vultures guys like dodger are it's barely enough to live on but that's better than nothing i guess the worst is when dodger gives me a bum lead and i get [ __ ] off that's happened more than once no skin off dodgers nose though he's got plenty of guys like me working for him okay i'll be back as soon as i can thanks you're saving my ass by doing this buddy but i'd wait till night falls to go there both zones are probably filled to the brim with infected right now thanks for the tip not that i'm in a hopeless situation but can you hurry [Music] you
