talking about your last opponent was tarkotten he was born with those blades yeah those things are real he represents outworld had you lost the emperor shao khan would have come one step closer to physically absorbing our world into his outworld right right the elder gods created the mortal combat tournament to give earthrealm a chance to defend itself but if we lose this time shao khan will conquer all [Music] look guys i'm an actor i save the world for the cameras if this emperor is really a threat call the military me i've got a date with a blonde ciao what do you see in him he is a

foreseen events like memories of my future they lead me to believe that you are all connected to earthrealm's fate what have you foreseen in my visions shao khan becomes invincible he destroys all life in earth realm we will all die i believe these flashes are a guide to defeating shao khan but disrupting the flow of time can have serious consequences i'm not worried i bet you could win this thing no problem unless directly challenged i cannot participate what should we do besides standing around looking pretty for now the tournament must run its course all right then we're with you raiden [Music] only one fight remains face me and mortal kombat round one fight fight wins it i concede well done my friend he has saved earthrealm [Music] congratulations [Music] so [Music] you failed me 500 years i have waited now i must wait 500 more my lord all is not lost curse the elder gods in their tournament i should have taken earthrealm by force but i am bound by their rules rules that cannot be broken my lord kill him but what if the rules were changed katana continue [Music] [Music] [Applause] i do not understand why my amulet is further damaged he must win if not luke kang then who you got me not sure anybody could have done what he did made shang tsung look like a chump here to congratulate us on our victory sorcerer what shang sung you have been revitalized i see i didn't realize your master was in the habit of rewarding failure the emperor has an offer raiden a new tournament i see no reason to participate in any plan of yours the emperor proposes a single tournament to replace the current system of ten it will be held in outworld if earthrealm does not win outworld will absorb it but if earthrealm wins xiao khan will abandon his claim to it forever give your emperor my regards hmm oh i now realize what we must do oh anybody get the number that wait where's sonia shang tsung has taken her we've got to find her we must follow them changsong has made it clear that earthrealm will be under constant threat unless i agree to a new tournament another vision yes i saw luke kang win the proposed tournament i believe we must attend but my earlier vision of your victory over shang tsung was not the solution i sought therefore this premonition must show an event i need to change perhaps he must win refers to another hear me elder gods i accept the terms proposed by shao khan [Music] we go to outworld i assume that's the big man himself the wrestler guy with the cow skull on his head and why aren't the kung fu twins here helping us i sent luke kang and kung lao to free their shell and masters i expected sonia blade to be here with shang tsung she better not have a scratch on her wait this is a tournament ah the earth realm delegation has arrived and we have a volunteer for first combat what the tournament will begin jackson briggs you will face barakah damn you my blades will find your heart jax wins you shouldn't be running with those where's sonja tell me major briggs do you and she do anything other than rescue one another your next opponent will be what is it excellent it seems i have a pressing matter to attend to with the emperor's permission we will reconvene later what was that all about i think we should follow okay sonja blade she is to be executed my powers are compromised here in our world but i will be able to transport us near enough to her maybe you could try for even nearer next time where are we i will inform you the instant i know i wish this damn tracking device worked in here this is just like my movie time smashers we were going around give it a rest will ya making my ears hurt so what's the deal with you and sonya anyway she's smoking hot it's not like that i'm her co honey like that under my command oh you'll want to stop talking now but if it's not like that then you won't mind if that's it time somebody shut you the hell up how you like that mr a liz jackson briggs you will restrain yourself yeah well ah someone approaches good maybe somebody else needs their ass whooped looking for something the armory is restricted you will leave now gonna have to ask nicer than that wrong place wrong time lady feel better um listen cage don't worry about it guess we know where we are now thanks to her yes and where he must go let's do it oh come on what is it with your show con and underground cesspools if you had not dishonored yourself by attempting escape we would not be here in the sewer [Applause] sonia guards stop them so much for the surprise attack she is the emperor's property human she's nobody's property jax wins i guess extra arms don't make a difference you sure have a way with women you know me i'm a class act thanks what took you so long he was busy hitting me in the face that's weird i've got two sets of readings heavy text signals both of them technology then they cannot be of outworld we need to confront the source of each signal we might discover the one whose victory i must ensure wait what about us what are we chopped liver what perhaps you are right johnny cage you will stay close to me great i close as a shadow and twice as silent sonia you're with me keeping my eye on you rayden looks like you want to teleport yourself about 30 clicks that way back from the nether realm empty-handed i see lukang liu kang i now realize what we must do we must allow shao khan to merge the realms that is insane the elder gods forbid it without victory in mortal combat what he does the elder gods fury will fall upon him defeating shao khan before the merge is but temporary he will return bringing armageddon i have foreseen it enough raiden he is here no do as i say have faith in the elder gods have faith in me lukang i cannot let you fight shall khan then you are my enemy do not interfere no enough of your madness if you must die so be it by the gods no no this was not meant to happen what did you do lucan forgive me you have killed us oh come on it's up to us ah raiden you have come to your senses earthrealm citizens suffer further resistance serves no purpose all these ages you have fought me you denied me my rightful claim not this time the elder gods fear me now their pathetic horrible combat shackles me no longer they masquerade as dragons but our mere toothless worms i know you can feel it it is the end of all things elder gods where are you why do you forsake me your time has passed ages wasted in foolish resistance have won yes you have won now raiden your world ends [Music] our penalty is clear an anemic effort from ineffectual deities i become the elder gods [Music] ugh um [Music] [Music] oh it is over [Music] but only at the gravest of costs [Music] so many are gone their light has sunk into the earth i am responsible for their loss you did what you had to to protect earth realm losses in war are are inevitable come let us tend the fallen then we must help our realm rebuild our work has only just begun [Music] blinded by rage how easily he was convinced that the elder gods would ignore his merging the realms yet the thunder god still lives no matter neither earth realm nor outworld can now withstand the nether realm's onslaught it is time soon i will be free earth realm and outwards millions of years ago shinnok one of the elder gods turned on his fellow deities and invaded the earth realm raiden and the elder gods stopped shinnok locked him up in the nether realm [Music] others followed in chinook's footsteps like outworld's emperor shao khan who was obsessed with conquering earth realm so raiden convinced the elder gods to enact the mortal combat tournament as a way to even the odds give earth realm a chance for generations xiao khan followed the elder god's rules the war moved to the arena where he sent his toughest fighters to challenge raiden's greatest defenders in mortal kombat two years ago we beat him but xiao khan wasn't ready to lose he violated the rules of mortal combat and invaded earthrealm most of earth's defenders our friends were killed turned into evil undead warriors despite the odds stopped shao khan's invasion as punishment the elder gods destroyed him we thought the long nightmare was over but it turns out that shinnok had been manipulating events shao khan's invasion his death all part of shinnok's plan to escape the nether realm and resume his war on the elder gods oh [Applause] hey so destination head head set her down nice and easy for me don't i always if by always you mean not once major all right you have the rendezvous coordinates far into the forest from there we access the portal to raiden's sky temple where there's an angry former elder god and his devil's waiting for us gods portals flying demons blind guys with magic swords the world has changed for the worse if we do not expel chinook from raiden's temple he means to poison earth realm's life force the jinsei and we're not going to let that happen kenji and i appreciate the major allowing us to join you we're happy to help kick shinnok's bony ass back to the nether realm you gotta land this thing oh get over here [Music] uh [Music] [Music] nasty [Music] yes [Music] now the end is near getting a little ahead of yourself aren't you [Music] gotta get back to the chopper sonja get out of there that was unpleasantly cold i liked it better when we fought on the same side you okay we fared better than the men add them to the list of things shin uncle answer for nice jacks nightwolf smoke smoke is dead i [Music] am [Music] the real jax wouldn't punch his best friend johnny cage killing you will be a pleasure we're gonna fix you someday well nice seeing them again sonia that's not him sento contains the souls of my ancestors they guide me could they hurry the hell up another guy going up fall back now go on you guys stay here close the door [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] you see it now raiden your legacy you poison their hearts with hope and what do you offer the same as you did millennia ago when you betrayed your fellow elder gods and attacked earth realm we stopped you then imprisoned you in the nether realm we will do so again remove the shadow from the light the shadow grows the legacy of life is death raiden my followers accept this and they are they fight for me oh uh [Music] will not touch the ginseng oh i will and all of earth [Music] oh sorry ma'am didn't see you there miserable wretch insignificant speck of fecult scum how dare you that is mine ready as always [Music] she will be the first to join me now [Music] i'm not sure what

remain here the chamber's properties will heal sonja blade in short order quanchi and the others they're gone a surge of power within the chamber overwhelmed my senses we can deal with quan shi later kimchi we've netted a bigger prize this day china's amulets and within it all fish face himself let us take the amulet to the elder gods they cannot destroy it no one can they might offer council chinook can never escape the war is not over quan chi has escaped why are you smiling she called me johnny rayden told me later that i'm descended from some mediterranean war cult bred as warriors for the gods i've never been able to re-summon that green halo raiden thinks it was triggered when i saw a loved one about to die how about you cassie can you summon anything like that or did it skip a generation take it easy gin we didn't need a halo in darfur or iran or kurdistan did we jackie nope we didn't shaolin monks ever send you there jen i've seen plenty of action takeda and i both stuff that blow your special force's mind that is you're all here because you deserve to be you're beautiful and unique snowflakes now as i'm sure you're unaware judging from the lack of gift cards today is our team's six-week anniversary secretary blake says he's pleased with our progress he could spit in his hair and he'd be pleased with our progress he was smart enough to have mr cage put this team together i'm glad the shira ryu chose me to join new places new faces as the secretary pointed out us older folks are going to retire someday so it's time for your generation to step up shaolin shirai ryu sf together for your team's first mission you're going to the linguai temple we haven't heard from the grand master in a while so we need to make sure he's still on our side that he's got our backs if things flare up again without world you need to bring him in but don't be surprised if sub-zero's not willing to cooperate why we worried about outworld i thought codal khan respected the reiko accords he does but he's facing a civil war the rebels win those accords will be history so other than that you enjoyed your visit the lincoln shredded us you maybe i see plenty of frozen boot prints on your ass too come on now you're all winners in my book new orders from general blade priority one outworlders here in earth realm an invasion couldn't be you're not afraid are you mr cage outworlders i can handle so when did they show up the portal opened by the docks a few hours ago nearly 5 000 in all refugees from the outworld civil war it must be bad if they risked coming to earth realm after you do not dwell on your encounter pretty hard not too thanks kenji could you and mr cage join us sergeant cage you and your team as you were this is lee may she seeks asylum for her people in earth realm our village sundo was the epicenter of a fierce battle we barely escaped with our lives such is war i mean no offense but you outworlders kind of live for that right this was different the rebels melina had a weapon unlike anything entire battalions erased it was not honorable not combat tell me more about the weapon a talisman gold with a center jewel molina wields its crimson energy without precision well that's good then not now sergeant cage it is enough that she possesses it it turns the tide in her favor the emperor grows desperate and those caught in the middle pay the price if this talisman is what i suspect it to be we may all pay a price we talking about shinox amulet can't be the base the vault your warnings sf shaolin no way anyone can get past all that i must be certain well this is cozy you remind me of an earth realmer who crossed over with us he also found humor in everything handsome guy right he was an earth roamer one of his eyes

with your team johnny you hear that cass she called me johnny i thought she might [Music] as you were for 25 years the special forces have been earth realms sword and shield we've pushed back shao khan defeated chinook yet none of our victories have come without cost recently commander jackson briggs was honorably discharged his wounds both physical and psychological left him no longer fit to serve we honor jackie's father and we honor his sacrifice by doing what he would do tirelessly defend earthrealm sergeant cage step forward your leadership and warfighting ability have earned you promotion to commander but there are no family favors here by special forces tradition you still have to pass one last test i need to kick the ceo's ass ma'am your ass ma'am all right then sergeant let's see if you can take me [Music] commander cage reporting for duty congratulations commander come on dad you really have to go oh you've got your duty commander and i got mine starring in yet another ninja mime sequel isn't what i'd call duty i need to provide for you in the manner to which you become accustomed then geez guys i'm right here general blade cassandra cage what is it raiden another realm we should open a dialogue maybe there's an explanation lou kang and katana were friends once they are irreparably polluted by shinnok's evil they are no longer the champions we once knew we must strike them preemptively it's about time we brought the fight to them what's the target buried deep beneath luke kang and katana's castle is the cathedral of shinnok the seat of their power destroy it and their undead army will fall removing its threat to earth realm aren't your powers weaker in the nether realm yes but i will have sufficient strength to occupy the undead army that'll buy us enough time to infiltrate the cathedral destroy it from the inside we get pinned down in there there's no way out to ensure earth realm survival we must all be willing to sacrifice uh you know it's been two years too much of your grim and gritty makeover droning on about sacrifice you don't have a family to lose i no loss johnny cage braden's right johnny we're not ready for another war we've got to take out another realms army now before liu kang can bring it here [Applause] general [Music] [Applause] she's trapped cassandra cage how the chosen one has fallen raiden's right whatever shinnok did to you you're a lost cause [ __ ] you general can you hear me general mom i'm here cass hey we'll get you guys out they're gone cass and i'm not gonna make it what i'm not leaving you behind get your team home that's an order your duty minds to finish the mission i love you cass give your dad a kiss for me [Music] mom no don't mom mom she started the detonation sequence overwrite it jackie there is no override commander our orders are to leave so your mother died a warrior's death may we all be so fortunate you did not just say that thank god you're back how did the mission go now [Music] without the cathedral's power we stand alone we are vulnerable who are you one of raiden's elder gods here to taunt us no katana i am much more beholden what power is this i'm cronica keeper of time the sands of time guide the destiny of the realms and every soul they're in i've carefully crafted them to keep the realms in balance but my work's perfection has been irreversibly tainted by raiden's actions the two of you have felt that pain most acutely what can be done the past is the past is it not it need not be i intend to wind time back to its beginning and restart history but even with my vast power i cannot create this new era alone how will this new era be different in many ways but most importantly there will be no raiden how do we begin [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] by the elder gods [Music] i swear to god i'm losing it can't someone anyone explain to me what the hell is going on right i've been in the future for a whole hour and i haven't seen one jet pack not one so it is true i walked a darker path after shinnok went down you became a different person red lightning black clothes authoritarian attitude adjustment about that what happened to dark you hmm how come you're an only child and i got an evil twin as an immortal i exist outside the normal laws of time that could explain why i am affected differently thanks weird isn't it not being in charge that's what's weird that and having daughters our age look at her how do i have a kid with him at least she's not an actress come on at least think about it we each get points off the gross coming this summer johnny cage and johnny cage in time any thoughts on what we do next for months i've been receiving vague premonitions of the future but none of them foretold this i must confer with the elder gods liu kang kung lao please assist the special forces while i am gone yes lord reagan follow me commander yes mom i mean general i mean this is strange for me too you have no idea what how do i say this this morning we were on a mission and and you gave your life to save it [Music] son of a [ __ ] seriously yeah and now here you are young enough to be my sister cass you need to see this what have you learned about kronecker's effect on earth realm we're tracking sites around the globe with major temporal anomalies texture's still fuzzy our kid's something isn't she

called me private pumpkin huh that's what you called me we should get back to work biometric verification required id verified general sonia blade general blade dad would be proud untwist your panties older me i'm a star this is a military operation not a movie set i'm only the best fighter here but your daughter's got me sitting at the kids table our daughter is ceo a little humility might earn her respect dad always said hungry people eat lunch humble people serve it dad was an [ __ ] hollywood made us an even bigger one an old man just kicked your ass get lucky [Music] [Music] [Music] you

that order you did read the full report lieutenant follow my lead [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] oh that's freaky like friday the shot our face johnny the shot our face ah he's gonna get us killed funny way of saying howdy partner i was saying goodbye now why is a nice texas boy like aaron black in bed with the black dragon older you works for codal khan he's one of the good guys kinda when i pick sides i pick a winner every time you chose poorly cassie sonja breathe kiddo they took mom sonia i'll get her can we find out where they've gone tarmac b on it keep her safe oh oh take her [Music] ugh uh [Music] so [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] you can huh that game another extraction vehicle you won't be online long enough for your friends to make it tinhead cage cyrax defeated you when you were younger and stronger as i am his superior i am yours you're forgetting the time i beat shinnok mano amano oh wait you were dead when that happened go back to the 90s who's next i'm next hollywood ah [ __ ] as if throwback me wasn't bad enough oh it gets bloody worse sonia and your little girl they're gonna die right in front of your face no one threatens my family well well got ourselves a full-on generation swap here don't think so between ninja mime and lady liberty we've got all the leverage we're leaving [Music] [Music] so cabal go get my lesser half and the base taken care of uh [Applause] cathy don't [Music] let's go get them anyone else hear that beeping have i arrived too late you're back in the nick of time [Music] so good i'll be leaving soon to go after johnny and sonia i'll go too we're both going no raiden needs you for an intel op we need to get sonia back undoubtedly but cronica's behavior makes it clear that while mighty she is not all-powerful otherwise why would she attempt to steal ginsei think maybe she's still building strength a distinct probability then what's the next move with the dragon grotto's ginsei fountain sealed there is no

his bones shall i break for you wife surprise me twice you fought in the tournament and twice you failed why raiden thought you were contender baffles me fight was that your best ugh [Applause] seize the vessel and dump its cargo we need speed to overtake karon's fleet for the second time in my life i kicked the living [ __ ] out of an immortal my prize the hourglass now i can change history talk about redonkulous cosmic power but despite what you may think about beverly hills girls that is so not my style the chosen one thing is for the liu kangs and katanas of the world in the next timeline all i want is to be a model soldier to command the next generation of special forces we were born to defend earthrealm just like the heroes that inspired me my parents okay so there's one more thing i want my mom back not just for me but for dad he and my mom deserve a happily ever after retirement we'll never know how different things were the last time around but we'll be together a family and that's all that matters none of us saw cronica coming not even raiden but with the hourglass i can see every terror in the realms any sane person would run screaming at the sight of them it's my duty to take out these ancient all-powerful beings but to do that i need an elite squad of immortal gods turns out to make a new god you've got to destroy an old one so i hunt the oldest i can find an omni deity from a forgotten unpronounceably named realm [Music] it's the fight of my life but i've got something this god doesn't family in my past these were the people who mattered most now they're my god squad my daughter my brother in arms my goddaughter yep even johnny but only because cassie insisted and maybe i missed him a little just don't let him know that this whole adventure capital i insane i marry sonja i have a kid who actually likes me inquiring minds want to know how the hell that happens so i get the hourglass to show me how kicking shinnok's ass which i did beautifully turned me from hollywood megastar into global icon so far so good until i let that fame screw me up didn't hit rock bottom until i saw just how badly i'd let down my little girl i finally got what old man me was saying about needing humility and maturity but i also knew i couldn't get there without living the same life he did [Music] so i restored the timeline just as it was with one tiny little difference sonia's story won't end underneath the rubble of some busted up netherrealm castle because johnny cage flicks always have happy endings [Music] you
