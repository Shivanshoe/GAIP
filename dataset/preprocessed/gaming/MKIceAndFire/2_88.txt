evacuation i just don't have the manpower left in the city if you find it tell your men not to engage i'll deal with it do you really think scarecrow's crazy enough to detonate a chemical weapon in gotham i won't let that happen jim in case you need to reach me it's going to be a long night we've got a 1033 in sector 2 missing patrol car unit 247 suspected officer down hey batman every damn time

penthouse in chinatown i swear that's all i know if you're lying i'll break the other one the other one oracle check the chemical analysis i've just uploaded sure is this what i think it is scarecrow's new toxin an uncontaminated sample you're not kidding i'll prepare a full chemical breakdown on the back computer what are you going to do got a safe house nearby i'm going to pay him a visit let's hope this is the break we've been waiting for [Music] [Applause] this is the place i should check those on the top floor oh don't worry you'll get what's coming to you when we're good and ready why do we have to wait we can give her a dose now be my guest i'll tell scarecrow was your idea i was just joking didn't sound like a joke would you think i wanted to know i was going against orders have you seen him yeah up close he's done something to his face hasn't he looks like he's taking a knife and cut chunks out of it rumor is he got his face torn off by some freak called killer croc really looks deliberate to me yeah well i guess he figured he should look the part you know like a scarecrow that's messed up man speaking of messed up why is she here i'm here because your boss has an inferiority complex after all he's only human nobody asked you freak they offered her the chance to join she said no scarecrow's gonna use her as his new lab rat pamela eisley able to control plants with her mind really stick around and maybe you'll find out i've seen it with my own eyes one of the guys who brought her got torn into by some giant tentacle you make it sound so grass it was beautiful man what's wrong with this city it's just full of freaks you are not wrong check compressor five we need to be ready to go when we get the order i can't say i'm surprised you should really review your security i've seen trees with faster reflexes something tells me this wasn't part of the plan well that's made things a little more interesting sir it's batman he's here were you expecting to find me that man i'm afraid i must disappoint you take a look at the chamber i want you to know the fear that is coming listen freak we're walking out of here nice and slow you try anything stupid i'll blow her brain down charming but only one of us is getting out of this cell no no nothing like a little natural immunity [Music] [Music] what are you doing here why did scarecrow lock you up no hello tell me and what if i don't want to then i burn every plant in gotham it started with a meeting what meeting everyone was there penguin two-faced riddler even poor harley scarecrow said he had a plan that together we could take you out and gotham would be ours over my dead body i believe that was the idea i told him that i wasn't interested in his pathetic human games and when i came to i was locked up in that room it's such a shame that his vile toxin has no effect on me nature always wins will he ever learn [Music] you're coming with me you only had to ask what's wrong go go go we've got the target sir he's cornered don't move are you sure it's him confirmed it's batman sir that tank they have backing them up is unmanned good i thought this would be tough all it took was one tank 16 millimeter cannon operational [Music] fire suppressor [Music] moving to chinatown they'll be there any second [Music] [Music] we need to leave i need to know where those tanks are coming from i'm tracking several transport helicopters moving into the city there are more on the way activate the batmobile weapon diagnostics it's time to go to war simulation activated weapon energy system diagnostic test online stage one destroy targets to charge up weapon energy and activate missile barrage diagnostic stage complete stage two charge the missile garage to level two to destroy up to four targets diagnostic stage complete stage three taking damage to please weapon energy charge up missile rush to level two and destroy four active targets to complete diagnostic tests simulation batman i'm seeing a transport deploying more tanks at panesta studios i've warned gcpd to pull their men off the streets i'm heading there now [Music] come in all units this is commissioner gordon we have numerous hostile tanks to point across the city gotham is under attack i want everyone off the streets and back to gcpd we're not equipped to deal with what's out there thank god there's someone who is so jim tell your men they can resume their patrols the tanks have been dealt with thank god let's hope they were the last don't count on it i need the isolation chamber prepped at the gcpd lockup i'm bringing in ivy [Music] district [Music] good to have you here batman bring her down to the lock up on the lower level what the hell what is that thing i thought we were under attack any progress with the fear toxin analysis it's gonna take a little while longer drop by the clock to her when you're ready and i'll show you what i've got so far who taught you to drive [Music] scarecrow's gonna break you batman honestly why do you even bother with these meat sacks civil unrest there's a war on the streets we don't have the manpower or the equipment well look who it is ivy that's one less thing to worry about is the isolation chamber ready glad you're putting it to good use oh good another cell [Music] you feel safer now that i'm all locked up the reality of the situation is this why do you waste your time helping these pathetic creatures so primitive compared to plant consciousness you know these walls won't hold me for long still if it makes you feel safer i'll indulge the fantasy for now each and every one locking me up is a sign of desperation batman i can see it in your eyes you're afraid and a six-man element you can't lock me in here like some human the only people who get in or out are our guys it was harley who broke me out of that police cell in bloodhaven why don't you try arresting her they're right we're outnumbered out gunned and understaffed but if we work smart we'll get through this and take back the city piece by piece come on answer the phone damn it just about here one stuffed beer and a canister of titan formula owned by being aka unknown we had to let being loose after the arkham city fallout guy was messed up anyway serious titan withdrawal my guess he's off somewhere getting clean and he's not going to be happy when he comes back one vial of titan formula one set of wind-up explosive false teeth one pair of actual x-ray specs one toy gun loaded with one toy flag and five real bullets all used by the joker no known alias it's one hell of a toy box i'm glad no one's gonna play with it again one custom tailored top hat worn by jervis tech aka the mad hatter guy's mad all right he tried to brainwash batman in arkham city he got the wonderland kicked out of him instead i hated letting him go this guy's too creepy to stay free two ceremonial swords used by rosh i mean we found these at the bottom of wonder tower the night of protocol 10. they were covered in blood no body though one arkham asylum branded shock collar worn by killer croc aka waylon jones we found this thing in the sewers under arkham city and that ain't good because it was supposed to keep that bastard under control one rifle and two wrist mounted guns used by floyd lawton aka deadshot another guy we had to let go after arkham city got shut down still that doesn't mean he got his toys back one pair of shock gloves worn by the electrocutioner aka lester buchenski joker hired this guy on the night of the black gate riots and then he killed him i heard batman borrow these for a while before handing them in i guess he prefers beating up punks the old-fashioned way one electric charge gun used by batman aka we don't like to ask batman dropped this here with the rest of the arkham city evidence nice to have some of batman's gear in the evidence room hovie doesn't ask for it back one mask and jacket worn by anarchy aka lonnie i wasn't even a cop when this kid tried to hit gotham no one's seen him since no one knows where they're keeping him i guess the government don't like anarchists too much a selection of body parts belonging to warren white aka the great white shark white got himself sent to arkham on an insanity plea he lost a few things other than his mind while there made the new look work though i gotta say one freeze ray used by mr freeze aka victor freeze we uh had to stop playing with this after the commissioner caught us making ice cream freezes kept quiet since leaving arkham city maybe batman finally talked some sims into him one ventriloquist dummy aka scarface this ain't the original scarface it's a joker knockoff don't ask me why but the clown took a liking to these creepy things one laughing gas grenade one snare trap and one baseball bat all used by dr harleen quinzel aka harley quinn during a recent assault on the bloodhaven police station from what we gathered scarecrow sent harley to break out poison ivy from the lockup in blood one black mask worn by black mask aka roman zionists scion has never really recovered from the night of the black gate riots the night joker showed up roman was an old school gangster joker well i'm not sure what he was tell ya i'm sorry [Music] one ceremonial sword owned by talia al ghul miss al ghul was a wanted terrorist and an associate of her father race but joker got to her before we did from what i hear batman put this blade to good work after she died one tommy gun used by peyton riley aka the ventriloquist or maybe the gun belongs to the puppet i never really understood what's going on there i don't remember you being an expert screw you damn bureaucrats we're on our own we can handle it jim what's the latest we've got incidents cropping up all over the city cash give us a rundown all right let's see first up we've lost contact with the fire crew from station 17. we've got their last known coordinates but they're not going to survive out there on their own for long then there's this it's a strange one body turned up we didn't have long to look before the evacuation but the forensics boys seem freaked out real nasty also we've had several sightings of the riddler creeping around the train yard knowing that guy he's got to be up to no good look i know you're busy but anything you can do to help is going to save lives don't worry jim i have someone working a lead on scarecrow i'll see what i can do good to hear i've got a skeleton crew searching gotham south and west i'm gonna join him when i'm done here we're gonna find that son of a i'll look into these later scarecrow's the priority good luck out there yep poor bastard you ain't gonna be able to live hey batman i guess scarecrow gave you the slip you broke my wrist for nothing he's got plans for you batman you and all your friends tonight's the night we finally break the bat oh this thing's had a serious upgra she's a little sluggish i have a feeling you'd say something like that give me a few moments and i'll bring the afterburner function online thanks i losers have some more upgrades ready soon i have messages for you all to the vandals who stayed behind behind the police department's walls you will not be spared and to batman i have already won emptied your city with a vile of toxin and a few threatening words that's how little the safety you provided was worth and when the dawn comes when gotham lies in ruin and i turn my gaze to the world beyond the legend of the fat man will be worth nothing at all [Music] identity [Music] do i come in the bat cave start messing with all your stuff you've managed to reduce the compound to its core elements but there's nothing in there that we can trace what if we'd been looking at this the wrong way instead of searching for the toxin what if we focus on the manufacturing process why didn't i see this the reaction emits a unique radiation spike run a scan of the city for this energy signature it will show where scarecrow is creating a sphere toxin it'll take a few hours to bring the satellites into position we don't have enough time i'll repurpose the antenna at the movie studios bruce i spoke to dad i hate lying to him he'd kill me if he knew i was still in the city he still blames himself for this we'll stop scarecrow jim we've got a way to find out where crain's working from thank god what can i do get your men ready as soon as we've got a location i'll let you know all right it's confirmed there's got to be someone left in gotham worth robbing [Music] you left me to die in the asylum but i will show you no such mercy the generator is damaged i need to bypass it and power the antenna directly hello again mr wayne how can i help you this time is the power winch ready for deployment it's 100 functional though no guarantees if you're intending to pull that car of yours up the side of a building you read my mind it's in the job description mr wayne that wing's on its way [Music] so uh function once it's attached just hit reverse and please be careful with the car mr wayne she's one of a kind [Music] uh uh the anchor point is secured to the wall i can't move it using the batmobile but maybe it can hold the car's weight oracle i've restored power to the radio antenna great i'm connecting now i was just talking to robin i think you should too bruce you need me out there we can find scarecrow faster together what you're working on is more important tim can wait one night let me help i've got this under control okay listen try checking in once in a while we're partners remember he just wants to help you know is the antenna ready yeah but we're going to need a microwave tower to triangulate scarecrow's location there's one at falcone shipping in the cauldron i've marked it on your map thanks oracle [Music] look at your city abandoned in terror by those that fled torn apart by those who had nowhere to go [Music] i need to evaluate the threat and plan my attack and need to reach a vantage point to draw them outside if i can separate them they'll be easier to take that down out there you two go take a look the door stays locked i'm taking no chances there's three of us [Applause] three more soldiers inside they think they're safe if they stick together lucius i've got a hostage situation three gunmen i need to take them all out before they can react is it ready flexible plates over an mr fluid armor layer you'll move faster hit harder and look scarier while doing so send it lucius now already airborne mr wayne [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] well mr wayne let me walk you through it the outer and inner layers of the bodysuit are made of a titanium dipped tri-weave it's between those layers where things get interesting wayne tech mr fluid hardens in response to impact with this kind of shock absorption you'll be able to put more force into your counter attacks the liquid armor is more flexible than the fibers you're accustomed to as well you can use that increased maneuverability to take out multiple foes in quick succession the suit's compatible with the batmobile's electromagnetic attack mechanism too you'll fly out of that thing like a bullet from a railgun speaking of which the new grapno launcher will pull you skyward just as fast don't worry mr wayne that suit can take the g's how's it feel mr wayne i've activated the ar training program should you want to run diagnostics or just break it in simulation activated foreign simulation activated simulation activated simulation complete so simulation activated simulation complete activated so simulation simulation oh you're activated freaky simulation activated oh uh three gunmen one hostage time to put this suit to the test [Music] the new suit is faster and more mobile by getting close without being detected i can get the jump on them and in the panic take down all three before they know what's hit them [Music] help me i need to help the hostage before i activate the ant man they said you were quick but i never saw anyone take down three-armed guys like that unbelievable you're safe now i'll send someone to pick you up thank you tell me you're gonna find scarecrow that son of a needs to be stopped oracle i've attached the uplink to the microwave tower perfect i made an anonymous call to gcpd they're gonna send someone to pick up the hostage come on come on connect love the suit by the way okay both towers are fully online time to find scarecrow i need to use both antennas to identify the micro and radio wave frequencies across gotham if i can find both frequencies at the same location i'll know where scarecrow is manufacturing his toxin the radio and microwave frequencies point to ace chemicals that's where scarecrow's producing the toxin jim i've traced the fear toxin today's chemicals that's crane must have bought them off or worse i'm in the area i'll round up my guys and head over hold off until i get there jim i'm on my way [Music] remind me to hit a toy shop before we leave [Music] ivy and scarecrow had some sort of falling out i think he may be breaking out the weight killer [Music] any word from inside nothing we think there's a skeleton crew left in there but they're not responding and the facilities locked down if they're still alive i'll find them they should be able to tell us what scarecrow's up to what the hell [Music] take cover [Music] your vengeance will come this ends tonight [Music] friend of yours stay here and i'll go find out [Music] [Music] oracle whoever this guy is he's assembled an army i need a name all right we've got something here from a black ops team operating in venezuela they discovered a hidden training facility housing soldiers bearing the same insignia there's nothing with speculation on their commander though the only thing sources agree on is his name the arkham knight the arkham knight hack into their comms i need to know what they're planning anything else there's a crew of ace chemicals workers left on site they'll be able to help us track down scarecrow and locate his bomb i need to find them each worker will be carrying a unique id chip if i can access their personnel records i'll be able to track them there's a security terminal and a booth near your location try there there are five soldiers each one armed and dangerous before i can access that terminal i'll need to take them down so it started sure looks like [Music] ah it's safe to access the terminal let's see if oracle was right data connection active data decrypting someone needs to upgrade their security protocols oracle i've got the id codes if i reach a high vantage point i can use the bat scanner to locate the workers okay i've marked the tallest structure in the area on your map try not to fall this is perfect i can release the bat scanner and search for the workers i've managed to intercept some radio traffic between scarecrow and this arkham knight relaying it to you now i had him in my sights i could have ended it right there we have not broken him yet it will come now i've waited long enough batman dies tonight why do you hate him so much you could never understand your revenge is in hand this is his last night i'll make sure of it any idea who the arkham knight is sounds like the two of you might have some history i've made a lot of enemies [Music] are you seeing the spike on the internal router and don't worry it's nothing okay oracle they've killed one of the workers damn it we've got to stop them listen i've managed to hack into the militia comms network you'll be able to listen in on any channel like broadcast from now on thanks oracle i found a way to get the batmobile into the compound they'll pay for this all of them gates open time to bring in the car we've deployed a diamond back to the main courtyard sir we'll crush him gotta love their optimism your 60 millimeter cannon will penetrate these heavily armored units but it'll take a few direct hits to destroy them sir he punched through the armor just like you said he's searching for hostages keep non-essential radio chatter to a minimum they'll be listening you are listening aren't you batman then listen to this to all embedded units and gotham operation savior has begun each one of you has a rule each of you knows your room so move out of this damn city and lock it down i want our hands wrapped tight around gotham's throat within the hour off this guy yeah but we can't help thank god you're here go go go spread out keep your guns trained on it if even looks like he's planning to leave that room open fire oh and avoid the bat symbol at syria it's a little trick it's where his arm is the strongest pay for the weak spots the shoulders first then coordinate fire at the points where the plates meet please you say something leave him out of this always defending the weak and the helpless it's what i like about you predictable and that's why we're gonna win we know your move before you do we know how you think do you know what i'm thinking right now of course you're thinking who the hell is this guy no i'm just trying to decide which one of you i'm going to take out first i just thought we're both on the same page here i fully fully intend to kill you but first we're gonna make you suffer we have the target just say the word and how endless gotham will be ours oh oh uh who was that guy he kind of looks like you you're safe now you don't know the half of it batman scarecrow he was stay calm and tell me what you know they've been running the plant for hours they brought in trucks weapons soldiers shipments of hazardous materials they knew exactly what they were doing he's producing his toxin on a massive scale it's a bad real bad we're talking about a gas cloud that could cover the entire eastern seaboard where do i find scarecrow i i got no idea all i know is he's moving ahead with his plan and he's got a whole freaking army backing him up we're screwed batman i'll stop him but first i'm getting you out of here wait by the batmobile have you found scarecrow not yet it's worse than i thought how much worse can it be he's building a bomb big enough to cover the entire east coast in fear toxin take your men and get out of here head to gcpd and lock it down keep everyone inside i'll get my men off the streets but i'm going nowhere you bring anyone you find to me jim it's too dangerous you'll stop him i know you will [Music] [Music] hold tight i'll get you to commission recording all over the city gotham is overrun if i don't stop scarecrow's bomb there'll be no city to save great work i knew you wouldn't let us down we're not done yet jim i'm going back for the others i'm back um so [Music] [Music] anywhere near the city [Music] so i'm watching sir the tanks can barely touch alpha target's vehicle offensive capability way beyond expectations he destroyed the tanks hey don't worry we've got more yeah but not here i just hope i survived you're better than this gotcha [Music] that's two dead workers now i should have stopped this [Music] batman look i've been talking with robin i really think you should consider letting him help you you're up against an entire army she's right we're a team the city needs both of us i can handle it robin i've told you what you have to do now do it this can wait no it can't you know what's at stake i need you to stay focused or things will get worse much worse you shouldn't be so hard on tim he only wants to help don't let your feelings for him cloud your judgment i think i want him out there in harm's way i'd rather he stay out of it but he could help you if robin can't save those people the fallout will be every bit as dangerous as scarecrow's bombs oh that's three dead now these animals are going to pay we'll stop them we always do right are fully operational i will attack you guys i'm here guiding now give me a troll i'm trying everyday this is as high as the elevator will go hey you on your feet this way move no please ugh around is chipping in on this one it's all part of scarecrow's plan yeah the knight took him for every penny they had how'd he convince them but he was convincing enough to get a 3 billion army 3 billion to take gotham talk about overkill this isn't about gotham it's about batman oh i'm getting out of here uh it's okay you're safe you're too late we're both already dead you know about the bomb he's building right where is he i heard him saying he was in a central mixing chamber you know what that means he's getting ready to release his toxin i've seen what that stuff does to people if that gas gets out there it's gonna be chaos i won't let that happen i'm getting you out of here get to the elevator jim i've rescued the second worker i'm coming to you what about scarecrow he's in the central mixing chamber as soon as the technicians are safe i'm going after him is it as bad as it sounds worse jim but i'll stop him you have my word this elevator is the only way out and it's busted how are you doing cheers [Music] alfred i saw sam initial scans indicate that the craft is unmanned and being controlled remotely weapons locked deactivated me did you feel that one so much more interesting come nice on i wish i could be in there but then you know you just hold back oracle scarecrow is preparing the bomb in the central mixing chamber i need a way in and i need it now i'm working on it but i'm gonna need a couple minutes find it barbara patience is a virtue you've heard that right these two were lucky scarecrow's forces have murdered the other workers bastards take them back to gcpd but be careful jim here's militia all over gotham what are you going to do oracle i need that route to scarecrow we're running out of time you're not going to like this there's only one entrance and it's been sealed from the inside what about the service tunnel it runs behind the main wall of the facility i've sent you the location what are you going to do thank improvise is the strike team ready first we need to focus on stopping scarecrow then i'll deal with the knight [Music] batman i think i found a weakness in those drone tanks i'll investigate and report back soon i think he took out our tank are you sure the soldiers are covered by that sentry gun i'll have to take them out quickly to avoid detection just follow protocols batman we made it back to the precinct god knows how there are tanks everywhere the bastards must have been planning this for weeks dig in and do what you can jim i'll deal with them as soon as i've stopped the explosion we're all counting on you batman we'll get through this i know we will i need to get the car into this area before i use it facility i say again this is the final evacuation order anyone left behind will die painfully and afraid i just got word that phase one is complete right now our client is preparing to engulf the city in a cloud of fear deaths do not forget your training gas masks useless respirators useless only two things can keep you safe men getting underground or as high as you can above it exposure to toxin causes severe psychosis and in extreme cases self-harm you've all got your assigned rendezvous point so be there or god help you and when you're there sit tight we've got drones on the streets watchtower scanning the skies all we need to do is babysit this city and let arkham knight and scarecrow work out a few personal issues with the bat come dawn every man here gets to enjoy their very generous retirement plan got it sir we heard that the consignment of the fear chemical was moved off-site that is correct those resources have been assigned to phase three of the operation any more questions no good now i'm going to run you through this again so we're all clear right now our client is preparing to engulf this city in a cloud of fear gas do not forget your training gas masks useless respirators useless only two things can keep you safe men getting underground or as high as you can above it exposure to toxin causes severe psychosis and in extreme cases self-harm you've all got your assigned rendezvous point so feed it look out it's the fat he's out of the car take him down i've just run a simulation based on the mixing chamber capacity he's not bluffing bruce i guess now we know why he evacuated the city he needed control of the plan only ace chemicals has the facilities to build a bomb of this size the fallout will be huge we played right into his hands he didn't care if everyone ran he knew that no one would be able to escape the blasphemy of nightmares a forsaken symbol of batman's failure a monument to fear but more than that we're about to turn gotham into the epicenter of a blast that will transform the entire eastern coast of america into my domain i need to stop the chemicals being loaded into the mixing chamber once i clear the room i can focus on stopping the explosion it doesn't matter get those loaded and there's nothing he can do don't stop them nothing what you do he's here there come on need i remind you that we are on a tight schedule here gotham is going to pay for what his savior did to me [Applause] he's running the occupation just keep moving loaded [Music] it oh that the chemicals are stopped which can only mean that you are here batman i've been looking forward to seeing you again do you really think you've won fear makes you predictable i am in complete control [Music] how do i shut it down let me go but she dies what are you talking about barbara gordon have you found him get out of there now relax no one knows i'm here nothing hurts like losing one of the family knowing that there is no one to blame but yourself alfred i heard what that maniac said to you sir i've been trying to contact miss gordon unfortunately with no success keep trying [Music] what are you doing it's too late you can't stop it i know i'm not trying to stop it but i can reduce the blast radius and what will happen to you that doesn't matter find her alfred neutralizing agents these canisters are highly volatile i'm going to have to move slowly be very careful sir i urge you to reconsider evacuate now if you're caught in that blast you will die there's no other way alfred there's always a way sir please i have no idea it's my fault they took her she was aware of the risks master bruce she'll be as angry as you are that she's allowed this to happen sir listen to me don't you see this is what he wants without you gotham will be at his mercy you cannot let him win reduced i'm monitoring that facility you're out of time i'm making you leave now it's what you taught me do the right thing that's all

the blast but eighth chemicals is still about to explode you need to start looking out for yourself after all you're brooding for two now um [Music] [Music] alfred oh thank god when the explosion i thought you might be it's okay alfred i managed to reduce the blast radius and prevented the toxin from spreading into the city but what about scarecrow or this arkham knight character they've got tanks missiles their forces are all over gotham crane got away i was exposed to his toxin good lord are you all right remember what happened at the asylum it's okay i had a bad reaction but it's over now i've really got to hand it to scarecrow i've never been a fan of his concoctions until now but this patch it's intoxicating it really brings out the me in you sir did you hear what i said

heading there now alfred analyze the militia forces troop deployments equipment movements i want to know exactly what i'm up against i'll perform a full analysis of the occupying forces and report back shortly you're afraid you've always buried your fears block them away deep in your subconscious of your mind something even you can't control the crap cauldron unit destroyed [Music] [Music] wait to see the look on his face when you tell him his daughter's been kidnapped and it's all your fault this is going to be classic i've alerted all aircraft [Music] i've got to go batman's here what's wrong jim come on you're scaring me it's barbara she's been taken no no no i spoke to her she said she got out she left hours ago stay calm we'll get her back which one who's got my little girl scarecrow they took her from the clock tower all right we need to go there could be a clue something that will lead us to her i'll follow stay in contact you've got to tell if it's your fault at some point that's and the great thing is i'll be standing right there when you jim i need you to stay focused it's dangerous out there drive slow and let me deal with any trouble why did i let this happen there's no way you could have predicted this jim it's my job to predict it as a cop and a father the whole thing's gone down on my watch [Music] your priorities vehicle down just one more to get that's it that's the last of them we're clear it's too dangerous jim get in the batmobile i'll take this to the clock tower just get us there in one piece batman we're running out of time sir before you head to the clock tower i thought you may like to hear the analysis of the arkham knights forces you requested what have you got alfred i've set the bat computer to analyze militia presence across the three islands and provide you with a real-time representation of the occupation's strength in each zone as you can see miyagani island is heavily occupied with a substantial drone ground force controlling the roads founders island is the malicious stronghold protected by long-range radars and a missile launcher i'd recommend keeping the batmobile away from there for the time being the remaining drone forces on bleak island have been redeployed to protect the clock tower so expect significant resistance thanks alfred i'm heading there now sergeant yes sir he strikes the squads down take control of the clock tower drones he's coming switching to manual control i'll stop let you know when it's safe to head inside rattler's been hit whatever it confirmed there are militia troops all over the clock tower chip you'll be safe in the batmobile i'll let you know when the area is secure i'm not just sitting here while you go after those bastards yes you are jim barbara wouldn't want you to get yourself killed i'll be in touch the minute i'm done a second it's too quiet i'm okay yeah yeah me too yeah it's not safe to enter without taking out the militia troops on the roof of the clock tower we're wasting our time that's not gonna show the bus says he'll be looking for that gordon chick we've got tanks patrolling the area no way he'll get through that [Music] issues nope maybe the tank's got them so we lost him start checking for mid-down jim the area's secure meet me in the clock tower [Music] colleen is that you again candygram oh don't pass out just yet come on show a little spine [Laughter] just wait till your father gets home he's going to be furious about all this mess uh ah nothing like a trip down old memory lane hey bats and now a front row seat to the main event you would have thought old jim gordon had been through enough first some handsome young maniac cripples his daughter now he's blaming himself for her being taken you really should tell him this is your fault bats i'm sure you'll understand i mean it's not like you went out and got his daughter killed well not yet anyway the night's still young oh god no this isn't your fault jim of course it is [Music] crane's done this to get to me i should have been here there's something i need to show you we haven't got time she's not like us identity confirmed [Music] she's strong jim stronger than you realize she works for you this is all your fault i will find her she's my family my daughter she's all i've got [Music] i never should have trusted you never [Music] i'll do this on my own stay away from my family i think that went quite well considering of course i wouldn't have told him but that's why it's so liberating being me you've got a lot to look forward to bats i need to find out what happened to barbara they covered their tracks by disabling the clock tower security cameras if i hack the municipal cctv system i should be able to monitor all access points to the building so that's the arkham knight he's got barbara i need to confirm which car he took her in there that's the vehicle they took barbara away in those tires are amartech d60s i can program the batmobile to track their unique tread pattern it'll lead me right to them now that i think about it how did scarecrow know to go after your i.t department i mean i had no idea she worked for you when i shot her i just got lucky lockdown clock tower authorization batman [Music] if i'd only had a video camera when i swept barbra poor old jimbo had to make do with a slideshow [Music] what's with all the rain suddenly penguin don't look so stupid with that umbrella the tire tracks will lead me to barbara i can use the batmobile forensic scanner to follow them alfred i want the arkham knight's name as do i master bruce he has presumably chosen that title for a reason where do you suggest we start arkham city go through the files of every inmate who was released following the death of hugo strange and alfred they knew about barbara activate the batcave security protocol don't drop your guard that's a big place alfred the militia have deployed a device it's burrowed deep into the road yes i see it similar devices are being planted across the city i'll investigate it's a bomb alfred a well-armored one oh dear in that case uh should you really be standing quite so close i'm going to set up a remote link to the bat computer and hit it with every virus we've got once we're hacked in i can expose the core and defuse it with a controlled explosion very good sam though i should warn you that the militia has already deployed a platoon of its unmanned tanks to stop you they won't sir the virus upload has destabilized the device if you move too far away and lose the connection it will flatten everything within a ten block radius as you predicted sir i'm trying to defuse the device i drawn your request that have been deployed damage he's hitting us hard these machines are relentless i like you they don't give up they don't hesitate they don't hold back and they are not afraid of you batman your time's gonna count batman the bomb's payload is exposed i can use the power winch to trigger a controlled explosion it's hit dark knight i've got this whole city wire to blow try and disarm the explosives and you'll face even more of my drugs you see i've waited years no one is taking this from me i'll get i suspect the arkham knight wishes to discourage outside intervention oh crap it's batman get us out of here alfred the arkham knights trail leads into miyagani island lower the mercy bridge i i can't sir we're locked out the militia must have hardwired into the transport control system find me their access point right tracing the network traffic it seems to have all been re-routed to grand avenue station then that's where they'll be i'll proceed on foot and take over their access point i'll contact you when you're able to lower the bridge with militia drones and troops listen up man we control the bridges stay alert watch the skies [Music] [Music] what do you see when perched on high pray that no longer fears you a dead city that heralds your own demise [Music] i need to clear them out and find the access point they're using to hack into the transport network good we're gonna need it you think he's coming i know he the drone is not catching us off guard he better not batman access that terminal i don't know what scarecrow in the arkham knight will do to us so what happened the chemical factory blew up but i don't see any giant clouds of fear gas batman happened he went in there leave them we need to look out for ourselves period nothing we could do for him all these years and you still fight like a coward he's creeping up behind you stick together with the arkham knight's men taken care of i can use their uplink terminal to lower the bridges [Music] isn't that barbara's job oh right and all the excitement i almost forgot you don't really believe old jimbo's gonna forgive you if you save her he holds a grudge bats i should know alfred i've re-enabled the bridge controls marvelous i'm rebooting the network now forget scarecrow it's time to face your one true nemesis batman oh dear is that who i think it is enigma contact me when you're ready with the bridge riddle me this why would a batman visit an abandoned orphanage eddie sweetie you've confused me with robin the big guy and i aren't all that close oh oh i know it's because of what will happen to his feline friend if he doesn't get here in time shock dark knight stunned you didn't expect this did you that is because you are no match for me edward the riddler and your intellectual superior did you think i would just forget our last meeting dark knight you humiliated me i know you will not beat me this time it is utterly impossible you cannot do it i have won already i will mock your attempts to solve my conundrums i will stand triumphant over your bloodied corpse and as the dim light fades for good in your tiny dullards mind your final thought will be how i have bested you come to the orphanage detective or she dies [Music] doesn't look good that's what i don't cut it you want to break the bat the forget scarecrow two face penguin and the rest of those punks nick was the man with the plan the riddle guy yeah i'm not buying it trust me this guy's iq is through the roof you want to catch the darkness you need to be smart that nigga's smarter than all you've put together if he's so smart how come the bat's still out there enigma's got a plan you'll see you don't believe me go ask catwoman she's right in there all tied up and wait for the bat to come save her that's when the fun starts um riddler has catwoman tell me why i don't know anything i swear i just tied her up and left her inside why what's nick must play i ain't got a clue i just brought her here and planted some of those trophies nearby that's it you gotta believe me i do batman that had better be you and you had better be sorry keep still are you okay perfect what little girl doesn't dream of being bait for her strapping dark knight we're leaving you might be but i'm not ah both contestants are finally here tonight folks we've got riddles galore but first let me introduce my beautiful assistants i'm growing tired of my dependence upon the least useless drugs i can scrape from gotham's utterly uninspired underbelly yourself let's not waste any time here no doubt you enjoyed that detective it's the most fun you'll have all night you see dark knight this spicy felonious feline has been fitted with a shiny new collar with each challenge you complete you'll get one little key collect every key and the kitty goes free remove it too soon and the kitty goes boom [Laughter] [Music] well don't just stand there dark knight take that rocket-fueled roadster of yours and make your way to the cauldron train yard my first test is waiting i'll be back soon you'll be back right away guys like eddie let me be until i started playing nice with the bat it's unlike you to get caught was it an ambush blackmail a trap he invited me what he said he had a job a job of the cat burgling variety i'm pretty good at it remember not all of us scamper around on rooftops at night because we want to help people you big brooding boy scout now where's my key don't keep me waiting sir i've regained control of the bridges good work i'll contact you when i'm in position at mercy bridge well batman oh boy this is quite the dilemma isn't it do you save the incompetent friend who got herself kidnapped or the incompetent friend who got herself kidnapped personally i go see eddie's latest contrived death gauntlet i'm sure he went to a lot of trouble slides you can't save all of barbara i killed half of her already [Music] i'm heading to mercy bridge to pick up the trail of the arkham knight's vehicle good luck over alfred i'm at the bridge one moment sir i should probably warn you there's a significant militia presence ahead newly noted i managed to access the files miss gordon was working on before her abduction it would seem she found a weakness in the drone sir a direct hit from the vulcan gun on their sensor array should destroy them with a single shot [Music] it's still operational what's the diamond lock the island down kingston you're finished is down [Applause] the arkham knight must have taken oracle and moved on i should examine the vehicle more closely the car veered off an empty road why looks like the driver wasn't wearing his seat belt i should find the body traces of pepper spray on the right side of the driver's face oracle must have been in the passenger seat and deliberately caused the crash clever i should check the area where she was sitting the door was torn off during the crash if i can find where it came to rest i can determine exactly what happened torn cleanly off the hinges the door must have been opened before the crash oracle got out i need to examine the reconstruction pinpoint where she landed marvel got free of the vehicle before the crash huh oracle stopped here someone took a shot at her i should analyze the point of impact for ballistic evidence [Music] the caliber of the weapon is a match for the arkham knight's sidearm the trajectory and impact velocity points to a shooter that matches his height at this range he couldn't have missed a warning shot i've missed something oracle knew she couldn't escape but she caused this crash for a reason she must have left a clue while crawling away so mr wayne lucius article left me the scrambler device at the scene of the crash decrypt the data so i can pinpoint the arkham knight's location ah this kind of thing was more miss gordon specialty i'll see what i can do but it'll take me a little while i'll meet you at wayne tower when you're ready alfred give me an update on gotham's most wanted one moment sir right these two are just in a mysterious hooded figure has been spotted on a rooftop in grand avenue he appears to be standing beside a burning bat symbol sir it might be wise to establish whether this interloper is friend or foe reports are also coming in of a blaze at the bristol fire station one suspects arson sir as the power to the building has been cut disabling the fire suppression system you may wish to investigate i'm heading to wayne tower if we can decrypt the arkham knight security protocol we should be able to track his location if he thinks he can hide from you sir he's in for something of a surprise [Music] um near wing tower [Music] [Music] nice of you to drop in mr wayne i suppose you weren't really dressed for the front entrance have you finished the decryption fully decoded i've downloaded all recent militia radio transmissions and their corresponding coordinates to your machine thanks lucious i can scan the network for the arkham knight's voice print and determine the location of his last [Music] identity broadcast good evening mr wayne upload waveform for analysis now i've waited long enough [Music] scanning tonight for voice print match location verified got it the knights transmitting from the miyagani tunnel network [Music] glad to be of assistance mr wayne but while you're here we've been working on some further upgrades for your car let me know where you'd like us to focus our efforts [Music] ah you'll like this wrote it myself when i saw what you were up against this evening the drone virus hijacks the militia tanks weapon systems and causes them to target their allies an upgrade to your weapons generator will let you overcharge the batmobile's secondary weapons you'll be a force to be reckoned with excellent choice well prepared right away now if there's anything else you need i'll be here all night it's not like i could leave this city even if i wanted to bruce it's vicki are you there i know you're listening to these messages look if it's about that article blame ryder i had nothing to do with it i swear call me okay i miss you bruce brucey you do remember me right um listen i had like so much fun the other night you were nothing like what i read in the papers anyway call me when you got this i got a couple of cute friends who are dying to meet you mr wayne lex luthor calling apologies for going via your direct line but i grow tired of these games has made a very generous offer for wayne tech's applied sciences division yet your persistent unavailability begins to look less like a busy schedule and more like deliberately antagonistic behavior come now meet with me i'm sure we can come to an agreement the man of your refined taste doesn't need an applied sciences division after all he needs another billion [Music] bruce dollars kate you're coming to maggie nice engagement thing next week aren't you no one's seen you in monsters and you taught me the importance of keeping up appearances [Music] you have to new messages uh bruce this is your father calling it's time we had a talk son you know about the dressing up [Music] next new message this is [Music] it's vicki are you there i know you're listening to these messages you know if i'd ever been curious about your identity i would have torn off that mask years ago i always figured the truth would be a letdown but i have to admit masquerading as gotham's least interesting socialite is one hell of a cover story the dead parents are just icing on the cake [Music] hmm you had to go and spoil the surprise i was hoping to keep her under wraps until she's ready next generation disrupter she's still a couple of weeks from completion but i figured you'd appreciate a working prototype i should have her with you later on this evening thanks lucius i think i might need it i hope you can get barbara back mr wayne she means a lot to us all of us [Music] take care mr wayne you know where to find me alfred i've traced the arkham knight to the miyagani tunnel system excellent news sir but i'm detecting the significant drone presence in the area it would be folly to engage them without the batmobile noted shall i open the south entrance hold off until i get there alfred i don't want to spoil the surprise grand avenue you've got contact heavy contact off the rattler drone town rattler he got a drone i bought the drone look down we lost one sir you look like a fool alpha target hit going for the kill target hit a drone drone unit destroyed at the gardens alfred i'm at the tunnel entrance open the doors just a moment sir i'm accessing the building's security mainframe alfred there's another blast door i need you to open it have you made any progress on the cure getting there hey i haven't heard from barbara for a while is she okay she's fine she's working on something for me it's important but she's safe right don't worry tim just keep working on that cure oh that's how very me of you though i can see why you didn't tell him after old jimbo's hysterical overreaction still if you care about barbara the way that little sidekick of yours does maybe she wouldn't have got kidnapped in the first place the star patsy like me and you shame they're being torn apart thanks to your crusade [Music] recap barbara is kidnapped and let's face it probably dead you're lying to lover boy wonder about it and dear old jim's marched off on his lonesome to save the day not your best day at the office bats something on your mind come on let robin out of this cave you can't force him to save over your cure plus if he gets himself killed out there you won't have to tell him about barbara it's win-win you think you're really gonna fix your nasty case of joke riders not a chance i'm chronic fruity lingering we both know there's no cure for me can you remember when it was simple back in the old days when it was just you me a regular walk war against crime well take a look bats things change now it's just war with you standing right bang in the center of course like with any war there are casualties it's inevitable unavoidable like death well maybe not death i seem to have sidestepped that one still not all of us are so lucky unless you know exactly where to shoot you're good dark knight even better than i remember it's gonna make it even more satisfying when i kill you oh and don't worry about barbara i'll take better care of her than you ever said batman's in the control room show him what happens when he messes with myself you're not getting through me justice get over here [Music] we're gonna make you suffer oh [Music] oh [Applause] that guy doesn't know you very well and a handful of tanks will stop the batman batman just took out a diamondback then let us hope he has miss gordon with him rocket mods keep them he's away close but i'm on the road got another one the driver isn't the arkham knight but he'll know where i can find him i should get back to the car it's under attack he's nice how does it feel to be chasing the wrong man where is the arkham knight ah you won't i did you think i didn't know you were tracking my broadcast location it's a lesson batman i know how you think which means i know how to beat you where is he with barbara gordon she's ours now can you imagine what the night's going to do to her what are you doing no you can't do this where is he he's gone to see the little man the penguin he supplied the safe houses for the attack the night's gone to pay him for his services that's it that's all i know please stop remember something else he uses a refrigeration company as a front the trucks distribute weapons throughout the city what's it called north north refrigeration thank you alfred i need you to find out everything you can about north refrigeration of course the mayan crown y penguin's supplying arms to the arkham knight and right now he's the best lead we have to finding barbara i'll look into it right away sir ah i can see mr fox is trying to contact you lucius mr wayne your new batmobile upgrade is ready to deploy the batwing is enroute to grand avenue sir i've discovered an exploit the arkham knight was using to broadcast a vial gauntlet rest assured that all of our communications are securely encrypted should i lock him out to prevent further disruptions keep the channel open alfred the more he talks the more i know about him drone's been hit you're gonna lose [Music] [Music] sir we just tracked a fast-moving aircraft heading in on grand avenue this thing just pulled a j-turn blocking it at 12 g's i don't know anything that can do that i do show him what it needs to go the weapons generator mark 3 allows the user to overcharge secondary weapons increasing their offensive capability batman wrecked up kingston unit offline sir i've been looking into north refrigeration as you requested it seems master grayson has been investigating them for some time good tell him to send me what he has he insisted on seeing you in person sir he's on his way from bloodhaven with the pertinent information he'll meet you on a rooftop overlooking the ranilla ferry terminal thanks alfred in the meantime sir scans have established that the arkham knight has mobilized his senior lieutenants in armored personnel carriers throughout the city we currently have a lock on one such vehicle should you wish to intervene and remove them from the battle let's see what nightwing's got on north refrigeration if i find penguin i'll find the arcade indeed sir master grayson confirmed he'll meet you on the building overlooking the ranaler ferry terminal [Music] [Music] still lurking around on rooftops you shouldn't have come here not tonight look are you kidding me when i heard about barb north refrigeration tell me what you know penguins using freezer trucks to smuggle weapons out of bloodhaven now i think he's stockpiling arms right here in gotham the question is where cobblepot's the best lead we have on barbara i need to find that weapon's cache if i can intercept one of his trucks it'll lead me right to him huh if only you knew someone who's been tracking their movements what you didn't really think i'd come here without a plan did you i'll handle this you're needed back in bloodhaven come on bruce look let me help you can't do it all on your own it's too dangerous i won't risk losing anyone else bloodhaven needs you all right i can take a hint but if you want to keep tabs on that truck you're going to need this it's a prototype straight out of r d the old foxes have done itself this time i'll see you around bruce i can disable enemy weapons using the disrupter sabotage ammo i've only got three shots i should pick my targets wisely the crate's electrified now anyone trying to resupply isn't for a shock you look like the guy that disabled the firearm if i use the disrupter again it will explode when fired knocking out the user and flooring anyone nearby equipment sabotaged time to introduce myself like i'm gonna tell you what's wrong with you we're all working for these briefs let's see a truck full of weapons and explosives i can use the disrupter's tracker ammo to tag the vehicle and follow it across gotham i'd better tag the truck startling the thugs inside now i just need to give them a little motivation to lead me back to their hideout what did you forget no no no it's batman get the hell out of here subtlety works every time if i stick to the rooftops i'll be able to follow them right back to penguin's weapons cache the vehicle tracker will remain locked even through buildings as long as i keep the target in view and within range what the hell are you doing are you trying to kill us we need to get out of here where are we going back to the lockup are you stupid that'll lead him right back to cobblepot so what do i do just keep driving maybe we can lose him can you see him i'm driving here okay okay i can't see him you think we lost him how do i know keep looking we gotta be sure before we head back thank god head back to the hideout before he finds us again we did it we actually did it screw batman he's overrated couldn't even keep up with this in this piece of crap [Music] anyone follow you they led me straight to penguin's weapons cache yeah right get your ass in there the boss wants to talk he said don't be late how come we're stuck up here while the boss holds his meeting i guess he wants to place kept safe from oh batman i'm more worried about two-face i don't buy this alliance crap still i'd rather work for two fish than scarecrow that guy scares the hell out of me yeah he's done something to his face something nasty my plan is to stay as far away from scarecrow as i can i suggest you do the same [Music] so what do you think he did to his face oh scarecrow for the love don't you listen to a word i say oh yes sorry i was just thinking god the worst city in america it's not that bad oh come on take another look you see anything worth saving me i'd burn this place to the ground and start again for a split second i thought it was batman them and the boss chatting away they don't kill you just feels like hit with a sledgehammer yeah well it came from over there [Music] the roof was heavily protected this must be the way inside [Music] come on do something you're making me look stupid here what do we do about the man batman don't worry about batman this is gonna be great he doesn't even know you're here come on he couldn't even keep up with youtube in a crappy little truck he's overrated anyway listen up i've got something to say as you're aware and this truly breaks my eyelids we've been working with the other freaks to take down the bat together i know i know it's been hard but look on the bright side we're bloody rich the arkham knight barbara gordon tell me where they are so that's who he had the commissioner's little girl i'll break every bone in your body cobblepot hey we're going to see some keys are called simon stag i think he runs a pharmaceutical company or something do not lie to me i'm not i swear they said he's about to leave goffin those airships over the west river it belonged to him put him down we'll shoot but we'll do you any good scarecrow's gonna break you you are going down batman all them sturdy i've been working on my swing watch and learn gonna knock his head right out of the this is you handling it right i don't worry you can thank me later try not to make you look too bad hey hey buddy this is gonna hurt [Music] we can't let any of these weapons get onto the street this cash needs to be destroyed bruce you need to let me help i had it under control i told you i need you back in bloodhaven now scarecrow these weapons this all affects bloodhaven too the best place for me is here look with the amount of weapons penguin has been running into gotham this cannot be everything he must have other caches in the city search this place for evidence it should help us locate more of penguins refrigeration trucks what a wanker let's put them out of business eh seriously do you believe that accent that he only puts it on to sound scary please what are you doing bats come on don't lock me in here i'll do anything i want your laundry done i'll do it help out alfred you got it i should back away from the vault i'll be too close to the blast i'm going after barbara i'll contact you as soon as i track down any of penguin's trucks thanks dick i appreciate it what are friends for bruce alfred find out everything you can about simon stag the pharmaceutical magnet of course sir now what have we got here a good old-fashioned ambush oh you wait there bats let your dear old uncle jay sort out these chumps i could handle it though it has been a while maybe a little rusty you're ready to see some joker moves this is going to be great they're not going to see it coming i'm gonna well you'll see target spotted exiting via roof hold position and wait for fire order the turrets have got them covered just say the word and we'll take them activate sentry guns on my mark three two one i need to find somewhere i can get a clear shot to take out the militia ambush [Applause] he's probably dead anyway it's always raining and sticks alfred what do you have on simon stagg now let's see ceo of stag enterprises a company that specializes in advanced medical research and development i'm heading to stag's airships now scarecrow was on his way there and that's our only link to finding barbara the threat analysis indicates that founders island is covered by the militias long-range radar and missile launchers the batmobile will be detected and targeted as soon as you cross the bridge don't worry alfred i'll go in on foot and stick to the rooftops find me the schematics of those airships right away best of luck sir sir stags airship's been hooked and tethered we're reeling him in good get in there and lieutenant i'm assigning you an extra unit for car duty scarecrow boss wants to come aboard [Music] [Music] [Applause] hungry for your downfall my screech so what gotham city just happens to be home to batman and a giant flying bat come on [Music] you here recon team stumbled on one of the riddle guys hideouts he sounds crazy the militia have captured stagg's airship and set up a watchtower with sentry guns looks like it's controlled from that central command point i need to take it out that soldier is equipped with a device that can track my detective mode systems if i use it for too long he'll be able to pinpoint my location and alert the others airship oh god okay i've taken out the militia now to disable the tower i'm at the airships what did you find well the ship's original schematics reveal a service hatch that should be accessible from the top of the aircraft it would seem mr stagg is rather protective of his research i expect the security to be high thanks alfred lucius how's the remote hacking device coming along i think i'm about to need it maybe you should add clairvoyance to that job description mr wayne i'm uploading the latest encryption software to the device in the vaulted wayne international plaza you can collect it from there he won't recognize this city once we're through we'll be everywhere so there's a service hatch on top of the airship i can use the remote hacking device to get in the hatch is locked from inside if i can locate the control panel i'll be able to bypass security using the remote hacking device does it work of course it works never seen anything like it that's because it's new state-of-the-art drone technology what can it do we went over this in the briefing the controller that's the soldiers are using an unmanned drone if i can download the security codes from the soldier controlling the drone i'll be able to turn it against them now i've got now i can turn that drone against them [Music] hmm that trapdoor sure looks inviting doesn't it look at the size of this thing i haven't measured i think it might even be bigger than your cod piece there's no way you're going to be able to shift this i see you have found your way in sir any sign of mr stag not yet but the arkham knight and scarecrow's forces have moved through this place killing everyone they must be there for a reason sir what are they planning barber's the priority when she's safe i'll deal with them but sir you have the chance to end this now capture scarecrow and you can save the whole city it's what miss gordon would want i'm not losing anyone else alfred i should now have full rotational control of the airship stability system however the hacking device will only work within a certain range of any controlled terminal so i've been waiting for a shot at you batman come on i'll cut you to shreds those soldiers have got stag and from the look of him he won't last much longer i need to save him where are the files i'm not telling you you want us to cut off your fingers i don't mind we start with the fingers and see how high we go before you tell us please we will find them you know we've got crews tearing this place apart the longer it takes the more you hurt choice is yours they can't have them they're mine correction we're yours soon they'll be scarecrows and you'll be dead you just need to decide how many pieces get buried you hit mr stag some more see if you can help him remember where he put those files yes sir wow dude defend yourself [Music] batman oh thank god you're here are you sure all of these men are incapacitated thank you they they were going to kill me why what did you do nothing these animals came in and just started shooting they were collecting those cylinders nimbus generators a totally clean power cell technology we've been developing where's scarecrow he's on the second airship did he have anyone with him oh you mean barbara gordon i think we both know she's probably dead don't we bats [Laughter] oh [Applause] [Music] that's the last time you'll see him nearly bats i could feel you losing control there a little more of that delicious fear gas and it will be all over for you so [Music] stag's been taken to scarecrow on the second airship i've been analyzing the schematics and it appears to be defended by automated gun turrets there's a security terminal in the research laboratory towards the rear of your current vessel you should be able to disable the turrets from there did you think you stopped me at these chemicals batman you merely delayed the inevitables gotham is mine to do with as i please and the same can be said of your friend poor little barbara gordon close your eyes can you see her cowering in the darkness cursing the hero who failed her she has become your weakness your obsession dragging you deeper into the abyss i could have her kiss right now it would be cruel sadistic brutal but i have other people talk about what happened down there i wasn't trying to kill you i was trying to kill your mind so uh we still pounds friends for life anyway don't blame me blame scarecrow and his patented joker liberating miracle tonic he comes in here he's dead [Music] i've downloaded the codes i can name it the drone or its designated targets to turn it against them one hard drive sir good work i want this place stripped fair mr stack thinks he can keep his files hidden he's wrong we're gonna tear this damn airship apart to find them what about the bats that's what the drone is for let him come i'll drag his corpse to scarecrow myself [Applause] he's using smoke ah target loss spread out i'm gonna check for casualties nothing this way now that they're out of the way i can use that console to disable the airship's defenses hmm the weapon system controls are locked behind a scanner keyed to stagg's fingerprints without a clean set of his prints i'm locked out maybe the cctv camera feed can help me i should scan the footage to see if stagg's hands touched any surfaces during the abduction i might be able to reconstruct the full set of prints stagg will have left a hand print on the floor there i should check for other places he touched there's more chance of getting a full set of prints he touched the floor after he was thrown down the stairs i should search for more prints he touched that railing when he steadied himself i should find more prints to reconstruct a full set stag left a handprint near the exit to the room i know where stag left his prince now i just have to scan those locations [Music] oh what's the deal here reconstructing a match using i've got an index fingerprint here three locations left to scan what do you think they're going to do to barbara i've completed reconstruction of stag's thumbprint two spots left to scan i've been able to reconstruct stagg's middle fingerprint one side left i've got the full set i should be able to access stag's computer system now so you're going to use a reconstruction of staggies handprint to access the computer oh that's genius bats really oh i know when you're done let's hack his online dating profile [Music] welcome i can't remotely disable the turrets on the other airship but i can control the turrets on this ship that's the weapons dealt with scarecrows next sir regarding the identity of this so-called arkham knight what have you found nothing sir none of the former arkham city inmates who remain unaccounted for fit the knights profile widen the search when joker took over the asylum dozens of inmates escaped focus on young men with military experience downloading the files now sir [Music] what the hell did you do to me helped you idiot anyone who touches you now gets a thousand volts the malicious combat suits can temporarily carry an electric charge i won't be able to hit them when they're in that state counter this one frank it's here this should help apologies for the interruption mr wayne but i can ready another upgrade for the car if you'd like to take your pick the localized emp blast will disable nearby vehicles and incoming missiles ideal for when you find yourself in a tight spot excellent choice sir nothing like a short-range emp blast to afford one a little breathing room but don't worry the batmobile's immune [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] no match for you oh [Music] um gentlemen an announcement our one-time friend mr stag neglected to keep the cloud verses charged and ready for operation we will need to do the job ourselves i need men in biological engineering varying energy cells to charge the device and i need more men to defend them do not fail me the revised formula works perfectly it passes through clothing and is readily absorbed through the skin and eyes gas masks are useless the results are horrifying combined with the cloud burst the potential is world changing and lucrative yet dr crane remains uninterested in commercial opportunities he intends to squander our work my work on a vendetta it's time to dissolve our partnership i should leave gotham before his return user id when dr crane approached me i thought the man had finally realized the value of his chemical expertise but no he's still scarecrow to the bone the man invents a formula that could cure depression turn an entire army upon itself and he uses it to frighten people fine dr crane i'll keep working on your cloud burst but i'll keep working on your toxin as well i'll show him there's money to be made here one way or another human testing has not been the breakthrough i hoped for i want to go the cloud burst works perfectly though i've temporarily obscured that fact from dr crane i must perfect his formula myself first patient number four two weeks after exposure how are we today daniel um daniel would you like to go home [Music] mild terror permanent damage not good enough october 14th now we're getting somewhere in fact we've had to restrain the patient haven't we miss i'll kill you i'll kill you all fear toxin may be dangerous for you and your loved ones prolonged exposure to fear talks in maine dues episodes of extreme psychological trauma i'm telling you that they just keep making this stuff sound better and better alfred stag and scarecrow were working together on a project codenamed cloudburst but if that's the case sir why is scarecrow attacking stag stag must have double-crossed him he's here for the device i'm giving you remote access to stagg's computer network search for anything related to the cloud burst i need to know what it is please let me go i've got so much money even batman won't be able to stop us but you couldn't stop yourself from the train scarecrow for a little more uh i'm sorry i'm so sorry no you're not sorry yet but when scarecrows talks and starts pumping into this cell i think you just might be oh god no i've seen what that stuff does someone help me it'll attract a lot of attention when i take out the mini gunner i should leave him until last all right all of you we need to charge the cloud burst and stop batman from getting to the boss fail at either of those objectives and that will personally make sure you're sucking up fear gas with stag got it it's over there come on target oh to stop it the batman is here do not let him not a problem [Music] i think keep looking all right everybody keep calm stay alert keep charging the machine how much more does that need we're done what scarecrow says we're done okay our work is nearly done my calibrations are almost complete and the cloud burst will soon be charged it's over guys it's over he went this way i'll tell you everything one i uh i okay okay look uh scarecrow came to me he needed my help with the cloud burst what does it do no no no don't let them touch me the cloud burst stag tell me what it's for i don't know it's all over my skin it's crawling all over my face i should leave you to your nightmare okay this is it the moment we've both been waiting for scarecrow's just down there so are you gonna stop him and save oracle or am i going to get another hit of that delicious gas while you watch helpless as she dies how do we decide roll up roll up it's the pictorial scarecrow so where's our first contestant you the one with the ears step up and have a go what's your name sir bruce so which one will it be bruce bad luck bats [Laughter] you're not dying it just feels like you are my toxin is filling your lungs drowning you in your greatest fears what can you see the city engulfed in fear betrayed by those you trust the most your darkest secrets revealed as i tear your mind apart i will cut that mask from your face and the whole world will see the fear in your eyes then they too will understand there is no savior no more hope no more batman maybe it's already happened what look at me i'm amazing and this body i can't believe how strong it is stay back such brutality you will move [Music] [Music] you need to do something you need to stop him good good good something's changed you're different i prefer to call it a work in progress but it does show potential you're trapped there's nowhere to run who said anything about romney [Music] uh sir scarecrow is broadcasting across gotham you need to see this how does it feel to see your city on the brink of ruin your friends in the clutches of death you stressed yourself too far this time bad man and now your failure is all but complete as that final dying breath escapes her body she will know you are the one who failed her alfred he's holding oracle at the safe house in chinatown i'm heading there now please hurry sir once in a lifetime opportunity couldn't turn down a chance to kill batman this will go down in history trust me don't hit the banks they're spoken for no i don't think i've ever killed a firefighter before what we hurry all the way here and cranes killed her already he's got no sense of occasion we both know fear is theatrics batman so permit me the indulgence of putting on this show maybe i got bag faced wrong oh here comes the toxin i can practically taste it [Music] what's happening barbara yes you see it now the horror behind the glass the monster that will be your end unless you pick up that gun and deny him don't listen please please no barbara it's me your friend [Music] you won't get me i won't let you get me you will bring death to all who follow you sir what's happened she's gone alfred what do you mean barbara scarecrow was punishing me he killed her no oh my well so we need to focus the people of gotham need you i should have protected her alfred she's dead because of me sir please listen stag's files have revealed what the cloud burst does it's a dispersal device sir don't you see scarecrow has the means to engulf the entire city in fear toxin you stopped him from making it operational but it's only a matter of time sir did you hear me he heard you he is wondering how he can live with himself master bruce don't let miss gordon's death don't let it be for nothing oh you can't bring her back let uncle jay take charge no more bad memories no more pain no more fear scout honor ivy oh no sir alfred run a satellite scan of the city let me know the instant you locate the cloud burst of course where are you going gcpd ivy was immune to scarecrow's toxin you think she will help she doesn't have a choice batman what happened if the safe house was not some cruel game it was necessary tonight is about more than gotham it's about what you became in that room the hero who failed that's what i want the world to see idiot yes good to see you batman i think you're finding that weapon hey man are you okay watch yourself whoa what the hell happened on that airship scarecrow took the cloud burst i'm guessing that's bad where's gordon he's still looking for barb i can't reach him tell me you found her batman cash i'm sorry no don't say it not her if gordon comes back here lock him up he goes after scarecrow it only ends one way i need your help from where i'm standing you need a miracle why didn't the gas affect you you are scared you would be too if you knew what scarecrow's planning and i should trust you why because without your help every plant in this city will die about that miracle i created a spore to counter the effects of crane's toxin it's easy when you know how and can manipulate plants on a molecular level could it protect the entire city theoretically but there's no way i can produce enough on my own then let's get you some backup where to the botanical gardens they're the oldest plants in gotham they'll tell me what we need to do oh cash the shutter door isn't opening what's happening there's one big mother of a tank driving around out there it doesn't look friendly neither do i open the shutter door and i'll scan it from the rooftops see if i can find a weakness i'll open it try not to get killed there's the tank i'll need to scan its hull to find a weakness i can exploit units that's the rear scanner now i need to scan the sides i've already analyzed this section this section's already been analyzed i've already analyzed this section that's the right side scan i just need to scan the left side this section's already been analyzed i've already analyzed this section the cobra drone has enough firepower to rip the batmobile to shreds in just a few shots and its armor is too thick for my weaponry to penetrate head on however there is a weakness the drone's rear exhaust port leads straight to the power core one well placed shot with the batmobile 60 millimeter cannon should take it out i can use the radar to track the drones movements and get behind it for a clear shot at the exhaust port cobra scout destroyed impossible we know what caliber rounds he's using the armor was impenetrable you can't just roll a single heavy armor unit into the field and expect to crush him under it he's better than that initiate stage two attack protocols deploy all cobra units in group formation mr wayne i trust that tank didn't give you too much trouble i thought you'd like to know that the batmobile upgrade you requested is ready for installation at the clock tower facility assuming the car's still in one piece of course thanks lucius hmm [Music] [Music] an electromagnetic pulse designed to temporarily scramble drug weapon targeting and divert incoming missiles now to get ivy to the botanical gardens thanks alfred i'll need to take them out before i drop off ivy you're not drawing me out batman a question did it hurt watching her die how did you do anything cobra offline i've got support nearby i'm sending it in complete we've got nothing quicker next time whatever you're planning it won't be enough i can't fix this tonight ends with gotham's ball and me watching you die try and get me to the botanical gardens in one piece batman or you can kiss that miracle goodbye [Music] we're here ivy what now look at her she's been here since before man walk the earth she still holds great power but she's weak poisoned by decades of pollution she won't be able to fight scarecrow's toxin on her own then we need another there aren't any left like her not anymore what happened what do you think man you cut them back built over them stop them from reaching the sun if i can locate the roots could you revive them they're lost buried beneath this concrete monstrosity how will you the bigger the plant the deeper the root you wait here i'll find a way to break them free [Music] lucious i need a way to track an ancient root system it's deep underground i'm sure i can throw something together but it may take me a little while come to wayne tower when you're ready thanks lucius alfred give me an update on gotham's most wanted let's see nightwing has been tracking another of penguin's trucks this will undoubtedly lead to another cache and a chance to rid the city of kabul part in his flood of weapons we also have a robbery in progress at the bank of gotham in chinatown surveillance footage confirms that the perpetrators are known associates of two-face perhaps mr dentis misplaced his coin whatever his reason he needs to be stopped thanks alfred alfred i'm heading to wayne tower parking garage let's see what lucius has come up with to locate ivy's plant mr fox hasn't failed you yet sir so whose throat are we gonna slit first he's gonna take him real soon you know lucius open the parking lot entrance i i thought you were here already mr wayne must be a glitch in the system i'll get that checked immediately mr wayne the perimeter's been breached we have some uninvited guests spotted way so mama offline okay got him lost direct hit yeah that appears to be the last of them your upgrades ready for collection i'm outfitting the batmobile with the latest and ground penetrating sonar mr wayne just fire out a pulse and the on-board computer can generate an image of what you've scanned below and yes it's sensitive enough to detect long-dead plant roots assuming they're there to be found lucious we can't risk another incursion lock the building down and transfer remote production to alfred consider it done mr wayne good luck with the gardening master bruce i'm afraid those drones were just the beginning i've detected a significant redeployment of vehicles from founders island into the north and south of the city it seems the arkham knight is tightening his grip i'm ready for the balfour there good sampler i'll find you and when i do you're dead it's batman alpha target wiped out the drone here in kingston i found a way to track the root systems beneath gotham follow the roots they'll take you where you need to go you must get closer you're too far away oh [Music] [Music] [Music] ah ivy they're attacking my plant protector keep firing bring it down yes sir establish a perimeter no one gets on this roof i can make her bark harder than steel but i need time i'll protect it i need more gonna make time it's done she's fully mature she should be strong enough to neutralize scarecrow's toxin let's hope we don't need to find out stay in the gardens ivy i'll let you know if the situation changes alfred tell me you found the cloudburst i wish i could sir but i'm encountering rather a lot of interference no doubt a deliberate attempt to disguise their movements run a full analysis of the arkham knight's forces of course sir but i'll need some time upload the data to the bat computer in the movie studios when you're ready yes sir in the meantime there are numerous open cases yet to be investigated alfred i'm heading to the movie studios prepare the analysis of the arkham knight stronghold on founders island it's time we took the fight to them very well sam the lion's den awaits we need to find poison ivy knight's orders no one told me we'd be going up against meta humans don't do that make it sound normal she's just a freak i saw a guy breathe scarecrow's gas once not pretty just open robin's down there right now planning his life with barbara probably thinking of names for all the little rugbats they'll have what a lucky boy she is so lovely although just a teeny tiny bit on the dead side for my tastes sir how are you going to tell master drake about barbara he'll be devastated he could do something dangerous i'm not not yet i need him focused on the cure sir it was bad enough keeping miss gordon's abduction a secret but this it's wrong we have to make sacrifices alfred consider those sacrifices wisely sir if he finds out she's gone and you didn't tell him you will lose him forever [Music] good to see you batman i'm guessing this isn't a social call is it as bad as it sounds out there worse but nothing you can't handle right henry adams current headmaster of the mccallum academy one of gotham's most prestigious schools calm down henry we're trying to save lives here i will not calm down i've had enough of your plotting and poking locking me up with these maniacs you have no right to keep me here no right trust me you're safer in here than out there it'll be done in a few hours if you cooperate henry adams is an anomaly he has been infected the longest having received a blood transfusion following a successful hip replacement operation after returning to work staff reported that he had changed for the better having become both calmer and more friendly when i approached henry after learning of his transfusion he refused to be taken into care and had to be forcibly detained i believe that if there is a cure to this affliction it will be found in henry fakes phonies charlatans all of them i'm telling you bats now i know how elvis helped you know after he boy died to draw blood look bad this robin he's an amateur a baby he doesn't deserve you bad see the boy's never brooded in his life couldn't resist king has never looked so good oh i've been playing around with a little diddy just for you batman i think you're gonna like it this time the goliath is ready sir the long-range scanners have not been able to locate the cloudburst deploy the batwing and run a low-level thermal scan we can't sir founders island is protected by two radar towers connected to a long-range missile launcher you won't be able to get the batwing or indeed the batmobile anywhere near there i can destroy the radar towers on foot if we can just find a way to disable the drones protecting them well there is one possibility i've identified a special drone that appears to be acting as a relay hub managing all communications if i can get my hands on that drone there's a chance we can reverse engineer the security protocols and give me a window to take out those radar towers a chance perhaps sir but it sounds dangerous too dangerous it's the only way i'll keep you updated i still haven't heard from barbara trust me robin she's fine i need you to focus on the cure you don't have to do this on your own bruce i can help you it's under control we need that antidote we're getting there it won't be long now look if you need help you know where to find me looks bad out there doesn't it the knights army is all over gotham i can handle it i hope you're right this is insane no no no this will not do there's no way you're sticking us in here brucy you'll be like some awful sitcoms two wacky roommates one quarantine fell i know comedy bruce this'll get old fast [Music] i thought for sure you were going to tell him come clean like you did with gordon ah but you realized why break him now when we can crush him later it's classic joker something truly beautiful is happening bats so i've been rooting around in this bad infested cave of a mind and it seems like you actually believe this cure nonsense oh bruce forget about the cure you just concentrate on taking out the arkham knight it'll be your swan song the last good thing you'll ever do her do is too powerful lex luthor's got a building somewhere around here right yeah over by the plaza you know there's rumors he might have put some money into this that ain't hard to imagine he's had his eyes on this city for a while he gets rid of batman he's still got bruce wayne to worry about terrifying [Music] [Applause] it's a pleasure to watch such resolve deliqued the relay chip will allow me to temporarily blind the drones that should give me enough time to take out the two radar towers i need to destroy the radar before the drone comes back online that's the first radar tower dealt with radar i'm coverage tech now it was batman leader tower p prepare yourselves without the target incoming [Laughter] the look on your face when you saw him i would have thought the big bad batman scared of his own reflection the son of a oh oh bruce i know how you feel about this arkham wanna bat the same way i feel about those cheap joker knockoffs you've got at the movie studios there can only be one joker bats and it's me i mean you go chaos i can use the remote hacking device to temporarily blind the sentry gun and purify the joker gene pool yeah i've got some interrogation skills did some jobs with a guy named alfred i've dealt with the radar now there's just the trivial matter of a long-range missile launcher once it's been taken care of i can deploy the batwing to scan for the cloudburst i'm heading there now we've lost the second radar he bypassed the sentry guns how is that possible just keep the missile launcher in play i control these guys both radars are down he's coming for us you think he lasted this long target lost spread out casualties over there so everywhere i'm searching for a walk-on [Music] oh the armor on the missile launcher is too thick for me to penetrate i need something with a little more punch it's being protected by a defense shield i can lower it in the control room i'll stay in the control room and bring the car in remotely i can't let the militia get in here and re-enable the defenses alfred i need you to lower the bridges of course sir i see you're making full use of the batmobile's remote guidance system sir batman's lowering all three bridges into founders island let's bring in the car to destroy the missile launcher deploy striking dealt at a target location now yes sir what about the batmobile activate we're squadron right into the crowd drone offline sending a cobra to support there's a whole world of hurt coming your way batman location i need to destroy the cobra technology drone was unable to acquire the target confirm strike on target target disappeared he's there find him we've lost one programming cobra to respond sir i don't think five tanks was enough [Music] he wiped out the drone unit launcher rooftops clear targets in the control room moving into secure hold off lieutenant he's mine [Music] you got me okay okay i give up where'd it go keep all access covered oh seriously he heard you boys coming from a mile away those pointy ears aren't just for show you know sir the launcher is secure as long as we control the skies he'll never find it good are we still on schedule we're answering the final things your patience will be rewarded soon there's no way he got out we had the door covered [Music] are you dark knight wake up again oh the arkham knight tell me you have a name i don't of the few arkham asylum patients who weren't recaptured and sent to arkham city none appear capable of organizing and leading such an assault he's not a ghost alfred he's got training and a grudge widen the search to include anyone ever committed to arkham because of me sir you heard me that's a great many individuals i know alfred i'm trusting you to narrow it down yes um do you think you get out with me you think i'm just like alfred the arkham knight's missile launcher is destroyed i'm calling in the batwing to start searching for the cloud burst upload the results to the clock tower once it's complete okay now we're done playing soldiers let's have some real fun we'll take turns you do a little bit of i don't know crime scene investigating or some of riddler's oc delightful scavenger hunt then i'll do some hit and runs in the batmobile promise i'll hand control of your body right back when my turn's done i'm heading to the clock tower offered upload the data from the batwing as soon as the analysis is complete seriously what do you mean we're posted on a rooftop opposite the biggest clock in gotham and you're asking me what time it is anybody seen that anarchy guy that kid loved it identity confirmed [Music] alfred pull up the footage from the batwings on board scanner certainly sir as you can see the batwing has completed an orbital sweep of founders island but there's still no sign of the cloudburst i will of course let you know when the situation changes but one moment sir i'm receiving an emergency broadcast from the movie studios that man i hope you can hear this the movie studios are under attack robin is in trouble listen to me very carefully you need to lock down that room we can't let the infected get out of course henry that's enough from you well look who's too late to save the day how's it going that brain it's been a while harley quinn so you don't remember me that's weird because you killed the only thing i ever loved and now i find you've been keeping a whole new generation of jokers to yourself i know awkward don't do it they're not stable oh they're not stable maybe you want to take a look in the mirror sometime alfred i need to get to the movie studios please be quick sir miss quinn is clearly volatile robin may be in serious danger no i told you we should have butchered that bunch of second-rate tribute acts they'd better not kill robin bats i had the idea first ah my favorite riot was probably black gate but this is top three easy so i had my mask ready and everything man are you still going on about that so you think she's interested oh harley you kidding me what come on you want me to spell it out for you it's just with joker gone i thought maybe no she's got herself some new jokers now and even if she didn't what makes you think you'd stand a chance with her yeah you got more joker chick what's your face christina bell right two personalities for the price of one i could put in a good word all you gotta do is ass forget it screw you guys get ready this is gonna hurt batman let's okay open voice print failure access denied nice try bad freak harley's changed the voice code access i can adapt the modulator i picked up from the arkham knights driver to synthesize her voice wow look who's too late to save the day how's it going batbrain it's been a while wow it's been a while look it's too late to save the day [Music] how's it going voice calibration complete now i can use the voice synthesizer to mimic harley's voice and open the door open something must have happened maybe the radio's busted if i find out that's black enough this ain't good what the hell someone took them all out it was that stinking bad-based loser get that chopper down here now i want more men on the roof and sentry guns covering the entrance don't even think about coming back down here until he's dead you hear me i need to secure the rooftop i can use the voice synthesizer to manipulate harley's men oh poor harley wasting time on those not pale enough imitations when i'm right here in you what's confusing me is how the hell she found your top secret bat base bad face she couldn't find her own reflection in the mirror when i was alive it's like something was holding her back what's wrong with the freaks down there they dying no they're changing where is he this way okay okay but be quick about it before activating an order i need to pick a target hmm [Music] nice ready kickback [Music] kickback check that weapons crate i'm coming oh thank god that damn thing didn't explode you guys okay listen to me stop listening to me that stupid bad brain loser is copying my voice somehow ignore what i'm saying i don't know how he's doing it but he's copying my voice ignore what i'm saying but now that i'm saying right now okay ugh how many morons does it take to kill a bat i'm guessing more than two he went this way that's the thugs dealt with time to go after harley ah memories you me an award full of psychotic killers you've never felt so at home have you oh come on you think you're different because you never killed anyone news flash you killed me i was there remember you destroyed my cure right in front of me watch me choke on my last laugh and then after killing me you said you would have shared you couldn't admit i'd won could you not even as a parting gift but now i'm on the inside oh we both know the truth yes you've killed before and tonight i'll make you do it again here he comes the big bad batman why don't you just you took your time you got overwhelmed uh what do you want hitting this one's conscious get off me when holly and the new jokers get back they'll kick your ass the infected where are they they're not infected they're joker harley's got him and they ain't leaving this place until you're a corpse how did she find us how did she get in i'd let him know if i were you he's not always in such a good mood how should i know i guess she's smarter than you think not likely let's check the bat computer good idea unlocking the whole building down no one leaves until we account for the infected she just walked in no alarm no warning something's wrong with the voice recognition maybe there's no trace of a hack if they're still here then the facial recognition software will find them got them albert king's in the wild west set looks like he's gearing up for a comeback bout they took christina bell to the haunted house set harley's left armed guards to protect her charisma is on the sound stage i can't tell what he's got planned all right we know where they are now all we need to do is get him back should be easy right henry what happened i don't know i think something hit me on the back of the head they were crazy you need to find them help them do you think she'll recognize me in this blank death mask you call a face i mean it does do expressions right henry lock down this door only let robin or myself back through nice place you got here i think my joker would have liked it kind of place he would have picked i ain't going anywhere near belle she's nuts she jumped on hudson scratched out one of his eyes right in front of everyone what did holly do nothing i tell you anyone so much don't mind if i do [Music] robin you wait here while i get behind him we'll take him down faster if we work together you'll know when you see it you sure took your time back there i was testing your self-control did i pass you need practice come on [Music] come on lady we need to get you someplace safe are you kidding me i'm getting front row seats anything happens to her holly'll kill you yeah he's right and if batman sees how you've treated me he's gonna knock out you and you well maybe not you definitely you and you oops [Laughter] well that evens things up a little anyway when he's done with you chumps me and bats will have this place all to ourselves so get out there and make him show you how much he wants me you heard the lady let's go jeez she didn't need to kill him are you done yet she's all locked up safe and sound that girl is very important to me so i'm not gonna take any chances remember who's in charge in here course upon now i say when you strike batman that you these idiots want to break us apart i tried to explain all the painful things you're gonna do to them over here they'll get away time to find a vantage point to cover batman when he strikes oh he's got one already eliminated in the very first episode of batman rescues christina you won't be spinning a book deal now's your chance kill that interfering little gooseberry third wheel brat robin robin he doesn't love you take him now batman strikes they need to have his back time to find a high vantage point boys you heard harley find batman and kill him not a problem you hear that fat freak we're coming to get you she broke in here she's got potential but she's a lackey at heart i can tell i bet she just flourished with someone telling her who to kidnap who to torture and when to shut up whose side is she on you think you're taking us down bad no chance keep fighting you're safer that way it's too dumb to figure that out there goes another one just go check the great over there worse than the joker at least he wanted us to win throw yourself i love it that's all of them time to go get miss belle so what she got against me i'm practically your prisoner too let's get her back in the cell so looks like you've made a friend you gonna replace me because i could use a break and christina here seems like prime robin material she looks up to you she wants to spend all her time with you i doubt she'd mind the awkward silences i'll take her back to the cells henry robin's heading your way let him in when he gets there of course i take it this means you stop one of those monsters yes but i'm not done yet this robin seems like a real improvement on that last one bats remember jason todd oh what a whiner always complaining we're both better off without that loser so what do we have here poor little batman all alone you want to hear this you come see me ignore this freak just you and me baby ugh boring like he's interested in a fight don't you know this guy he craves something more that wall don't look right go take a look creative something fun i'll show him fun two fists of fun and then i'm coming to see you charisma i'm gonna smack you so hard you're gonna be singing at the back of your head but first you'll have to find me and second well let's be honest old-timer you're a little past yourself by day where do you hello is someone there jason i i thought you were dead [Music] batman is that you batman's not coming to save you jason hook it's been six months now jason i think it's time to face that screw you that's the spirits you're a real chip off the old bat block not that it'll do you any good why won't you just kill me what oh no no no no i'm not going to kill you not yet anyway you're my sidekick now imagine it you and me out on the street starting fights picking on the weak a regular dynamic duo just like bats and that new kid appears no he wouldn't you think so this isn't batman then oh weird the pointy ears are usually a dead giveaway i didn't want to show you that photo really i didn't but well it was the only way for you to get closure now i know it hurts but sometimes you gotta be cruel to be kind sorry bats but i was this lock is mechanical with no digital components i won't be able to use the remote hacking device henry i need your help of course anything i need you to send me the cctv footage from the camera in stage c you can use the computer in that room to do it okay i'll try computers really aren't my speciality you can isolate the data using the panel on the right slide your finger along the dial and like this oh this technology is very interesting okay i can see the camera now highlight the track for the last 10 minutes so i see thanks henry [Music] uh charisma is wearing a bomb vest there are five other bombs around the room got it don't be shy there's room up here on stage for two no really i insist as you can see the crowd is so excited it may just explode nobody serenades you but me bats take it away boys take me on home to the asylum never alone in the asylum anarchy rule it was wild but through it all you never smiled joke's on you i'm in your head so look who's laughing now remember in our come city i killed your girl so pretty that was the night you let me die but when i looked you in the eye that's when i knew we'd be together look who's laughing now i'm stuck in your head and i'm laughing ah i feel you with dread and i can't stop laughing your parents are dead and i can't stop laughing what else can i do now i'm part of you i am the clown prince of crime and we've had a hell of a time you're part of me i'm part of you and now there's nothing left to do i just can't wait till i'm in control who'll be laughing then i drove you around the bend and i'm laughing i'm with you till the end and i can't stop laughing i killed all your friends and i can't stop laughing [Laughter] [Music] oh yeah i think i can that's all the bombs disarmed time to take down charisma now that my time is near i'm in your blood i'm so alive i only wish you'd let me drive it won't be long no encore and he's a professional singer even alfred sings better than this guy good work robin no problem call it my contribution to music let's get golden tonsils here back to the cells catchy number right bats i'll take charisma back to himself alfred we're almost done here and we need to make up for lost time prepare another upgrade for the car absolutely sir would you please make your choice the weapons generator mark 4 powers your secondary armaments to maximum capacity were you fighting anything less than an army i'd say we were approaching the realms of overkill sir excellent sir with this in the batmobile the malicious tanks are destined for the scrap heap well look who shot their mouth off too soon i guess it's just you and me now bats motto imano a real fight something to tell the kids about of course you could just turn and run like a little chicken you faced the rest now fight the best open the gate i don't get it what's that again just get the gate open okay but uh this don't seem right uh what do we have here then wakey wakey [Music] what's wrong you think i'm going to hurt you why i'm not the bad one here oh

quinn woman and her goons are trying to break in here there's no telling what she'll do to me stay calm henry i'm on my way robin wait here with the infected i'll go ahead and deal with harley's men you think she's okay who harley yeah i'm beginning to think for the wrong crew you are what the other said they're idiots true but they're not insane it's the woman and holly said do something the next she asked him to do the exact opposite she's always been like that even before the joker died i guess but we have to work for the fruit loop what if she changes her mind and just kills us she won't we're all she's got what would she do without us open the gate now no problem first she said shut the gate now she wants it open i think she's gone crazy that dumbass is why you're not paid to think it's some kind of bad trick oh look who it is batman's little helper looks like he left you all alone uh he figured i could handle you by myself he doesn't take you very seriously neither do i oh he's asking for it oh thank you funny for huh this time if you think you're taking him back to the south think again he's got the joker in him they all have that means they're mine i'm taking them now that would be highly irresponsible of me to allow that to happen batman took mr jay away from me once already he ain't gonna do it again you hear that batman i know you're out there yeah where are you bat freak what to face us how about that you're a trigger pull away from getting your little bitey brains blown out lady how do you take him we lost the out i'm impressed what can i say i'm

would be so kind go join your friend over there go to hell now [Music] nice move henry your turn baths [Music] evolution's a funny thing [Laughter] no matter how many obstacles get in its way the strongest always survives [Music] still you know what they say about evolution even amoebas can do it what are you doing purifying the gene pool even i don't know which side to roof for now goodbye it's been educational i changed my mind kill kill kill him now that unexpected you're gonna be spectacular [Music] all right you're the last joker that other sells for you i need to stop scarecrow when i'm done i'm locking myself away what if you fail you'll be too dangerous i won't be able to stop you oh no no no you're not going to do this you need to get in the cell it's the only choice we have left that's a defeatist argument bats and you know it i'm sorry bruce but it's the only way i know tim i'll stop scarecrow master bruce i'm reading multiple militia forces converging at your location it's the arkham knight he's found you i'll take care of it alfred are you sure there are rather a lot of them i said i'll handle it you'll be fine of course i will you train me security lockdown initiated don't worry about robin batsy i'm sure he won't die well fairly certain anyway hey i never finished my story about jason todd did i so have you got something to tell the nice man jason my name is jason todd who do you hate batman excellent of course you do did you get that bets kid's not yours anymore he's mine mine mine mine to do with as i wish hey i never asked what's the big secret who is the big bad bat his name tell me of course sir never could stand a tattletale that's why i like to work alone no one to spoil the punchline you should try it sometime after all you've seen what happens when you drag your friends into this crazy little game of ours you need to get in the cell it's the only choice we have left what the hell are you doing the right thing trust me i've gone crazy listen to me we can help you you don't need to do this alfred alfred you son of a you cut my communications sir are you okay i've lost communication with robin is he all right he's fine faulty comes unit i'm looking at him now thank god with all that's happening i feared the worst speaking of which the arkham knight has ordered a squadron of tanks into the city to lock it down and reassert control thankfully the weapons generator upgrade you requested is ready for collection thanks alfred you had featherhead slaving away when he could have been saving barbara [Music] it was cruel selfish and had horrible no no no don't tell me he's gone he's still out there i know he is batman doesn't retreat i'm sending in reinforcements find him [Music] so [Music] the web edge generator mark iv allows the user to supercharge alfred the cloud burst give me an update the batwing is still conducting scans of the entire city but there is no sign of it let me know the instant it's detected of course there are two new situations developing that may require your attention firstly i'm detecting unusual seismic activity on mirgani island also i thought you should know i've been unable to contact lucius for some time highly unusual behavior for mr fox a visit to wayne tower might be in order just to make sure nothing untoward has happened alfred i'm going to investigate the seismic activity on miyagate island i fear it's not going to be good news sir it seems nothing tonight is target spotted in the canal [Music] where the hell did he go he was right there alfred i've located the source of the seismic activity it appears to be increasing in frequency i know what it is and it's not good you just gave away your location it's time for scarecrow to pay for what he did to me i hope you're ready he's going to throw everything he's got at us i'll wreck his little tin toys he got don't tell me this is it you must have something more than a plan we're taking damage not losing here not again that's right you're not [Music] alpha target just to the diamondbacks no it's going to hell sir with batman protecting her i've deployed cobratics kill him or run him off the island i have a lock on his position now sir he's surrounded be wary batman they're sending something bigger to stop us they won't i can't help you further batman i'm not strong enough yet set he's not there spread out find him nearby i'm sending it three cobras operational he's gone alpha target spotted northern sector miyagani island you've run out of time sending a cobra to support i can't stop him you don't need to my drones will weed you out he's taking i should take ivy back to gcpd before the arkham knight launches another assault it's too dangerous to leave her exposed you're not safe here the knight knows where you are you're coming with me i won't leave them they can't do it alone they need me sir i think you may wish to take a look at perdition bridge the batwing has located the cloud burst scans reveal it is manned and emitting a huge amount of energy the arkham knight ivy get down yeah it's worse than i thought [Music] my plants are dying the cloud burst is amplifying the effect of the toxin you need to destroy that device or my plants won't be able to protect gotham you'll die if you stay here we'll both die unless you stop him god [Music] welcome to godzilla the city of fear sir i've never seen a chemical agent dispersed so fast i know alfred it's bad and sir the cloudburst energy field burned out the batmobile's power core what will you do i'm going after stag he created the cloud burst he'll have the means to destroy it very astute master bruce i only hope you can find him but please uh be careful of the gas do you see this batman your poisoned desolate the world sees it too thanks to the world we'll see what happens to the man who tries to stop me and when it does the world will know fear you aren't fighting for gotham tonight you're fighting for every desperate fool who thinks that when their worst fears come to pass a hero might come and save them and you're losing ah foreign ah stags increased the level of security since we last spoke guess he knew i'd be back only way past this door is via his voice prank taste of the new dynamic duo i've got so much money even batman won't be able to stop us voice calibration complete simon stag open stag got out somehow the militia won't spare him if they track him down i should deal with them first before i look for him i've synthesized the arkham knight's voice i should be able to order his men around he's busy he won't follow my commands scarecrow ain't too smart now is it maybe not it's too late i already have the cloud burst stag can help you now find him then throw the old bastard out of his own blimp what's he doing up here safer than down there that's what he did don't you need to wake up oh i'm gonna check for casualties i've still got stacks fingerprints on file i can pick up his trail of the container and track him down yes sir serpents activated and moving into position stag must have been crawling around on the floor trying to hide from the militia come here please don't hurt me tell me how to stop the clown burst or so help me i will hold you responsible for each and every person scarecrow has killed it's surrounded by a nimbus field it helps spread the toxin amplify the effects any vehicle not using a nimbus cell will be fried then you won't mind if i borrow one no of course not by all means get in there wow alfred stags given me a way to take on the cloudburst tank how kind i'm heading back to the batmobile i need to find a way to fit this nimbus cell to the main power drive but sir crane's toxin can be absorbed through the suit's fibers not even a gas mask could protect you if you're in there too long there's no telling what could happen then i need to work fast so how did you persuade poison ivy to come rallying to the aid of the city she despises threats blackmail charms she's dying my toxin strikes at the minds of humans but it leeches the life from her dr eisley cannot stop me you were to make her goblin's first line of defense [Music] look at this place i think we won no turning back now bats it's time to face your fears [Music] master bruce i hope you're not planning what i think you're planning it will be reckless and irresponsible even by your standards it's the only option alfred sir even if the gas doesn't immediately incapacitate you another dose could cause long-term psychological trauma i have no choice [Music] i need to remove the power core slowly or the failsafe lockbook again this is it that's can you feel the rest of the delicious toxin burning through your veins creeping into that demented mind of ours i sure can i'm getting stronger i'm more alive with every breath you take stay calm take deep slow breath deep slow breath oh [Music] [Music] your gray matter is turning green master bruce are you all right sir are you there give me a moment alfred i'll be fine [Laughter] you're not looking too good old boy it won't be long now till i'm behind the wheel oh just the other fun we'll have then brains brawn brutality the full package we'll have gotham that our mercy and you know what the best part is you'll be there with me every step of the way watching it all from the passenger seats i don't know about you pal but i can hardly wait [Laughter] master bruce are you okay better thank goodness that's a relief indeed you should know sir that the levels of fear toxin in the atmosphere are interfering with the batmobile scanners you may struggle to track the cloudbest ivy i can't track the cloudburst in this gas clear out as much as you can i can't batman my plans are too weak then tell me where to find another there's a tree berry deep beneath founders island the miyagani people called her ayanna i'll find it i'm on founders island time to scan for ian's roots close you're close no you're too far the other way [Music] find her please batman i'm getting weak she's waking up alfred i've located ivy's plan to process the remaining toxins but the sonar can't penetrate deep enough to release it one moment the new extension to the gotham subways under construction directly beneath your location i believe you'll find an access point in port adams will that suffice it's a start send me the location ivy your plants buried too deep i need to head underground hurry please [Music] i've reached the container yard alfred i need access of course sir i must warn you scans reveal there's a considerable number of the malicious tanks inside not for long they're between me and the plant sir they've locked the entrance it's a trap i got him he's my fort atoms we lost one sir multiple units offline glad you got the wheels back target strike diamondback's hit it won't take another strike now the target this is over rattler's been hit he's broken through the outer defenses i got him he's just wasting a twin rattler batman lost a rattler target hit a drone armor still attacks i can't see him he's there sergeant [Music] i can't believe you're still running errands for that titillating tree hugger honestly that i thought we were making progress here are you really gonna let plant lady turn this place into her own personal garden you've seen what's happening out there it's in joker wonderland what do you seek in those tunnels batman oh you will find none i once searched for terror in chemistry i thought perfectly arranged atoms could unlock the demons in a man's mind you proved me wrong the drone sensors are temporarily disabled but i can only hack one at a time so the previous drone will be back online drone offline true dread when it has you a stalwart knight ever ready to slay monsters fear isn't pure biology batman it's more than instinct true fear is the absence of hope and hope is the red wings of the valley shining on the clouds oh you're not still digging off of ivy's ancient shrubbery are you it's overpass barbara's dead gotham's choking on scarecrow's crazy juice and your popularity is falling faster than the flying graysons on bring your kid to work day there's nothing left to fight for you promised that gotham would be safe but what does the world see now my toxin choking its streets blotting out the moonlight poisoning the saplings you thought could stop me and now dark knight they turn to you but don't be afraid it's not your life that needs ending it's your myth the hope that you stand for the hope and die tonight do you need me to spell it out for you scarecrows one there's no city leftist with our roads to start embracing your joker's side must approach my sincerest apologies but my search for the arkham knight's identity has proved fruitless nothing i have a short list of candidates we cannot fully eliminate but no i have no likely suspects shift focus to former arkham staff hugo strange had ulterior motives quincy sharp was unstable are you saying the arkham knight is a co-conspirator looking to finish their work exactly you need to get closer batman find her searching she's waking from a long sleep [Music] it's free drawing attention you need to protect it i don't know how much longer i can hold on sergeant there's a weed grown tall churchyard coming down sending drones in now sir enemy spotted otisberg churchyard alpha targets get a drone confirmed contact with multiple organic defenses ivy's still helping him more drones batman's taking out a drone think of it as natural selection [Music] he knows she will grow stop him isn't strong enough to purify gotham multiple strike drones offline i can help you crush these tanks batman but you must stay close to the churchyard armor holding you wipe them out sir we're gonna need more tanks no now he needs to face me batman just stop stop acting like a hero stop thinking you can save anything oh you found another tree well i've still got the cloud burst you want to finish this come to bleak island then it'll be over batman i've cleared as much of the toxin as i can you must find the cloud burst it's killing my plan i'll destroy it just hang on so alfred raise the bridges he's not getting off blink island are you sure sir get the batwing to scan the cloud burst find a weakness i'll take out the cobra tanks on you're entrapping yourself with an enemy that has you severely outgunned no i'm trapping him we've lost the cobra maintaining search patterns [Music] look around batman look at all the good you've done we've lost one programming cobra to respond oh [Music] i just want you dead both are too well armored for a direct assault how's the cloud burst operating its power source is internal but the device has been modified with a coolant system to avoid overheating that's the weak point a rupture will set off a chain reaction destroy the cloud burst and take out the tank as well i'm reconfiguring your scanner to locate the vehicle's coolant lines good luck sir the scanner won't work from this range i need to get closer and avoid being spotted the coolant lines run close to the surface of the tank i should be able to rupture them with a shell from the 60 mil cannon but one strike won't be enough i can't stay near that gun attack and fall back you never face anything like this he's trying to overeat the cloud burst leave now he cannot win you will have your chance to kill him i'm not waiting anymore old man oh [Music] the cloud burst is not fake tonight it and that is mine tank was built to destroy you you can't power oh me [Music] catch you in my sights retreat the explosion disabled the main cannon now i can get close and concentrate fire on the platforms uh i can still beat you [Music] uh ah [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] sir the arkham knight did you subdue him he's he's gone you uh don't sound entirely sure sir ivy i've destroyed the cloudburst purify the remaining toxin as fast as you can ivy i fear you may be too late sir scans reveal the toxin is overwhelming ivy's plants i'm heading to her now [Music] and all your allies like poison ivy my toxin overwhelms her she's paying the price for opposing me right now [Applause] the anarchy of terror join them in the talks in batman stop fighting those fears [Music] [Music] oh [Music] nature always wins [Music] [Music] sir the gas cloud is dissipating you did it are you in poison ivy i mean we underestimated the humanity that remains within her she's gone alfred clearing the toxin took everything she had oh i see her final act was a noble one i need to find scarecrow before anyone else dies do you have any leads nothing concrete sir but the gcpd comes from might they're currently puzzled by an encrypted transmission sent on a swat channel from within the city most odd given there are no swat officers currently in the field then of course there are the numerous unsolved cases that still require your attention with the toxin clear now would be the perfect time to reassert your control of the city i'm heading to gcpd to investigate the transmission sent on a swat channel from within the city fingers crossed shed some light on scarecrow's whereabouts in the victory but now his army answers to me for even as my talks and dissipates it leaves behind a forsaken city forever by your failure tonight the myth of batman dies and gotham dies with it [Music] good job batman yeah nice work city of fear my ass thanks batman i didn't think we're gonna make it back there the fools in here actually think you're winning deluded batman you must get it from you gotham ain't going down yet batman thanks to you tell me about this broadcast wish i could sir but it's not a swat channel encrypted those boys really don't like anyone listening in i'm in me it's jim i need you to send through some blueprints i found crane and that bastard's going to die for what he did to my little girl was that the commissioner what's he doing getting himself killed but i've got the id number of the radio he's using and that means i can track him i've decoded a radio transmission it's gordon he's alive i need you to isolate the radio's frequency and pinpoint its location of course sir the transmission appears to have originated from an abandoned shopping mall the building has been without power for some time sir you may well encounter some obstacles the remote electrical charge prototype is being held in the gcpd evidence room that should help very well i'm sure officer cash will understand oh there you are look what electricity so this is my memorial i know this is the evidence but you could have tried to cover your tracks i ain't stopping him don't look at me let me tell you a secret you haven't seen the last of them he's gonna find him and when he does you'll find him i know good luck out there batman oh foreign i'm coming for you jordan's signal is coming from behind that shutter i need to find a way to reach him electrical charge to power up or disable [Music] i hear about it's generators worse hitting harder i guess killing joking get in the elevator you know when he comes for me you're gonna need a lot more guys than this get in there you'll be needing a wheelchair too batman's on his way stay alert why would we need more guys he's just one man i'm guessing you never met him the commissioner's right we're short on numbers where's everyone else downstairs in that briefing what briefing something about how to kill the bat what he didn't think to invite us open the shutter now the boss wants the door open huh i thought the bat took about when he destroyed the tank it's not let's get these shutters up door's opening get ready lock down the elevators and find him do you still believe that you are god's savior soon the world will see you for what you truly are a fallacy a figment of hope in a world of suffering and pain if it's any constellation i'm sure cranes put old jimbo out of this misery by now it's not like he's got anything left to be afraid of so [Applause] so you hear something yeah it sounded like it all products of our fears he said you'd be coming for the generator ah what will you give to save your friends i wonder are you ready to reveal your secret are you ready for your legend to die that's as far as the elevator will go i need to find a way past the obstruction blocking the shaft no power that won't work [Music] quiet their leader is wearing an explosive vest i need to neutralize him first throw that idea away it's what he wants you to do it's where the armor plating strongest you shoot him there and you're just helping him we are not i repeat these guys are packing more firepower than penguin are you thinking what i'm thinking that weapons crate is crying out to be tampered with why don't you stay back after this and we'll go see him you can ask him personally who cares i'm not scared of batman you put me in a room with him and i'll tear his head off and that is why you will fail he won't come at you straight on he'll watch you from the shadows and when you make a mistake he'll be ready if you need an example of how to act look no further than right here there is no way that he will get near me so what do you think ladies my money's on the batman now you could say i have a vested interest remember your training uh oh [Music] those boys have really done their homework where do you think they're getting that ginger huh you think barbara

by fear let her go you both still have a part to play we had a deal once i understood your greatest fear controlling you was simple you blame yourself for her condition you need to protect her but buried deep down is the inevitability that you will one day fail and that fear makes you mine think very carefully about your next move commissioner her life depends on it dad no did you think i wanted him dead did you think that would save your daughter do you know what happens when a man refuses to be controlled by his fears he must face them no take me please it's not her you want take me

dark knight i will peel back every layer of the batman before the night is through oracle the clock tower's secure you're reconnected to the mainframe great okay it looks like we lost a couple of servers it's going to take a while to restore all my data but i should be back online by the time you get back here in the meantime you might want to head over to the lady of gotham that reporter guy jack ryder went over there to follow up on a lead cash tried to stop him but ryder just started shouting about freedom of press i'm heading back to gcpd oracle may have a lead on where scarecrow has taken jim now she has access to the clocktower computers i don't doubt she will sell [Music] [Music] scarecrow should just give up man he ain't taking you no way you think that's smart bringing the girl back here batman might as well kill her now cash said it was his anyway great you're here scarecrow's chopper flew out towards the bay before heading north i tried narrowing it down further but the data's corrupted they did more damage than i thought what the hell was that trouble police force of gotham i have a message for you you are not safe you are not protected batman will not save you

in black hate the asylum arkham city never seen batman not once just lucky i guess open [Music] tim so there goes another boy wonder lost to another super villain if it's any consolation i can't see him matching my incredible work with jason can you scarecrow will probably just pop him full of fear gas and slit his little throat oh what a waste ah well just you and me now hey kiddo the real dynamic duo there there try those eyes seriously when are you gonna learn every time you let someone come between us they end up dead or crippled or brainwashed into killing you take a hint old boy we may have had our differences but you and me we're made for each other looking for someone you should know by now that nowhere is safe the commissioner was so eager to betray you earlier when his daughter's life depended on it and now i have your robin the caged bird fascinating that your fears would drive you to lock your closest ally in a prison cell now those same fears will make you do as i say there's a storage depot in kingston go there alone prepare to take off that mask or your friends will die [Music] you left him in his cell he wasn't safe and he is now he'd take a bullet for you bruce we all would but you left him defenseless you didn't even give him a choice i'm sorry bruce but you have to get him back whatever it takes so it's decision time bats give yourself up to scarecrow and get us both killed or is it time for the new dynamic duo to hit the streets alfred i'm going to give myself in to scarecrow it's the only way to save robin and jim consider your decision wisely sir there could be no coming back from this well it's been a hell of a halloween can't wait till next year we can still take enough yet punk speak up we can't hear you you won't win still think the bat's coming to save the day huh run oh why are you crazy you give up and we're done both of us why give them coming back so much more fun to be had out there think about it all those heads to smash all those bones to break it's like the world's greatest theme park and you're crying to get off the ride your fears got the better of you i see how fitting that i will win and batman's life will be over not because of what i have done to your precious city but because you are scared of what i will do to your friends your family they are your weakness hiding just below the surface i'm sure that you're scared of what will happen when i tear that mask from your face what will we find your true identity or proof that without your mask you are nothing impotent powerless afraid leave your

nightwing i'm going after the key cards work on getting the survivors off this ship you got it i'll check the database make sure we don't miss anyone master bruce it appears when the airship crash landed two guards did indeed parachute to well i hesitate to say safety sir it is gotham send me their locations of course then though i can only approximate where they landed you'll need to search for signs of a parachute once you get there i've accessed internal security get right back out the way you came in so alfred one of the guards didn't make it notify cash get the body picked up of course sir let's hope his colleague fared better so who's controlling the militia now that the night's gone you know i don't think i've ever killed a firefighter before tonight's a special night for you man you guys are crazy he can't help it when he starts collecting he has to get the whole set yeah i remember collecting baseball cards when i was a kid me too stumpy jackson the one card i never

eating escaped convict waiting we tracked the subject back to its den located beneath the founders island lighthouse it suffered minor injuries during capture fortunately wounds did not impede immediate testing the creature's regenerative healing factor is quite remarkable superficial lesions can repair almost instantaneously and the subject's hand is now fully regrown post amputation further surgeries have been scheduled to see whether tissue growth can be accelerated human trials are underway stabilizing the recombinant dna is our next step we have lots of work ahead of us as an aside the subject's physiology is altering possibly as an adaptive response to trauma sedatives are becoming less effective termination although undesirable must be considered the warden was experimenting on croc and the other prisoners trying to weaponize his condition looks like croc wants payback man the things they were doing here to prisoners to croc bastards they must be directly

assassins have been spotted on the rooftops of miyagani island well i presume it's the league sir the reporting officer's precise words were and i quote crazy ass ninjas thanks alfred i'll investigate did you see what that thing does oh crap he's coming after us [Music] [Music] you won't win oh dead few people can kill two league assassins i should set up a crime scene injuries consistent with slashing attacks from a long sharp blade like her own sword same injury pattern different uniform they were fighting each other a third sword dropped in a hurry blood type doesn't match the other bodies someone got away whoever got away was injured badly i should search the other rooftops try and pick up her trail it this should lead me to some answers alfred the assassins appear to be fighting one another i'm following a survivor's trail civil war amongst the league how is that possible is not known for restraint when it comes to punishing descent his body went missing after arkham city i thought the league had revived him but perhaps not sam if the league has a new leader or leaders they could be even more dangerous than rage you ever hear about team seven i've heard that name in a while some serious stuff what happened to those guys dropped off the grid no one knows for sure there's a splinter group all female that's where i've seen that name what name over there on the club black canary where are the others what have you done with them your concern is admirable but if i were you i do a bit more worrying about yourself did any of you see where she went i barely saw her coming what was the city of thinking anyway you see a ninja you let the ninja pass it's common sense and basic courtesy black ops are using don't leave okay some guys tried sneaking off the bridge [Music] did you see what he's built down there it's huge he doesn't share tech so don't ask yeah but robots look all these freaks the trail through the duct into elliott memorial hospital i'll have to power down that generator to gain access remember your training follow our orders you are initiates you are untempered steel these battles will forge your minds and bodies blades the league will wield the rebellion is weak rotten with disloyalty you will strike at its treacherous heart soon they will come when they arrive you strike at my command for the league for the league [Music] the blood trail leads through here but the automated door has no power i need to find a way to open it [Music] alfred i need to restore power to elliott memorial well let's see ah there's a backup generator located on the exterior of the building sir thanks alfred [Music] [Music] the demon's head must never rise again the trail heads over the damaged floor into the morgue i need to find a way in so fish [Music] she's dead blood loss i imagine sir looks like she was trying to press this booby-trapped must be more complex than a single button i should reconstruct her last moments she hit the switch here looks like she pressed the lower switch here she pressed the switch here she attempted to press this switch before succumbing to her injuries wrong again i need to work out the sequence she hit the switches in so race you dare approach rich all ghoul you've brought him back too many times the lazarus streams all that's keeping him alive he will rise again seethe your blade there will be no fighting here but war is coming traitors to the league conspired to stop the glorious resurrection of rae chalgool we will see gotham burn before we let the rebels hurt our master then let him die i want you gone by morning the rebels have found another pit a pure source a sample of his essence is all he would need i won't help you revive him then you'll face the consequences of war we know you detective you will not let innocence die yet you will not kill the demon's head to prevent their deaths you will do as we ask because your precious morality compels you to detective help me are you sorry you could restore rishi's health and then hand him over to the proper authorities you know no prison can hold him alfred besides he'll outlive any sentence i see what's up what are you going to do find the other lazarus pit stop it into the wrong hands alfred calibrate the batmobile sensors to search for trace lazarus particles in the city water supply it should lead me to the source absolutely sir sending you the real-time visual data now [Music] get us out of here [Music] yeah you're right it's just a man what's the worst he can do oh i don't know in your body and are you sure the turrets [Music] the trail leads beneath the dockyard i'll need to continue on this must be the lazarus pit [Music] trespasser we guard this site in the name of our new leader you're relieved attack remember your training oh we will overcome straight fat so turn around slowly and hand me the detonator nissa thank you bruce does race know his daughter fights for the rebels the rebels fight for me and that zombie no longer knows his own name or the day of the week or that his other daughter died i'm sorry about talia she was a loyal fool i am neither you understand so long as my father's corpses strapped to those tubes there will be war in gotham what do you want nessa go back to him destroy that foul machine and let that thing that was once my father finally die i'm no killer he's already dead he has died a thousand times and every time the lazarus pit restored him he came back worse more hateful more crazed i trembled to imagine what he would have become if this had fallen into his followers hands but with him gone the league will be mine and it will shed no more innocent blood the assassins will leave gotham never to return how can i trust you i swear by the woman we both loved i swear on my sister's grave i will win this war dark knight it's up to you how long it rages for [Music] [Music] sir nissa was always the most reasonable member of the family but do you trust her i do and are you prepared to end the life for her [Music] put your foot down [Music] i saw it gcpd was a freaking warzone sir if you don't mind i just wanted to suggest that given rishi's supernatural longevity and his current state of artificially prolonged existence not to mention the fact that he has in essence already died a case could be made that well um i swore i'd never kill he's a dangerous uncompromising zealot sir restored to full strength there's no telling what he'll do or who he might hurt is preventing some ungodly resurrection truly the same as taking a life what would you do alfred i don't know sir but i'll stand by you whatever you choose the loyalists have set up defenses against rebel attacks how considerate of them you weren't a good man ray but you had conviction stop him kill him stop him defend our men oh reality [Music] father what a monster you've let yourself become how long does he have maybe hours maybe days it doesn't matter there's no way back for him now i'll take him to gcpd good the loyalists will scatter and i'll be true to my word the league has no business in gotham from now on nissa don't make me regret this or you will [Music] detective proud of you um so i always thought the person inside sir i'm picking up a distress signal from a stranded cargo vessel i'm attempting to establish radio contact but there's too much interference send me the coordinates i'll investigate [Music] up um [Music] we just keep attacking we need the knight to come back he could help us i just do what the voice on the radio says guy's a badass man seriously he's only got one eye and he can still take out any guy who trained with him in the bunker did you try him sure did i was living for a week it's odd though what i saw him take a couple decent beatings right but he's always up and fighting the next day guy heals sir i know one would be hard pushed ever to call gotham clement but icebergs this isn't the weather alfred i feared
