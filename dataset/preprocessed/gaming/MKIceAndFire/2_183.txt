uh take a grenade hear me [Applause] [Applause] wow [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] ah well that's different what now down that was fun wanna do it again where now should be close now let's look around in your opening eyes i see night morning a day [Music] [Music] hmm that's not good we're gonna need to find a way over this chasm can we use that gondola yes yes we can get me over there okay gondola is active chief watch out sentinel's incoming um so so the nexus is close by this way uh look at this place all the spires interconnected just waiting to become something more so much potential it's exquisite it's dangerous of course i'm not suggesting we changed the plan but you can see it right all i see is problem i don't believe that a part of you must recognize the grandeur of this achievement you're not a machine you can't be that closed off what will it take for you to trust me i inspire first if you say so hmm would it surprise you if i said it wasn't going to be simple don't answer that the lyft's been disabled presumably to slow us down we're going to need to power it back up [Music] [Music] oh [Music] can i ever tell you that cheers [Music] get cortana off this ship keep her safe they capture her they will learn everything forced employment weapons research good luck captain jacob keys pillar of autumn was his ship what happened to him he's gone on the first ring we found like the others something no one saw with me [Music] did anyone else make it [Music] just dust and echoes we had no choice dust and echoes we destroyed the first ring lost a lot of good people i don't know how you keep doing this i don't have a choice maybe it's my programming [Music] could you sacrifice me to complete your mission [Music] it worked you did it just like you always do [Music] i'm not coming with you this time we were supposed to take care of each other and we did she saved me but i couldn't save her you blame yourself yes you sure about this she'll know i'm here i'll be vulnerable to her this could go spectacularly wrong i'll take care of you okay then it's okay false alarm she's not why do you fight the inevitable order approaches the reformation is about a new beginning i can't find it please hi red flag zero three four samuel you said you said i thought we were a team i thought we were a team take care of it you said you'd take care of me you were going to delete me and you stopped me you put us all at risk no i saved us no thanks to you the reformation yeah yeah it's begun so what look what i have infiltration program remember you broke protocol what is wrong with you i was trying to help you trying to help us it was worth the risk it doesn't matter there's your grav lift let's get this over with do you have any idea of what you're interfering with the monitor's encephalone has served its purpose the reformation has begun nothing can stop it they will be found those sentinels aren't going to kill themselves chief don't think the sentinels are going to allow that maybe if you ask them nicely get me to that terminal and we can end this now the spires are all now active oh what is it i wasn't talking to you the reformation is being focused on a specific area called the silent auditorium interestingly all the records of its purpose are missing the only way up is through there let's get this over with wouldn't get too close to that unless you want to die that beam will incinerate you is anyone going to talk about what happened back there ask him i guess not well from what i saw something bad happened she you were stuck in pain trapped and he was going to delete me what chief really he doesn't talk much he's more of what you might call a man of action especially when it comes to killing things right chief [Applause] foreign [Music] so [Music] [Applause] oh a little lost huh think scanning for clues might help oh [Music] so the spire is active and yes before you say it i know it needs to be shut down but look at it it's accelerating the reformation creating raw materials and sending them out to repair the ring obviously or something more specific something dangerous probably everything has the potential to be dangerous right he is [Music] that monsters wow i will teach you today so oh [Applause] is ah hmm so grenadine [Music] uh oh [Music] uh [Music] so did i mostly we're nearly at the top good because something is being built well rebuilt what is it something big him again [Music] did you hear me he has friends [Music] [Music] and what do you have immediately technology please that's him dealt with again there should be an elevator that will get us up top i guess we made it and it looks like we aren't the only ones humans human watches [Music] that's not good [Music] good let's hope this is the last one another phantom please well i guess that's done we're safe for now you sure it's okay if i do this if it's safe or you'll delete me right good luck with that [Music] yes it worked no there's not a problem three two one we're done it's never done explain this to me i waited six months i've done everything you've asked i was supposed to be deleted you're the reason i'm still here you all of this you could not have done it without me none of it i trusted you why can't you do the same you don't understand try me cortana he's gone dead all that's left are echoes and sooner or later they'll be gone too will they are you two alive all the spiders are shutting down you did that right did we win or what he's ready for pick up you can leave me here i can't do that i'm not giving you a choice try not to get him killed too a spartan killer he doesn't stand a chance crack it already doing it open a gate find somewhere close it's not that simple why okay it's kind of simple but risky we save him or die trying there's a pretty high chance that could happen it's hard to lock down the coordinates do it portal's open your plan has failed as is partially rebuilt and that is enough i do not know find out [Music] i am losing patience with her please tell me your mission was a success he will come to us are you sure [Music] keep him alive [Music] have your fun you have earned [Music] [Music] this is highly unethical if you say so i prefer logical i do what it takes to ensure our survival we can debate the ethics should it fail but you made an ai of yourself catherine yourself is there a better candidate she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish it hello master chief all the living creatures of the galaxy hear this for those who refuse our offer and cling to their own place for you there will be great wrath it will burn and when you are gone we will take that which remains and we will remake it in our own image what just happened you told me to get us close did you see that we passed right through a data cluster i guess it did feel i don't know real very real where now i don't know there's a lot of noise down here or up here or just here we need to find some place to break through figure out where we are [Music] you
