blake sir i was just looking for him do you know where he is thanks pretty chilly huh lousy weather huh it'll always rain like this it rains every fall doesn't it do that where you come from well yeah [Applause] yeah of course sample of no interest comes to one of the policemen present on the waste ramp so unrelated to the investigation harry comment sample of no interest comes one of the policemen present on the wasteland [Applause] lieutenant blake i'm agent nam and jaden from the fbi i went by your office this morning they told me to be here now if you're looking for rain dead bodies and highways you come to the right place mike will you tell that [ __ ] with the bulldozer to stop for five minutes i can't hear myself think here right away lieutenant [Applause] well are you coming jake so what happened some guy taking his dog for a piss found a body about six o'clock this morning we don't know much more right now based on what we've seen looks like the work of the origami killer has the body being identified no not yet we should know more later today any news on the corner he's on his way lieutenant we've been waiting for an hour for [ __ ] sake because the time of death being established based on the rigor mortis must be less than six hours ago we should know more once the coroner has had a look any witnesses none yet given the neighborhood i'd be surprised if anybody saw anything do you have any leads my men are going over the scene with a fine tooth comb the killer left anything behind we'll find it tony i don't want to see a single [ __ ] stirring journalist with a milo here you got it yes lieutenant [Applause] do we know the cause of death there are no marks on the body chances are he was drowned like the others listen i'm a little busy here why don't we discuss all this a little later back at the office well no problem i understand do you mind if i have a look around be my guest hey jaden you come and see me if you find anything okay on the same team now some orchid power the concentration of pollen in the air is quickly decreasing because of the rain but it gets higher in the direction of the body [Applause] very common the pollen particles disappear in the tall grass it's probably the end of the trail harry coming traces of blood on the railroad track the blood report indicates an advanced and long lasting state of exhaustion footprints continue just after the pollen tray there's a good chance that they're the killers very common traces of blood detected on the fence behind the railroad line oh oh [Applause] hello there's a good chance that they're the killers very common tracks on the side of the boat behind the railroad line but maybe the killer's car so uh harry coming victim is lying on his back no visible signs of violence [Applause] an orchid was placed on the victim's chest [Applause] a small origami figure in the right hand angus were probably closed after the time of death the victim is jeremy bowles declared missing five days ago see reference file his face is covered with mud like the other victims superficial wound on the right thigh the blood is identical to that on the fence i think i've seen all there is to see i'm heading back to the office you're staying no i've seen enough i'm leaving too [Applause] do so [Applause] a butterfly a wolf's head a crab death death i have the results of your mri scans everything seems to be normal there is no physical damage from the accident however i am worried about your psychological condition i know it's not easy but you've got to start over ethan you're not responsible for what happened it's my fault jason is dead it'd still be alive i've been looking out for him it was an accident accidents happen every day you can't blame yourself forever for your son's death how is shawn he's a very solitary kid you know very focused within himself he's really close to his mother with me he's more distant and what about you ethan what do you feel i stopped living at the same time jason did when that car ran into us is there something else you wanted to tell me ethan i sometimes have these blackouts times when i don't know what i'm doing i recover consciousness sometime later but i'm someplace else and i have no idea how i got there do you think this could be related to the accident you suffered a massive concussion and were in a coma for six months we really don't know what effect a shock like that can have on the brain [Music] that's the end of this session we'll continue this conversation next week you were lucky ethan it's very rare to survive such a traumatic accident i don't exactly feel lucky doctor [Music] how did things go to school today i was punished because i didn't do my homework i'm sorry about that next time we really pull it together okay is something that matters sean [Applause] no i'm all right aren't you gonna go play with the other kids i don't feel like it do you want to eat something [Music] i haven't been on a see-saw in a long time what do you think [Applause] yeah [Music] come on dad make me fly [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what about that merry-go-round i bet i can push you so fast you won't

charlene i'll look at the reports later i'll cancel all appointments for this afternoon okay oh captain agent norman jaden from the fbi is here jaden of course we've been expecting you i'm in a bit of a hurry do you mind tagging along we can talk as we walk yeah of course i wanted to introduce myself before getting started but uh perhaps there's a better time now it's fine i just have to get to the press conference we have them every day now believe me it's not always easy finding something to tell fortunately today we have some news have you met lieutenant blake cat yeah we met this morning he has his own methods but he's a good cop i'm sure you'll get them well together do you know how to tie a knot in your necktie i guess to be frank with you i could have done without the fbi on this one but the press are all over us this origami killer case crept up on us and it's fast becoming a national concern there are hundreds of pillars in this country but what do you know this guy is exotic these flowers and origami figures work that one out then the press get onto it and we suddenly become the center of the universe i'm here to arrest a serial killer with all due respect sir the rest of it it's none of my business no of course not all i'm asking is that you make progress and fast the press want a perpetrator and we're gonna have to serve him up on a silver platter not bad oh go see charlene and she'll show you to your office yeah chicken on the press conference if you're interested it'll give you an idea of the political climate around here thank you sir welcome to the club jayden i'm ready to start maybe we should kick off by talking about the case i have some work to finish here let's talk about that later if you don't mind okay uh no problem just let me know when you're available really starting to dislike that guy that'll watch my back from now on captain perry is doing his press conference now might be interesting to have a look strange character captain pereira seems to be more interested in meeting the press than investigating the crime where's the water cooler when you need one the police are continuing to work around the clock to find the murderer as quickly as possible i'll field some questions yeah you said the methodology indicated another victim for the origami killer can you be more specific an origami figure was found in the victim's hand and an orchid was placed on his chest his face was covered with mud but there were no visible traces of violence to the body go ahead uh the zodiac killer was never identified perhaps the origami killer would have been found either i don't think there's much chance of that for the moment the killer may think he's invulnerable but in the end he'll make a mistake and we'll be there to arrest him yes did the killer leave any written evidence perhaps a ransom note explaining his actions or anything like that no he has not made contact in any way and we have only the murders to help us understand his motives yes what's the question some people are saying that the police were slow to take an interest in these murders because the victims lived in poor parts of the city what do you say to that that's absurd the police make no distinctions between victims based on their social class it is true that the origami killer seems to choose his victims from the more impoverished parts of town the higher crime rate in these areas makes the investigation more difficult time for a couple more yes there are rumors that the fbi has sent a profiler to help with the investigation is that true you seem to be well informed yes we asked the fbi to send us a profiler to help us with this investigation we were planning to announce this in the next few days but it seems that won't be necessary according to certain sources the town hall's been applying pressure to avoid any mention of a serial killer in order not to have an adverse effect on the mayor's election campaign do you have anything to say about that pure speculation at no time has the mayor been involved in this investigation except to support the efforts of the police force of course thank you for your cooperation one question please sir one last question captain perry one more question please cases front page news and all the papers it's not going to be easy investigating a crime under the glare of all this publicity i'll have a look around the station stretch my legs for a bit this investigation is starting to give me the creeps get ahold of yourself man as you get paris assistant show me my office i can't wait to get to work ugh so nice watch oh it's the present we offer to our new lieutenants we bought the same model each year for the past 20 years for each promotion it optimizes everybody's time and it's the kind of thing that always goes down well you can contribute to our fund if you like we're still a few dollars sure congratulate larry on my behalf i'll be sure to do that sir captain perry said you could show me to my office yes of course follow me this this is my office that's where i was told to take you if you need anything you know where to find me okay time to work uh step one change the office [Music] well well looks like there's something new harry comment tire tracks on the side of the road behind the railworld line it may be the killer's car the killer's car is probably a chevrolet malibu 83. hmm a common species that doesn't help much no prints or specific clues nothing much to go on eight victims in the last three years all boys aged between nine and thirteen no signs of violence the victims disappear from public places in broad daylight no one notices anything bodies are found three to five days later drowned in rainwater always the same ritual an origami in the hand an orchid on the chest the victims have always been dead for less than six hours when they were found which means they remained alive for several days before being drowned over three thousand five hundred people questioned of a one hundred suspects interrogated not a single lead to go on the killer is white aged between 30 and 45 he is intelligent calm and determined an organized type he has a car he's probably employed but his work allows him free time the killer has a large comfort zone he gained confidence rapidly moved away from his base this won't make the geo profiling any easier there is always a railroad line adjacent to where the bodies are found and all the victims disappeared in the fall one foreign [Music] here we go again i better go wash my face i need to take some i'm going to feign if i resist [Music] that's all right i know i can make it i know i know i can make it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is lieutenant blake mr marshall could you please tell him what happened it was this afternoon i went to the park with my son sean we played together for a while and then he wanted to go on the carousel so i put him on one of the wooden horses and when i turned back disappeared exactly what time did you arrive at the park try to remember exactly mr mars every detail can be important it must have been about 4 15. yeah that's it 4 15 i remember exactly because i looked at the clock in the park when we arrived what was your son wearing when he disappeared he was wearing a coat a beige coat and a pair of pants black pants how could shawn have disappeared without you even noticing weren't you right by the carousel i i can't remember exactly it all happened so fast you say you took your son to the park after school but you didn't report him missing until 8 15. why did it take you so long to contact the police i searched the whole neighborhood for him i thought he couldn't have gone far all right that's all the questions i have for now you're free to go mr mars we'll continue to look for sean overnight we'll contact you if we have any more questions dude do you think the origami kirk listen your son's probably just run off and i'll turn up in a couple of hours [Music] but what if it is the origami killer well then we have about four days to find him alive [Music] did they find something [Music] no nothing yet but they're gonna keep looking through the night do they do they think it's the origami killer it's still too early to say but it is a possibility what happened ethan how could you lose sean like that you should never have taken your eyes off him i mean for god's sake how hard is it to keep your eye on a child in the park why did you leave him ethan why wasn't it enough losing jason i'm sorry it's not what i meant to say [Music] laughs [Music] so living good evening to you sir can i help you sir well i hope so my name's scott shelby i'm a private detective uh i'm investigating the case of the origami killer i'd like to ask you a few questions my son is dead mr shelby i have nothing more to say i also lost someone i loved i know what you're feeling then you will understand that i do not wish to talk about it the killer has kidnapped another victim a 10 year old boy like your son risa i have four days before we find his body on a deserted stretch of wasteland no one did anything to save my son now we're pleased to move along sir oh do you sell inhalers i'm all out and at least i won't go away completely empty-handed in the back of the store to the right thanks [Music] good evening sir are you looking for something in particular give me what you got in the register don't [ __ ] try anything open the register you dumb [ __ ] put the money on the counter [ __ ] you death or what are you gonna open that [ __ ] register or not no sir you do not have the right to steal that money from me i have worked very hard to earn it you cannot have it what did you say you're out of your [ __ ] mind man you don't get it do you i'm gonna put a [ __ ] bullet right between your eyes if you don't do what i say now you shall not be robbing my register sir that money is mine i ask you now to leave before it is too late christ god damn idiot open register don't make me [ __ ] kill you those are doctors that i cannot do didn't give me any choice a thousand thank you sir i don't know what would have happened if you had not been here this i didn't come by for nothing have a nice day when my boy razer disappeared i received a letter with a locker ticket inside inside the locker i found this box i do not understand what it means but i think it must be a sort of message from the man who took my son from me can i please take the box if it can be of any use to you at all it did not help me to save razer but maybe it will help you find the other little boy mr shelby i was beginning to think that there was no good to be found in this place i could see now that i was wrong [Music] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] ugh uh [Music] uh so [Music] so i really need sleep how hard can it be to fall asleep god damn insomnia i'm totally exhausted but i just can't sleep uh maybe i'll go to bed and give the sleep thing one more shot [Music] so there's someone here there's someone in the apartment the phone on the desk i could call for help the front door it's the only way out if i can reach it i still have a chance [Music] thank so [Music] [Music] huh [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Music] god [Music] [Music] ah [Music] so when the parents came home from church all their children were gone they searched and called for them they cried and begged but it was all to no avail the children have never been seen again i have to get out of here and find out what this ticket is about it looks like the ticket to a locker that letter might be linked to sean's disappearance i need to show it to the police the origami figure in my hand after my blackout it's the same one the killer leaves in the hands of his victims i've never done origami in my life someone sent me that letter for a reason this angel on the ticket i'm sure i've seen it somewhere before what does it mean some sort of fairy tale i'm the origami killer i black out and then the murdering starts i know it's me this doesn't make any sense it couldn't have been me i couldn't ever have done that goddamn reporters they've been camped outside my house all day i'm exhausted i didn't sleep a wink all night i think i know where this ticket comes from there's no way back for me if i've done anything to hurt sean i couldn't have heard him i love him i love him with all my heart but what in god's name did i do when he was on the carousel i'd give anything to know where shawn is now mr mars a few words mr mars mr mars can you confirm that your son has disappeared could you think the origami get another card you lost your son in the park how do you feel about that please mr mark mr mars a few words you're going to make an appeal to the killer mr mars can you confirm that your son is still alive [Music] [Music] [Music] gonna gonna have to make it through the crowd i can't can't take crowds just can't handle it the luggage lockers they're on no time to waste i need to find out what's in that locker maybe i could come back later when there's less of a crowd i'm just not gonna make it i'm tightening up i can't go on i can't make it too many people too many people [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] dad dad [Music] dad where are you jason dad jason dad jason [Music] dad jason jason [Applause] [Music] jason dad jason daddy [Applause] [Music] the lockers now i've got to find the right one made it i made it i managed to get through the goddamn crowd a nightmare the whole thing was just a [ __ ] nightmare jason jason is dead the lockers now i've got to find the right one line 18 box number three so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] where are you i'm so cold dad dad [Music] [Applause] [Music] the killer is white aged between 30 and 45 he doesn't act on impulse but plans his crimes in a very meticulous fashion he doesn't have anything personal against the victims that's why he covers their faces with mud to make them anonymous why does he kill them if he doesn't have anything against them for him they're more of an image a symbol is probably why it gives him an origami figure and an orchid as gifts to apologize for what he's done to them very interesting and where does all that get us [Music] the best way of tracking a predator is to be familiar with his behavior that may be true in novels but there's a child's life at stake here continue jayden one detail attracted my attention the interval between the time when a victim disappears in the time when the body is found ranges from three to five days but the rainfall is always at six inches give or take ten percent what on earth does that mean all the victims are drowning rain water the killer kills only in the fall when there is plenty of rain it could be that he puts him in some sort of well or tank that is open to the skies and that fills up with rain water the more it rains the less time the victim has to live then i studied the geographical distribution of the murders generally a killer commits his first murder near to where he lives so he has a safe place to flee to if any complications arise the more confident he becomes the further he roams from his base by analyzing the locations where the victims disappeared i was able to isolate a zone where the killer might live and what size is this uh zone for the moment about 10 square mile oh great you must be 10 000 people live in that sort area you gonna question them one by one the more clues we get the more we can reduce the zone we can then cross check it with our list of suspects and identify the killer so what's next there are two suspects whose psychological profile might fit and can be connected to the comfort zone i'd like to question them god damn it we're wasting our time with this [ __ ] the killer's out there somewhere we got to get off our asses and find him [Music] the killer is no ordinary murderer he is intelligent organized and methodical you won't find him by patrolling the streets tell me agent jaden did you get your fast experience on the job or did you just [ __ ] read about it in some school book your vast experience hasn't prevented eight victims from being murdered [ __ ] [ __ ] that's enough [Music] you said it took six inches of rainfall before the victim died how much time do we have left the weather forecasts are right less than 72 hours [Music] [Music] no answer we waste our time coming here maybe we should have a little look inside anyway there's

questioned him a few months back because he was causing a disturbance in the park he was ranting and raving said he heard voices i had this idea in his sick little head that i was the anti-christ i'd come to earth to persecute him real twisted all the signs of a mystical obsessive neurosis compounded by a persecution complex you don't have to be a profiler to see he's not a killer we're wasting our time here nathaniel williams is our prime suspect he's already been questioned and he lives in the exact geoprofiling zone well no warrant no problem for blake he thinks his badge entitles him to do whatever he wants it's stifling in here those windows haven't been opened in years the guys taking a break from reality hold up here in this crazy apartment candles are still lit he should be back

i didn't want to go back to prison when i saw the cops i just bolted i wasn't thinking straight we checked out his statement he has an alibi for at least three the murders [ __ ] that bastard was a perfect fit [ __ ] ash okay sean moss's mother's here she'd like to speak with you it was a few months back the middle of the night it was pouring down ethan came home completely drenched at about three i asked him where he'd been he uh he spoke about drowning the rain um he didn't make any sense [Applause] there was something something in his eyes as if it wasn't really him there may be no connection but the next day there was that announcement about another victim of the origami killer find my son i'm begging you [Music] i'm police lieutenant carter blake this is agent norman jaden of the fbi according to our information ethan mars is one of your patients we'd like to ask you a few questions about them i'm sorry that's impossible i beg your pardon i'm bound by an oath of secrecy under no circumstances may i discuss my patience my job is to find sean mars alive and i don't give a damn about any [ __ ] oath i know you don't want to protect a murderer if you know anything you must tell us doctor i'm sorry i can't help you now i must ask you to leave you need to cooperate for your own sake it's your duty to inform the police if you suspect one of your patients doctor are you threatening me i'm just giving you some free advice doc i suggest you take it doctor a child's life's at stake you may know something that could help us save him i am going to call the police and make a complaint about your behavior doctor you are really pushing my buttons the only thing i'm interested in is saving that kid's life so you're going to be a good boy and tell me what i want to know or i am really going to lose my template that's enough let's get out of here let go of me you you have no right come on doc there's an easy way and a hard way it's your [ __ ] choice oh what's up with you norma you getting cold feet you don't like to get your hands dirty huh i thought you wanted to save that kid i'm gonna save sean mars just as much as you do but that doesn't give me the freedom to do what the hell i like so you're gonna stop this [ __ ] right now [Music] i'll get you for this jaden don't worry i will not forget ethan mars has had psychological problems since his first son died feels responsible for his death sort of morbid neurosis he is haunted by visions of drowning bodies a few weeks ago after one of our usual sessions i found this on the floor it must have fallen out of his pocket ash i want you to assign every available man to finding ethan mars i want a man outside his place day and night notify all agencies to start looking for him i want you to keep an eye on the train stations the airports the bus terminals i want every cop in the city on his ass so if he moves we know about it yes ethan mars is the origami killer [Music] so nice shot thank you please come in mr shelby would you care for a coffee oh no thanks do you play i tried once but i think the owner of the course is still looking for him it's an interesting sport it requires strength but also a cool head and absolute precision would you care to hit a few balls with me there's no danger of damaging the greens here okay take off your jacket and grab a club the balls are in that basket the most important thing is to grip the club correctly when you feel ready you swing well it's only your first ball you should try to strike it a little harder next time i'm assuming you didn't invite me here just to play golf mr kramer i hear you've been asking questions about my son that's right i want to know if gordie is linked to the origami killer case in any way my son had nothing to do with that sordid case well then he has nothing to fear from my investigation you have no business investigating my son i told you he had nothing to do with it with all due respect mr kramer it's up to me to decide who i want to investigate i'm an influential man and i pay very well for loyalty are you trying to buy me let's just say i'm trying to show you where your interest lies how much do you want to leave my son alone [Music] [Applause] i think you misunderstood me i don't play that game don't go near my son mr if you do you'll regret it have a nice day mr kramer so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] porcelain lizards they look new out of place with the rest of this old beat up stuff there's been a fire in here everything is all burned up where are you sean 9711 marble street it's the right place but what am i supposed to do in this dump the pain's coming back drugs are beginning to wear off still feeling weak i can hardly stand [Music] [Music] are you prepared to suffer to save your son you have five minutes to cut off the last section of one of your fingers in front of the camera if you succeed you will get your reward [Music] [Applause] [Music] you have four minutes and 30 seconds left [Music] ah oh [Music] [Music] under the desk [Music] [Music] uh uh that's affirmative lieutenant we're in position perfect nobody moves until i give this signal is that clear we nail him as soon as he sets foot outside right lieutenant lucky that patrol spotted his car what's he doing in there beats me you're the profiler right i thought you were supposed to be right inside the killer's head that's just it what i know of ethan mars doesn't match the killer's psychological profile i know what the jury's going to choose between your theories concrete proof what the [ __ ] is that girl doing there marsh comes out now she's gonna be in trouble what do we do lieutenant you want to get her out no stand down [Music] so [Music] she's going inside if she lives there off just as well we don't want anyone hanging around if mars comes out ethan what happened the police they're out there i think they're here to arrest you we've got to find another way out [ __ ] what's he up to in there wait for a go on my word think of something think of something fast no point in trying to get upstairs dead end on the roof the solution there's got to be a solution [Music] you can't get out that way [Music] they're still out there you've got to find another way we've got to get out of here fast the cops are going to break in any second [Music] wow [Music] [ __ ] it's too high [Music] ready on my go stay here jaden out of the question i'm coming with you two men at the door hold your positions it's a go come on let's go this way hey you don't move i'll shoot come on quick i can't hands in the air there's a man and a woman exiting the hour woman [ __ ] it's that girl who went in everybody downstairs they're in the alley follow them the subway ethan ethan what's the matter we've got to keep going ethan ethan they're coming i'm so tired i have to keep going come on girl [Music] the crowd they might lose us in the crowd [Music] [Music] goddammit hey watch it man please stop or i'll shoot they've already blocked all the exits from the station they're closing in from all sides only a few yards away now think of something fast anything still get lost in the crowd if you don't why am i risking my life from him the cops are after him he's probably dangerous [ __ ] he's getting worse and worse what's happening to him i can't just abandon ethan now there's got to be a way quick quick ethan quick is gonna hit us it's our only chance less than an hour ago we heard from the police who have identified the man thought to be the origami killer ethan mars father of the kidnap victim sean mars is on the run and should be considered armed and dangerous a police manhunt is now underway and they hope that they will soon be able to announce the apprehension of this dangerous lunatic i brought some food i didn't know what you liked so i brought some of everything i i hope that's okay any cops no i think we lost them the guy at the desk though he gives me the creeps i don't trust him you're all over the news reports ethan every cop in the country will be hunting you they say you're the origami killer is it true are you the killer ethan [Music] i i sometimes have these blackouts times where i don't know what i'm doing as if i'm someone completely different the only thing i remember afterwards is the bodies the body's in the water why are you hurt ethan why were you in that apartment i think my other self is testing testing my love for sean he wants to know if i'd love my son enough to save him that means there's some part of me that knows where sean is the only way to find him is to go through these trials why can't you tell that to the police and tell them why that i'm a schizophrenic who drowns his victims and has kidnapped his own son they'd never let me go and i have to stay free to save sean i have no choice i'm his only chance when shaun is out of danger i'll turn myself in but not until then you can't keep going like this you're destroying yourself ethan finding sean is the only thing that matters there has to be another way you don't understand time is running out sean will be dead in a few hours i have no choice please madison leave forget everything that's happened there is nothing more you can do for me if you want to help me leave leave me to do this on my own [Music] [Music] uh so [Music] so [Music] [Music] your vodka sir thanks you look preoccupied if you don't mind my saying so problems with the investigation flake is convinced that mars is the killer not you i thought there was some evidence to that effect that's true but it just doesn't make sense his psychological profile doesn't fit neither does the geolocalization i can't see this father drowning eight victims before kidnapping his own kid mars is not the origami killer let's stake my life on it then who is i am the faintest [ __ ] idea maybe you should review the evidence in your possession that's just what i was thinking of doing oh one last thing sir you should be careful not to over indulge in you know what it can be dangerous very dangerous i'm trying to keep a handle on it but that's difficult it gets more and more difficult it'll end up killing you if you're not careful that would be most unfortunate sir [Music] [Music] [Music] well well looks like there's something new the video recording from near the park on the afternoon shawn mars disappeared i doubt there's anything on it but you never know a chevrolet model corresponding to the tire prince passed at 1602 heading for the park went in the opposite direction at 1637 that could fit the time that sean mars disappeared could it be the killer's car [Music] the car was stolen let's see a certain jackson neville was suspected of stealing it but the charges were dropped not enough evidence [Music] jackson neville aka mad jack involved in several cases of buying and selling stolen vehicles considered to be very dangerous this guy might have provided the killer with a car it's a pretty slim lead but it's all i have right now oh one last thing sir [Applause] you should be careful not to over indulge very dangerous [ __ ] it's it's coming trip the cane the tube is on the bedside table all i need is to take some and the pain will go away i should put this this is gonna kill me i know i can resist i just need to stay in control

one with false plates he paid cash and i ain't the question in kind said i was supposed to drop the word to a guy named paco down at the blue lagoon when the car was done that's all i know we'll continue this discussion down at the station you're under arrest you have the right to remain silent anything [ __ ] not now anything you say cannon will be hey you look like you got a problem man what they letting you dope heads in the fbi now god bless america now i'm going to give you a little help with your drug problem mr five-o permanently hey so um ugh what you got yes [ __ ] oh [Music] so you think the origami killer killed manfred that makes sense didn't want him spilling his guts to us and you suspect gordy kramer right oh him or one of his men gordy has the time and the means not to mention the [ __ ] up attitude to go along with it he's only a suspect but he's a pretty guilty looking one are these your files on the case yeah i've been working on them for a couple years i build up a mountain of paperwork magazines about origami you think the killer could have subscribed to one of those if he was even remotely interested in origami in the last 30 years his name may be in there somewhere trouble is there's over 500 names against the squad i'm starving do you have anything to eat well i'm no chef but i should be able to make some scrambled eggs if you like great i'm soaking wet i need to warm up a little is it okay if i take a shower i'll be my guest go to my bedroom it's the next door oh i'll cook up the eggs while you're under the shower so [Music] [Music] so [Music] egg should be ready by now [Music] i took the liberty of borrowing your bathrobe looks better on you hey that almost looks good enough to eat what's that the notebook i took from manfred's place [Music] according to this about 30 clients bought spare parts for royal machines in the last 10 years the killer may be one of them oh you know checking out the alibi of 30 clients one by one that's a lot of leg work except that if we cross cross-check them with the list the list of subscribers to origami magazines you still got that right yeah yeah lauren wait [Music] if the killer really used a royal typewriter and if he subscribed to an origami magazine his name should be on both lists well lauren i mean that's just an assumption but yeah i suppose his name is here somewhere help me we're gonna find him [Music] the only guy whose name was on both lists died when he was 10. what are you going to do now pick up his coffin make sure he's dead i know it doesn't make any sense unless the killer was only using his name but why use the name of a kid who died 30 years ago well that's what we came to find out the name is john shepard it should be on a grave around here you somewhere give up do you [Music] it's cold it's raining i'm standing outside getting soaked oh how i love my job the sooner we find that grave the sooner we can get the hell out of here this girl knows her mind all right no point in trying to reason with her she's convinced she's onto something and here's me thinking we're wasting our freaking time in this freaking cemetery excuse me i'm looking for the grave of a young boy who died about 30 years ago his name was john shepard you wouldn't know where it is by any chance the children's graves are in the next plot thanks i should be investigating gordy kramer right about now here i am standing in a cemetery pouring rain looking for the grave of a kid who's been dead for 30 years [Music] [Applause] [Music] excuse me i'm looking for the grave of a boy named john shepard straight ahead a little further out thanks i found it [Music] these flowers are fresh looks like someone's still tending the gray origami figures that's one hell of a coincidence oh

do they do you remember john my johnny he is a good little boy you know i know what happened at carnaby square do you remember carnaby square i think i used to live there a long time ago we didn't have much money at the time you know we had to make do with very little [Music] mrs shepherd your son may be linked to a series of murders perhaps you have some information that could help the investigation are you a new nurse where are my pills [Music] all right no point in wasting my time i won't learn anything more by staying here it'd take days if not longer to find the name of the family that adopted her son sean mars would be dead by then this woman might be the origami killer's mother must be some way to get her to remember all right no point in wasting my time i won't learn anything more by staying here does mrs shepard ever talk about her past it's not all very clear to her now sometimes she'll remember the oddest things though i suppose if she sees something that reminds her of her past she ever mention her sons sons well she often mentions john i i think he drowned does she ever talk about her other son i didn't know she had another one i've never heard her mention it does she get many visitors she's been here for 10 years and you're the first sometimes if you show her things it seems to trigger a memory from her past you might get it to remember thanks for the advice show her things that take her back so [Music] [Music] what a lovely orchid my sons loved our kids we used to grow them in the back when john died i laid orchids on his grave [Music] are these your children mrs shepherd john and his brother is that them they are good little boys their father never looked after them always drinking they didn't have an easy life you know [Music] her memory is coming back don't stop now just just remember [Music] did you make these origami figures my little paper animals they played with them for hours i showed my boys how to make them you know

the same name i was wasting my time telling him they couldn't all have the same name but he always wanted his paper dogs max it's funny isn't it i cried when they told me i'd already lost one of my children and now they were taking away another one you understand the foster family mrs shepherd what was the name of the foster family that adopted john's brother they were really very nice people i met them you know in the beginning i used to go and see my little boy and then i got sick and i couldn't go any longer perhaps he thought i'd forgotten him he must have thought i didn't love him anymore his name mrs shepard what was his name but i loved him if you only knew how much i missed him please anne his name what was his name [Music] come closer [Music] so [Music] the last trial the last question are you prepared to give your life to save your sons there is a deadly poison in this file it will kill you in exactly 60 minutes if you drink it you will get the last letters of the address you will have enough time to save your son and say goodbye to him but then you will die you can drink the file or decide to leave the choice is yours [Music] good [Music] [Music] [Music] the last letters have been sent to your phone [Music] i did what i had to sean your dad's coming to save you [Music] i'm nowhere and i'm out of time to have [ __ ] shitty letters from this [ __ ] [ __ ] address come on there's gotta be a way to do this several different addresses fit these letters god they're scattered all over the city i don't have time to check them all [Music] i may only have time for one address if sean's not there i'm done it's a crapshoot we've only got a few more hours left to save sean mars there has to be a goddamn clue somewhere it's probably staring me in the face this kid's gonna die and i'm going around in circles [Music] all packed up and ready to go what are you talking about the investigation's over we know who did it we no longer need your services anymore norman so you can ride your files all the way back to washington i'd be lying if i said i was gonna miss you [Music] the investigation isn't over you have absolutely nothing on mars mars is guilty case closed anyway it's no concern to yours now you're off the case so pack up and [ __ ] off blake you are an unbalanced psychopathic [ __ ] i'll take that as a compliment honestly i don't give a [ __ ] what you think i found the origami killer everyone's happy end of story have a nice trip back norman [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the killer's name is here somewhere in this theater i just have to find it find it before it's too late oh one last thing sir you should be careful not to over indulge in you know what it can be dangerous very dangerous it'll end up killing you if you're not careful that would be most unfortunate sir ahri was in record mode when i was fighting with the killer perhaps there's something on it gold watch i'm sure i've seen this before somewhere the watch they give for promotions to lieutenant the killer is a cop two receipts from the same gas station might be near the killer's home ah that doesn't get us anywhere the killer lives in this zone 342 people live around there not good enough gotta find a means of identifying the killer more precisely [Music] looks like the killer is a cop carter blake that would explain the dead end investigation and his desire to frame ethan mars [Music] i i can't go on [Music] let me stay with you scott i don't want to go look it'll only take a couple of days long enough to get this resolved i can't just wait while you confront my son's killer it's the only way lord trust me now go stay with your mother for a few days i'll come and get you when this is all over tell me who the origami killer is i want to know who killed my son listen when i'm done i'll tell you everything i know i promise [Music] go on hurry i think the water's rising i'm hurrying i'll be right back right [Music] i [Music] [Music] crap please please dad you've got to save john i tried john i really tried but he wouldn't come please don't die john please don't [Music] don't forget about this guy [Music] [Music]
