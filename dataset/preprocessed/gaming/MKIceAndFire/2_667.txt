agent 47 and diana burnwood are the world's top assassins working for the ica unknowingly they have been hired by a shadow client to target a number of operatives of providence a secret organization working in the highest echelons of power providence's controller the constant approaches diana and makes her a deal eliminate the shadow client and learn about 47's past but when 47 discovers that the shadow client is lucas grey his lost childhood friend he and diana switch sides to fulfill an old pact destroy providence together they managed to capture the constant forcing him to reveal the identities of the three providence partners eliminate them and the war would be over however the constant has an ace up his sleeve look closer in the shadows behind the everyday world beyond the headlines and the seats of power a hidden hand a kind of company known as providence to it we were just assets to use and throw away to do the unthinkable the unforgivable and it never gave us a second thought until now after decades in the shadows we are fighting back me and 47 much has been lost but we are closer than ever we trapped the constant providence's chief controller and finally learnt the names of its three partners [Music] and just maybe look towards the future it's time [Music] the partners are down there you know i never planned this fire ahead you never do i see someone got his memory back wait is that a beacon and the hell bass alexa carlos helicopter just took off confirmed target locations over diana that's the status right we have a situation carlyle has left the building and i think i know why the constant has escaped he persuaded one of the sailors into setting him free and since then he's been seizing control of providence assets and resources i can only assume carlisle is rushing to contain the damage if she slips away again we'll keep track of her make sure she doesn't meanwhile the plan stays the same your destination is the scepter the world's tallest building where the partners are laying low courtesy of their host sheikh omar al-ghazali marcus stuyvesant is fifth generation old money his family made its fortune in real estate and banking and we're at one point the chief land owners in new york carl ingram is a powerful washington king maker whose family grew rich selling gunpowder during the american civil war and later established a globe-spanning empire in oil coal and steel both families long since retreated from public view but their quiet dominance endures to this day now the partners likely suspect that we're coming so mr gray will infiltrate building controls and disable all electronic doors and elevators stuyvesant and ingram are about to find they have nowhere left to run right this is our moment 47 providence ruined our lives with the flick of a pen today we return the favor happy hunting welcome to dubai 47 today is the inauguration of the scepter and the ceremony is well underway you will find marcus

dreadful critic insists on speaking to me now that i'll be kept away from my friend cornelius stuyvesant everything is going fabulously out there i really want to say how much i appreciate all you

punctuality i i was supposed to be ready to present my papers half an hour ago hockey are you making fun of me that's so cruel do you do you know what a man is without his gun a man in his boxes crying like a baby you women will never understand and i don't think we ever will hello sir reporting for duty about time our client has been going out of his mind waiting for you do you have the papers yes good i'll call him now how should i address him it's classified so you don't call him anything but officially he's just known as name pinky sir this is security just calling to let you know your new guard has finally arrived yes sir see you soon okay wait here he'll be here shortly mumbai okay you must be my new escort i have very high standards and trust you will do your duty you have your credentials on you let me see here yes that looks good i like it a cutlery expert no less i have no idea what that means but your cv is very impressive this looks perfect come on let's walk i need to tell you a bit about what i expect from you i expect you to be by my side 24 7 and as i say otherwise bathroom breaks are of course permitted but only when i say so i have a very important and delicate meeting today in which i expect you to keep your ears closed but your eyes wide open understood now your papers were indeed impressive but i need to see what you can do with my own eyes my father used to take me hunting he was an avid hunter i personally hated it but always admired his skill with a knife and grew to appreciate what it takes to gut an animal have you ever tried to gut an animal yes good then you know it's not so easy as it looks like trying to stab a rubber ball bounce his back if you don't stab it correctly we're almost here you have to understand i didn't get where i am by blind faith okay we are almost there you see the shooting targets any fool can shoot a target with a knife that's where the talent lies my father always used to say if you look good with a knife you're even better with a gun i want to see your skills i don't know why but i've always trusted a man who would throw a knife i'm sure psychiatrist would ever feel a day with that statement so show me what you got do well and you work for me fail you get out of here and i never want to see your face again let's just hope this half as good as you were only time will tell but i doubt you cocky idiot look at that not bad at all [Music] that was a magnificent performance i like you i think we will get along just fine you've gained his trust what to do with all that take the rest of the day off you deserve it thank you sir it was an honor thank you sir you impressed me you really did please give me some space now you impressed me you really did but let's get to work some things you should know about me and this is very much on a need to know basis i'm here incognito so i want you to stay close but not too close especially when we are out in public if you see a man with a bodyguard it draws attention understood yeah of course come on follow me look it's just a precaution i've been personally invited by the royal highness omar al-ghazali i should have clearance the name is zaina kazeem sir i understand zana kazeem aka the vulture one of the top agents working for crystal dawn the pan-african terrorist organization i almost hired him myself once but chose the maelstrom instead now what is his business here but you can't enter without being searched it's standard procedure this is ridiculous well that's how it is think about it and come back if you want i'll be waiting upstairs in the reception understood crystal listen i want to talk to the partners directly make them understand why all of this is happening and that terminal gives me an idea there's a server room near the sheik's personal reception if you can gain access to it we might be able to recover useful intel from it you'll have to work together to hack the system but it's our best shot what's up if you want to pass you need to comply to a frisk sir nothing to worry about it's simple protocol sir you're good to go sir thank you for your patience oh mr kazeem i'm glad you changed your mind arrogance can be a dangerous trait yes indeed it can mr ingram has been expecting you we have a conference room set up for you please go in and make yourself comfortable mr ingram will be with you shortly thank you mr kazeem a pleasure to meet you omar tells me great things about you i'll get straight to the point i have uh well let's call it a dispute which the royal highness tells me you're very capable of taking care of now i've worked with your organization before in morocco i believe so i'm a little hesitant don't be we do what's needed well only time will tell i have two assignments for you take care of the first one and then we can discuss the bigger fish now under the first an acute problem has been brought to my attention keep talking i'll be candid with you no one is supposed to know that i'm here however there's a journalist down at the inauguration and he's asking rather intrusive questions about who's staying up here and that is a very dangerous problem for me now i want you to silence this little pain you think you can do that it's what i do best i like your bluntness this is his file hands looked bullets are winning free lance journalist he's good and won't give up until he gets the answers he needs and that can't happen consider it done good man and remember i want a picture i want proof so i can sleep tonight of course once this little assignment is completed come back and talk to miss toe then we can discuss the real cancer that needs to be removed i'm sure you can see yourself out hello i mean deprived but upstairs do you by any chance know who's staying there i i hear it's not just the royal highness i'm going to ask you politely to move along i don't appreciate your line of questioning well i was just curious but thanks for your keep time mr look i hear you're looking for information oh really okay hey what's happening upstairs i know more than you could imagine but we can't talk here follow me great lead the way wait no no no no no this this feels off i don't trust you i'm gonna walk away no harm done okay talk to me again if you mean business yes that's it now ingram trusts you it's like shooting fish in a barrel mr kazeem welcome back so you have the picture yes here good our guest will be delighted please follow me he's waiting mr kazeem please follow me hello sir i hope you have had time to see the art exhibition his royal highness has a keen eye for the arts if you haven't yet i highly recommend it [Music] have you seen the view yet it's quite spectacular on a clear back in china this would never be possible because of all the smog mr ingram is expecting you mr casine so good to see you do you have the picture yes your problem is fixed omar said you were good let's get down to the important business at hand okay people clear the room i need to discuss some delicate business with mr kazeem perfect we have ingram right where we want him excuse me for a second 47. you know what to do it's something to behold now where was i oh that's right my man here will stay for the meeting i assume that will not be a problem either way you have no choice in the matter it's interesting we haven't come across each other before mr kazeem well maybe not i usually have my people talk to people like you i can imagine i don't know how much omar i mean the royal highness has told you but my guess is very little so let me get straight to the point my organization has been hit by an unpleasant cancer that can only be removed by cutting it out of the gut if you get my drift yes i do good this little turd is spreading his vile toxic cells and i want him stopped brutally chemo won't remove him only the knife i have his file here arthur edwards a sly little devil if there ever was one me and my associates well we underestimated the little worm we want revenge i think you and i share a common interest i doubt that but i want you to make him suffer this is not a horse that needs to be put out of its misery this is a rabid dog that needs to be put down am i making myself clear mr kazeem yes consider it done good we're now in business we are i'll have miss toe send you anything you need we're done here oh one last question i'm just curious you're nicknamed the vulture why i find it's best to wait for the perfect kill i think you'll be perfect for the job nice to meet you mr kazeem i look forward to receiving an update safe hunting god yes mr ingram please show mr kazeem out yes sir mr kazem please follow me hmm a calendar function we can use this to summon the partners to a fake meeting 47. all right i'm no hacker like olivia but i think you need to pull one of the racks here to gain access to the terminal damn it a silent alarm has been tripped security is on its way hide 47. everything looks just fine damn my tea guys i'm sick of coming down here online yes sorry about that 47 let's try again shall we ah i think i've got it we'll need a key card to gain access someone in maintenance should have one we can borrow for a spell hey it's me i thought about what you said yeah i changed my mind it was an insane idea to start with exploding golf ball i don't want blood on my hand i have never taken things out i know i have issues admissions not that many of us have keys and people tend to stay out of that room anyways so no one will get hurt i'll take it home when my shift is over i love you too i'll be home as soon as possible bye that must have done something can you see anything different in the room good we're in now all you need to do is access the terminal and use the calendar option to summon the providence partners to a meeting good work the meeting has been booked the partners should be moving up here shortly looks like the lounge can be sealed off for private conversations andy excellent i see the partners moving you should join their meeting time to end this 47. building cameras are now disabled please stay back the partners are alone now i'll activate the panel controlling the room's security features when you're ready use it to start the show now we'll just wait for the partners to be alone then you can activate the room's lockdown feature i trust his people will have multiple scenarios ready for us very soon which reminds me we need to discuss alexa what's there to discuss she left us at the most critical moment she abandoned ship that family has never been trustworthy and alexa just proved to us that she and indeed any of her heirs isn't up to the task i agree she displayed extremely poor judgment i hope omar is able to step up at this time in particular we need a solid foundation to rebuild from and someone to help us hit that traitor edwards where it hurts oh he'll get what's coming to him you know marcus my father taught me many things throughout my life loyalty respect dedication edwards has betrayed all of those i look forward to teaching him the most important thing my father ever taught me the power of fear i think it's safe to say the situation has revealed some structural weaknesses in our organization we'll deal with them as swiftly and as harshly as we've been taught by our predecessors now what's holding up the chic what's this carl did you do that i certainly did not i have no idea what's going on gentlemen what's the meaning of this you you're the one responsible for all this grey what do you want something that has been a long time few revenge revenge how banal you killed cobb navikov caruso the washington twins everyone at haven you broke into our bank and you outed providence to the world whatever perceived slight we've done to you is insignificant to the amount of damage you've caused us you've caused the world you're a murderous terrorist nothing more what did we ever do to you anyway you specifically nothing providence everything providence made me and that the flick of a pen providence broke me i'm just returning the favor providence has ruined the lives of countless people expecting and facing no consequence for its actions you take for yourselves and those who support you and you burn everyone and everything else to the ground from the comfort of the shadows no more you're delusional exposing us achieve nothing beyond moving a few pieces around on a board much more complicated that you can fathom the world believes we're dead what more do you want me nothing my friend however well let's just say he's a bit of an expert i'm just here to watch you die 47 finish it gotta get out of here the hell is that security panel oh [ __ ] not a patient man are you finally stuyvesant and ingram are gone providence will soon be no more than a bad memory 47. thank you i'll meet you at the rendezvous on the edge of town [Music] [Music] [Music] that's your winning face i'd hate to see you lose we underestimated the constant now he's the glorified desk cluck he's not just after the money he wants it all we caught him once we can do it again and well we're not the ones who let him escape you still don't trust her i don't like executive decision makers look you don't have to follow her you know soon this will be over maybe it's time to think about the future you have to face the possibility that there's no going back if the ica knows what you did she'll make it right she always does we have a fix on carlisle come on we've got a plane to catch i hope you like the rain 47. miss burnwood how did you i have everyone's number you really ought to know by now you planned this all of it don't be silly i just played then i was doubt we'll find you you had me where'd that get you we handed you an empire it's for the best the partners were complacent set in their ways but power is more than just security providence can be an agent of change surely you understand or you will soon enough she came home carlisle's lust and empire you fall hard enough you tend to be reminded of what truly matters so the end of the line you ready for this are you who will you be without a score to settle i guess the world's most wanted fugitive will have to do [Music] alexa carlyle is dead according to the funeral invitation that is so naturally it caused quite a stir when the late matriarch turned up at the breakfast table alive and kicking carlisle wisely sensing that her number is up has emerged from exile to tie up loose ends and secure the carla legacy she may be a monster but you have to admire her due diligence carlisle descends from an ancient line of warrior aristocrats her great-grandfather made a killing in the second opium war and established an empire in shipping railroads and newspaper publishing while largely unknown to the public the family still asserts its quiet dominance over global transport and logistics media and technology most senior of the partners alexa carlisle is cold as ice tough as nails and sharp as a razor incidentally it was her late father who first brought the three families together after the end of world war ii at this very house meaning that this gentleman is the birthplace of providence it began here and it ends here talk about poetic one more thing according to our intel carlisle keeps a case file on the constant information that may be helpful in his recapture so don't give the estate without it right happyhunting47 see you on the other side [Music] thornbridge manor the carlisle family's home for countless generations the revenant alexa carlyle and her three adult children younger brother zachary grandson and daughter-in-law are all gathered to conduct carlisle's sham funeral curiously carlisle summoned a famous london pi soon after arriving this morning but his purpose at thornbridge is yet unclear now the target knows that you're coming and her guard detail is top notch so mr gray will secure their nearby field hq and intercept all calls going in and out of the estate any appeal for backup is going to fall on very deaf ears good luck gentlemen this is a private area sir phineas whitmer private investigator i have an appointment with madame carlisle please wait mr whitmer is here to see madame carlyle you can go write it that is phineas whitmer the famous private investigator hired by madame carla this morning i'm curious why he's here maybe you should do some detecting yourself 47. a famous private investigator summoned by alexa carlyle has arrived at thornbridge manor if you take his place it may be an opportunity to get close to madame carlisle i know i ought to say anything you're but everything's just so strange preparing for madame's funeral and then she turns up alive but then the awful business with her brother zachary and and all this security i've never seen a place guarded like this and and i dare say i don't like it at all no no mr whitmer thank you for coming on such short notice a great tragedy has fallen upon us and i need a quick resolution handled with absolute discretion results and discretion are my speciality very well i suppose you will want to start at the crime scene in my experience a thorough examination of a potential crime scene is half the job done good fernsby will take over from here i am mr fernsby the butler madam carlisle has asked me to assist you in any way possible mr whitmer i understand that you've traveled from london would you care for some refreshments or do you prefer to go straight to mr zachary's sleeping quarters i prefer to get started as you wish if you'll follow me sir i feel obliged to point out that current affairs surrounding madame carlisle are of a delicate nature you may be familiar with the recent announcement of her death you will probably learn that the staged funeral is scheduled to take place tomorrow madam's children were not informed until this morning that their mother was in fact not dead at all so please bear with them if they seem affected by the rather unusual situation i trust i do not need to remind you that there will be consequences if word gets out that madame carlisle is still alive i'll consider her dead when i leave before you inspect the crime scene i will tell you this the case concerns the death of mr zachary madame carlisle's younger brother he was found dead in his bed this morning the door was locked from the inside and a suicide letter was found in his room however madam carlisle suspects foul play and will not accept that he took his own life i've prepared some information for you so please do come and see me when you finish your investigation of the crime scene this is mr zachary's room to my right a lock to room murder mystery 47 i trust you'll get to the bottom of this zachary was shopping for new wellingtons last night not exactly what you would expect from someone suicidal zachary's suicide note also a sample of handwriting it could be relevant to compared to other samples to establish its authenticity why don't you use your camera to scan the dead body for 37. throat markings indicate a rare short-lived plant poison killed him spread shows time of death at around 10 o'clock last night you do know your poison's 47. a hidden door it's a secret passage this could explain how the door was locked from the inside hmm a photocopy of the floor plans somebody's been researching the secret ins and outs of thornbridge manor i believe you've done a thorough search of the crime scene 47 maybe it's time to see the butler i'm curious about the information he's prepared for you mr fernsby i'm done with the crime scene did you establish a time of death zachary died around 10 o'clock last night that means the staff were off duty and madame carlyle and her security didn't arrive until this morning that leaves madam's family and myself as the only persons here when he died and before you ask no i do not have an alibi i was alone in my office at the time of death here is the material that i prepared for you it's a list of the possible suspects and their quarters hopefully that will help you keep track of your findings please come and see me when you've solved the case and i will take you to madame carlisle this is very useful information 47. so how does one solve a murder mystery 47 motive means an opportunity i believe may i suggest you ask the suspects for alibis or perhaps do you prefer searching the mana for clues first yes i understand i'm sure we can come to some arrangement but you really need to talk to anthony he's the man with the papers listen you know who i am who my grandmother is was right just relax it'll be fine you'll get your returns don't worry give anthony a call okay patrick carlisle can you tell me where you were yesterday evening [ __ ] it's that sneaky butler isn't it he ratted me out elaine give us some privacy would you don't tell mother okay she's really tense these days and the last thing i need is more hassle i took that pretty blonde um rosie for an evening stroll i mean how the [ __ ] am i expected to cope for an entire weekend in this [ __ ] i'm bored out of my mind if that's all i think i'll get back to my slow death by boredom what did you think of zachary creepy as hell no ambition imagine deciding to live in a museum you know father says zachary and alexa used to be two of a kind he had a great future ahead of him then suddenly he just gave up everything what an idiot thank god daddy chose looks and brains over pedigree when he married mummy i don't have to worry about the inbreedings her customer in these circles so is that it did you see anything suspicious last night no i reckon zachary topped himself i know i would have or perhaps mr fernsby i don't like him he could have done it i'll have a damn good reason for not being here in person christ really don't have a clue do you i'm talking about that weasel arthur edwards can we get back what he stole from me so far it looks like we can't all the transfers of funds and privileges i've been through have been bulletproof he intercepted the arrangements our office worked years to put in place that's why don yates should be here he made the arrangements he should bloody well be the one to clean up this whole mess i uh i don't know what to say i'm sorry don't kill the messenger alexa please continue your efforts mr ford i can see from the log that rebecca was in a conference call from 9pm to midnight last night [Music] oh this all confirms that arthur edwards stole everything from adam carlisle perhaps you should let her know how bad it is 47. i received the vote patrick london did i understand correctly i should give it to rebecca in case you were there exactly she holds the other one i want her to have the file on arthur edwards if i die you're not fearful she'll be in trouble she knows she will start digging when she realizes things don't add up inevitably getting her in trouble i'd rather she knew who she's up against she's clever and resourceful who knows maybe she'll be able to hit him where it hurts but i don't want her to get involved prematurely hopefully she'll never have to get involved at all you faced great obstacles too i know we will persevere it is my duty to make that happen i've received more information about your situation mr ford we can't talk here go back to your office i will be there shortly what's the verdict mr ford undoubtedly some of my assets must be safe no everything is gone thornbridge manor surely that too but that's not i'll possible him i swear if it's the last thing i do thank you mr ford that will be all emmer carla can you tell me where you were yesterday evening surely i'm not a suspect i need to account for everyone well i spent the evening with my family but i got an awful migraine and had to take to bed everyone can attest to that i believe i went up when the boys sat down for a drink around eight o'clock is that all how did you feel about zachary i might as well be honest his presence was always awkward how do you have a meaningful conversation with a man who only cares about plants in my opinion alexa bears some responsibility for how this ended she supported his self-limiting behavior by letting him live here anything else you want to know have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary nothing special comes to mind except perhaps i did get a feeling that zachary was depressed not just sad i suppose he realized that he had no one with alexa gone even alexa must feel the pangs of guilt over that one letting him believe she was dead then again guilt isn't her strong suit right let's get started i want to keep this short i know you have a lot of questions some i will answer now the rest will have to wait first zachary's sudden death is a great tragedy but also a great inconvenience as it happened just now i'm dealing with the situation in a discreet and efficient way and i expect your cooperation in all related matters secondly the arranged funeral event tomorrow will take place as planned no one can know that i am still alive i expect you all to act your part last as you all know i have a lot on my plate and need to focus on sorting everything out so please do not disturb me with your petty concerns you are all adults and as part of the elite you will eventually have to deal with difficult situations like this it comes late for most of you but this is a chance for you to show what you are made of that will be all rebecca carla can you tell me about yesterday evening we don't really see much of each other my brother exit i suppose it takes our mother's shoes to bring us together you know i think he might be in some sort of trouble edward wanted to go as well but gregory convinced him to stay for a few drinks before they went off for a pint at the local at a quarter to nine i swear gregory enjoys edward's discomfort over staying here i had a conference call with my new york office at nine so i spent three hours on my laptop in my room and went straight to bed afterwards i don't know about emma she did act a bit strange you know i bet she was making lists for changes needing to be done once she gets her hands on thornbridge manor quite the shock she had when mother arrived during breakfast is there anything else you want to ask me tell me about zachary did he act strange last night you know now you mention it he was a lot more chatty than usual he wanted to know about my connections in the publishing business apparently a friend of his is writing a book which strikes me as very peculiar i didn't think he had any friends is that everything mr whitmer i do have a lot to see too anything else you feel like mentioning i may be wrong but i saw mr fernsby the butler leave zachary's room early this afternoon and he seemed a bit startled when he saw me in the hallway it's probably nothing oh and one more thing please be kind to edward he can only take so much ah my perfect mother of thought you [ __ ] up didn't you staging your own death a major grandiose cock-up i'd say be quiet gregory it says you're only human after all i never would have guessed gregory carlisle can you tell me where you were yesterday evening oh you're wondering about my alibi mr detective well um i left thornbridge around half eight for a pint with edward i wish i hadn't quiz night at the inn on the other hand staying here with zachary my obnoxious sister and the wife sporting another one of her headaches would have been a fate worse than death the the short of it zachary was very much alive when we left i stayed for the last shout and i was back here just before midnight anything else you want to pry from my intricate intellect tell me about zachary zack such a sad old sod a bit heavy on the bottle but you could blame him only company he had was his rare plants and mother who travels more than she stays here honestly i can't say which is the bigger ball he's better off dead is that all not very thorough are you anything else you'd like to tell me nothing really i'm just enjoying the show our perfect mother obviously [ __ ] up didn't she faking her own death you know she's explained nothing to us i think she's scared to own up to her own mistake professor edward carlisle can you tell me your whereabouts for last night oh yes this dreadful business with zachary i stay at the local inn you see i prefer not to spend the night here at thornbridge manor my brother gregory came along for a nightcap he'll never admit it but i think he understands that i find this whole thing upsetting and wanted to provide some comfort i believe we went to the stacks head around half past eight anything else i can do to help can you tell me about zachary's behavior last night i certainly didn't expect him to commit suicide sure he was upset by mother's supposed death we were but he seemed more engaged than usual you should ask rebecca they had a long talk did you know that he hadn't left thornbridge manor in nearly 50 years his plants mother and the staff all the company he had if that's all i have a speech to write did you notice anything else out of the ordinary you mean apart from the fact that we came here to bury our mother and she shows up alive and kicking zachary found dead in his bed this morning or perhaps of the planned funeral is still taking place and i have to do the eulogy and mother will surely have strong opinion on it afterwards i can't breathe excuse me you always led by example rather than by words and meaningless gestures like hugs very encouragement just a single spontaneous caress what a difference that would have made right i clearly remember when i was five i climbed a tree and could not make my way down i was scared and called out for help of all people you heard me and when you saw me you climbed the tree i was relieved that help had finally arrived but can i help you in any way mr edward friends me thank you no i'm afraid not some fresh air may do you good it might but i need to finish mother's eulogy for tomorrow she doesn't think i can do it does she did she say anything to you mr edward your mother has very high standards i'm under the impression they are rarely met by anyone but herself oh god she expects me to fail tomorrow will soon be over and then you can put all this behind you i'm sure you'll do splendidly just wait and see i don't know i hope so that is the door to mr fernsby's office what's gonna come of it stick to your own kind you mean like chris he treated me like [ __ ] all he wanted to do was play his stupid video games never any romance i deserve a romance madam carlyle is well and emma won't be moving in all things do eventually come to an end did all the groceries arrive no sir some of the delivery people were unhappy with the security of the game she never misses a step gossiping at work both fake funeral tomorrow zachary found dead upstairs today death is everywhere i never thought of it that way oh god it's such a big responsibility having a baby i have to protect it right how are things coming along outside will everything be ready for the funeral event tomorrow i would say so mr fernsby as long as the birds don't make too much of a mess may i add that the undertaker mr parsons is not happy about putting on a pretend funeral he's worried about his reputation if he gets out yes i expected as much he certainly are strange days i suppose we'll never get an explanation it's not our place to question madame carlisle no i know can't ever wonder i'm getting a headache from all the decisions i mean pram or stroller comforter or not should i ask her to marry me what if she says no and then this big funeral thing tomorrow it's the last thing i need i remember how it was with the first one the ones that come after certainly are a lot less of a worry rosie tell me what you did last night i'm in trouble aren't i i i spent the evening with patrick we met after dinner and i went home at one in the morning he said he needed someone real to talk to when he looks at you it makes you feel like the center of the universe like a real princess but now he just ignores her well he's under a lot of pressure he's an idiot that's what he is did you notice anything out of the ordinary any strangers outside the house no no we saw no one outside except patrick's mother emma we were sitting on the bench behind the greenhouse talking when she came out and um we had to hide you won't tell her about me and patrick will you she'd insist madam carlyle fire me i'm sure of it too right she will she's always going on about how things will change once she's in charge of thornbridge manor zachary's diary this is big he was about to confess to the world that he and alexa murdered their older brother montgomery 46 years ago and apparently mr fernsby helped make the murder look like an accident and 47 the handwriting doesn't match the suicide letter in his room proving he didn't write it himself painkillers lethal if you use enough of them but not the poison used to kill zachary of course madame carlisle doesn't know that are you considering to frame the butler 47 mr fernsby clearly didn't commit the murder but i think you have enough evidence to convince madam carlyle he did maybe you should tell him you are ready to present your findings unless of course you want to do some more detecting 47 that door leads to emma and gregory's room a keychain pendant for the greenhouse what's that doing in emma and gregory's room i wonder and why is the key missing now this is interesting food seven a letter from emma's mother stating that emma is the illegitimate child of alexa's late older brother montgomery and listen to this she claims to have witnessed alexa and zachary murder him the plot thickens we don't have any extra fuses ethel looked everywhere oh you've got to be kidding me no power no portrait oh madam carlyle will be furious she expects the family photo to be done any moment now i need this shoot to happen okay and i need it to be perfect can't can't we just take a fuse from another fuse box so madame carlyle wants a picture taken if you were to assist with the missing fuse i'm sure the portrait would be one for the ages uh i i guess we could do that good i'll finish setting up and then we'll grab the fuse just before good i'll finish setting up and then we'll grab the fuse just before you call down the family good yeah that's a good plan [Music] in the greenhouse how curious damn it i need this to work [Music] oh you startled me [Music] i i was just i don't know thinking about zachary he spent most of his life in here with these plants not much of a life is it well anyway i'll be outside if you need me if you'd excuse me broken lab equipment it looks like it was recently used though [Music] this is a table showing lethal dosages for the poison used to kill zachary something is circled 47 female age 65 to 79 60 to 64 kilograms i'd say madame carlyle is next in line for a poisoning you have uncovered enough evidence to tell madam carlisle that emma is the murderer quite the detective 47 i'm impressed i said just you go tell mr fernsby unless you think there are more secrets to uncover the 41 guests will attend the future i'm ready to present zachary found dead upstairs today death is everywhere i never thought of it that way oh god it's such a big responsibility having a baby i have to protect it right there are a lot of them on the grounds talk to mr fernsby he's in charge of the staff this is madame connaught your detective skills have gained you access to the lion's den 47 now go claim your reward so mr whitmer you've reached a conclusion take a seat please go ahead your niece emmer carlisle murdered your brother zachary my niece emma is not my niece she's my daughter-in-law and your niece emmer is the illegitimate child of your late older brother montgomery who you and zachary killed 46 years ago that's preposterous you asked me to find out what happened to zachary would you rather not know no no go on i found a letter from emmer's mother jane who was the fiance of your older brother at the time of his death she witnessed how you and zachary pushed him off the balcony she believed you did it to steal the carlisle empire from her and her unborn child and she raised emma to reclaim what she lost marry your heir gregory get revenge and secure the carlisle empire for her bloodline generations to come emma is the daughter of montgomery and that local girl jane she is well the girl got it wrong i didn't steal anything i did what was necessary to protect the future of the carlisles montgomery wasn't cut out to take over from father all heart and no balls emmer used a funeral gathering to speed up her installment as the lady of the house seizing the opportunity to stage zachary's suicide she did her homework used a poison made from one of zachary's rare plants found old floor plans from thornbridge manor to gain access to his room through a secret passage that scheming [ __ ] more than you think i found proof that she will try to poison you next well i'll have to take care of that thank you mr whitmer you have not disappointed i promised you i would reward you generously if you solved the case so what do you suggest i want the file you have on arthur edwards edwards the constant but how do you oh i see i expected you might show up but to kill me not help me and i've been wrong on so many things lately so why not this one i will give you the file on edwards you've earned it [Music] i don't suppose i could convince you to deal with my daughter-in-law now you're here i would like to see her dead no what a say i'll have to see to it some other way then [Music] the file you want is in the safe god i hope you get it great i need some privacy thank you good work 47 that's the file on arthur edward secured time to take care of madame carlisle gregory don't say more to that weird detective than you need to i was just having a laugh dear must admit he's pretty good what if he believes we had something to do with zachary's death oh please he's circling us i don't see him snooping around your sister i bet alexa said something if i could be bothered i'd be worried about your mental health emma but sorry i'm having too much fun enjoying the circles excellent 47. madam carlisle is on her way down for the family photo shoot let's see if any memorable moments will play out in front of the camera hi good afternoon tomorrow it is isn't it it won't last though my mother will have things back in order in no time and that's what she does create precise order in all her affairs never letting go i'm the youngest i guess i just flew under the radar when it came underneath down by the fountain i don't think so she really respects you if you just stopped craving her approval you're nearly 50 edward i know i'm such a loser but you're not you're a professor you're artistic you've got your music i mean that's really something it's not exactly expanding the carlisle empire though but thanks that does help a little i wish he'd hurry up this place is sucking the life out of me it won't hurt you to relax for a bit right ahead please i expect you to be efficient i have a lot to see to today i'll do my best right get in position let's get this over with there's a puddle of water here oh never mind let's just get this done shall we chin up edward no one wants to look at that long face you're such an idiot gregory i'm fine rebecca fine you look like a nervous wreck stop victory well mother you certainly know how to lighten the mood mission complete well done 47. oh god oh no oh you are messed up tell you what i'm gonna go get help it feels like i can't breathe in there the tension is off the charts yeah 47 don't respond just listen diana can't help you now you need to find olivia she will know what to do [Music] and then there were none thank you miss burnwood now it's my turn stay down the bus wants you alive yeah how about now [Music] over here cover me [Music] walk away or what you gonna take us all on don't tell the constant to start running you think you've won 47 is out there and 47 never misses his mark neither do you miss burnwood that's what makes you valuable you're delusional you think i would betray 47. trust me you owe him nothing what is this i told you we could help each other and i meant it i look forward to your call gray is gone go to berlin and stay out of sight [Music] for all that's left now we've been compromised abort and walk away now ica they tracked me don't know how it's what they do how many one prime asset and a whole pack of up-and-comers they've infiltrated the club searching for us chris i think i killed one of them get out now before they spot you no they found us once they'll find us again keep your head down i'll take care of this do you copy [ __ ] yeah it's it's terrible reception it must be the trees no no trace of our target yet agent price i will i always work by the book you don't have to worry about that hello hello crap this is like looking for a needle in a haystack just keep trying agent montgomery our client considers agent 47 and olivia hall as a serious threat you can't underestimate them i never do joe we'll find them we're all in position good report back to me if there's anything don't worry swan here i'll quiet so far he's here he has to be don't get comfortable agent swan oh hey agent swann are you still there there's a second agent down are you all sleeping out there we could not have stacked the deck more in our favor and still ugh this is davenport no sign of target stay alert we don't need to give him an opportunity to strike agent davenport montgomery here everyone in position confirmed huh we got ourselves an accident montgomery i need a report montgomery no he got montgomery i told that bastard not to get so cocky damn it he's anticipating every move we make he might be listening in there's no other explanation for it go silent we can't risk it much appreciated hey i'm looking for a man regular height bald caucasian are you a cop no he's a friend we're supposed to meet him in the chill-out room but he hasn't turned up i thought he might have dropped by it's a pretty vague description you guys you kind of described every man here i suppose but he also has this big tattoo uh who doesn't sorry man you're on your own besides i don't talk to cops i'm not a cop yeah right i haven't seen your friend okay go look elsewhere when this job is done i will be back and i'll beat some respect into you command reporting in no updates yet understood stay watchful it's only a matter of time now hey tim's calling in i only got visual on stoned idiots no sign of target he's here he has to be don't get comfortable hey you what are you doing get back to work are you talking to me i am working doesn't look like it i've been sent from the head chapter under cover because they believe some of rolf's crew meaning you morons are being a little light-fingered that's [ __ ] is it either way i could just blame you too they've cut people's balls off for less ask ralph if you don't believe me hey man i'm sorry no offense meant just do what you do i mean we're innocent yeah right strange sweet how the hell did he we're done get out i'm not losing any more of you confirmed we're clear you killed all of them they got my message where are you diner off the main road on my way you're hurt you should see the other guy i've never killed nobody before what you did back there you really are all gray said you'd be 47 he didn't suffer did he he made it count bruce but not broken i'm glad it's time we start afresh you and me get to the point you and your friends pulled off the impossible you stormed the heavens took down the untouchables and yet here we are status quo it just goes to show you can't fight power miss burnwood power never dies it only changes hands the best you can do is claim it i never cared about power power is a tool miss burnwood it's the thing that gets you to the thing as the next constant you can be the agent of change transform the system from the inside will be transformed by it no risk no reward i'll need to think about it no you won't the real question is what will you bring to the table [Music] look closer i'm telling you the file is trash the constant doesn't so much burn his bridges as blow them up arthur edwards whoever he was don't exist anymore his personal data somehow deletes itself from any system that records him way beyond advanced the partners spared no expense to make sure their controller would be untraceable how untraceable look i did what you asked but gray's gone and i know diana i'm not who you need right now you gotta be kidding me ica i used every encryption known to man who are these guys the best it's only a matter of time before they get lucky we need to take them down you and which army i know where the agency stores its files mission reports client data if we leak it to the public you want to whistle blow the ica it's the path of least resistance turns out you are who i need right now olivia i do this and i'm out so what are we breaking into data facility in chunking china run by a man called hush of course the ica side in chongqing houses the agency's data storage and analyst division needless to say security is daunting the state-of-the-art server vault is biometrically wired to the facilities to overseers imogen royce behavioral analysis pioneer and hush a data security guru with a taste for fringe transhuman experimentation tell me about hush a former cyber terrorist for the ministry of state security in kedan yang who fled his country after one of the po regime's periodic purges he made a career doing cyber security for dark web deplorables human traffickers organ harvesters scum like him with no code or conscience ica sure can pick him no offense can you disable security a dual authentication protocol ensures that any handling of data must be directly authorized by hush and royce the proverbial human factor device make the system impenetrable luckily i found a loophole if both overseers should unexpectedly die within a short space of time the system reverts to a temporary felsafe protocol which i can bypass take them off the board and you'll have free access to the data core and i'll handle the rest and you're sure it'll work look i know hush if i'm wrong we won't live long enough to regret it all right i will leave you to prepare chong king china this city is big brother's wet dream with more than 2.5 million cameras covering 15 million people privacy is a four letter word in this place it's pretty ironic that a cloak and dagger organization like the ica keeps its most valuable secrets here you'll find hush conducting his fringe experiment in an abandoned apartment building while imogen royce the archivist runs a day-to-day business at the ica data facility i just hope you know what you're doing 47 no they only want people like us the flyer cesso that means it's too dangerous for rich people don't do it oh i'm going this is my chance i just need to find out where it is but the player has a symbol i need to find a building that's got hush written all over it using the desperate for personal gain maybe this is a way for you to get to the bastard mr pritchard i presume hi i'm chanting pleased to meet you i'll be your guide on the facility tour spare me the pleasantries i've had an awful flight nine hours delayed luggage lost somewhere along the way and the airline is trying to avoid their responsibility i'm hungry and i'm tired and i want to straighten everything out before i'm doing your tour yes so sorry about your flight just let me know when you're ready oh did you bring the p41 we left for you in the apartment no i wasn't informed that i should so someone is here for a tour of the facility might be a way to get in very sorry mr pritchard we need you to bring the p-41 to get the tour it's procedure please pick it up before you come and find me i'll be waiting by the stairs in the back of the restaurant kitchen the vip has access to the kitchen i'll be waiting for him hello mr pritchard i've just learned that your plane will be delayed beyond the lifetime of the entry code you received for the facility for your convenience we've set up the new code to be 0118 to match the one for the apartment i hope you enjoy your stay hi chanting here mr pritchard i'm just calling to tell you to bring your p41 for the facility tour thank you mr prichard i just read your report and share your concerns regarding this ability leadership behavior i fully back your decision to inspect and i would appreciate updates on your initial findings as they come in good job oh you got new menus i had no idea uh do you still have the uh sorry what right yeah uh just some sparkling water is fine so do you oh right here yeah so i'd like to get some soup dumplings right sorry yeah with the crab uh and how about some of those [ __ ] what are they called the crispy ones yes those perfect you know what i'll get a double order and a plate of the pork balms no i'm not meeting him at the apartment he went straight to the restaurant i guess he was hungry after the nine-hour flight delay i'll give him the tour of the facility when he's ready yeah i'll keep you updated surely how am i supposed to focus when the kitchen feels like a train station find your inner zen close your eyes and focus your mind on a discretion bonus on the paycheck that's what i do that is a calming bonus i don't know when he'll be ready for the tour but i'll wait for him here no he's lost his luggage and wants to handle that first of course i will thank you oh god i don't feel so good huh just glad it's not me mom you can't call me when i am at work yes yes i know i am not home and that is in the middle of the night that was a bit of a hang up and i had to stay i am 24 years old i'm hanging up i'm ready to inspect the facility now good i hope you enjoyed the food did you bring the p-41 we left for you in the apartment yes i have everything i need good let's continue the tour continue you may say we haven't even started the tour yet but we have without you even noticing it mr pritchard invisibility is the best security there is you see the restaurant is in fact a flood that let all ica personnel arrive unseen who notices a dumpling cook on his way to work dressing the part takes you a long way ica guarantees absolute discretion to all clients we take that promise very seriously as you will see on all steps of the tour let's step inside doesn't look like much does it ms chen and visitor welcome please report to security desk for visitors sign in will do i love the facility ai it's really looking out for us and we're in the inside is a self-contained modular build that can be disassembled and removed in less than 12 hours if we are compromised no trace we will ever hear i agree leaving no trace behind is the only sensible ammo the outside shell is a building marked for demolition we put a hold on it with city planning a deliberate misplacement of the order but have people in place to rectify that at first shift city construction will move in our policy around ica personnel is that they are a resource but also a risk on top of contractual repercussions if breaches occur we perform detailed vetting on everyone the first blunt vetting is a frisk we have of course never had any employees trying to bring unauthorized weapons inside the facility but we do consider the step important i'll need to start the setup of your visitor security clearance here mr pritchard hey it's me sorry to wake you up could i please have your people to watch the coffee machine when i left yeah sorry just make sure it doesn't catch fire get so feel free to have a look around i'll meet you on the other side of the frisk naturally you'll have to be frisked like everyone else no exceptions mr pritchard there's no way you're getting through that door 47. it only opens for people with an authentic security clearance the signal is encrypted without a dongle we can't hack it sir if you want to pass through i need to check that you're not carrying anything dangerous okay you're all fine off you go good you're here i've started the security clearance process it will take a little while since you're covered by the xero protocol all your data will be encrypted and inaccessible without your authorization only facility ai will use it for id analysis fully anonymized of course but we can go a few more steps on the tour while it's validating id analysis what the hell does that mean give me a minute i'll try to find out as i said personnel is the greatest asset but also the greatest risk of the ica the work we do here exists high level pressure on our employees and there is no room for mistakes we perform a daily multi-layered full body scan to guarantee that no employee will act erratically because of ptsd or other mental issues drug use physical health issues external pressure or moral hesitancy the scan only takes a few seconds come on it's this way inside i'm sorry but we can proceed beyond this room until your security clearance is finalized so why don't you have a little look around while we wait mr richard it should be here shortly [ __ ] we need to intercept that 47 or the facility ai will blow your cover get me into one of those computers and do it fast you've got 60 seconds before all hell breaks loose good i'm in and you're safe that was a close one perfect timing your clearance just came through let's continue let's step inside i'm thinking about getting some we are very serious about security what we protect is after all core to all ica operations we and we alone store all legal work contracts target profiles employee files contract documentation and validation and so forth furthermore we handle all current operations effectuate logistics of personnel and equipment our analysts do the client vetting target profiles and of course offer real-time contract support to handlers and operatives storage and transmission of sensitive information like that takes constant vigilance to keep safe we have a team of engineers solely dedicated to that task and on top of that we have a dual human authentication process set up all access and alterations to the source are oh good there she is hi imogen royce i've been looking forward to meeting you likewise that's imogen royce quite the [ __ ] apparently nothing wrong with her look though edgy after you this is the blast and emp shielded core room the nervous system of the ica where we store the past and facilitate the present in general only a handful of people can access this room hush and myself plus bodyguards and a chosen few of the engineers i'm the most likely person to meet in here because i perform a regular physical check-in on the core console as a supplement to the remote authentication procedure we have a strict routine of daily core maintenance part of that procedure is a flash process evaporating all biological matter in the room you can see reed through that window it's her job to initiate the maintenance don't worry we're safe as long as the safety mechanism is engaged even if reed presses the button the procedure will not happen until we leave the core room the doors to the core room are all equipped with you know what screw this tour i know why you're really here cunning to the chase i see knowledge is power more importantly knowledge is opportunity let me demonstrate you have a sixth sense for irregularities and although hush's recent behavior has not been reported it has no doubt brought you here you do have authority to shut down unwanted efforts but at heart you are progressive and not the stickler everyone thinks you are you have sway with the board and as i see it your opinion is now what decides my future and the future of the ica so here we go imagine this having a time schedule on a target with minute details on locations durations and purpose a detailed layout of a target's actions within a defined time frame that would transform a contract into a surgical dance of precision no mess no fuss low cost just how i like it i've been working on a prediction algorithm based on a combination of big data analysis and micro targeted surveillance of defining target markers and my results are astounding all this state-of-the-art is nothing but heavy old-fashioned machinery compared to what i offer analysts preparing detailed files dedicating days weeks to prepare our contracts gone handlers and analysts supporting our operatives during missions gone teams for cleanup and media manipulation in the rare case something unforeseen does happen all of it gone i asked you to imagine that scenario but what good is imagination when you can see it with your own eyes i've set up [Music] sup three employees unaware that i can accurately predict their behavior firing them will result in an already clearly defined reaction on the top left we have sharon reed who you saw downstairs she is a dutiful and trusted employee if she is to be fired my algorithm predicts with a certainty of 97.8 that she will finish up her most important tasks before she leaves the building specifically she will press the maintenance button within 11 seconds jeremy bolt the guard in the lower left is as tough as nails when on but in private he's a real mummy's boy if fired he will immediately call his mother and at her advice seek out who he considers his best friend for support my personal guard as it stands me really [Music] well explains why he's always next to me at lunch at the top right you see alicia reynolds bright and very passionate about her job however also very possessive about her contribution my prediction is that she will try to disable the work she has done for the ica if she's not allowed to enjoy her results no one is specifically that means she will try to enter the courtroom and disable the safety mechanism i'll leave you to consider your choice of who you want me to use for the demonstration just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back i will have a closer look maybe your project could play a part in the future of the ica just let the guard outside the door know when you're ready and i'll be right back oh and if you decide to leave the room a guard will escort you around safety protocol thought i'd just mention it she really takes the term god complex to a whole new level sitting in there pulling the strings like that i think you should take her set up and give it a spin 47 i see potential if you time it right alicia reynolds i regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status thank you for your service jeremy bolt i regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status thank you for your service can't be right code 41 is confirmed effective for your employment status oh god this is not good this is not good mom it's jerry i think i've just been fired i have no idea i thought it was going really well i like it here i can't believe it but who though friend sharon reid i regret to inform you that code 41 is now effective for your employment status thank you for your service [Music] good that's imogen royce down take care of hush and we can get to the core hey how's your back doing lately are you still keeping up with those stretches it's a little sore there's something i can't live with you accept that you may suffer partial or complete memory though yes you understand that full compensation for the above mentioned is part of the agreement looking good today sir and you waive all future rights to seek further compensation yes who would you like to benefit from the proceedings if you yourself are incapacitated would you excuse me so hush likes the last one i sent up to the top floor he'll be the one to conclude this phase i knew hush would be pleased with him he signed up for the full package strong too all things considered i'll wrap up down here thanks julie i was just informed that we don't need any more test subjects tonight i don't understand there's no work oh no there will be more to come depending on the results of the conclusion to this test phase come back tomorrow and we'll schedule a new spot for you come in and take a seat you there i'm sorry to inform you that we have all the test subjects we'll need for tonight but you're welcome to fill in your information now and come back tomorrow a guard is waiting outside the door he'll escort you out of the building when you're done help yourself to an apple for your trouble i do need my vitamins test prep page 109 initiated focus now identify defining moment prepare incision .017 link suggestion to defining moment execute my head no no no no i'm back [Music] load suggestion motor control 44.1 test prep h109 initiated signal strength at 40 confirmed where was i oh ah yes let's see identify memory marker section 14 amplify amplify good good good don't get too excited hush where's the final test subject everything is ready to conclude the motor control phase of my experiment he's in the bathroom having second thoughts about signing up make him come out i'm trying maybe it's good for you to have a bit of a break before you start the final experiment i don't want to hear it again my big break it just feels wrong too much of a risk if i do this i can give my family a future i had to do it but don't you understand what i'm trying to do here i won't let pain stop me i'm ready to experiment oh good i'll let sisterlay know to join us for the experiment then greetings sir you're done for now come on we'll get started when sister lays here he's ready for you hush he looks strong good a good specimen to conclude this phase we'll get started when sister lays here no no no don't have time to chat so the test subject came to his senses i see good sister lay yes we're about to perform the final test of this project phase sit one-on-one with hush 47 make him hurt ready when you are ginley let's start at 100 signal strength oh i mean no there's no need the subject is clean cooperative i was thinking 25 and then adjust if necessary 60 is minimum we'll get no motor control below and i'm not wasting my time but 60. log concluding experiment h109 initiate run calibration 60 signal strength 60 confirmed h109 initiated load suggestion motor control 44.1 execute the signal's too low i need to focus the signal's too weak they'll get nothing like this go to 100 it's not safe you've been working too hard with your condition it can cause you real physical harm it's safe you're strong you can overcome it 100 do it log continuing experiment h109 run calibration 100 h109 initiated at signal strength 100 now i'll see you dance identify impulse string load suggestion motor control 44.1 execute it's too low he's got spirit come on do that we need to go higher i can get to him just need to focus abort you're going too far no he's on the verge to break him go higher it'll kill him it's already way beyond reasonable intensity this subject is abnormally resistant he's no match for hush nothing worth [ __ ] ever came to be without pain i am calling it quits hush you need rest [Music] okay okay a short break i'll return with a clear head goddamn that assistant if they up the signal it will kill him stay put or stay close i want you in that chat return i'll stick around no way right i'm so glad you decided to go ahead with it you know you're going to be part of something truly amazing he's a g yes hush and this is groundbreaking research it's an honor really but um he's under a lot of pressure these days so if you could just go along with it okay don't try to resist

to worry about intruders it's all here clients operatives every hit the ica ever sanctioned enough to shut them down for good but first you need to locate all files referencing diana and yourself [Music] tell me what did it feel like taking lives random disorder well we are here basic training starts at 600 hours i should leave you to prepare perhaps i see possibility where others see limitation i choose him the two of you go way back i didn't realize that you i don't know i get why you want to protect her so wipe all the data referring to the two of you from their system before we publish the rest [Music] okay good i've set up a link to an information non-profit site when you press that button is up there and the whole world will know there's no undo 47 this will shut the ica down for good you really okay with this it's who you've been for so long maybe it's time for a change [Music] i'll just return things to normal no need to alert them we were here prematurely [ __ ] i missed that we're blown 47 i can hold the doors for a little while use the fence to get out go now personnel reach protocol initiated this is bad that means they'll shoot on site i'm going to create some havoc 47 make the core meltdown maybe we'll defer their attention a bit warning core overheating warning core shutdown temperature critical warning fire detected rain rain [Music] [Music] we turn now to the data leak bombshell causing shock waves across the world the so-called ica files the disclosure you win so what happens now the ball's in your court miss burnwood i do have other candidates you know most of whom have never tied me to a chair you've seen the news that was 47 acting on his own he is untethered he is unstoppable and he cannot be bargained with he will find you mr edwards and i'm the only chance you've got i'm less than 47 has one weakness me [Music] i found something buenos aires international airport this morning now watch this harold trail ends at the airport but turns out that a top providence operative owns a vineyard in the area don yates of infamous new york law firm morgan yates and cohn can get this testing his retirement party today she's infiltrated them she's sending a message she needs my help could have for me you don't know her anyway if you're going after her you'll need to deal with the herald her name's tamara vidal former cia asset and political firebrand she's a master of surveillance and the constant most trusted aid she'll have eyes everywhere you won't get far as long as she's in the game why are you telling me this i thought you were out yeah old habits i guess anyway i i need to go see you around 47 no you won't [Music] because you're not an idiot let's just humor him yet he likes his little game don't be long you got my message you'd never get caught on camera not unless you wanted to be seen so what's the play you're not the only one who's been busy 47 i'm this close to becoming the next constant i'll be able to dismantle providence from the inside only one man stands in my way don yates that weasel was the partner's legal counsel for years he's the top candidate but remove him from the playing field it won't work if edward suspects i will convince him you acted alone retaliation for grey trust me i know what i'm doing the herald tamara vidal she has eyes everywhere and they're all fixed on you the plan won't work unless we take her out she never leaves my side for long whatever your plan is i'll help you if i can you're sure about this as sure as i'll ever be here i got you an invitation just like old times come find me when it's done good luck 47. ready pam three two one and for more than two decades new york based law firm morgan yates and cohn has been among the most successful and the most controversial companies in the united states founded in the greed is good downtown era of the mid-1980s by kenneth morgan don yates and theodore cohn the firm quickly amassed an impressive client roster counting such corporate behemoths as top investment bank milton fitzpatrick and van orton tobacco a reputation for ruthlessness and dirty tactics no doubt originating with a notorious affluenza defense of murderous socialite chelsea whitmore has long stuck to their name but despite the persistent outrage of progressives the firm has enjoyed a seemingly never-ending streak of successes and legal triumphs this however may be changing just a few months ago senior partner ken morgan passed away unexpectedly at the himapan hotel in bangkok and now another of the founding partners don archibald yates in front of whose argentinian vineyard i am currently standing has announced his retirement from the firm and so the burning question in the upper echelons of corporate america is this i mean they fade has morgan yates and cone finally run out of steam i am pam kingsley reporting live from mendoza argentina on gnn news mustn't be late figure is fairly common in these parts after all i'll get a picture later for what i [Music] on don't i know how to deal with the likes of don yates the one we need to worry about is corvo black yates fixer you know him i see a regular i always suspected he was a middleman for morgan yates and cone i never took his contracts nasty piece of work below my standards but plenty of my colleagues were less picky well they certainly got theirs i wonder how your agent will feel if he saw you now he wouldn't 47 is a weapon and weapons don't judge they go where they're pointed oh that's cold i like you more already [Music] not just a puddle either we're talking knee deep the whole place looked like a horror flick of course yes came down until the poor sod in charge of the tanks you'd think there was some kind of fail-safe mechanism or early warning system in place yeah you would but you'd be wrong if the pumps malfunction the tanks overflow that pretty much sums it up so pay attention to that pump flow unless you're in the market for an extra orifice lightning never strikes twice we'll be flying these fermentation tanks are accident prone if the pump malfunctions the tanks overflow this has happened before provoking an appearance from don yates it's likely to happen again i didn't know we had investors come in a private tour mr yates with all due respect we are about to harvest them all back i hardly think this is the best use of my time fine if you say so who is the audience okay and the last one corvo black is he your um fixer the scary one okay i'll clear my schedule a private tour of the estate diana vidal and this fixer corvo black black is a threat but also an opportunity yates's own machinations are inconsequential joining the tour will give access to vidal away from the crowd thank you mr yates enjoy the why does he want me to play tour guide to his socialized friends it's our best day he probably just wants to show off patron i know i would [Music] sir this is a no-go you can't pass through here you must be burnwood and vidal and you must be huge man it's a living what's your excuse well we're all here it seems except for our guide mr vargas suppose someone ought to fetch him black i'm looking in your direction yeah let me know how that works out for you well this is fun [Music] welcome to vineta yates i'm gabriel vargas chief winemaker and i will be your tour guide any questions before we start yes but they're all above your pay grade we're good lead the way senor vargas follow me hey yo what's up first stop on the tour is the production floor where our prize-winning malbec grapes are processed our equipment is state of the art including a dragon freezer unit and last but not least our great crusher industrial size for your disposal purposes interesting follow this is an industrial cold storage unit useful for preventing cellular decomposition it easily reaches temperatures of minus 10 degrees celsius trust me you don't want to stay inside for long no kidding hey there's no doorknob on the inside seems like a pretty glaring safety omission if you ask me probably sound proof too and good luck getting a phone signal follow me please this is our grape crusher the de-stemmed grapes are crushed into a thick pulp by a powerful rotating cylinder making each grape quite impossible to id have you heard any workplace accidents what fall into the vat and get crushed to a pulp you'd have to be a bona fide idiot waste a space if you ask me follow me please next on our tour is the fermentation atrium in these spacious tanks which could easily be able to contain a couple of hundred human bodies the sugars in the wine are converted to alcohol this is also where we squeeze the must into a fine juice using our grape presser fascinating come along this is the facility's grape presser where the freshly crushed pulp is pressed through a fine filter leaving only the flesh and skins behind much more efficient than the ancient practice of grape stomping but also less personal so this is what the little guy feels like our large fermentation tanks are constructed from solid french oak and each contain up to 500 gallons of grape must you don't want to fall in but if you do at least you'll die happy well looks like an accident waiting to happen occupational hazard neighborhood final stop the barrel room nothing dramatic just wine biting its time the vault next door contains our most precious bottles but the access doors are made from ballistic glass and can only be unlocked from the security room high above our heads so unless you're the sparrow don't get any ideas remarkable ah here comes mr yates now perfect timing ah miss burnwood is it not don yates pleased to meet you you come very highly recommended as chief of the heralds let me be the first to say welcome aboard why thank you mr yates rest assured that i will be following your every lead very closely say that reminds me we're about to have a little herald get together up the house just a modest toast to celebrate my forthcoming inauguration is constant you are of course most welcome to join us i believe you shall make a fine herald once the training wheels are off i wouldn't miss it for the world capital right this way into the lion's den oh almost forgot cortisar please nip down to the wine cellar and tell mr flowers this sommelier to prep the 1945 grand paladin and bring it up to the house for our special occasion got it chief flowers mr yates wants the 1945 grand paladin brought up to the house special occasion what what did aliens land on the front lawn have the ghosts of jesus john lennon and ava peron unexpectedly come for dinner out here what could possibly be so special above your clearance flowers just fetch it already fine what's the pass code again last year of world war ii if you have to look it up shame on you the meeting in the root cellar i'm judging from yates's choice of wine some type of celebration likely a gathering of heralds come to congratulate yates on his upcoming promotion diana's presence a calculated risk i'm fine santino it's just the grand paladin it is perfection irreplaceable you don't drink the 1945 grand paladin any more than you would write a shopping list on the mona lisa men like don yates know the price of everything but the value of nothing say what if we exchanged the labels served in a different way ah you are devious santino but no if mr yates wishes to destroy something beautiful i will not stand for his way that is between him and his creator how did he even get his hands on the ball i hear the last of the fighters for six hundred thousand dollars most expensive bottle ever sold ah yes a curious story see that bottle you refer to came from a case of 12 which were recovered from a sunken carlisle shipping container that went down in the south china sea during the final days of world war ii you know of those 12 only five were raised intact al gazali bought one under a great media coverage while the others simply disappeared quietly obtained by some clandestine private collector until one of the bottles was donated to mr yates by byron washington ceo of the pax mundus foundation as a reward for winning a court case now byron's twin daughters were treasure hunters so that explains how he managed to get first pick but you see i was here when the bottle arrived and the crate it arrived in for a curious logo something called the ark society intriguing do you know what it means well not a clue and now we will never know don't get attached santino for all fine things in life are transient hey flowers over here come on while we're young sir i present to you the 1945 grand paladin somehow i thought it'd be bigger come on flowers guests are waiting okay you are good to go so here's the deal flowers the boss is having a powwow with some employees and discretion is the name of the game i'm sure you figured that out already you being a scholar and all don't discuss disclose or hell even contemplate what goes down just set your mind to wool gathering mode you think you can do that for me flowers worry not mr cortazar i'm the very soul of discretion good man they're already at it go on place the wine on the table i'll pour it decant pardon me your majesty i have always considered there i have always considered the heralds the unspoken heroes of providence the nervous system effectively and reliably transmitting the decrees of the brain to the body and limbs of our great organization and i am delighted that so many of you were able to join me today despite your busy schedules and celebrate my retirement from the world of law and imminent instatement as the third constant of providence make no mistake i have two formidable sets of shoes to fill but i am a thirst to pick up the mantle looking good looking good flowers ah ladies and gentlemen mr flowers our resident sommelier i believe he has brought us something quite special perhaps you will educate us mr flowers this is the 1945 grand paladin one of only five bottles in existence the vintage is legendary the proverbial unicorn wine the year was hot the wines super concentrated and thanks to hail and frost the production was small only 300 bottles were ever produced and when the vineyard was bombed during the closing days of world war ii only a single crate survived it is said to have amazingly complex aromas with long savory layers of fruit and spice flavors and a silky texture enjoy wonderful thank you mr flowers feel free to stick around in case our guests have questions this wine was gifted to me by the ark society an acknowledgement of my firm's legal services it stands as a powerful reminder that providence draws its strength not from force but from partnership we are but a few and yet together we are unstoppable because we stand united my friends loyalty is everything which is why we cannot allow traitors into our ranks oh yes here it comes this woman has wasted bloody war on us more than a dozen heralds and operatives dead your colleagues and clients my friend ken morgan not to mention the partners themselves our founders our benefactors make no mistake this woman's hands are soaked in blood our blood and arthur edwards the new supreme head of providence is handing her the keys to the kingdom now does that seem right to you my friends does that sound like loyalty absolutely absolutely right perhaps edwards simply recognizes talent when he sees it perhaps this is why i am also in the running to become constant and following this childish outburst i dare say i am in the lead don you're lying of course which only proves my point you're gonna be trusted miss burnwood this woman will be our downfall that is unless we take matters into our own hands you are heralds sworn to protect providence against all threats including inside ones i have devised a plan together we can make it work but you have to decide now my friends are you with me yes yes i agree yes listen to yourselves don yate is not even appointed constant yet and already he conspires to betray his master i don't pretend to understand edward's every move but i do know that this man is an opportunist and unworthy of office then you are a traitor to the heralds the room is against you tamara stand down now or share her fate edwards will hear about this i think not i am sorry but you brought this on yourself mr cortez [Music] i scored miss burnwood to my office i'll join you shortly right move it let's go i'm warning you yates this will not go your way we need to get our story straight diana burnwood died today by the hand of her rogue agent 47. tamara vidal who saw through the assassin's disguise was alas killed as well this is what you will all attest to yes yes i agree yes a toast then in her honor send her the taste because you here's to loyalty yeah hey huh good i was beginning to worry were you no listen up 47. yates will be here shortly he'll have his thug courtesan do his dirty work but he won't pass up on the chance for a good gloat and a monologue so private space kill room decor exactly we won't get another shot at this now sit down and blend in when i provide a distraction you just be ready to move corvo pick up your damn phone plan b is a go i repeat eat plan b is a go start prepping a crime scene like we discussed remote staged accident oh and corvo make it for two just improvise miss burnwood you rolled out the red carpet just for me don you shouldn't have so confident even in defeat i suppose you're not used to danger always safe behind your screens just tell me one thing before we part ways why me why you why would edwards trust you please it will keep me awake at nights and i'm 65. i get up four times to piss as it is oh it's simple really edwards is proud he considers himself the cleverest man alive and yet we tricked him on isle of scale and it's eating him up he needs to win full unequivocal victory my recruitment was just the feather in his cap by the way you write about one thing yeah i'm all ears holy [ __ ] you gotta be kidding me turns out this woman will be your downfall he'll work huh what are you doing you [ __ ] come here weird noises i'll have a look around what the hell man your instincts were dead on i would be confident now and i will make it my mission to tear down providence brick by brick finish it such a good boy well done 47. better get rid of the body won't be long before they come looking when you're done meet me on the dance floor oh and dress appropriately 47 it's done now what now we strike at the heart and woods you know how to find him don't you why edwards finds you 47. he is untraceable and he never lets you forget it he is cocky and that will be his downfall what's the plan too many eyes meet me at the olive grove at sunset one last tango 47 how did you know your deal that kind of power always comes with a price what's yours i think you know i am sorry this is a necessary evil what have you done eat the brand's neurotoxin transfers by touch see edwards learns by his mistakes 47 and as you've clearly demonstrated brute force is futile it had to be me it was the only way to get this class my family know what you did after all these years i finally know i am sorry you didn't have a choice i did providence used you but i'm no better all i saw was a blank slate a weapon to wield i told myself it was what you needed but people aren't meant to be controlled this is a kindness goodbye agent still clinging on to your self-image agent 47 the apex predator always hiding behind the headlines was perfection its own justification or a willful distraction a wall built contract by contract to shield you from the uncomfortable truth you're exactly the tool they bred you to be quite a piece of work you are how could you possibly function on your own you never even had a name until i gave you one that's him burnwood never ceases to surprise me you really are a most singular individual and to think she wanted me to put you down lucky for you i never throw away anything useful prepare the serum forgetting's not so bad you've done it before what's he doing is he still looking at us i'm afraid so poor sap just won't accept his days are done perhaps i should take him out to the woods and set him free oh it's a classic it was a loyal tool but everything goes the way of the horse and cart eventually i couldn't agree more are you done the toxins are playing into your fears don't let them come on gotta get your head straight she wants me dead she has every right to after what we did but that's not what is really going on she chose power in the end she was just like them no she found a way to turn edward's own cleverness against him the rest is up to you i don't know how you do know diana coming once you dispose of edwards i will dismantle providence from the top down it will finally be over all you have to do is embrace the past sir we have produced a fresh sample of the serum yeah the exact specs from the lab in johannesburg a dosage is on its way to your car as requested well i recommend that the muscle paralyzing agent used to incapacitate the subject is out of his system before the serum is administered to avoid unwanted side effects yes sir i will inform you once the subject comes too we need to find a catchy name for it for when we go commercial i mean you figure this thing has commercial applications who'd want to have their minds wiped not wiped obviously but that's just fine tuning okay right now the serum erases long and short-term memory banks wholesale but in a couple of cycles we'll be able to isolate the effects to individual memories imagine if you could pluck out childhood traumas ugly breakups combat trauma you guys should be over the moon what are you talking about i love waking up in a cold sweat with a scream stuck in my throat so what would you call it then your catchy off-the-counter name i don't know blank slaterzine you are a piece of work lady come on jim was it it always starts like this gps microwaves duct tape this serum will eventually improve lives i've got to believe that tell that to the poor sob in the rear nah when i want to forget something i rely on my good old pal mr alcohol no offense the ether corporation bought this train for sample backups but since the bombing of their r d site in johannesburg they're refitting the cars as a mobile field lab huh so what did the russians use it for back in the day the way i hear it this used to be some kind of kgb black site mobile missile launch control center prison transport your guess is as good as mine but at one point it appears to have been the hq of janus the cold war spymaster apparently his crest was on the front car before ether painted everything over well that's the way it goes isn't it national past corporate future where are we supposed to be exactly ukraine it all looks the same through the blizzard nah somewhere in romania we're on a loop from zagreb to irkursk isn't that risky what about border inspections use a system of decommissioned rail lines and pay the local governments to look the other way it's been like that since the cold war in theory this thing only needs to stop for refueling a regular ghost train i guess that's one more box tick it's ridiculous if you ask me a whole train full of mercs to guard one guy you know who he is right sure sure everyone's very impressed i get it i get it and if you want some kind of elaborately planned calamity or a convenient heart attack sure he's your man but how does he manage in a brawl i'm willing to bet this guy doesn't hold a candle to any of us too much sneaking around and dressing up too little fighting right you feel like putting that theory to the test i just might sir sir everything under control orson here had one of his feelings everything's on the rails now move aside i have a message yeah with all due respect prisoners [Music] [Music] [Music] i don't suppose there's any point calling for help no seems i brought this on myself well played miss burnwood do you really think she'll be able to resist all that power this is not how people worked she rejects the power not the responsibility a noble idea but please join me in the real world i trust you already know what this is why not simply take it embrace who you are always meant to be no never again well i had to try go on then do your thing at least i die knowing who i am what are you doing no no this is what it means to lose everything you're making a mistake it's mine to make oh forgive me i seem to have uh what were we talking about don't worry we were done [Music] [Music] [Music] the string of resignations at the top level of international finance continues as milton fitzpatrick's ceo alexander fanon joins the president of hamzen oil [Music] it's been a long time agent 47 that's not who i am anymore the pact is done the past death [Music] and yet here you are i choose this path because i can there will always be people like them so there will always be people like us no one is untouchable it's good to be back [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
