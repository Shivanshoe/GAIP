tournament is more than a chance for personal glory we are fighting for the very survival of earth realm what are you talking about your last opponent was tarkattan he was born with those blades yeah those things are real he represents outworld had you lost the emperor shao khan would have come one step closer to physically absorbing our world into his outworld right right the elder gods created the mortal combat tournament to give earthrealm a chance to defend itself but if we lose this time xiao khan will conquer all [Music] look guys i'm an actor i save the world for the cameras if this

my future they lead me to believe that you are all connected to earthrealm's fate what have you foreseen in my visions shao khan becomes invincible he destroys all life in earth realm we will all die i believe these flashes are a guide to defeating shao khan but disrupting the flow of time can have serious consequences i'm not worried i bet you could win this thing no problem unless directly challenged i cannot participate what should we do besides standing around looking pretty for now the tournament must run its course all right then we're with you raiden combatants the next match will now begin who among you is worthy of this challenge where is the link way sub-zero he killed my family and clan i will have his head i know it is you kung lao the sheldon monks chose lou kane to represent your order in this tournament i am lukang's equal that remains to be seen watch and see i accept the challenge never mind the lin quay now you face a shaolin you will regret your impulsiveness [Music] flawless victory you are not yet a warrior kung lao listen when your elders speak you could not win this fight have defeated a challenger shane soon i demand sub-zero you will demand nothing night wolf your aggression is misplaced what do you know of mine you are not the only one whose people have been victimized but i have found new purpose in serving the spirits i do not cling to the past you no longer seek retribution you dishonor your kind the spirits have forsaken you shaman an impressive start you waste my time sorcerer restraint scorpion you will fight sub-zero soon enough scorpion i understand your desire for revenge but nightwolf is right there are other ways in which you may find peace sub-zero deserves death defeat sub-zero if you must but do not kill him i fear his death will give rise to a more treacherous foe i will have my revenge spare sub-zero's life and i will request that the elder gods return the sheri ryu to the realm of mortals i understand there are benefits to the grand master's plan but his plan goes against the inquiry principles we are lin quay cyrax we will obey the grand master's commands it means giving up our free will our souls it will turn us into scorpion your inferior clan is dead soon you will join them my clan may walk the earth once more a challenge scorpion versus cyrax and sector your obsession with sub-zero ends here scorpion wins i will have my revenge but i will not kill sub-zero will not or cannot you you this is where i was reborn this is where you will pay i have avenged my family and clan this is your retribution scorpion kill him i i will not he has been beaten have you forgotten what is this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] uh [Applause] your clan your family [Music] no that is not me ouch despite my efforts my vision has come to pass an unfortunate end he once defended earthrealm from the nether realm armies of shinnok and quanchi scorpion will pay for this sub-zero's fate is his own doing his own doing the lin quay have a history of making ruinous choices such as the cyber initiative i am among those speaking out against the grand master's plan surgically transformed the lin kuei into glorified robots it kills our intuition our instincts did you speak out against the lin kuai's participation in this tournament you were invited by shang tsung he pays you to kill earthrealm warriors betraying your own realm i expect better even from an assassin my loyalty is to the grand master victory for shang tsung means the end of earth realm and the linquay what are you doing i am not here to fight you i'm assigned to kill johnny cage shang tsung no longer has me of you what do you mean he is terminating your agreement and you cyrax wins i need to have a talk with your master uh this fight is not over you mean to finish me you couldn't even stop theater now this fight is over shang tsung has turned on me i need to find out why sector we need to talk our hosts tried to have me killed you were speaking with the thunder god your indiscretion has jeopardized my plan cyrax is lin kuei he will complete his task we shall see the next match will be cyrax versus johnny cage what me all right then not everyone gets to rumble with a celebrity ready for your beat down sunshine here it comes cyrax wins that should shut you up i won't kill him oh you were commanded to kill johnny cage you disobeyed i eliminated him from the tournament he didn't need to die you have broken your oath i used my judgment the cyber initiative will eliminate insubordination we are not machine sector i chose to serve the lin kuei but i will not surrender my free will tell the grand master i am finished no one leaves combatants i present this latest creation of shao khan she is many warriors their souls fused into one being behold ermack be wary liu kang he is unlike anything you have fought before lukang you are the sole earth realm warrior to progress to this final stage of the tournament i am ready you are one we will destroy you earth realm will not fall into your master's hands he is a greater threat than anticipated i will ensure he does not reach the final challenge remember raicho's teachings for my vision to be realized you must not let emotion overpower you your visions what causes them my future self sent them to me perhaps to ensure some outcome or to prevent one he must win he must win those are my last words before i die i believe it is you who must win this amulet was forged by the elder gods it cracked here in the present after my first vision if we choose wisely the future will be secured and the cracks healed i trust you will make the right decisions we must trust in the elder gods liu kang huh you're good show me more do not underestimate me shaolin i am impressed do it do what kill me why would i do that i came to kill you i have failed my father my emperor shao khan is your father i have disgraced him you must kill me i will not this encounter never took place you have disgraced no one i hope we meet again under different circumstances combatants only one earthrealm warrior remains the shaolin is he ready to bear such a heavy burden earthrealm's fate is in his hands your opponent will be scorpion i do not fear you demon fighting with scorpion the sorcerer quantity [Applause] as i said i do not fear you i pity you you have done well but the tournament is not yet over goro what's a goro kang it has been years since an earth realm warrior has progressed this far but the reigning champion is far beyond your ability to the lair with you uh i did not expect to fight in this tournament but eventually even the shaolin produce a warrior worthy of the shogun i know who you are i am ready for you i will give you a warrior wins it seems the shaolin trained a warrior greater than a show khan [Music] only one fight remains face me and mortal kombat so be it wins say it i concede well done my friend he has saved earthrealm [Music] congratulations [Music] [Music] you failed me 500 years i have waited now i must wait 500 more my lord all is not lost curse the elder gods in their tournament i should have taken earthrealm by force but i am bound by their rules rules that cannot be broken my lord kill him but what if the rules were changed katana continue [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] i do not understand why my amulet is further damaged he must win if not luke kang then who you got me not sure anybody could have done what he did made shang look like a chump here to congratulate us on our victory sorcerer what shang sung you have been revitalized i see i didn't realize your master was in the habit of rewarding failure the emperor has an offer raiden a new tournament i see no reason to participate in any plan of yours the emperor proposes a single tournament to replace the current system of ten it will be held in outworld if earthrealm does not win outworld will absorb it but if earthrealm wins xiao khan will abandon his claim to it forever give your emperor my regards i now realize what we must do [Music] anybody get the number that wait where's sonia shang tsung has taken her we've got to find her we must follow them changsong has made it clear that earthrealm will be under constant threat unless i agree to a new tournament another vision yes i saw luke kang win the proposed tournament i believe we must attend but my earlier vision of your victory over shang tsung was not the solution i sought therefore this premonition must show an event i need to change perhaps he must win refers to another hear me elder gods i accept the terms proposed by shao khan [Music] we go to outworld i assume that's the big man himself the wrestler guy with the cow skull on his head and why aren't the kung fu twins here helping us i sent luke kang and kung lao to free their shell and masters i expected sonya blade to be here with shang tsung she better not have a scratch on her wait this is a tournament ah the earth realm delegation has arrived and we have a volunteer for first combat what the tournament will begin jackson briggs you will face barakah damn you my blades will find your heart wins you shouldn't be running with those where's sonia tell me major briggs do you and she do anything other than rescue one another your next opponent will be what is it excellent it seems i have a pressing matter to attend to with the emperor's permission we will reconvene later what was that all about i think we should follow [Music] you okay sonia blade she is to be executed my powers are compromised here in outworld but i will be able to transport us near enough to here maybe you could try for even nearer next time where are we i will inform you the instant i know i wish this damn tracking device worked in here this is just like my movie time smashers we were going around give it a rest will ya making my ears hurt so what's the deal with you and sonya anyway she's smoking hot it's not like that i'm her ceo honey like that under my command oh you'll want to stop talking now but if it's not like that then you won't mind if i that's it time somebody shut you to hell up how you like that mr a liz enough jackson briggs you will restrain yourself yeah well ah someone approaches good maybe somebody else needs their ass whooped looking for something the armory is restricted you will leave now gonna have to ask nicer than that wrong place wrong time lady feel better um listen cage don't worry about it guess we know where we are now thanks to her yes and where we must go let's do it uh [Music] what is it with your show con and underground cesspools if you had not dishonored yourself by attempting escape we would not be here in the sewer sonia guards stop them so much for the surprise attack she is the emperor's property human she's nobody's property jax wins i guess extra arms don't make a difference you sure have a way with women you know me i'm a class act thanks what took you so long he was busy hitting me in the face that's weird i've got two sets of readings heavy tech signals both of them technology then they cannot be of outworld we need to confront the source of each signal we might discover the one whose victory i must ensure wait what about us what are we chop liver what perhaps you are right johnny cage you will stay close to me great i close as a shadow and twice as silent sonia you're with me keeping my eye on you rayden looks like you want to teleport yourself about 30 clicks that way we should stay together tundra assuming your brother's identity will certainly draw attention not all of it welcome you are right smoke but assuming bihan's identity is the best way to honor him let us proceed then sub-zero we should separate our fellow lin quay will not be far behind once our absence is discovered if only they had been more forthcoming with the details of your brother's demise we will find shang he will tell us all he knows if he killed bihan he will die be stealthful as the night and deadly as the dawn the emperor was wise to send me here the lin kuei do walk uninvited in his realm wise though your emperor might be he was foolish to send his housemate to interfere with lin quay business i am katana princess of outworld and i deal harshly with sharp tongued intruders [Music] sleep well princess with a whole army toting these no one in outworld or earth realm could stand up to you well done you may tell your fellow black dragon that i am very interested in your merchandise shang tsung i'll take care of him no charge one dead len quay in a tick stay down i would have words with your associate tell me what you know of sub-zero's death what despite his failure at my tournament a wager he was more powerful than you lin quay assuming his form will not give you his skill shape-shifter let us see if smoke can freeze now answer me what do you know of sub-zero what smoke you actually did it you're a cyborg i will never submit [Music] there is great energy nearby um ray dude they must not take him thank you lord raiden i am called smoke why are you here in outward to participate in a tournament to save earthrealm join us smoke forgive me but if sector was searching for me he is hunting sub-zero as well sub-zero call me crazy with a k but didn't we see him die the grand master intends to turn every lin kuei into a cyborg my friend is in danger the tournament i have a feeling your friend will be there then let us go sub-zero soul depends on it a pity you could not have cooperated you are ordered to return to the linguay temple for assimilation cyrex i am lin kuei unit lk 4d4 you will come with me i'm sorry for what they did to you but i will not comply i will face the link way when my task is done not before the readings were getting stronger and now they're gone i sub-zero but you're dead i am not the sub-zero you speak of he was my brother your brother i'm only here to learn sub-zero's fate he was killed by someone named scorpion where would i find him try the coliseum that's where you have disturbed our regeneration process gotcha [Music] stay with me jax we will break you as well not if i break you first round one fight uh i remain whole for now sonia blade to command sonya blade to command do you read sonia blade to command do you read you have stopped the bleeding yeah but he needs a medic as soon as possible i must go to the coliseum but i need your help to get a portal to the south you can use it to transport yourselves back to earth realm that portal better be close [Applause] ah i deserve death i have failed my father you must kill me kill him katana you will join me i challenge scorpion the murderer of my brother you will bring him before me no one makes demands of the emperor [Applause] reptile but that is not my purpose here your followers hold you in high esteem warlord they fight and die for your amusement my brother participated in this folly i do so only to face his killer and you shall what is this you are not sub-zero i am his family and clan i fight for his honor he had no honor and you will die as he did for my brother who now interrupts the emperor's tournament sub-zero no you cannot save him stay here they will take you as well and what do i gain from granting this bold request the linquay's royalty and service very well he is yours the flow of time has been changed i spared smoke this fate only to watch this new sub-zero fall no i will not be turned [Music] katana how is it that earth realm ninjas brazenly appear before me when my daughter princess of outworld was sent to intercept if it can be uprooted altogether sure let's go ruin someone else's life is this how you show your loyalty jade katana you follow me when i clearly wish to be alone then you upgrade me i will not be scolded like some child you need to be careful i have never seen your father this angry with you you are a princess he expects more from you than i know what he expects we will talk later when you are in more of a mind to listen princess katana i request a naughty earth roamers you dare approach me hey listen honey we don't want to fight but we will if we must you will learn respect katana wins shao khan wants death to follow combat i will give it to him perhaps lou kang was wrong about you or perhaps he sensed as i do that there is conflict within you thanks ow you couldn't have seen that in one of your hot flashes something whispers to you that circumstances should be different that you should be different you are much more like sindel than shaoka but she is dead my mother is dead yes why do you need answers katana i can help you find them if you will trust in me go to shang tsung's flesh bits much will be revealed there the flesh pits but i am forbidden to yes you are and why is that i don't know tell me you must discover your true path alone show yourself jade i know you're following me again following you still i know where you're going i am ordered to prevent you from going there and why is that i do not question the emperor's commands katana please turn back i cannot this path might lead me to the truth i'm sorry jade but i will not allow you to stop me i tried to warn you this is something i have to do what in the name of she looks like me sister pretty so fair come let us be a family you are not my family you are a monstrosity farewell sister that is no way to treat your sibling despicable swine do you think my father will stand for this these abominations you have created here i am merely perfecting you princess as difficult as that might be silence i will drag you before shao khan by your pointed beard wins get up you will stand before my father and confess your deeds i would not disturb you father if this matter were not of utmost importance i felt you should know what shang tsung has been doing as of late this conjurer has created hard replicas of me crossbred with her cotton blood one was alive and attacked me well done sorcerer you know you approve how could you my own father i am your emperor your father was a weakling a dingy king i annihilated him while merging his realm without world and took his queen as my wife if only i had not allowed sindel to convince me of your worth but now i have a true daughter raiden was right you have lied to me my entire life escort her to the tower i will make an example return to the flesh pits bring me my daughter i failed you katana now i will make amends that is all of them that is no toy it belongs to shang tsung we are finished return to your post stand aside i will see katana no one enters the tower you are an excellent guard dog baraka but you must learn to heal i do not take orders from you jade wins good boy adenians have no loyalty blind loyalty is not a good thing as i have learned you must keep your eyes open to anticipate the finishing blow what you make it too easy my orders are clear no one is allowed in the tower as you can see i am here here to help the princess escape you would deny her execution the only means of regaining her honor we have very different concepts of honor show khan wins not much of a jailer are you now then your highness let us see how quickly we can remove these bonds jade i i am too go find raiden ask for his help that should distance me from any pursuers others pursue i have fun by the gods you are melina you must return with me there's to be a celebration for my sister she's going away [Music] i am more of a sister to katana than you i must find raiden he is here kitana turns away from shao khan so you attack her rather than join her this is not cheap stop that is not katana you will come no closer i did not wish to do that lord raiden i come at the request lord i was with smoke i thought she was a bad guy uh girl guess he turned another one what's raiden got that i haven't got godlike power a personality that is not at all like sanding paper jerks katana does not have much time katana executed where is she held captive in the tower of shao khan's fortress i will not pleased with this outcome either liu kang but there is no time we must return to the tournament but you are responsible for her capture you persuaded her to turn against shao khan lord raiden we can free her as others fight in our stead and join you thereafter very well we will meet you at the coliseum i hope your girlfriend is with lord raiden's anger bouquet notice that i am ignoring you they must have relocated katana we have indeed we knew someone would come for her [Music] may you join her in death be thankful i choose not to spill your tainted blood who are you there is something familiar you need help four arms against two is hardly a fair fight you have had your match against liu kang now you will face me now if you have any honor left you will tell us where katana is she has been taken to the coliseum where she has no been doubt she may yet live let us go [Applause] there's katana i must free her not now smoke and johnny cage have been defeated and i no longer sense jackson briggs or sonya blade's presence and outworld despite my doubts as to whether you are earth realm savior you must fight but i am not he who must win read it put forth a worthy champion if you can perhaps you are meant to be the victor ah no earth realm boy can stop this deadly alliance on that we agree it is done no come now not nearly so [Applause] i will eat your hearts [Applause] you see raiden earthwell is free [Music] [Applause] from your phone do you know who i am the murderer of my friend [Music] you will taste your own blood on your feet [Music] for kung lao the shaolin and earthrealm [Music] i cannot believe realm as one the elder gods have spoken earthrealm is free of shall khan forever [Music] but the price of victory was almost too steep to pay kung lao's death is my fault i encouraged him our triumph was not meant to be achieved in this way i see now he must win refers to you but to prevent armageddon you needed to defeat shao khan not shang tsum it cannot be shao khan is dead yet the future remains unchanged shao khan is finished melina is there she should rule melina she exists only because of my sorcery and you breathe because i restrain my emperor you live i am not so easily killed quan chi accelerated my recovery emperor i'm not one word because of you outworld can no longer merge with earthrealm there may yet be an alternative emperor invasion invasion do you mock me sindel's ward prevents me from setting foot in earth realm have you considered why your wife and empress chose to betray you in this particular fashion of course but even after millennia her motives are a mystery she realized that the safeguards afforded by the elder gods through mortal combat are but fiction she sacrificed herself to give protection the elder gods could not so earthrealm could not suffer as had adenia indeed i have mastered the spells necessary for her resurrection her ward will be nullified and with it the barrier that prevents your entry into earth realm i will return her to you of course you will find her much more cooperative this is a very magnanimous offer i wish only to serve emperor i am weary of sorcerers [Applause] quan chi xiao khan looks forward to your return the emperor yes what of kitana kitana now allies herself with earth realm then she is no longer my daughter take me to shao khan yes empress the invasion of the earth realm can now [Music] begin

with your ancestors now sindel face the spirit's judgment raiden braden where are you [Music] elder gods i beseech you earth realm is in danger we are aware of your plight then you must intervene on earth realm's behalf we cannot but shao khan liu kang has bested him twice yet he still has not violated the rules of mortal kombat what he invades earth realm as we speak invasion is not itself a transgression it is the merger of realms that distinction without a difference innocents are dying at the hands of outworld it is regrettable but the mortal kombat tournaments are not intended to prevent certain outcomes they are intended only to maintain balance among the realms the please doors are closing we are nearly trapped ah victory is mine shaman why the elder gods you were right i wish we had met under different circumstances katana they are dead we abandoned them and they're dead my heart too is heavy with their sacrifice their deaths achieved nothing what is next raiden tell me the future how do we honor their sacrifice i climb to heaven now i must plunge into the depths i will go to quanchi ally our realm with his against the forces of outward what graufel before quan chi what will he demand what price will be paid would any price be too high to save earth realm i had prayed it not true but you have gone mad raiden your visions they are nothing delusions of an adult mind luke please enough i must help the wounded leave on your hopeless quest may the elder gods protect you [Music] it disappoints me to see you here save your pity i will have an audience with quan qi you may address me i will inform him is this why you chose not to save your family and clan to maintain your place at his feet do not talk with my family raiden fetch your master scorpion i

poorly raiden earth realm's defenses are overwhelmed you have mere hours name your terms what do you offer i offer i offer the souls of earthrealm warriors who die in this conflict [Laughter] [Applause] they would agree you are cavalier with other men's souls not just others i offer my own soul as well if i die you will have it how noble raiden yet utterly pointless no you see their souls are already mine shall khan's payment for netherrealm's allegiance no this was not meant to be earth realm has lost raiden now so shall you finish as you command my master may the elder gods watch over you the elder gods cannot help them their souls are mine kitana night wolf kung lao you sealed our fate in this place thunder god you have condemned us all victory is nearly complete soon he will arrive in earth realm no the elder gods cannot allow it the elder gods are toothless your world is near destruction yet they do not act they must only through mortal combat may shall khan merge the realms lest he face the judgment of the elder gods lest he face the judgment of the elder gods he must win it is you who faced judgment raiden thank you quan chi i now know what must be done [Music] back from the nether realm empty-handed i see lukang liu kang i now realize what we must do we must allow shao khan to merge the realms that is insane the elder gods forbid it without victory in mortal combat what he does the elder god's fury will fall upon him defeating shao khan before the merge is but temporary he will return bringing armageddon i have foreseen it enough raiden he is here no do as i say have faith in the elder gods have faith in me liu kang i cannot let you fight shao khan then you are my enemy do not interfere no enough of your madness if you must die so be it by the gods no no this was not meant to happen what did you do liu kang forgive me you have killed us come on it's up to us ah raiden you have come to your senses earthrealm citizens suffer further resistance serves no purpose all these ages you have fought me you denied me my rightful claim not this time the elements fear me now their pathetic mortal combat shackles me no longer huh they masquerade as dragons but are mere toothless worms i know you can feel it it is the end of all things elder gods where are you why do you forsake me your time has passed ages wasted in foolish resistance i have won yes you have won now raiden your world ends [Music] our penalty is clear an anemic effort from ineffectual deities today i become the elder god round one fight [Applause] uh round two fight alright uh it's official raids [Music] uh um [Music] [Music] oh it is over but only at the gravest of costs [Music] so many are gone their light has sunk into the earth i am responsible for their loss you did what you had to to protect earth realm losses in war are are inevitable come let us tend the fallen then we must help our realm rebuild our work has only just begun [Music] blinded by rage how easily he was convinced that the elder gods would ignore his merging the realms yet the thunder god still lives no matter neither earth realm nor outworld can now withstand the nether realms onslaught it is time soon i will be free earth realm and outwards was dead the god of war had prevailed the spell that had summoned him began to reverse itself as he slowly faded from this place and time kratos was approached by raiden and fujin though he did not count them among his enemies kratos had never been beloved by these guards he prepared for combat to his surprise they bowed to him a show of respect he had not seen from an immortal in many an age raiden explained that though his motives were not pure kratos had saved earthrealm he was owed a debt of gratitude as he returned to his own world kratos nodded silently their change of heart would perhaps prove useful one day a debt of gratitude is often dearly paid guided by sinto his ancestral sword ken she destroyed shao khan and saved earth realm from armageddon but he had not yet exacted revenge on shang tsung the elusive sorcerer had hidden himself somewhere in outworld jax allowed kenshi access to a newly developed portal that permitted travel among realms in return kenshi agreed to serve the fledgling outer world investigation agency after countless missions he finally located shang tsung with a roar kenshi plunged sinto through shang tsung's chest the magical sword drew the souls of kenshi's ancestors into itself leaving shang tsung a withered husk his vendetta fulfilled kenshi left shang tsung to die alone and powerless [Music] shao khan had used rain to crush the edenian resistance but had not granted him an army for this betrayal rain drowned the emperor in his own blood a grateful raiden thanked rain for eliminating the emperor and saving earth realm his heroics were befitting of a son of argus reigns lost heritage was a revelation to him that he was a direct descendant of an edenian god proved his superiority power was his by right his divinity confirmed reigns path was clear he would use shao khan's army to rule not just outworld but all the realms read in surprise and horror reigns first target is earth shokhan and centaur alike were enraged that baraka shao khan's trusted enforcer had turned on their master and killed him just as earthrealm was within their grasp but their anger turned to admiration as the lifeless body of shao khan transformed into that of the treacherous sorcerer shang tsung shang had attempted to claim the realm for himself by posing as xiao khan the deception had not fooled baraka he had recognized shang tsung sent and torn out his throat with earth realm finally in shao khan's control morocco's loyalty and bold action were rewarded the tar cottons replaced the centaur as the emperor's favored race though he had pledged his life to the lin kuei cyrax left the clan to help the earth realm heroes turn back xiao khan's invasion for this act of desertion he was marked for termination by the new grand master sector surrounded and severely outnumbered cyrax prepared to meet his fate when raiden came to his aid with him were 100 shaolin monks the lin kuei were defeated though sektor was not counted among the dead cyrax was offered sanctuary at the wuxi academy where he has begun a new life as an honorable warrior for peace with shao khan dead ermac was no longer bound to him anarchy erupted within her mac as the many warrior souls that comprised his beings struggled for dominance only one had the strength of will to quiet the chaos the conflict resolved irmak returned to outworld determined to reunite with his past queen sindel and princess katana were shocked to learn the truth the trapped among the many spirits within irmak was their husband and father king jared though he would never be the jared they once knew ermack would forever serve and protect his queen and the adenian people shao khan was defeated but the intense battle rendered jade unconscious she slipped into a dreamlike state and found herself walking in an unknown realm as she explored her surroundings shifted and changed jade approached a lone figure who stood in the distance a shimmering woman she did not reveal her name but spoke with an air of regal authority through the minds of countless mortals the woman had been watching events as they unfolded over the centuries she informed jade that shao khan's death was an outcome that must be reimagined jade was defenseless as the woman possessed her body and emerged in the waking world [Music] after the invasion was thwarted many of jax's allies had seemingly disappeared leaving him to clean up the mess on his own he searched for shao khan's remaining forces utilizing a new cyber scanner designed to remotely access worldwide databases navigating its virtual reality interface jax inadvertently accessed kano's brain through his optical laser implant their minds linked jack's virtually battled kano finally he captured and quarantined kano's consciousness within the special forces mainframe a dangerous criminal had finally been neutralized as the last remnants of shao khan disintegrated johnny felt strange as if he had lost control of his body suddenly powerful energy burst forth destroying everything around him johnny sought the aid of raiden and nightwolf but their efforts did nothing to stop these random spasms of destruction desperate raiden transported johnny to sato the realm of order where he could be taught to control his power johnny cage will transform into a warrior powerful beyond mortal imagining [Music] victory over shao khan came with a heavy price cabal's respirator was badly damaged and if it was not repaired soon he would surely die desperate he tracked down kano and forced from him the identity of the cyberneticist who developed kano's eye laser the good doctor was not easy to find but he was more than eager to help for a price now cabal is rebuilt he is better than he was before stronger faster he will need to be in order to repay his debt kano made a fortune selling arms to xiao khan and used the prophets to upgrade his cybernetics the added connectivity of his eye implant gave him unparalleled access to global communications using his mind he navigated the databases of banks law enforcement agencies and other networks but his activities left him vulnerable to hackers jax infiltrated kano's mind and trapped his consciousness in the special forces mainframe it wasn't long however until kano managed to free himself his consciousness spread like a virus throughout the special forces network of automated weaponry kano has become a one-man army [Music] kitana had ended shao khan's life for his betrayal she had discovered the truth about molina but rather than slay her as well she took pity on her half-sister she offered molina a home within the idenian aristocracy she was after all of royal blood molina cautiously accepted her sister's invitation with molina and jade at her side kitana formed a fighting force dedicated to bringing justice to the realms never again would a warlord arise to create such terror kung lao had avenged his ancestors death and saved earth realm from shao khan's brutality in quiet reflection with raiden at the grave of the great kung lao he touched the modest stone marker images of past events moments of someone else's life flashed through his mind concluding with a lost battle against goro raiden theorized that kung lao had unlocked memories of his past life the kung lao that stood before raiden was in fact the reincarnation of the great kung lao who had been defeated by goro 500 years ago he had accomplished in the present what he could not in the past [Music] having defeated shao khan believed he was the only one capable of defending earth realm against outside threats during the invasion raiden had been more burdened than ally brazenly he demanded the elder gods grant him the thunder god status in a one-match mortal combat tournament lou kang defeated his former friend and mentor lukang's request was granted he was made a god the new protector of earthrealm molina killed the emperor in a fit of deranged fury but she was unaware that her victory resulted from shang tsung's designs he had imbued molina with the ability to drain shao khan's dark magic rendering him vulnerable now shang tsung was ready to execute the next phase of his plan murder molina and take shao khan's power for himself but molina instinctively wielded her new dark power against the sorcerer shang tsung's end came quickly melina absorbed his soul multiplying her strength she then set out to claim an even bigger prize the soul of a thunder god [Music] it took all of night wolf's power to destroy shao khan his spirit guide the wolf had aided him in the battle but in the aftermath its presence was no longer felt night wolf returned to his home seeking the elders help and reconnecting to the spirit world during their ritual his wolf returned to him changed shao khan had tethered his soul to the wolf spirit in order to cheat death now corrupted with shao khan's evil night wolf has transformed into his animality his bite converting his victims into subservient lycanthropes through nightwolf xiao khan will conquer earth realm one mortal at a time [Music] controlled by quan chi's sorcery scarlett attacked and destroyed xiao khan as quan chi's magic subsided she realized her unwitting role in his plot to bring ruin to outworld with shao khan's blood splattered across her body scarlet absorbed his immense strength she used this newfound power against guangxi brotherhood of shadow warriors raced to defend the sorcerer but their blood only served to make scarlet invincible in a battle between sorcery and gore-fueled fighting power she avenged her fallen master having served her purpose scarlett disappeared into the shadows awaiting shao kahn's rebirth [Music] having finally brought about shah khan's demise quan chi was then tasked with growing the ranks of the brotherhood of shadow many warriors had perished in outworld's invasion of earthrealm quan chi stole their souls and remade them to serve his master the fallen elder god task completed shinnok repaid quan chi's service by ordering his execution thereby eliminating a possible challenger to his rule quan chi had anticipated this act of treachery however and resurrected shao khan the ultimate phantom warrior with xiao khan as his enforcer quan chi struck down the brotherhood of shadow and chinook quan chi forgives betrayal from no one not even a god [Music] so [Music] so [Music] after the victory over shao khan sub-zero learned from raiden the truth that the lin kuei were ultimately responsible for the deaths of both sub-zeros and scorpions families enraged sub-zero offered scorpion a chance to share in his quest for vengeance with the might of fire and ice combined they were a storm of vengeful fury as they cut down their foes once justice had been done sub-zero and scorpion disappeared into legend emerging from obscurity only to avenge the innocent the forces of darkness will never stop this deadly alliance despite telling the world that he was simply doing his job stryker was made a hero for saving earth from invasion he received both the key to the city and the congressional medal of freedom press and paparazzi hounded his every move his biography spent a year on the best seller lists striker action figures flew off the shelves and into every young boy's hand but when approached by hollywood for the rights to his story stryker put his foot down never would he allow himself to be portrayed by johnny cage the loss of friends and allies during the battle with shao khan took its toll on sonia blade's sanity she left the special forces and went into seclusion to cope with her grief but her solitude was brief as she found herself regularly visited by an apparition who claimed to be her missing father with her father as a guide sonia embarked on a mission to exterminate what remained of shao khan's army shall khan's violent death shook the very core of smoke's being and dislodged his earliest memories tomas rabada was only a boy when he was abducted by an obscure cult and sacrificed to a demon burned alive he returned to the mortal realm as an anendra a creature of smoke and vapor his captors were helpless against his shapeless form as he lashed out with rage killing them all his murder revenged he returned to his human form remembering nothing of his former life now aware of his true identity smoke understands he is no mere assassin his destiny has been revealed the spell that bewitched queen cindell had been broken she did battle with shao khan and slew him punishment for the suffering he brought upon her and millions of others throughout the realms she dissolved the sorcery that bound edenia with outworld and began restoring her realm to its formal glory the many races of outworld were impressed not only had sindel defeated shao khan but she had shown great leadership in chaotic times they willingly offered her their allegiance under sindel's governance the realms of edenia and outworld remain merged in spirit [Music] shiva had recognized the signs her people were out of favor and in decline the centaur would soon dominate xiao khan's forces while the shokhan would move inexorably toward extinction shiva's act of defiance her murder of shao khang made possible a new home for her people among the mortals of earth realm a world free of both tarkatan and centaur with cooperation from world leaders shiva secured for the shokhan the continent of australia in return they would protect earth realm from future invasions for her leadership shiva was exalted the most honorable shokan in their proud history [Music] shang soon voraciously consumed shao khan's soul absorbing his immense power overwhelmed by his newfound sorcery he fled to outworld moments before suicide shangsung was visited by boricho the mentor of warriors offered to teach him to control the dark magic but for a special purpose lu kang had become a god the power had corrupted him transforming him into a tyrant he needed to be stopped after rigorous training shang tsung mastered the one technique that could finish lu kang vengeance would finally be his [Music] sector had dedicated his life to the ling quay his victories had brought honor to his father the grand master he had proven himself worthy it was time to replace his father in a bold attack sector smashed through a company of lin quay guards as he pushed toward the grand master's chamber there he found his father waiting the grandmaster warned him that wearing the dragon medallion brought much power but at a cost sector ignored the warning and slew his father whose soul burst from his body and flew into the medallion sector had finally seized control of the lin quay [Music] xiao khan's death did nothing to relieve scorpion's pain the loss of his kin still weighed heavily upon him for reasons he could neither explain nor understand he was drawn to the home of the shiraira you standing amid the rubble in solemn contemplation scorpion was visited by apparitions of his fallen comrades who revealed the true mastermind behind their brutal deaths enraged he returned to the nether realm as the spirits of his kin immobilized quan chi scorpions slew him finally avenging their deaths having defeated shao khan reptile was feared by all he forced shang tsung to regenerate his raptor race the process took agonizing months but soon reptile heard the snarls of young broodlings throughout the flesh pits eventually shang tsung had created an army of raptor warriors bred to serve reptile they stormed the realm killing any tarkatan shokhan or centaur who opposed reptiles rule the intoxicating feeling of reuniting with his people blinded reptile to the suffering of his former comrades reptile was home once more shao khan was gone but the scars of the merging of realms remained remnants of the invasion force roamed freely and had to be dealt with but earthrealm is vast and raiden is but one being he recruited four warriors one for each direction of the wind and divided his soul placing one part in each of them through these new heroes raiden can combat the forces of darkness in four places at once quan chi should never have resurrected noob saibot nor should he have enhanced his power to defeat xiao khan the revenant he created had broken free of his control noob had secretly formed an understanding with a cleric from the realm of chaos and opened for him a portal to the nether realm shinnok quan chi and the brotherhood of shadow were unprepared as the forces of chaos overwhelmed them leaving the underworld severely weakened satisfied with his work the cleric havoc returned to the realm of chaos noob cybot remained to seize control of the nether realm [Music] you
