millions of years ago shinnok one of the elder gods turned on his fellow deities and invaded the earth realm raiden and the elder god stopped shinnok locked him up in the nether realm [Music] others followed in chinook's footsteps like outworld's emperor shao khan who was obsessed with conquering earth realm so raiden convinced the elder gods to enact the mortal combat tournament as a way to even the odds give earth realm a chance for generations xiao khan followed the elder gods rules the war moved to the arena where he sent his toughest fighters to challenge raiden's greatest defenders in mortal kombat two years ago we beat him but xiao khan wasn't ready to lose he violated the rules of mortal combat and invaded earthrealm most of earth's defenders are friends were killed turned into evil undead warriors despite the odds who stopped shao khan's invasion as punishment the elder gods destroyed him we thought the long nightmare was over but it turns out that shinnok had been manipulating events shao khan's invasion is death all part of shinnok's plan to escape the nether realm and resume his war on the elder gods oh [Applause] uh destination set her down nice and easy for

he'd be pleased with our progress he was smart enough to have mr cage put this team together i'm glad the shira ryu chose me to join new places new faces as the secretary pointed out us older folks are going to retire someday so it's time for your generation to step up shaolin shirai ryu sf together for your team's first mission you're going to the linguai temple we haven't heard from the grand master in a while so we need to make sure he's still on our side that he's got our backs if things flare up again without world you need to bring him in but don't be surprised if sub-zero's not willing to cooperate why are we worried about outworld i thought kotal khan respected the reiko accords he does but he's facing a civil war the rebels win those accords will be history [Music] 20 million emperor what's the expression it's not worth the dirt on my shoe kota khan has always bargained with fairy tale sure i'm just saying upgraded weapons my intel and poof the long out world civil war done might be nice to kick back a bit eh you know molina's location and a whole rebel army it's gotta be worth at least 50. i must attack her immediately end this conflict as you say it drains us right do we have a deal what is it devorah the emperor should not be concerned accident ahead this one will clear it make way for coastal car move [Music] the tarkattans are in position we await your order it is given dearest tanya stopping a carriage is nothing killing an emperor false emperor requires power power you have molina and won't use [Music] it pains me to use it rain i need more time

[Music] [Music] to take you out hmm [Music] you're not worth the dirt on my shoe i'm pleased you remember me koat i will never forget those who freed molina she vowed to create a free edinia something you refused to do a united out world stands strong against its enemies it will never be united under your rule your rebellion is all that prevents it oh my sacrifice honors me [Music] you are a fool to trust molina kano was to kill you miserable snake bro not day [Music] another edemian the supposed half guard here i am a son of argus i was not merely declared by befuddled commoners bullock surely molina suspects your true intentions son of argus [Applause] my intentions are to teach you the difference between pretension and godhood sacrifice hmm [Music] that should silence you you won't touch him again but i will as the heir to my father shall khan i molina condom of outworld order your execution wow death [Music] duplicate pretender failure there will be an execution this day you will atone for your descent molina your blood will make right up the stair path through the fire's edge [Music] oh what did my emperor see a mere cub grown to be a jaguar once we hit the drop point we split up jackie and i will come in from the south you two from the west rendezvous here the north entrance then what a simple pickup and go we bag him if he resists resistance might be more possible than you think don't sweat it it comes to that subzero won't know what hit him the forward defenses stand down as you command grandmaster it is confirmed for intruders it is time to entertain our guests all right i've got point you and jin that side move ready [Music] you are not welcome here state your intentions grand master we need you to come with us my name is sergeant you demand my cooperation yet you are cut off surrounded what will you do my father always spoke highly of you sub-zero he wants to talk talking always his first choice okay let's try pummeling now [Music] wait cassandra cage you lead this group they do not follow what would your mother do stop wasting time and take you down [Music] god [Music] uh got a thing for punishment cage you are more like your mother

were friends our history share a dark chapter [Music] you shared ugh [Music] do not judge yourself harshly specialist briggs you should rally your companions rather than mock your superiors i'll remember that in case i ever meet one uh [ __ ] it off [Music] uh uh false bravado does not suit you any ideas sub-zero let's talk that opportunity has passed got a new plan cage you could have followed the old one jyn you're gonna catch hell if you kill us yes i suppose so sure [Music] that worked this was all a a training exercise damn i should have seen it you and your friend show much promise cassandra cage but until you function as one you will fall short so other than that you enjoyed your visit the lincoln shredded us you maybe i see plenty of frozen boot prints on your ass too come on now you're all winners in my book new orders from general blade priority one outworlders here in earth realm an invasion couldn't be you're not afraid are you mr cage outworlders i can handle so when did they show up the portal opened by the docks a few hours ago nearly 5 000 in all refugees from the outworld civil war it must be bad if they risked coming to earth realm after you do not dwell on your encounter thanks kenji could you and mr cage join us sergeant cage you and your team as you were this is lee may she seeks asylum for her people in earth realm our village sundo was the epicenter of a fierce battle we barely escaped with our lives such is war i mean no offense but you outworlders kind of live for that right this was different the rebels melina had a weapon unlike anything entire battalions erased it was not honorable not combat tell me more about the weapon a talisman gold with a center jewel molina wields its crimson energy without precision well that's good then not now sergeant cage it is enough that she possesses it it turns the tide in her favor the emperor grows desperate and those caught in the middle pay the price if this talisman is what i suspect it to be we may all pay a price we talking about shinnok's amulet can't be the base the vault your warnings sf shaolin no way anyone can get past all that i must be certain well this is cozy you remind me of an earth realmer who crossed over with us he also found humor in everything handsome guy right he was an earth roamer one of his eyes glowed red what does she mean can she continue with lee may i'm going to the refugee camp gotta get to him before he finds a way out i'll come with go get an update on camp security from colonel flagg why because then you won't be here are we with you no i need to confirm with kotal khan that lee mae's story is true you and your team are going to outworld [Music] i don't know i expected the sky to be purple or something don't believe everything you see online and what makes you an expert michelle in archives i studied a lot about outworld no substitute for experience so what makes you our leader guys let's stick to the mission lime has to be telling the truth an invasion would violate the reiko accords you can always trust an outworlder but if outworlds are ally why didn't they help us during the netherworld war against quan chi and his team of revenants like jackie's dad [ __ ] it's not an alliance not aggression pact outworld is not our ally a point you might make with more subtlety given your surroundings now state your business including a reason why we shouldn't kill you i can read you you're not from outworld i'm from earth realm like you but my employer koto khan is from outworld so now i'm from outworld state your business we're emissaries we need to talk to kotal khan here we have raiden's official seal can buy one of those at that stall right over there look you can arrest us even kill us but if we're telling the truth you probably get a pay cut or worse you take us to the con i'll tell them you took us down maybe you get a bonus you can't lose follow me to take without his leave is to steal from the hand of kotal khan himself therefore having been found guilty of theft you shall be put to death i was hungry your sentence will be carried out immediately death for petty theft remember where you are gin [Applause] uh get out of here go i knew i shouldn't have listened to you a lesson in trust from a mercenary here's another learning opportunity did you at least try the gun is the best offense [Music] i'm a quick learner you couldn't just ask for a pony like every other girl the archives never mentioned symbiotes [Music] oh [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] you here make trouble skinny [ __ ] it off [Music] let's rub some dirt in it you should be embarrassed [Music] love to learn more about you too bad you're insane you guys all right earth bombers yes this one must learn more of your diplomatic techniques we're here to see kotal khan general blaze you interfere without world matters the penalty is death i'm sensing a theme but as we honor the reiko accords we will consult the emperor you will wait in here you want to take this opportunity to tell us what the [ __ ] [ __ ] you were thinking i gotta wonder why you'd risk interrum war for a bread thief because not all thieves are irredeemable [Music] [Music] [Music] it has more sentimental than monetary value nevertheless i would prefer you did not steal it it's a family heirloom one that shouldn't have been given to you your family honored me with this memento of your cousin lao after his death a death you caused you made him fight shao khan and stood there while that bastard snapped his neck you go too far kung jin no not far enough [Music] to at least try give it up just let me go blood of kung lao descendant of the great kung lao a common thief did you think you could walk unimpeded into my temple and walk out again without my complicity you wanted me to attack you why to release your anger make you amenable to reason and make me feel like [ __ ] self-loathing has always been an unfortunate part of your makeup there lies ahead a brighter path one that will truly honor your ancestors one that is worthy of you go to the wuxi academy join the shaolin like kung lao before you i can't they won't accept they care only about what is in your heart not whom your heart desires it's too late for me it is never too late kung jin [Music] your news of refugees is troubling their exodus to earthrealm was not known to me i do know this i invited no guests from earthrealm certainly none who would disrupt the execution of justice how do i know you are not allied with molina perhaps her newfound power has earned her new friends friends no no we're not even sure that chinook's amulet she had he employed shinnok's amulet against me the very item earthrealm swore would be safe in its care when outworld was offered no participation we were under attack not outworld total khan the fire that burns the sun we are here because we share your concerns about the missing item we intend no ill against your rule at least one earthrealmer can forge words like silver but i recall an earth realm expression there is more honor among thieves than diplomats i've had the questionable fortune to be both emperor but i'm telling you the truth you are allied with molina you may carry out your sentence total khan under outworld law i claim the right of defense by combat what you're gonna fight a duel to absolve us of all accusations denying the request brings dishonor upon the accuser you know much of outworld no also the duel ends in death you have won nothing nearly a few more seconds it's over already uh [Music] and now emperor the charges against you are void i say to all that earth realm means outworld no harm now kill me be done with it you're not actually gonna instead of your life i claim your service if molina does have the amulet we can get it from her more easily if we work together emperor they cannot be trusted laura can you not perceive i am indebted to them you honor us kotal khan our gratitude is wide like the ocean i'll talk to general blade tell her about our new arrangement thanks for the heads up sergeant stay with kotal khan we'll figure out next steps once i've got kano locked down yes ma'am cage out he's still here i can feel it report one of the refugees founder near the north perimeter that's one of kano's neckties inform limey tell her we're investigating raiden what'd you find chinock's amulet has been stolen replaced by an exquisite duplicate damn it something is wrong i will speak to you once raiden raiden lieutenant i need you to take a team to fort charles check in with raiden and report back what's going on what's your update from colonel flagg he said why are you bothering me and i said because my ex-wife is a pain in it where are you going you can't just walk away i'm in this too not my decision thank your buddy secretary blake this is what split us up in the first place you disappear in your work never time for me and cassie i had responsibilities sorry you couldn't be the center of attention there was a time when you cared more about your family than your job general nope no evil sorcerers in here would you get serious quan chi needs to clean up his man cave it's cleaner than yours you're comparing me to quan chi only in terms of cleanliness what's this i wouldn't do that ah come on where's your sense of adventure you wish for adventure you shall have it fire i have no need of your soldiers but you and mr cage will serve me well once you are dead don't know when to quit do you um you're dismissed not as tough as you look quan chi you've lost a delay misplayed the inevitable still beckons johnny [Music] you won't be dead for long this will not happen [Music] christian you're dismissed [Music] i'm sorry jax i'll get you out of here you'll be fine don't know blood's supposed to be on the inside raiden i must reverse his spell oh [Music] you're weak thunder god johnny cage is mine no he's mine save him i've got this son of a [ __ ] uh as you were [Music] that wasn't even close to what you deserved not a problem [Music] no foreign the others are restored to the living by coupling quan chi's dark magics to my own i was able to restore their souls is he gonna make it haven't i told you uh he's a god huh you scared the [ __ ] out of me and they said i couldn't do horror films he's gone how did he we got to go after him he can wait right now we need to get you and the others back to earth realm why is it taking so long name ray m a 2 k e ray thanks all right you seem to know this kano intimately not the word i'd use but yes i chased him for years until he escaped to outworld after shinnok's invasion why would he return now all that matters is he's caught gotcha are you lost [Music] hello love been a while not long enough this is general blade i need mps to my location immediately oh let's keep this between friends a tribe info for freedom i don't negotiate with scumbags well then if mother won't play nice maybe daughter will if you ever back off and all's well piss me off and cassie's gonna meet uncle kaino i swear to god how's your blood taste um no i'm not done with you all right all right get off me sonja ease up you killed me sonia we need that info don't make this another thing you regret talk the quatton jungle with at least two divisions of tarkatans they're on the move constantly to avoid detection that's not far maybe 200 kilometers you know what to do yes ma'am good luck blade out you have new information from earthrealm kano talked gave us the details on molina's location she has the amulet but she's got a lot of protection we will strike immediately perhaps a too proud approach the army will engage milina distract her but this one retrieves the ambulance not alone this one's coming with stealth is the essence did you not hear me you may assist in the main strike we will grant their request and i will finally be rid of molina [Music] this one understands your logic but does not reach the same conclusion like others this one is not plead with melina as car that is why i invited our zateran friend listen and join us i know things about melina a troubled rule will fall in the telling and pave the way for gratal what would you know that ah there they are three of your fellow counselors whispering like handmaidens about what i wonder if only you would hear our council as war with netherrealm looms i have urged detont with earthrealm and i've told you i would sooner die than treat with my father's murderers you refuse practical solutions to credible threats you endanger the realm and sedition does not speak your last before i have your tongue you are not shao khan's true heir she is a construct formed in shang tsung's flesh pits i saw this your best claim to the throne is moot how dare you i succeed shao khan by his decree succeed him you have but outworld demands new leadership from you architect fool kill him this one serves melina no longer to defend your empress [Music] uh i honor his will [Music] uh [Music] [Music] ah is dead your last ally has left you take her away then you serve cotton card [Music] [Music] there here to surrender traitor you speak of treason this one knows you desire the throne why serve melina i advise her stealing the amulet was my genius it kills her a bit each time she uses it as both sides diminish you fill the void exactly my plan ashamed [Applause] yes [Music] your schemes end here leaving without your friend laura your people believe we avoided your island out of respect for your solitary nature he just didn't like you but you do prefer solitude which i will achieve momentarily [Music] this one is pleased now two identities will die i know you said you weren't friends but you're not killing them head's fine by the way very well let us go [Music] step aside that is really disturbing devorah this one knew you would not stray far from the onions you took my throne now you wish to steal my means of reclaiming it neither wasn't for you who are you to say i will take something of yours your life uh yes this one will enjoy your death [Music] enough of your prattle finish me that i may join my father you do not deserve death by an emperor's hand instead i give the honor to my worthy first minister [Music] hmm ah the rebellion is over well thanks for that i know i'll never eat again with your leave we're gonna head back to earth realm put the amulet back where it belongs the hell are you doing earth rome cannot be trusted to protect the amulet it will remain with me the raikou accords require this accords no longer concern me but you may prove useful when raiden comes for this this one deceived them the amulet is in culture possession you can retrieve it he trusts no one else to transport it keeping you close to the outworld throne these many years has proven most fortuitous devorah they never suspected one of their own to be a disciple of our lord this one lives to serve sheep you have done well now bring it to me without delay auntie will soon be freed we make for my fortress is there a problem [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] your wife told me i'd find you in here you and vera have a nice chat always is that a national i haven't seen one we didn't come here to discuss farm implements all right i'll cut to the chase i need your help my help i know i don't have any right he knew what i wanted jackie volunteered she came to me i know listen i get why you didn't want jackie joining sf why you retired i mean if i had to live with memories of being one of quan chi's thugs i would have eaten a gun a long time ago well you know vera she never would have allowed that so what is it you need help with the outworld refugees worse chinook's amulet molina has it damn and we've gotten word from serena that quan chi has resurfaced in the nether realm he shows his face after 25 years just as shinnok's amulet is in play that's not a coincidence that's why i need you your quan chi expertise we wouldn't reactivate your commission you'd be an observer cage jax what is it just wanted to see if you could help close the cell yeah because that worked out so well last time can't blame a guy for trying we need you jax help me capture quan chi none of us is safe if he gets near that amulet so where's jackie in all this outworld with cassie's team recovering the amulet she'll be fine we expect to hear mission accomplish from them soon [Music] so what you guys think are they gonna kill us they would have done it by now unless kotal khan's planning on having us as guests at the coliseum well if they don't kill us my mother will me at least tough being the general's daughter ah you have no idea i do my great whatever grandfather took down shang tsung saved earthrealm how often do you think that comes up at family gatherings that was 600 years ago and yet you'd think it happened yesterday no pressure there i've trained all my life can fight my way out of nearly anything but i still feel like a second-rate cage at least you grew up with people expecting things from you i thought you and your dad were best friends now it was a no-show for a long time i can relate what was that like growing up having an ex-revenant father jen no i'm asking couldn't have been easy he was just a bit overprotective when i joined sf mr cage insisted on being the one to tell my dad he thought it'd go smoother i'll never forget that day my dad came home with a broken jaw all right i got this you've got what exactly trust me away from the bars [Music] [Music] [Applause] hmm [Music] how'd you do that i overloaded his senses it only works at short range being the son of a telepath has its perks i didn't use to think so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] yield well done [Music] you are now choo-chin you honor me master asashi now that i'm trujin how will i serve the clan your future does not lie with the shirai raju but the clan's my family when i took you in i promised your father i don't have a father yes you do one who's proud of you a chujin in record time you knew he was coming you said nothing knowing this would be your reaction yes takeda your father is not your enemy ten years no visits nothing you abandoned me i did not abandon you i was eight my mother had just died now you come back think you can jump right in as a proud dad son i to hell with you i am not your son [Music] is [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] now get up i want to knock you down again takeda cease kenji did not abandon you he brought you here for your protection protection from what from those who murdered your mother she she died in an accident [Music] that is the story i asked master hasashi to tell you but in truth your mother was killed by red dragon assassins i was the target su chin was the victim son of a [ __ ] it was your fault your father has devoted his life to fighting animals like the red dragon it is they who are without honor you shouldn't have hidden the truth you would have gone after your mother's killers unprepared i could not risk that master hasashi has perfected your fighting skills now it is time to complete your training how did you do that we are telepaths a family gift i can read minds through training we will determine your full abilities and then we will hunt down the red dragon together this is divora's work no argument there only she could create wounds like these that divorce full of surprises question is is she working with anyone else what is it damn it's made us okay guys standard diamond formation takeda you're on point jackie bring up the rear kung jin air converting got it the earthrealmers divora freedom nothing doesn't [Music] quicker yes the eyes oh one down two to go when we get back you're teaching me that deal go help with irma i got this think you can handle me alone you're either brave or foolish yeah it's yeah than the eyes brave or foolish i'm alive let's see what's worth learning in there so many minds trapped inside we exist to serve bound by shakhan's magic chaos the voices we are men you are one your ability for us you gotta suck i think i've had enough of that world i'm starting to get why my dad retired we have to find devorah get the amulet let's go it won't be out long devorah and the earth roamers she stole the amulet then helped him escape she betrayed us to the thunder god you wound me devorah prepare the legions we go to earth realm we will rest back the amulet from that devil raiden we're all in one piece no one seems to be tailing us have you been able to determine where devorah was headed we think she's headed for the sea of blood damn dad she's coming here to quan chi there's a secret portal near the sea of blood quan chi had it built when we were getting ready to invade outworld great dad what are you doing why are you in the nether realm now who's being overprotected i know you think you have things to make up for but i'm doing this for sonia she's family that's why i'm worried i'll be fine you stay safe here you stay safe too i love you breaks out rigs out feeling better or worse not sure maybe both they'll be fine the question is will i be we have good crossfire position but why is it quan chi travels by conventional means he seems unable to fully use his magic he's weaker than when i was in his service serena's dead on he doesn't have shinnok as a power source he's still quan chido i realize you agreed to guide and observe but you are welcome to assume any role you wish too rusty don't want to jeopardize the mission he approaches [Music] now yes [ __ ] [Music] guess i have been uh destruction good job yes that knocked some of my rust off [Music] ah [Music] [Laughter] ah yes this hill is not my home then why be full enough to return i got a family to protect ponchi reunited me with my family he will do the same for you that came from [Music] gotcha is not helping you it is possible to escape quan chi kitana i can aid you as bihan aided me you became too familiar with bihan allowed emotion to corrupt you emotion freed me i don't understand katana i mean i hate the things i did here but you enjoy being a revenant it suits me i am a victim no longer yeah i know what you mean but this ain't the way to assert yourself far deadly if you crap uh i gotta believe there's hope for you mother god we've lost many the rest are wounded and our friends the tide turned against them they fled how you two do it i'm fine that's what i thought where are you going gonna bag me a sorcerer alone you'll be killed wouldn't be the first time [Music] in your weakened state is it possible for you to release i am more than capable and aura are you certain she is capable she will bring the amulet to me and i'll be waiting for jackson briggs a pleasant surprise nothing pleasant about it so you return to raiden the food will follow fools did his best he saved earthrealm he murdered me [Music] you were not there he stole everything from me you do not deserve to join us [Music] instead you will learn there are worse things crap think of that uh i wish i could help you bouquet jacks there is no need just it's good to be back kenzie i got him excellent work i'm staying here the war is on the way you need to get quan chi to sonia she'll make him spill his guts sit i'm guessing it's not your first time in cubs what's your safe word advise secretary blake that quan chi is in custody we'll be moving him to the super max facility at fort charles within the hour yes ma'am u2 stand guard prisoner transfer will be here in 20. oh now she trusts me to babysit cage report we haven't caught up to devorah we had her track to the makipa cliffs but then her trail went cold damn jackie thinks deborah's unique physiology may allow us to pinpoint her location she's retooling her smart comp to track devorah's ceremonies on my command only do not kill we're looking at two hours sergeant your team doesn't have two hours we need her found immediately cassie i appreciate what you're trying to do but there isn't time bring your team back here we need to
