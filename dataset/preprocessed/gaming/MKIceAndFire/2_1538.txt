Casey good news Mei said she would give me the key we need good news help tourist I would classify that it's [ __ ] outstanding nose look I don't want to jinx it but no you know what I'm gonna keep my mouth shut that's not to risk the jinx let's just forge ahead one step at a time okay so the part to repair the final pump gosh aya I don't have much to go on weird there's been really faint chatter about it on a few channels they nothing but static for months there's an outpost called Bastion set up in a heavily defended duplex home barricades and optimal sight lines they're acclaimed currently control it now the place has been a hotbed of conflict between tower and reclaimed for a while from what I'm hearing that's where it is so be ready for a shitstorm good luck and hey keep your head on a swivel hey Casey how's it going hey tourists honestly hey Casey how's it going alright tourists honestly I'm a little freaked out you always freaked out Casey who you are a freak out I'm not always freaked out Tourister that's an exaggeration and you know it if you don't think you can handle it you should probably just stay locked up down there violence is as much a plague on the world as the dead I'm gonna sugarcoat oh wow what great choices remain a [ __ ] old man for the rest of my life or crawl out of my hole to the surface that's overrun with violent Psychopaths and ravenous walking corpses could be worse you know oh yeah I don't see how it could possibly be worse you could be a sentient dog turd stuck to the bottom of a Walker's rotting foot doomed to squish slowly in and out of the mud for all eternity yeah you're right that'd be a pretty shitty deal you know I gotta hand it to your tourists the conversation with Hugh is always enlightening even entertaining sometimes but that's about all I can handle right now but take a few minutes to myself I'll talk to you later you ah Oh [Music] if you made it I didn't doubt that you would of course but my patience was beginning to be tested let's start with a formal introduction you are the tourist and I am Jean Baptiste JB for short there now we can proceed to matters of more profound consequence it is my understanding that this gizmo here would be of use to you it's all yours consider a gift and when we are finished with our conversation I will provide you with the mist and now that you'll need to operate it sound fair sounds fair terrific now I prefer to play it straight once I received word that you were collecting these devices and to what purpose I saw an opportunity to connect with the city's most illustrious survivor and have a chat about the reserve so I made it a priority to acquire one through various means I will not divulge that now here you are it is my hope when I'm through you will see the reserve for what it is nothing more than a crutch holding back the people of this fine city from regaining themselves you're a cocky bastard JB not cocky convicted but I also know how to humble myself when dealing with someone as formidable as you so my apologies if my demeanor seems brash I'm a man a particular predilections don't worry about it say what you have to say I am a firm believer in the greatness of humankind our ingenuity our art our towering scientific achievements this reserved nonsense even if the rumors about what may be inside it exceed our wildest dreams the bounty will only prolong our addiction to survivalism as the only path in life it will stifle our creativity it will eventually lead to our whither in doom now this is the proposal that I have for you continue your search for the reserve and when you Werner that which I have the utmost confidence you will destroy it these four numbers will disable the entire flood contingency system mother nature will rage to the reserve and take care of the rest one 0:06 flood the reserve and set us all three give this still glorious city the jump-started needs to revoke asan something much grander than mere survival grant us hope tourists and thank you most sincerely for hearing me out and let's keep this chat between us if that's all right I'm not sure my comrades would see the big picture benefits of removing the reserve from the equation the floor is now yours my friend anything on your mind that requires clarity I want your perspective on the reserve if the room is about what's inside the reserve a true wouldn't it benefit the reclaim to get your hands on it you are absolutely correct but once those supplies are gone then what the same old fruitless pursuits and there is the very distinct possibility that the tower gets to it before we do the only way to guarantee this city will move forward in the proper direction is to remove the reserve from the equation entirely why choose me to destroy the reserve because you're the one best equipped to find their cursed place and I trust you will do the right thing when you do call it a hunch how did you find this code to flood the reserve one of my scouts came across the corpse of a National Guardsman in rampant highschool the body had a manual for a bunkers flood defense system I put two and two together I have some other questions for you JB I'm curious about the reclaim yes the reclaimed have made quite a mark on the city how did the movement get started after my exile from the tower for insubordination I took the raven their supply lines rather efficiently I might add no one ever got hurt and other exiles clamored to join my operations needless to say momma and her cohorts were not pleased with my exploits when they sent several communications asking me to cease my pillaging or there'd be consequences of course I refused politely no one was gonna dictate the terms of my existence anymore but it wasn't until the tower started sending thugs out to track me down and in me that I decided it was time to send a message of my own what's with the gory rituals first one was a man I knew well in my brief tenure as a tower grunt had he even called him a friend Tripp was his name snuck up on me in the middle of sleep tried to slit my throat still carry the scar we had a long story short trip was no match for me I've named him something awful really and I dragged his body about a mile all the way to the southern bump which at the time was the most highly trafficked exit from the tower I found an old oak hung him upside down from it so his lifeblood would spill rapidly into the soul and upon his chest I append a note that read keep him coming and just like that I became the most feared boogeyman NOLA has seen since the axe man once I had fear on my side the rest just blossomed naturally those with nowhere else to go wanted what I had so they listened and they learned I empowered him that's all people want a sense that their lives still have some meaning I've heard snippets about the reclaimed philosophy but it would be enlightening to hear it from you it's simple really we want to live purposeful lives reclaim the world and our humanity along with it mere survival is so paid it's beneath us forcing people to focus solely on survival it's cruel really I believe we must invest in a future of our own design life is not worth living otherwise I have some other questions for you JB I've heard enough fair enough then we are finished here the Dow has promised Godspeed tourists we finally meet tourists after all the hype you're not exactly what I expected thought you'd be more put together a bit more danger to your presence sorry to disappoint lady good thing I'm not too concerned about what you think of me you should be fooled your life may depend on it I'm Georgia maybe you heard of me maybe not I could give two shits what does concern me is the man inside the building you just stepped out of the time has come to silence him once and for all cut off the head that won't shut up rest of the reclaimed fools would fall back in line venez tower folk can get back to doing what's right without all the noise from what I know about JB it may take more than you and a couple of goons to take him down you a real smartass tourist I [ __ ] love smart asses especially when I snipped the tongues out of that smartass mouth but I'm willing to give you a pass on your smartass ways just this business I'm gonna offer you an opportunity to be a hero you gain that depends what the [ __ ] do you want me to do quit [ __ ] with me fool you know what I want Marsh back up into that house and kill JB through a bureau worked more to the tower than the cockroach you've been so fun and in return all your fucked-up transgressions will be forgiven if you happen to find yourself in the midst of our onslaught on the reserved tower troops will have your back you have my word this is your conflict not mine I'm not a hired gun for the tower that's a goddamn shame tourists JB is not walking out of that place alive whether you get involved or not what you don't seem to realize however is your fate if you define me let me clarify do as you are told or you are dead around too long you've returned to what do I owe the pleasure terrorists tower troops are outside they want your dead I suggest you get out of here well look at you tourists choosing sides I suppose that's a good sign regarding our previous conversation for a rogue spirit you certainly have proven pivotal in the fight for the soul of this godforsaken and still glorious city I have no designs on escape I plan to march right out of his house gun drawn and send a message if you feel like joining me I suggest you keep up when it comes to violence I am decisive and Swift we collaborate well tourists together we might have been able to handle twice as many tower goons I had forgotten how much I enjoy the thrill of a bra been a while thanks for reminding me and now I must bid you farewell I have a new broadcast [Music] [Music] I'm back Casey ready to repair the pump he's still alive yeah a life but almost swimming no turning back
