i need to get the weapon fragment to gaia to analyze if we can replicate it maybe we'll have a way to defeat the zenith i should check on the clone too well where's our guest we're in the maintenance card or below the control room okay so this is best he's like uh gaia's own personal holograms yeah gaia i thought you said the data here was lost as like my uncle laurent man didn't smile a day in his life and would box your ears if you messed with his forge harem you okay huh oh yeah yeah i mean why wouldn't i be because there's two of me now there's two of you now at least you seem to be handling it okay i wouldn't say that exactly but i'm trying what you're reading next i saw gaia added something to the archives about metal rods being used to harness lightning during storms guy reminded me of a cousin of mine thought he could trap lightning if he covered himself in storm bird plates went up the tallest mountain in the claim to prove it it ended like a lot of asaram things do with a spark and a boom what are you working on with your focus i'm still figuring out how to read stuff on this thing those two lovebirds over there i've been giving me a hand but to be honest all the little symbols give me a headache but i'll get up to speed i promise did you speak with beta at all i just didn't really wake up till we brought her here and when she did i i thought it'd be better if zoe and varl took care of her no use crowding someone when they're in a state i have to get going don't go causing too much trouble eloy you're back yeah i'm just uh checking up on how everyone's doing you mean after meeting someone who looks exactly like you but isn't you down in the basement guess this must be even stranger for you than it is for us huh a little varl said she may be able to help us in our mission though maybe what else have you been up to i've been studying gaia's seedlings the sub functions i wanted to understand why one of them would do what they did to far imagine my surprise when i looked into this hephaestus and found out it helped create all machines our land gods included in a way the utaru oh hephaestus our whole way of life as well as our current troubles that's why we have to make guy a whole again learn anything interesting lately there's been much to read up on now that ether has been reunited with gaia it's hard to imagine that machines like storm birds once helped heal the skies i used to be terrified of them as a child thunder still brings chills to my skin but everything gaia creates has a purpose no yeah and if we can get a festus back she can get those storm birds in line you said you met beta varl mentioned she was hurt i thought i'd offer her an extract to sue the pain that was kind of you i just hope she doesn't plan on staying burrowed down there like that she looks like she's barely seen the light of day as it is i need to get going may the land bloom in your steps hey loi glad you made it back okay she panicked after waking up and stumbled down here i thought it best to wait for you i'll talk to her hello it's uh it's beta right my name's eloy [Music] what's wrong is it your injury withdrawal syndrome i don't understand sudden removal of a neurologically integrated data device the brain especially the cerebellum goes into a kind of sensory freefall everything real feels unreal distant is there anything that can help do you have a focus to spare it's it's primitive but i can make it work [Music] booting up so hey boy i suppose you want information about you and the zenith yeah why are they here what do they want how did they get you but let's start the beginning i'm guessing they faked the destruction of their ship a thousand years ago that seems consistent with their behavior they wouldn't want to be followed so far zenith established a colony world after all yes for a few hundred years but it didn't last some sort of natural disaster rendered it uninhabitable okay so the descendants of farzenith escaped a dying planet and now they want to claim earth for themselves not their descendants what not their descendants it it's them the same ones who left earth a thousand years ago you didn't know how can they still be alive they don't even look what did they do to themselves i believe it's a combination of pharmaceutical cellular treatments and technological implants and you does that mean that you're i'm not like them i was made on the way to earth on the ship i spent years studying in my training interface all so that i could serve my function access and control of the terraforming system but why what does the zenith want with it when i discovered the zero dawn system had disseminated into its sub-components i thought my purpose was to fix it but i don't think the zeniths want that at all i think they want to wipe earth clean and start over so the zeniths want to exterminate life on earth that's what guy and i concluded too but why why kill everyone just to take over when they took me on missions with them i saw how they butchered the tribal people we encountered they didn't seem to care about a rejuvenated earth so i concluded that they must want a hard reboot of the system then they can redesign it to be exactly what they want mass extinction for their own comfort who thinks like that well without their gaia kernel they'll have a hard time doing that the zenith needed elizabeth's jean print to access zero dawn facilities so they made you trained you and you went along with it they told me i was born to interface with the zero dawn system when we reached earth i pieced together what must have happened to gaia and her subordinate functions that's when i started to realize i wasn't meant to fix gaia that they must have made me so i could do what their remote extinction signal failed to do reboot earth for their own benefit so you know about the extinction signal it was speculation but the only logical conclusion why gaia suddenly self-destructed after operating efficiently for centuries gaia would have only undertaken such a desperate course of action if it had detected a threat to life on earth that was more dangerous than ceasing function all together i should have realized that she would also order the recreation of elizabeth sobek to rebuild her yeah well surprise [Music] so we're dealing with the same farzineth people who once lived on earth what else do you know about them they were some of the most affluent and powerful people on earth they controlled almost every major resource every industry gerard commands them he's the one who decided to set up a base the others eric tilda verbena they resent his authority over them but in the end they always do what he says eric he's the one i fought back in the hades proving lab he enjoys hurting people yeah i know you mentioned the zenith set up a base here on earth where is it off the coast i think whenever i had to go on missions i was transported inside of a specter drone i couldn't see anything outside but i did overhear the zeniths talking about it once they were discussing setting up a perimeter energy shield to repel the local fauna i'm certain they have other security measures inspector patrol's machine boris it must be impregnable what's inside the base launch facilities so they can shuttle back and forth to their ship in orbit plus infrastructure to gather materials and fabricate anything they need are there more zeniths than the ones you met i'm not sure i suppose there must be more of them in the base or back on the ship for all i know there could be more of them out in space other survivors of the colony you said the zenith colony in the serious system was destroyed what happened all i was ever told was that a natural disaster forced them to leave sirius i've speculated that it was an extra solar object or a cataclysmic seismic event or maybe even an abnormally violent coronal mass ejection from serious a the zenith never told you any details they said the only thing that mattered was that they survived first earth thousand years ago and then serious guess they survived old age too how did you escape the zenith before the hades proving lab i never thought i'd get away from them even if i were to run i'd never survive on my own in the wilds but then i saw you and i thought that maybe you could help me so when the zenith pinpointed a luthier's location in the biomedical research facility i saw an opportunity you said you saw an opportunity to escape when you went to capture luthia what did you do exactly whenever i was taken out on a mission to recover a subordinate function only one of the zeniths would go with me the one the rebels killed outside the facility but venus dead how did they bypass her shield i'm looking into it but you were talking about your escape well when it was time to use the zenith transmitter to send a luthier back to base i also sent the encrypted transmission then i distracted for baina long enough to seal myself in the ectogenic chamber altering the facility's log so it appeared that there were only 236 containers and the gaia root colonel i told them i could capture luthier faster if i had it with me and they believed me well done you said you were born on the way to earth in an artificial womb i'm guessing the easiness had an ectogenic chamber aboard the ship an updated version of the one you found me in they must have used a stored sample of elizabeth's dna i doubt elizabeth would have let them take her dna do you know how they got it that wasn't part of the archive i was allowed to access you said you spent years studying in a training interface was this archive you mentioned part of that but only the parts i was permitted to access aristotle and espacia the avatars of the archive would assign me learning modules and evaluate my progress wait those names they were designed to be the virtual guides for the apollo database before ted pharaoh purged it the zenith have a copy so it still exists and you got to learn from it only what was deemed pertinent to the mission if i requested information outside of my parameters my tutors would deny it to have all that knowledge just out of reach must have been frustrating [Music] all right i think that's enough for now do you want to come upstairs or so how long you know your your plan how long before guy has fabricated a machine army to defeat the zenith how did you know optimal strategy so well i still have to get two more subordinate functions before guy is powerful enough to absorb hephaestus what you don't have hephaestus already guy is still figuring out how to capture it it's not confined to a single to a single location of course not you didn't even know who the zeniths really are you're supposed to be further along by now coming here was a mistake they're going to find me they're going to find this place and take me back this was all for nothing they're not going to find us guy is using minerva to mask our location what difference does it make you're too far behind we're never going to beat them everything everyone i'm gonna die hey calm down you're here now right so is there anything you can do to help i have certain knowledge sets and given your state of progress expertise you probably lack geo-engineering of course computer science physics biology chemistry okay well see if you can do something with that talk to gaia i'll check on you later how'd it go her injury's not that bad but i think she regrets coming here feeling might be mutual hmm i'll come back later and talk to her see if i can learn anything [Music] i should get the weapon fragmented got his focus things trying to kill me he did almost drown it in beer not on purpose hey you and erin okay nothing some rest can't take care of are you okay this beta thing it's a lot even for you just trying to take it one step at a time fair enough if you need anything just let me know it's good to see you and zoe enjoying yourselves we're learning a lot i've actually been looking through the data to find ideas for a gift and to thank her for helping me study the glyphs something from the old world that she's never seen before instead i found out they gave each other stuffed animals if you ask me stuffing a dead animal with anything really doesn't sound like a good time for anybody maybe gaia can help you find something else how's everyone dealing with beta i tried explaining what a clone is to aaron he was totally lost ben zoe said something about two trees coming from one seed that seemed to help a bit i see everyone settling in zoe's planning on bringing all kinds of plants in here says the home should always spring with life anew i asked aaron to help find some i think he'd rather stick his head into a snap mall still it's not a bad idea should liven up the place i should get back to the wilds i'll keep an eye on beta make sure she's comfortable okay welcome back hey i see we have a new guest so now we know the origin of the transmission yeah i also recovered this the weapon it was part of somehow stripped a zenith of its shield but it malfunctioned and blew up if we can recreate the weapon and improve it maybe we'll gain the upper hand on the zenith a moment i will scan it complete by combining the results with data from your focus i can infer that the weapon was highly advanced comparable to zenith technology but not how it worked did the explosion corrupt the data it was only a catalyst the moment the weapon malfunctioned it appears a command executed to purge all data within its core ostensibly this was to prevent the weapons secrets from falling into enemy hands whoever designed this weapon knew how to cover their tracks silence based on your data on him that is my conclusion as well and he's not going to cooperate with us well it was worth a shot but that's not all the zenith got a luthier along with artemis and apollo that is unfortunate however our original plan remains unchanged the two remaining subordinate functions should increase my heuristic processing density enough to absorb hephaestus right one problem at a time well i guess i better get back out there i wish you luck on your search right thanks guy so i guess we won't be making use of silence weapon and now there is another clone of elizabeth here with us but i can't let it distract me i still have two more subfunctions to get a little loud aaron i know that makes you want to punch something more like someone oh you're the one that helped me find it people make mistakes [Music] there is something i'd like to discuss it's about the land gods if you have time that is you said you wanted to talk about the land gods i think there's a way to heal them so that they'll once again provide plain song with grain gaia gave me a set of instructions she called it uh reboot code if we deliver it to the land gods their derangement will end that's great it may be there are thorns on the path unless the code is given by hephaestus the land gods will reject it gaia showed me a way around this we need components called control cores from machines made by hephaestus machines similar to the land gods you mean grimhorns like the one we fought in the repair bay yes gaia helped me locate two of them out west so kill the machines get the control cores then use them to adapt the reboot code into something the land gods will obey if all goes well but taking down two grim horns won't be easy we'll do it together bless you aloy i'll send you the location of the machines i'll let you know when i get close to those grim horns good if we can get their control cores maybe we really can heal the land gods looks like someone's made this space their own i believe they wanted private accommodations i see so the old ones painted their faces with something called makeup like the karcher why yeah it beats me it probably meant something to them as it does to my people and the tanakh i just think my faith says it all as is that's all that it does where'd catolo go [Music] so [Music] this is where zoe said we'd find the grim horns she needs parts from to heal plain songs land gods i should let her know i'm here hey zoe i'm near the grimhorn site can you join me i'll be there soon aloy i'm glad we can do this together the grim horns we're looking for should be just to the north let's go get those control cores thank you again for helping me if this works if we can heal the land gods it will end a generation of suffering for my people how do you think fain and the chorus will take it they seem to think the tribe's extinction is inevitable i've had my disagreements with somebody something i'd like to see they'll be happy to be wrong in this there the grimhorns and they're not alone we'll just have to be smart about this i'll follow your lead [Music] one [Music] here we go wow i could give it a taste of it no weapons ah oh oh much better over here ah i can't with my stamina is oh but we did it you okay a bit winded but i'll be all right i'll grab the course be my guest [Music] stuff for the stash i'll take those cores two control cores as requested thank you gaia showed me a way to scan them and take what we need to update the reboot code i'll head back to base and get started when i was a child there was always enough to eat the land gods provided for us and every season we celebrated them my happiest memories come from those times do you really think we can bring them back we'll make it happen thank you eloy so we'll probably need some time to sort through those cores i should do something else in the meantime better for blackhand pizza apparently it tastes worse the longer it takes to be delivered or something like that maybe you can find the recipe i think it was just flat bread with cheese and some sauce i like it already i was hoping we could talk go ahead now that you have those control cores are you ready to reboot the land gods in plain salt not yet gaia told me the reboot code has to be altered using data from the cores she updated my focus with software to accomplish this task but apparently it's very complicated it'll take time well let me know if you need any help i will i should get going may you unearth that which you seek so is i see you champion sit please choosing the right rations can be just as important to your chance of survival as choosing the right weapons if you want food that'll save your life out in the wilds go northwest to salt bite the cook there pantala she'll whip up a meal for anyone who needs it to knock or not oh make sure to pay her a visit if i'm out that way if you're welcome so [Music] [Music] stay alert soldier so [Music] foreign [Music] something chased me all the way back to camp nasty machines are your stories in your body should have known better than to take a job i think i might make this a camp proper talana little rest stop on the journey to the delft thanks to the secret passage for your base it was quite a sight secret passage don't let the others hear you say that or you'll have a lot of asura knocking at your door and you are this is ragged he's a scout with this caravan he says a modest was here he joined up with our expedition right before he went through the tunnel after we made camp here i set out to do some scouting i also made peace offerings that it's a knock before trespassing in their territory a modest wanted me to ask around about some place called the rot what did you find out most i learned was that it's where the tanakh took their prisoners somewhere far to the west near thornmarsh the lowland clan's capital he set out to find it not long after on his own i tried to warn him but he was dead set on going did a modest say anything about why he was heading to the rot afraid not he was a man of few words sounds like him did he look okay to you more or less he seemed shaken when we learned the tunnel had collapsed behind us but then again so was everyone around here so you're a scout for this crew anything i should know about the area where to start down south we've got a trio of osram trying to delve into the ruins in the sand there are more of you they're the ones we followed out here in the first place and then there are all the other folk who broke away as soon as we got to this side of the tunnel salvagers explorers all sorts of daring venturers just how many of you were there enough to lose track that's for sure i've also spotted some rebels a while back too seems like they've been patrolling the desert heard all about the rebellion from the knocked up and scalding spear that's the desert clan's capital north of here sounds like you've really gotten to know the area it's what i do thanks robert this has been helpful hope you find him okay i'll have the thor marsh meet me there hold on what you're willing to go to the ends of tanakh's territory to find this guy no hesitation of course he's one man alone in the forbidden west i'm just worried about him i think it's more than that i'll meet you near the lowland capital but then you're going to tell me who a modest really is fine i'll lay low north of the village see you there might be get out of my way that's not soldiers in trouble get out of my way now the tide's turned [Music] [Applause] done i need a word quickly you've got to help my friend wait slow down and explain the tay and i were heading south with supplies from salt bite when machines attacked i left her behind so i could get help from the grove and ran straight into another machine thank the ten you were here to help so your friend is still up the road fighting machines that's what i'm trying to tell you i'll bail her out if i can you go on and get those reinforcements will do i'm in your debt one more day behind me [Music] soldier it looks like the tanakh tried to salvage some supplies after getting attacked there trucks from the missing tonight here by the 10 that lump made it i thought we were both finished let's clear out these machines uh oh [Music] ah [Music] machine [Music] oh oh you guys gotta get more ammo ugh we've got incoming blazes how are we going to take that thing down attack no time to lose the tap you stubborn fool you haven't let me down yet out now [Music] almost done you did it i can't believe i'm alive [Music] a word before you move on thanks if you hadn't shown up i would have been machine grist all i did was give your friend here a little time to come to the rescue ah you're full of it i barely escape with my life on the road that i believe i uh hope some of your supplies are still usable me too food's always scarce the soldiers at the grove need the rations no way we can trek back north to salt bite to get more i'll get this one back on her feet and we'll scrape what's left of our hall of the dirt you're making me hungry thanks outlander we won't forget what you did stay safe both of you [Music] what happened here take a closer look hands down [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] a moment before thought uh uh more debris but it looks like the trail keeps going up maybe i should look around more before i move on [Music] okay better take a look at that debris maybe i should look around more before i move on maybe i should look around more before i move on okay let's take a look at that to knock the mask something tore through this place it looks like there's a trail of debris [Music] hello anyone here nothing no sign of a machine attack either maybe one of those big storms swept through if there was anyone here they're long gone now machine's resistant to fire [Music] huh she's on to me [Music] oh oh oh oh god ah [Music] so ugh oh [Music] ah [Music] oh god oh no room on me i can send it to my stash uh in [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's with the acrobatics [Applause] [Music] [Music] any soldier of worth has sharpened their skills [Music] awaits you [Music] so remember [Music] shamefully [Music] strength something nearby is sending that signal oh let's do huh sounds like atomic nearby my favorite invisible killing machines [Music] [Music] good oh [Music] [Music] what i could pick up that weapon tall neck if i can find a weight at the top oh [Music] uh no huh [Music] yep hello land settlement looks abandoned but all enough to get me on that tallneck if i can find a way to the top um i need to get to that platform [Music] there we go this might be high enough to jump on that timer is uh get this from my stash when i need it [Music] oh looks like this tallnick's missing some parts there's no way to climb to the top i'll have to find a platform that's high enough to reach its head directly there's got to be a way to reach higher ground somewhere thanks for the ride buddy now to find higher ground uh [Music] better watch my step kick [Music] time to leave the party all right i should be able to find a spot suspicious trees as tall as towers the stand of the sentinels that's better [Music] good [Music] so [Music] said her father's hunting camp should be near here i can catch my breath here [Applause] so uh hello world ruin i don't know what's inside amazing [Music] thorn marsh quite a sight isn't it never thought i'd find myself this deep into knock territory have you run into any trouble i've been keeping my head down i had to duck into the swamps a couple of times to avoid to knock the trolls well i'm here now so spill it who is a modest really like i said before he helped me put a stop to a hunter killer machine out in the wilds at first he thought i was just another hunter from the lodge who only cared about the biggest machine trophy and i thought he was just a grouchy hermit living in the woods but then he trusted me with the truth told me how the red raids took everything from him seeing that side of him i don't know change things you love him don't you i think i might yeah then why did you part ways when he told me how he failed to save the woman from his past i told him how i made peace with my father and brother's deaths he realized he needed to do the same on his own wait when we searched that red raids battlefield together you said he'd lost someone close to him there i thought you meant a fellow soldier who she was women aren't allowed to serve in the carja army but nessa disguised herself so she could the modest kept her secret when he left to come out west he promised he'd send word that he was all right but his letter never came so you set out to find him and when we do i'll have words for him for leading us on this wild goose chase well at least i kind of understand now the modest thought nessa died on the battlefield but when he learned that the tanakh took prisoners back west he kept going so i guess now we find this prison the rot i did some scouting while i was waiting i think i might have found the way lead on them do you think nessa might still be alive i doubt it any card your prisoners from the red raids would have been killed or returned home by now then what's a modest after i think he just needs to know over here you flaming hunk of scrap that's him the fire claw's right on his heels there's no match for the loan come on we've got your back [Music] not now shake off [Music] god so this next painting uh ah ah [Music] oh i think you can dodge my arrow to lana i you were supposed to let me know you were okay i was going to send the message right after i crossed into the desert with an asaram caravan but when it became clear that the tunnel had collapsed behind this i figured the only thing i could do was press on seeing as you found a way out here however clearly i was wrong i'm sorry the last thing i wanted was to worry you so you must be a modest and you must be aloy salan has told me a lot about you and i guess you must know about me uh a little we know you're headed for the rot but what are you hoping to find there a clue or a shred of one anything about ness's fate maybe she died on the battlefield or maybe she wasted away in that prison either way i have to know talana told me about you and nessa during the red raids that you kept her secret we were both assigned to the southern spear division our orders were to push into tanuk territory through the tunnel she was proud to serve the sunder at first but as the atrocities mounted we both saw the raids for what they were and the two of you grew close we did what we could to protect innocent lives it felt like we were the only ones who objected to the slaughter and yes we were close until the battle of the burning blooms what happened at the battle of the burning blooms i had intel that the tanakh forces were greater than we had anticipated i tried to convince my commander to halt the attack he was drunk and loud and when i threatened to reveal his incompetence to karja high command he pulled a knife on me so i killed him in self-defense it was still murder i was condemned but i thought at least i could still save nasa it was too late by the time i got to the battle the fields were already burning our soldiers slaughtered were missing what's more the commander i had killed was from a powerful noble house they put a bounty on my head i've been on the run ever since but the red rates are long over sun king of god would pardon you if he knew the sun king can't help me a pardon from a fod won't stop bounty hunters eager to claim their prize so you and delana um sounds like the two of you had an adventure out in the wilds claw striders a hunter killer mercenaries a shell snapper nothing could get in her way a scruffy hermit in the woods certainly tried that was foolish in hindsight [Music] well we're here now so let's head to the rot i can't ask you to come with me i feel bad enough you've come this far i didn't come all this way just to leave you now we'll see this true together i know better than to try to talk you out of it come then the rock's not far the rock's along the shore but we'll have to stick to the woods to avoid being seen how did you find it i overheard a tanakh patrol from the nearby village talking about it figured it out from there hope this tastes as good as it looks what were you gonna do if we hadn't found you take it on alone i only need to question one guard figured i'd grab someone when they're by themselves well now you have us we're getting close just a little further there it is the rod those are regardless they're waging civil war against the rest of the tanakh they must have taken over the prison then they would have killed any of the guards they were my last hope of finding out if nessa was there maybe not there might still be some clue inside even after all this time aloy can see much more than you or i and let's do it any scrap of hope is better than nothing we'll have to find another way in the front gate looks impenetrable and there's no way we're scaling those walls you two stay here i'll see if i can find another way in and get that gate open i should check around the sides might be a way in from the water oh wow keep me awake gotta get to the main gate to lana into madison so is the outlander hiding out there victory for regala it's coming down if i can get the main gate open talana and modest can help me clear out the rest of this place my blade is sharp my eyes are open any sign of the enemy icaro hasn't the courage to attack what's that whoa i guess we scared them all false alarm call it all that was the way gates open keem go down hmm huh oh up oh [Music] uh oh hang in there strike back they're there shoot them [Music] we'll stay here you make a nice target [Music] ah it's already turning to scratch my aim's as sure as the sun rises [Music] oh me [Applause] end of the line outlanders that device is gonna call a machine [Music] this one's too late so here we go between you and me this would be great come on aloy join the fight i got you covered take this ammo uh that did a lot of damage so oh foreign more animals [Music] oh you guys huh tell me all right i think that's the end of it hear that what here door's locked but that last rebel had a key on him freed by karja have we not been humiliated enough it's not their fault you were locked up in your own prison i'm looking for information about a carja soldier she might have been a prisoner here five years back her name was nessa the car jenessa was here i killed her myself vanessa i'll handle this go secure the grounds it's you isn't it nessa how let me get this straight you were nessa you were brought here as a prisoner during the red raids and then became tanakh the karja forbid women from military service i lived my life pretending ashamed of who i really was but the tanakh measure a soldier only by their strength and resolve so i took my place among them nessa retucka i've mourned you for five years why didn't you let me know you were alive i had a new life i wasn't going back not even for you a modest [Music] the way a modest talked about your time together i thought you'd still care about him it was five years ago i didn't abandon you before the battle i tried to get godaya to call off the attack but of course he didn't listen i ended up killing him then he got what he deserved i ran for the battlefield to find you but you were already gone by the time i got there i didn't know but even if i did i mourned you and then i moved on if you were brought here as a prisoner how did you become tanakh i knew it was only a matter of time before the tanakh killed me and the others who were held captive but one day one of their soldiers stopped in front of my cell asked how a woman had ended up fighting for the mad sun king as he spoke i realized he was once karja vashov i heard how he fell at the embassy he deserved a better death than that the other prisoners he condemned to death but he convinced the tanakh to let me fight for my life i won through blood and blade i became ritaka and never looked back you were willing to wear a disguise so that you could serve in the karja army do you miss being carja at all no the red raids showed me there was no honor in fighting for the karja and when my comrades and i were brought here as prisoners we knew no one would ever come for us i would have had i'd known it's better this way beneath my karja armor i found i had the blood of a tanakh so if you became tanakh how did you end up as a prisoner here again my squad was ordered to retake the rot from regala's rebels we failed considering how much regala seems to hate the karja i'm surprised her rebels let you live you're right i'd be dead if they knew but few to not remember who i once was what will you do now you've taken back the rot my squad will ensure it stays that way so this is it after everything we've been through this is goodbye it has to be my place will always be here and yours is back east i'm sorry that you've suffered you deserve better than how the last five years have treated you i'll make sure you're granted safe passage out of the lowland consider it nessa's final farewell at least now you know the truth somehow it hurts worse he must think i'm an idiot no i just think you have a lot to figure out i'll take you back east to send him after that [Music] i don't know talana i understand i'm sorry it came to this me too give me an a-lawyer moment are you all right to be honest no what's going to happen between you two i'm not sure he clearly has a lot more feelings to sort through and i won't
