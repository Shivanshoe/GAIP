what do you think let's take a look around see what we can find there you go we'll be on our way from little hope while the others are still m.i.a in the woods something up yeah there's something kind of familiar about this place these small town police stations all look the same there's got to be a phone in here someplace real nice there's got to be something we have a winner found a phone this could be our way out mine's dead [ __ ] whoa hey take it easy i'm thinking i know what's wrong please do share there's no cable plugged in i there's got to be a cable here someplace real nice keep looking [ __ ] thing i thought this was her way out yes keep on looking can you our number one priority right now is locating a cable to get this phone working [Music] what is that what do you think answer it wait let's think about this hello who is this who's on the line i can't tell but they sound in pretty bad shape this is getting way too crazy just hang up come here girl i would speak with you you cannot talk of our secret eternal damnation awaits if you do we have an understanding do we not no evil words shall leave my lips should you breathe a word or the edge of a word about the other things then i will come to you in the black of some terrible night and bring a reckoning let us begin enough time has gone begging go be with you i beseech this court and good judge wyman do not be fooled by the protestations of the accused the devil is the master of deceit all his servants feign innocence they can do little else i solemnly swear before god i am innocent of all accusations against push now amy what the hell should we do let's get the [ __ ] out of here i beg you not to abandon me why all that is holy with whom are you conversing woman even though i have seen this with my own eyes i scarcely believe it amy is lost to us even now she pleads for evil spirits to remain by her side you must help me i'll beg you she can hear us if she can then maybe others can too i would ask the court to a direct testimony a witness who saw with their own eyes the accused take part in some unspeakable satanic ritual in the woods outside of this very town reverend carver you mislead us all forgive me god judge but it is my wife who stands accused and i know her to be innocent i would not be so quick as to cast stones at others joseph not when your own condom does not bear scrutiny please hear me good judge all accusations against me are false that found it only in malice if there be darkness here among us i will shine mary mary my sister what ails you what have you done to this child you have bound an innocent girl into a pact with the devil himself the poor creature seems possessed no doubt what you're doing it's not true reverend why have you trained against me sir we will see the truth in it amy lay your hands on mary let us see what occurs if i am correct your touch will release her from this affliction it must be so if you were the one who bewitched her i don't think i can take much more of this i think it's almost over they are here among us they are here among us what more proof is needed that the devil walks among us take heed and pray the devil is here in this very room protect yourselves seek out the lord what the hell was that [ __ ] was that for real felt pretty damn real to me seriously didn't the witch trials happen centuries ago most of them over 300 years ago then how come we just saw one like i say i have no good explanation that little girl who had some kind of seizure what do you think was going on there the whole thing scared the crap out of me but that little girl was freaky my gut says her fit was a setup a scam to put that woman on trial in even bigger trouble accusations were often malicious made by someone with a grudge or by meddling liars like that little girl who took perverse pleasure in poisoning their own communities come on she's just some little kid who most likely doesn't get how big a deal the whole thing is she knows exactly how serious it is either way the woman on trial angela 2.0 she seemed like she saw us and so did some of the others a little kid just seeing us appear out of nowhere could easily believe that was witchcraft especially back then dream up all the excuses you want for that little kid i don't trust her one little bit we can't explain how we happen to see each other how do you expect some little girl from 300 years ago to wrap her head around it the woman we just saw condemned i saw her back at the intersection she was in deep [ __ ] and she knew it it's tough to watch who's that hey professor you in there come on let's go hey taylor we're in here we can't open the damn doors we can't either they must be locked let's all try to force the handle in three two one [Applause] let's try again put everything you've got into it [Applause] not exactly busting a gut there are you move over let me do it finally not exactly working like a chain gang are we find anything that could get us out of here nah big fat nothing back there just a pile of junk are you okay i'm fine why the concern shot what's bugging you we saw angela's double get tried and condemned for being a witch okay so now what uh we've already tried a few places and come up with nothing except enough weird [ __ ] to put us in therapy for life and we have to continue on into town forget about what's happened so far our best shot at finding help is in town really forget about what's happened there's some real scary [ __ ] going down in the outskirts and our plan is to stroll into the center of weirdsville just a suggestion but maybe we should figure out what the [ __ ] is going on here first we need to know what that woman is facing what's gonna happen to her next i like the idea but how would we even begin to find that out we've already been down those paths maybe the answer lies down the one path we haven't taken yet what the hell what if i'm somehow linked to that woman if she dies what happens to me i have no [ __ ] clue what is going down here but i do know that that woman is not you this fog is getting worse maybe the fog was the reason for the diversion we were never meant to make it out of here i can't see for [ __ ] oh jesus water looks black i don't want to go anywhere near it [Music] okay who's first up huh professor you keep telling us you're in charge so okay sure thing is it safe to cross don't stress the professor in me will make sure you get across no problem right we'll we'll get you over for sure huh my god what do we do we can't stay here in this year of our lord 1692 we are here present to bear witness to a just execution no amy is declared guilty of consorting with the devil and is to be drowned as a witch and sorceress let us pray in silence for us all i've done no wrong i am no witch i do not deserve death i beg you [Music] i don't know how to help you tell me what i can do please sir you must help me you must the devil is in the wind seeking to help his own he would release her from the chains isaac let us conclude our business here swiftly the will of the court must be imposed before it's too late the devil fortifies her you must bind it tightly [Music] he cannot do all this isaac send this switch back into the lap of her master lest he come for us all little hope is already lost shrouded in evil but not as you claim from witchcraft outside demons we are poisoned you will not save yourself with riddles there is no riddle the devil takes many farms you know that better than any if little hope he has hid himself under a shroud of innocent taken the form of a child by accuser while mary still does breath little heart remains beyond salvation there lies your evil reference see your very face isaac [Music] what did you see tell me i don't know how to tell you what i just saw your double was pushed into the river in chains she drowned all right i'll go first okay you two get on down here [Music] ugh what the hell is
