sign pretty tight setup you got rogue queen of night city could have been easy to achieve all this so many others failed the hell's that supposed to mean just thinking back you missed the old times at all rogue fine with where they are fine with where i am i can see that shame no one else from the atlantis had the same luck hey everybody we're close oh what gives we didn't finish yet oh yes you is sheesh what's the matter nothing your shift's done you're heading home to kick your feet up okay guess i'ma go back to work we'll have the whole place to ourselves hmm vip treatment now talk just what the hell are you insinuating that my bottle behind the bar yep been waiting there just i never knew what the [ __ ] for but i'm starting to get some good ideas about how i might use it you're wasting my time you chose a cozy life for yourself i'm just curious what it cost you we all pay a price for the choices we make i'm no exception that what you tell yourself when you're cashing corp checks that's what i tell myself when i stand over the graves of the crew from the atlantis it's what i tell myself when i look at you now well hey the past is the past that's right but that's not why you're here you want to drag me into something again and this chatter is just a prelude need to get into soccer tower and you're gonna help me do that are you serious arasaka again jesus johnny you're obsessed [ __ ] arasaka this is about v this body is dying and i'm the cancer killing it right so we know of an access point to mikoshi it's under our socket tower that's where i need to get to it's where i'll port alt into the system which is the only way v and i can part ways not okay just staying in that body it's gotten a little tight only an idiot does the same thing over and over while expecting things to work out differently you even have a plan for this you're the best fixer in town you tell me how we're gonna do this did you say we willing to miss out on this so what i dust off and load up my tsunami rejoin your crusade against arasaka bingo when don't know now and what makes you think i'd agree owe it to yourself is that so sure you can just be the queen of the ball in night city but that's not the real rogue the real rogue you buried while you climb to the top look deep i know you can find her again [ __ ] knew this would happen one day that one night by some [ __ ] miracle you'd waltz in here and tear everything down some things never change and us have we changed i don't know well what do you say we go find out will you lend me a hand shut the [ __ ] up johnny just stop talking [ __ ] christ [Laughter] every time every time never have i seen one not drunk as a pig sleep over 20 hours next time you're losing teeth think so i would like to see you try but the boss will not be happy when i break your bones mean rogue there's only one boss let's go the boss awaits see you two said your hellos excellent rogue what's this specimen doing here he's our pilot and our ride to corporal plaza today rogue you're the best of course i am your sorry ass wouldn't be here otherwise gears over there help yourself don't mind if i do grab some gear johnny don't forget what are these retro thrusters antigrams strap them to your legs and you can jump from damn near any height christ johnny i'm not your [ __ ] babysitter never mind got it okay now gonna tell me what the plan is yep jack and the shard targets the mikoshi access point in arasaka tower need to reach the lab floor hold it just long enough to do what we need to do then get out alive arasaka towers a fortress the most secure building in night city walking in through the front door just ain't an option so we'll get in through a window of our own making specifically we fly in on a militech strix tactical bomber first we rained fire on the building's air defenses from a high altitude then we breach a wall on the 76th floor jump from the av and survive the landing thanks to our anti-grafts that's right we'll land smack in the middle of a tropical rain forest contrary to popular opinion arasaka has panache at times we cut our way through the jungle to a shaft located on the tower's vertical axis the shaft runs the height of the building we use our retro thrusts again reach the bottom floor quickly we'll surprise the socks off security they'll be in disarray resistance should be minimal we hit the lab floor running reach the access point the rest will be in your hands i'll hold for applause as i said there's only one boss one queen sheesh didn't say you had a bomber we all have our secrets guess nowadays a slick red muzutani just doesn't cut it how'd you get that i'm the best fixer in town idiot enough said now focus on the plan saying we're gonna rain fire on these [ __ ] seriously i've waited too long for this don't bust out of your pants just yet if we want to survive we gotta do a lot more here comes the tricky bit we're going to knock a gerogen 0401 comsat off its orbit blood cloud satellite we're going to make history friends that'll freeze calms in nc norcal and socal should buy us three or four hours no coordination no support complete chaos you need to tell me that apart from that [ __ ] bomber you have a weaponized space shuttle got a certain acquaintance at orbital air mystery benefactor highly positioned informant i'll pay him enough to give us access to the gerujian the rest will be up to our old netrunner friend you mean alt only one i know who can rip an arisa satellite out of the sky contacts at orbital air eh you really are the queen of fixers better be grateful call them my best assets for you brew all this up while i was asleep actually i brewed it up while you were dead a finger in the comms network pie when corp conflicts start to heat up again could be worth gold because nothing stands to make you more at ease than more i'm supposed to talk to walt anyway i'll convince her don't [ __ ] this up johnny it's the one thing i can't do for you said i do it and i will so summing up we fly to our socket tower unnoticed and say hello with the welcome basket of missiles exactly then we jump in find the building's vertical axis and work our way down to the mikoshi access point yep what'd you think see just one problem there's no coming back from this you'll burn bridges to ash and dust all our sock is gonna be gunning for you yeah probably orbital air will too but as i see it they braided this whip that's gonna sting them so what do you think plans got more gaping holes than a kabuki dollhouse but [ __ ] it it's gotta work it won't be the stupidest stunt we've ever pulled rogue what just thank you thank me later there's still the matter of alt do you know how to move around cyberspace well v got some practice under his belt sure i'll manage head out back nicks will show you the ropes and you wayland heat up the strix we'll be with you soon how long you gonna be might i have time for a nap hey so you the one gonna dive right that is the plan right on hop into a suit and have a seat over there i'm finishing up for the day so you be resurfacing on your own and don't [ __ ] with my gear alt you here i told you alt cunningham is no more [Music] don't believe that some of her still in there hell you look just like her you see alt because you wish to it's a defense mechanism your explicit memory is simply creating a replacement image it's weird like having a bad dream you read my thoughts an over simplification you still deny what you are a construct a set of data i no you you know me like lines of code so why even bother talking if you know my thoughts as action precedes reaction so johnny silverhand speaks before he thinks huh that's some kind of joke only a sliver of memory from old sense of humor well this is all completely [ __ ] now i feel naked time is short netwatch could detect our local net traffic i know how we get it's beneath arasaka tower predictable holy [ __ ] you're doing it now you're reading zero four zero one poses no problem i can deactivate the satellite can you just hold on a second you will breach arasaka tower and locate the port into mikoshi this is the program that will establish the link i will send it with you on a splinter upon your opening of a back door i will be able to circumvent the data ford's security protocols and then you will be separated and mikoshi will cease to exist no fear i mean something could go wrong fear is the wrong word [Music] serious shop talk now holt this is a jailbreak for the others right the little souls will fly free yes not good enough i know there's more to it just spill it they will become part of something greater nope keep trying don't understand because it is not just one other thing i have no more time for you know what think you are right alt's gone oh for christ perfect go on [ __ ] off [ __ ] this they don't know if you can hear me but thanks for trusting me let's do this [Music] they're in escrow paper works with asukaga and finch yeah everything's fine got no reason to worry now pull over kill the engine and have a nice long look at the stars simply that you won't regret it gotta go i love you biggest rate of your life in that getup really what not catching my good side won't exactly shed many bullets but that's your problem ready rogue who was that my son wasn't expecting that you telling me you uh you got a uh private life yeah and we'll leave it at that asked if everything's ready yeah it's ready good now come on or that lunatic will take off without us i like this joint gonna miss it to the very top so wayland what'd you tell him about the job exactly only what he wanted to know his cut which while running how much for a job like this

insert yourself then search for me on the other side [Music] alt don't know if i have the wherewithal laters to figure i'll just say this now on v's behalf thanks as for me i'm sorry [Music] [Music] so so once out of nature i shall never take my bodily form from any natural thing but such a form as grecian goldsmiths make i've hammered gold and gold enameling to keep a drowsy emperor awake or set upon a golden bow to sing to lords and ladies of byzantium of what is past or passing or to come [Laughter] looks like i was right again told you i'd handle it good to see you too johnny you see any of what went down nope that's probably for the best rogue's dead smasher was there i'm sorry shouldn't be died for me not for you is my body still in one piece parked it in our soccer tower's basement

panties pain right now digital analgesia we're data streams certain sensations inputs can be blocked blah blah blah yadda yadda alt make you suffer through an exhaustive lecture imparted it instantly whatever she did say she'd destroy mikoshi just as you agreed gonna release all those poor bastards only sucked them into her own bosom make them part of herself so we at the finish line it's all in halt's hands now no what the alt i made a mistake in excluding the body as a factor dna reconfiguration has progressed too far added to aggressive invasive medications the body's immune system attacking its own neurons spit it out in human terms we will die independent of what i do this is inevitable this is imminent for [ __ ] sake old you had one job and you [ __ ] it up i could not know the situation before conducting a thorough and precise diagnosis you promised this poor little [ __ ] a new life and you lied you [ __ ] lost shut it for two seconds will you gotta think gonna be all right i said give me one [ __ ] minute oh come on there's got to be a way out of this the biochip has irreversibly changed the host organism it no longer belongs to v who is an intruder there this situation is different for you all changes were made to accommodate you hang on telling your ex to kick me out of my own body the changes are irreversible you have nothing left to lose he has everything to gain i will not interfere in your personal affairs but while johnny has full control he can do what he wishes got zero intentions of doing you wrong we made a deal i'm sticking to it i'd hope so let's just think a sec about what to do seen as how i'm doomed to die we stick to the plan i gave you i leave you stay keys to my body are yours no it's gonna be me you lying sack of [ __ ] so what do i do alt simply cross the bridge you will become a part of me as v's body and former life are restored are you [ __ ] kidding me there are no options you two-faced sack of [ __ ] you're out i'm in that was the deal okay easy i think too big a dose of silver hand wound up in my blood need to chill listen if i had to choose who to hold up with on a desert island it wouldn't be you ever hell the whole cast of little big corporates would have you beat cause you're a [ __ ] in a big way and sure plenty of others out there are more deserving of life but even so i never wish you dead just promise me one thing [ __ ] you won't forget me [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] now they say the crystal palace has the most expensive casinos the most beautiful women in some damn

never look back run away with me what would it change if i did leave with you i only got a few months left anyway it would be a few months among people you care about people who care about you unless unless that's your point you think the end could be easier if you were alone you know that's not true [Music] i know this v tomorrow i will be gone we're breaking camp we'll leave at dawn [Music] i'm dying pan am [ __ ] you think i don't know that we've talked about wait let me finish this last job it's important probably the most important job of my life and if i can get it done you will have finally proven to yourself that you're the best something everyone else knows and you will see how you're addicted to the thought no i'll prove to myself that all this city gave me or took from me that was for a reason [Music] i understand i think can you let me do this [Music] [ __ ] see you around pan am until next time somewhere someday remember you still owe me that story about the guy from carcass one who rode in your trunk oh it's a great [ __ ] story but a long one many twists and turns i'll try to find the time damn right you will till next time i will remember b always [Music] good morning v hey dale are you prepared for takeoff hang on need a minute naturally v go on they're waiting counting on you the afterlife head over there your wish is my command my don't you look tired did you have a difficult night difficult few weeks success weighing you down is that it i was under the impression you had gotten all you wanted that you'd shown the city exactly who is top dog can i help i'd very much like to help you honestly it's too late i can't be helped you've unlimited resources at your disposal after your raid on mikoshi all let the afterlife eat out of your hand i'm certain don't worry about it though if you say so mood in the city what's it like arasaka's problems continue to compound organizational disintegration its share prices collapsed public mistrust is at an all-time high i could go on secure your soul was to be a smashing success for arasaka it turned into a horrific curse they lost all resources related to the program promised the rich immortality sold them on it actually collected engrams and knowledge a bid for control for power i see in the street rumors abound that you've taken on something rather big and that one with great power and even greater funds is backing you nothing much besides arasaka is in chaos striving to restore even a semblance of order it seems you the afterlife are safe for now good to know may i ask you something v shoot you mentioned recently that only one thing matters to you to gaze upon night city from the very top i hope you're deep learning covered metaphor and you're not about to tell me to exercise caution when looking out the window sarcasm funny no i wish to ask what will come next once you've achieved your aim [Music] i'll feel fulfilled truly sure [ __ ] hope so i've chosen the optimal route we'll be arriving shortly one last thing before i shut up as requested don't worry best of luck v may your plans bear succulent fruit hey you there yes i'm talking to you are you getting what you want out of life let me guess food from a tube rusty water from the tap another murder outside your bedroom window but what if you could leave all that behind far far behind when you begin your journey to

that case you're going to need something special rogue had this little ritual before any big op she'd knock back a shot of tequila silver hands preferred asked her once if it was for luck or whatever you know what she said i said it was about remembering said that remembering johnny that way helped her focus on what was important anyways afterlife tradition i'm gonna mix you up one of our specials

already but what you plan to do today v i mean respect nothing else will ever come close take good care of yourself and good luck thanks talk to me well v mikoshi was quite the punch utko'd arasaka in fact brought you eddie's influence around town but not just that it meant positive paralysis of arasaka systems a few additional hatches opened up my people rushed in grabbed what they could so it's all systems go for the op i have confirmed the intel leaking out of arasaka the casino is currently testing a new security system and it's true they will be shutting it down briefly today i believe you'll know how to use that moment won't be disappointed pick the best merc around for the job so i've heard but i'd like it proved to me as well speaking of which nobody's ever pulled off a stunt like this where i'm from they'd say it's straight impossible they'd say you're taking too big a risk poetically speaking flying towards the sun to burn up they'd be dead wrong all of them self-confidence worthy of a legend or of someone risking it all but i sense you know what it's like to lose everything to fight for one last breath i see it in you this time tomorrow should i have the casino's client data all of it don't forget your side of the bargain oh i never forget a promise good luck right in position perfect almost to the second my turn hmm satellites are down for now just got the signal signature cloaking activated remember got one shot and one shot only yeah tell me something i don't know as soon as it starts there'll be no backing down no chance at extraction no chance of survival if anyone notices excellent but if this works you'll gain more than you ever imagined times when i had something to gain are long gone now now i got nothing to lose that's kind of grim then again who am i to judge okay here goes nothing see you down bottom over and out uh so [Music] so [Music] bye [Music] hey v what's up kid been a while since you came to see old vic i'll bet

before i come they wrote to say a death point it contained their final thoughts about life about death i have read many of them of late somewhat truly works of beauty yet i am not a samurai so i beat

it this far awareness of what's happening right now that just raunches like alt neatly packed me into an engram couldn't even tell when or how so what do you think like being a clump of ones and zeros at first the phantom pain jesus felt like my whole body was on fire realize now it's not pain at all it's just some digital simulacrum i guess alt's gonna start moving this digital psyche i am back into my flesh but got no idea if i'll survive or what i'll be if i do so we at the finish line it's all in halt's hands now no what the walt i made a mistake spit it out this could land well he never
