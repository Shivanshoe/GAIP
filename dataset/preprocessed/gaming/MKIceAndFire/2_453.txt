part of the problem let's see they've been waiting for you taking control of this fort will bring peace between your tribes the scouts have reported activity nearby that's worth looking into before you enter the fort they've positioned a storm tower near the fort that you'll use to get over the wall however you need to prop up its wheelhouse first to stabilize the situation says you don't have to knock to get inside [Music] could this thing steer itself so so much damage you don't have the key energy for that great shot [Music] stand against that [Music] itchy trigger finger oh you get used to the beasty smell i hear it's time to set the rival tribe free inflict as little damage as possible as you make your way through to their sifu hello you need to unite the tribes and save the tree of

absolutely drained [Applause] right in the face yeah the future is in your hands so take care of it [Music] that's a pyro sizzler right there just get to work on it make it frizzy [Music] nice crackle [Music] [Music] the battering bunker looks like a great way to get through the gate bet you just need to knock and it will open up that's bonkers [Music] the jagni tribe wants to become omnipresent and most importantly feared they want to vanquish the tribes as the only way they can guarantee peace is through supremacy you didn't expect it would go down this way it'll be hard to talk your way out of a fight he's not sure if you're likable enough to just give up the fort without a fight he realizes a peaceful end would be best he'll entrust the fort to you [Music] the rival sifu is defeated and the destiny of their tribe is in your hands you are free to choose their fate but not free from the consequences of your choice he'll leave it up to you to decide the fate of the rival sifu but suggests you be merciful do good and good [Music] [Music] good or bad never to be undone side by side they'll stand until order and stability is reinstituted he wants you to focus these are the new rival outposts your tribe needs to take control of [Music] he says you'll regret not being on their side the only way you'll learn their secrets wong fu and the tribe weapon now is if you defeat him and that will never happen your sifu is pleased you're one step closer to uniting the tribes it's a pity you needed to use force to get the point across what but he's still concerned about the fate of the world you can't lose this war if you get the ending wrong the effort it took to get there was in vain a proper ending however provides closure he says you've grown so much stronger than when you first met you know better than anyone that the fate of the world is still at stake you need a world where everyone is guided only by their conscience the fate of the world depends on the triumph of good the tree of life still stands and it's up to you to make sure it does so to the end [Music] it's the jagne staff [Music] [Music] take a moment to absorb the day it's a rare sight treasure it wildlife here is teetering on the brink of extinction we all are the meat eater again nothing seems to satiate his hunger the note is done for unless you intervene it's blasting [Music] so uh the night feels dangerous and exciting this place is called spurf top the fur dresser named let's see he seems glad you're developing your own fur style can't be shy about who you are when the world's about to end says the world's broken not sure if it can be fixed but it's going to be a bouncy ride either way [Music] says you've blazed a path to a place where you have the power to destroy or save everyone so which way will it be he can see you have a steadfast heart you know the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others like he does with his clippers wonders if you ever think about your place in the world whether you wear your fur short or long it's about how well your insides match your outsides right [Music] right it makes you feel more like yourself whoever that is figures we might have more styles in our futures the world still has some good time left in it knows you've been working to make things better says it's good you're working with the myriad tribe as crazy as the world is now he confesses that tribes with more fur are more his style [Music] likes how they sit still for their fur dressing thinks you're more important than whoever you're working with though you're the one who gets things done says visit has been far and a few no one seems to prioritize a hair cute these days it's barbarism at its worst he thinks everybody seems occupied with the fact the world's going under he presents himself as trim says he'll take care of you and that astrocity [Music] tells you to ask any of his happy custom first even though he realizes they won't be easy to find he's got one little problem his clipper fingers have rusted due to the contamination and without them his whole [Music] his friend juju should have a pair of clipper fingers to spare as he's mostly on the zigzagger nowadays maybe you could snag it from him [Music] he doesn't know who gave you your franken cut but he'll up style it and give you a number one pop mop in no time just fetch him the clipper fingers figures he can make your fur as delightful as your tongue light instantly vanishes dark how much light do you really need all the light i mean you could leave a little space for the dark [Music] hey nice shot [Music] you just line up the gears on that lock and it should spring open just a few that's a colorful find wow lucky you're here for a reason it's up to you to figure out what that is this is called suburbia a place to get away from the city stink [Music] cannot thank you enough nothing is as great as a surprise after the rain he thought he was ready to make you the jumble juice but his supply of fill up glasses has become a bottleneck without it he has nothing to put the juice in here so get him a fill up class and he'll start mixing the juice in the meantime he'll have it ready for you when you come back that kind of glass shouldn't be too hard to find you should be able to find one drifting about on the surf you're helping him do the world a kindness it won't soon forget the light shines on better isn't the word i would use right not better best you're the worst the worst of being the worst we're just the best jumbles happy you're here [Music] so grateful that you're building things up instead of knocking them down says they're glad you're with them understands you have things to do jumbles happy you're here will it do sometimes your mind creates an illusion where it's possible to go back in time to relive a moment in your life uh [Music] we all have things in our past we wish hadn't happened and can come to remember seeing and doing things that never happened [Music] however there's no doubt that what you remember makes your future different [Music] choose the automaton functionality you want to recall [Music] so you weren't supposed to know how to start the automaton pew pew pang but clearly you figured that out way back then like walking down a trail you're such a lockster a moon could make this a hunter's night [Music] will it do also jumble says that now he's got a fill up glass he's willing to part with a splash of his incredibly invigorating jumble juice jumble says he's got other interests than sunshine after rain he's gathered quite a mix of curiosa over the years but so the problem is it's weighing him down now that he shifted his focus to the sky he'd be happy to part with some of it he's been hauling around this stuff for too long anyways [Music] says it's whether the weather weathers well that worries him most [Music] jumble says seeing you always brightens his day [Music] we're not says talking [Music] see came out on top um [Music] cut that one in half [Applause] a monolith like that means the potato people aren't far away you got it dialed in see where that light leads [Music] supposedly mounts like that can smell fear [Music] [Music] uh uh there it is the tree of life the idea that all life is related by common descent where the twigs are existing species and those produced in the past represent the succession of the extinct the trees great branches were once budding twigs a connection between the past present and future a representation of all extinct and living species with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications we are an evolution of those that came before [Music] there's a lot on the line here [Music] [Music] ah that wood scrap seems like it would be perfect for your fans let's see beefed up it's a place well hidden it's just below the above [Music] when a story comes to you pay attention out of dates impressed you made it this far but there's still so much left to do the end of the world is still on everyone's minds you've beaten a path where you have the power to destroy or save everyone question is what you'll do with that responsibility he can sense that your heart beats steadily and acknowledges that the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others thinks it's important that you remember who you are and where you came from someone without knowledge of their history and origin is like a tree without roots it's important to stay grounded you share the same fate as the tree [Music] out of date says there's a time for everything and now there's no use thinking of the past for it's gone until think of the present because that's where you are it's time to set your priorities as the one who completes things if you continue to do good good will follow you if the world really does end there won't be anywhere to run so he's prepared for the worst something he calls the ark two sides to everything but for him it would be devastating if you were forced to use the ark to escape while the world crumbled out of date says there's no clear record of the chain of events that changed the course of history and brought the world to its knees he's found evidence on the ark records of a crisis decades of contamination that permeated the ground and broke its inner core the contamination disrupted what we now know was key energy the life force that runs through all things living and inanimate he's been told the blight affected everything at a genetic level and turned our perception of normality on its head myani it was only those that changed that avoided extinction proving that the possibility for survival and renewal was real yeah [Music] he understands you are curious about the ship at the foot of the tree he says it surfaced when the oil broke through the ground the ark predates the back in days and now after years of study of the manuals he found inside he believes he's figured the ship out the ark has room for four more and he trusts you'll apply wisdom to your compassion and choose whom to save if the world comes to end [Music] he'll keep the seats open and you are free to invite up to four others to join you in the ark in the event of a cataclysm [Music] [Music] he says he appreciates what you've done so far but unfortunately he's got urgent news from his friend goop in the southeast out of date says that even though he's unsure about your intentions he hopes you'll support goop toledreya yeah he says he'll point you in the right direction but finding goop and making sure he gets what he needs is up to you that's the sound of impending doom out of dates premonitions of imminent disaster are true the porky puff needs to be handled out of date says that goop is worried now that the southeast world eater is stepping up its activity he explains that goop is working on a goo gliding vessel in order to get to the world eater but needs help to get it done out of date suggests that you should head southeast as fast as possible and see what you can do to help [Music] he wonders what's on your mind [Music] you have other places you need to go [Music] you
