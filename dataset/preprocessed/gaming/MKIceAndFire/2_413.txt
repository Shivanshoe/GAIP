yuito going to so do you need help [Music] it must be a weak spot it should everything you've got i can hit it come on [Music] that was close thanks snobby all right we have to get out of here i know luka was right but i just wonder if nagi's okay you eat home come on we go use sas to find where it is [Music] not over yet right in the middle let me borrow this another one do you need help i'm using this endure it i'll destroy everything there's nothing i can't do i mean this is what's right huh [Music] do you think it's others ah damn it others are everywhere we'll never make it to the exit can you make it out of the hospital by yourself luca no teleporting is too dangerous in areas where there are this many others calm down if water doesn't have the data either i have to rely on my own memories for the route to the exit my memories can i even trust my own memories huh watch out i love you here we go here goes i was busy looking farther out sorry i wasn't paying attention either sorry and thanks sure thing more importantly others are coming this way let's take them on the smell is [Applause] can you do unique about it do you need help here we go i'm using this let me borrow this oh let's regroup i feel better time to use this good job [Music] everything about this place is strange yes this isn't simply an abandoned hospital you guys good [Music] [Music] come on let's regroup i need your help hey uh what i can still fight [Music] we managed to take it down is everyone okay others are gathering damn it why are there so many others are there any safe spots nearby as i've said before there's absolutely no data on this old building sorry there are others everywhere what what is this there you are major general fabuki everyone come with me we'll lose those others by following the underground highway through the ruins of lokusho city um where are we is this a safe zone safe zone what is that a blind spot in new hamuka surveillance system we call it the safe zone we'll be able to talk here freely we could talk outside of the city but we don't want to be seen by any patrolling osf members i never knew about this if you want to talk here that must mean it's something you don't want the government to know i suppose it does had i known sooner that you were going to osf hospital i might have been able to scheme better you must have known what kind of place the osf hospital was yes seems like you didn't hear anything about it they conduct power research at that hospital funded by the new himuka government they draw out stronger powers by tuning the human cerebrum i had no idea they were doing such things at my uncle's hospital oh right that hospital belongs to the ichijo family listen what i'm about to say may be hard for you to hear [Music] as a result of the cerebral research conducted there a number of byproducts were created personality rehabilitation yes they tune the brains of people who are problematic for the government pacifying them by brainwashing the government found out that nagi witnessed naomi being metamorphosed so that's why he ended up that way what but gemma kasana and i saw the same thing you were all protected under the pretense that i would be monitoring you but nagi was captured by the government before i could help him i'm sorry if only i'd been able to get a hold on the information sooner um what do you mean naomi was metamorphosed i thought she was killed in action i see naomi wasn't killed in action she turned into another are you really saying that she turned into an other nagi said something similar but is that even possible that's a byproduct of new hamuka's research as well a special material is able to turn organisms into others any organism with a brain can be turned into another wait then does that mean it was the government to turn naomi into another yes i'd love to sit here and tell you everything but staying in the city is dangerous most likely the government has already given the order to hand you over to them i want you all to go out on patrol i'll do what i can to take care of everything while you're out [Music] hold on how is it that you haven't been subjected to rehabilitation despite knowing all of this it seems like luca knew too right that's why luca wanted to prioritize escaping rather than talk to nagi it's simple i'm one of the government's dogs lucas should have heard some of this from karen if you're curious ask him yes we should go out on patrol i'll tell you what my brother told me along the way yuito can you please direct us where to go all right let's head to kikuchiba [Music] a resource reading here here i feel like we're starting to work smoothly together [Music] this place is too exposed we should go somewhere more private you're on patrol so make sure you take out those others so be careful i'm going to get stronger here we go looks like the enemy dropped something rare [Music] [Music] oh i'm one step closer to muscular physique figure it out i think there's something over there [Music] [Music] [Music] so this area should be safe enough to talk is it true that the new himuko government was transforming people into others yes it was a long time ago but fabuki's fiance alice ichijo was also metamorphosed my brother and fabuki began investigating the cause of alice's metamorphosis the case led them to find out about new himuka's personality rehabilitation metamorphosis technology and the surveillance systems of each city excuse me do you mean my aunt alice that's right she was your aunt have you heard anything no i was told she joined osf and planned to leave when she turned 20 but she was killed in the line of duty that's why my family was in such strong opposition to me being scouted but since we're legally unable to refuse hey i found the file on alice ichijo in the database she looks exactly like hanabi alice was the daughter of osf hospital's previous chairman that's why she was engaged to spring pharmaceuticals major general fabuki i think that's true it's the first i've heard this but it seems plausible if this was a plan led by the new himuko government does that mean my father knew about it oh i think he did moreover it might be better to assume that he was at the center of it all the sumiragi family has a long history in politics after all then does my brother know about it too am i the only one who was kept in the dark casane is coming 8 o'clock just hold on we can talk this over no point you'll be dead [Music] why are you trying to kill me at least tell me the reason i told you i don't want to talk i'll do everything to get serious i won't make the same mistake twice i'm going to stop kissing we should defeat them one by one let's nullify the other two and then yes [Music] i need your help [Music] [Music] time to use this is everyone okay this should [Music] careful everyone [Music] let's go pay attention do you need help [Music] why [Music] by any means thank you for your help here we go [Music] now [Music] tell me why did you kill my father and join ceyron is it because my father was involved in metamorphosis research because new himuka turned naomi into an other so you found out about it too yes that's exactly right hey kodama's coming what what is she doing here master yuito donna is here ah wait kasani oh that traitor kasana is here too that's fine it is a pleasure to meet you master yuito i'm kodama maloney i believe this is our first time meeting as well oh you're right but i'm only loyal to master yuito what oh master yurito i have a message from master fubuki he's taking care of everything so you can come back now so are you on our side kodama of course i am always on your side master yurito officially my position may be the leader of kodama platoon and major general kabuki's aid but my heart will always belong to you master yuito you could have just contacted us instead of coming all the way out here kodama maybe no one trusts you water i mean your sister went to ceyron after all shut up don't group me in with haruka and it wasn't just to deliver a message i had to give this to you too what is it your medicine that was discarded at the osf hospital oh is that okay i don't mean to offend my uncle but isn't it dangerous to take meds from the osf hospital a knobby and this goes for the rest of you as well but it's in your best interests not to talk about or criticize the hospital in suo i'm sure you know why because the government is monitoring everyone exactly well i'll be going back now see you later master yuito this ampule it's the same as the one i found in the abandoned underground subway why don't we stop by the hideout before returning to suo to go over everything we learned we won't have to worry about anyone listening there and don't worry recording conversation data through my control system isn't allowed now that i think about it major general fabuki probably prohibited recording in order to protect the osf after he learned the truth about the government yeah maybe [Music] so much has happened it feels like my brain is fried let's go over our situation first research on powers is being conducted at the old ichijo osf hospital building it's likely they progressed in the research of the brain gain the ability to turn people into others and perform personality rehabilitation yes you can't blame yourself you didn't know about any of this yes you are so kind to everyone so i think you should be kind to yourself too thank you moving on the government is well aware that we've come to know this information major general fabuki is trying to put out the fires but it would be best to consider the possibility that we will become fugitives from the government anyone on the run from the government won't survive wait there's ceyron yes worst case scenario we should consider fleeing to say ron and yuito how is your memory ben i haven't had any missing gaps in my memory recently i think if anything strange happens please let us know although concerning that medication you were prescribed it was prescribed by the osf hospital it kind of scares me yes i'm concerned as well right i think it would probably be best to avoid taking it unless your condition significantly worsens you're right i'll do that hey do you think it would be a good idea to ask my brother about this oh yeah chief sumaragi is your older brother i would advise against it the chief is with the government after all of course he is also your family but any unnecessary contact would be dangerous right now i wouldn't want to hinder major general fubuki in any way [Music] yes you're right kaito were you aware of new himuka's power experiments [Music] did dad and kaito do that to nagi damn it the only one that was left in the dark was me only me i'm sorry yuito you're the commander i shouldn't have interfered no you're always so level-headed and helpful don't be afraid to tell me what you think understood oh was that an order uh [Music] oh there you are i was beginning to think you wouldn't come i hate killing time by myself so you said you wanted to talk about tsugumi did something happen with her oh nothing like that i'm just a bit concerned i mean that girl is kind of difficult for most people what do you mean difficult she doesn't talk a lot unlike me and it takes her time to warm up to other people yeah she is pretty quiet i've known sagumi for quite a long time and we get along just fine i just worry whether she's getting along with everyone else and now she's away from me in a new team so i'm losing sleep worrying that she might be getting left out we wouldn't do that i'm sure she's getting along fine with everyone oh well if mr strait is an arrow yuito says it i guess i can trust you i kind of get the sense that he's making fun of me she's not like me she's a good girl so you take care of her i'm counting on you seriously don't worry you can count on me well that was kind of unexpected i never saw him as the type to worry about other people sure he's a joker but he's actually pretty kind that being said i should probably ask him about it yeah i think that might be best hey kagero i have something i want to ask you is that okay it's about my father actually yeah what do you want to know well you see the world thinks kasana killed him and i saw kasane holding a knife but i still can't get myself to come to terms with it do you know what actually happened sorry but i can't say anything maybe i will someday but not now please he was my father well then let's say kasane did do it i'm sure she would have had a good valid reason for doing so fine but i want to know that reason and then what what are you gonna do it's not something you can forgive just because you know why well yeah but let's just forget all that for now why don't we talk about something nicer something nicer he's just trying to change the subject but i know he knows something anyway let me be straight are there any girls in the osf you like anyone that you've had your eye on what where did that come from don't be shy tell old cogaro how you really feel your childhood friend hanabi or the cool kasane are you all about a cute face or could it be the magnanimous kyoka huh no i mean i never um i guess i never really thought about it okay hold up so you're serious you're not just being shy life can be really boring without a little desire kid what about you you did seem pretty interested in sagumi don't be an idiot i don't think of sagumi like that she and i are best friends we understand each other what we have is a connection of the souls it's deeper than just a man and a woman so you're almost like family i understand that kind of thing better than talking about what my type is [Music] you really are lame and boring if you don't loosen up you might just end up suffocating yourself well i've never really had any problems before all right i got it sir kagero will teach you how to have some real fun uh no i'm fine i am a very strict teacher it's probably best you bring an energy drink next time we meet see ya but i said i didn't want to and right when i was beginning to think he might take things seriously turns out he really is just a joker first [Music] damn kassani what is she even thinking ever since i met her she's been hard to figure out it's also weird that she looks like the person who saved me when i was young even talking to her face to face it kind of feels like we're not on the same page but she doesn't seem like she'd kill someone for no reason i can't be sure but i feel like she wouldn't if she doesn't want to tell me anything then i just have to figure out the truth on my [Music] and own were hurt by the government and karen wants to take it down what's wrong emma oh sorry i was just thinking about what i can do or what i should do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is very nice luca can i ask you something yes i will answer if i can oh is it about my brother uh you mean former major general karen no not that i wanted to ask you about yourself we're fighting together now so i wanted to know more about you ah about me did i say something wrong no i was merely surprised people mostly ask about my brother so i don't usually talk about myself your brother is karen after all yes for better or worse most people notice him i am frequently in his shadow so i tend to assume people want to talk about him i apologize don't worry about it i kind of understand how you feel my older brother isn't like former major general karen but he's known for always being an elite and i'm me so people are always comparing us chief kaito true he must be very capable to become chief of the osf at such a young age it's hard having a brother that's good at everything it makes it seem like you're bad at everything i guess it's not like that for you i mean you're a septetrion the fact that you're just as good if not better than your brother is known among both the military and civilians regardless of what the military or civilians think of me i'm no match for my brother in a lot of ways so you wanted to know about me what exactly did you have in mind yeah right uh what are your hobbies this is like an old-fashioned arranged marriage well my hobby is exercising despite my looks i enjoy honing my body i created my own program a long time ago and i exercise every day wow exercise he doesn't look like he works out he's skinny and small did you just think he doesn't look like he works out what no i didn't please be honest i won't be angry ugh yeah i did think that i didn't know you could read minds as well as teleport it was written all over your face you're not very good at lying good to know well i understand why you would think that it is very difficult for me to build muscle however by continuing i am seeing gradual results it is true that persistence pays off you're a hard worker yes but i enjoy exercising too the more work you put into your muscles the more results you will see you should try working out from the looks of you i think you'd see good results if you follow the training program i created you'll be ripped in six months huh ripped tell me if there's an area you would like to train if you want washboard abs or shoulders like melons melons i don't want to get that big uh i'll let you know later come to me anytime [Music] do you so are you sure [Music] gemma want to go into town with me if you're free is something going on we talked about checking out trends remember i looked up a lot of interesting places oh that okay i did promise you after all don't worry i'm sure you'll find something you like i hope so [Music] are you all right give me a little time to gather my thoughts that was a lot to take in i dragged him all over the place to show him the latest trends but maybe i went a little overboard let's see we've checked out all the new trendy spots was there one that caught your interest what was that last one i got mobbed by a herd of giant cats inside a room ah the vr cat cafe that was pretty crazy it's apparently very popular with girls for their soothing effects that was supposed to be soothing the youngsters these days find being buried and giant cats soothing it was more like a nightmare and before that one we were trapped inside a tiny room and forced to do confusing puzzles right the escape room i thought that was pretty fun solving the riddles with vision well i'm glad you enjoyed it at least which means you didn't sorry i should have researched better no i'm sorry to be complaining so much it's not your fault i just don't know how to enjoy them i had no idea that amusement had changed so much this is much different from the era i'm familiar with to be honest i can't keep up i see i'm sorry maybe we can grab something to eat to salvage the day all right but what to eat i don't really eat here that often they have a lot of different kinds of dishes here what do you usually like to eat hmm i'm not really very particular about my food i guess i like gyoza if i had to choose gyoza oh they have some interesting looking gyoza here a new and popular dish the chef recommends that's so i don't really have a good feeling about it but we came here to check out what's trending among the young people after all you don't need to force yourself it's okay i've made up my mind let's do what we came here to do thank you for waiting here's our restaurant special variety gyoza platter please use any combination of these 10 sauces enjoy but what is this green yellow red black are these supposed to be gyoza [Music] [Laughter] seems like these are the restaurants original gyoza apparently they all have different fillings the shapes are just as strange as their colors i see a round one a square one and this one has spikes is this what gyozas have come to in this day and age i can't believe how much the food i once knew has changed hmm well they look weird but they actually taste really good why don't you try one eat this i'm not thrilled about it but i can't stand here and waste food all right hmm you're right this doesn't taste bad it's not what i'm familiar with but it's interesting i'm glad you like it yeah they look weird but you can't know until you eat them maybe it was too wary because they seem strange pretty delicious if you can appreciate these that means you learned how to enjoy one of the latest food trends hmm just because these gyozas happen to taste good doesn't mean i've learned to adapt to this age i think your ability to appreciate them is important that you were able to get past the way they look you may have a point at the end of the day people still enjoy the same types of things even if those things may have changed yeah exactly i may have failed choosing good spots for you today but i had fun checking them out together i wasn't able to enjoy the newest trends but i did have fun walking around the city i felt behind the times every time i experienced something new time may pass but our true nature remains constant just that our perspectives may have changed [Music] that hit the spot thank you for the meal you're finished eating already he must have really liked those this might be my new favorite food i guess trying new things isn't so bad well let's do this again sometime that's fine with me but please no more of that cat cafe i don't dislike cats but it's unsettling when they're that large sorry about that okay we won't go there again it seems part of it was a little too much for him but i'm glad he ended up enjoying himself overall [Music] i'm stating the obvious but you're young well i'm younger than you i know i was young once too i just can't really remember it you should cherish this time while you have [Music] it i think i'm beginning to learn who you are as a person i feel like i've learned about you too [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] i've been thinking about this too much my brain is going numb yuito wake up watch her who's on the line sorry i only meant to take a little break but it looks like i fell asleep so water what's up is the fact that we snuck into the old osf hospital going to be an issue no major general fubuki was able to take care of that for us so that's not a problem anymore it might not be a big deal but i thought i should let you know about the hole in kunan highway now that you mention it there was something strange in the sky above kunat highway i guess you could call it a hole so much happened after that i'd forgotten about it so what was it the government is calling it the count gate a survey team took a look but aside from the extremely localized gravitational anomaly they don't know anything about it it's just that it has similar characteristics to a black hole so that area has been deemed off limits gate nothing could be seen on the other side it was unsettling you might not go there but i figured it's better to know about it than not that's true thanks for telling me about it if you learn anything more please let me know as you wish oh i almost forgot ueto platoon's next orders are to stay on standby so you can hang around the hideout a little while longer really then i think we should do just that yes that is a good idea knowing fabuki i'm sure he arranged all of this so i think it's best to comply mind if i come in major general fubuki how did you find this place i told him i thought it would be safer to talk here in the hideout rather than meet in the safe zone every time thank you luca i managed to sneak past their surveillance so we should be fine for a little while they started monitoring you i told you before that i was a government dog but i don't have to be a dog anymore now the karin's gone what do you mean karen's personality didn't make him popular with the government the top brass has been targeting him for elimination or personality rehabilitation for some time now that's why i took on the role of being the government's puppet directing the osf in karin's place so does he he doesn't know that i had to become his monitor in order to protect him from the government besides even if i told him he'd probably just tell me to stay out of it to be honest i'm a little relieved i don't have to be the government's yes man anymore government surveillance will be stretched then after ceyron's uprising i don't plan on missing this opportunity i should be able to bring change to this country by taking a different path from karen different path what are you planning on doing this country is aggressively pursuing power research through illegal human experimentations i have no idea why they can get away with it because the government has complete control over information even the media is under the government's monitoring and influence i want to find out why they would do this and free this country from its corrupt system karen joined forces with ceyron and rebelled against the state to do the same however i feel that collapsing the government system from the inside is the fastest way to results my brother is trying to change this country from the outside while you're trying to change it from within yes feigning loyalty allows us opportunities to learn valuable information we should be able to find out what the government is hiding through the city computer arahobaki please let me help you i want to know what my father has done and what my brother is hiding yuito you are the commander of this platoon and a commander's number one responsibility is to their platoon members if you attempt to pursue these government secrets it will undoubtedly put your platoon members in danger are you fully aware of that then please remove me from command i can't do that because for better or worse there are many eyes on you there's also the fact that your post was specifically ordered by chief kaito sumaragi well if we all agree with what commander yuito is doing then it doesn't matter gemma either way my time with the osf is drawing to an end i'm getting too old but before i leave i want to uncover the truth i want to know why that happened to naomi and why nagi received personality rehabilitation i agree with gemma if you're going to try to uncover the government's secrets then i would like to help i was also subjected to this country's human experiments what do you mean my brother karen and i received power enhancement treatments i had no idea if huey till can't be removed from the platoon then you can remove the platoon members instead any member who doesn't want to take part in this can simply be assigned to a different platoon fine i can't very well turn down your help now however reorganizing your platoon requires paperwork so i will issue an official deployment order in the meantime please gather intel around the ceyron area i've heard osf deserters are appearing around mizuhogawa former osf members sympathetic to ceyron's cause could be up to something while you're investigating i will take the steps necessary to reassign hanabi and tsugumi to a different platoon what oh okay get to it then [Music] i'll stay in the platoon as the operator i feel the same as you and gemma i'll help you stop the government from doing whatever they want thanks wanderer [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] a resource reading you're here there's a chance that saron osf patrols might show up beyond this point let's keep our eyes open were you serious about what you said back at the hideout about helping major general fubuki right because wouldn't that mean going against your brother and your late father i'm staying in this platoon what sagumi what happened to naomi was terrible and if the government had something to do with it then i won't let them get away with it hold on incoming others from the front hanabi tsugumi we'll talk later for now let's clean up the others yeah you're right now died leave it to me [Music] use this let me borrow this successfully attack now don't here we another go i'm going to get stronger are there any more others i'm not reading any are you okay huh yeah i didn't take too much damage in that fight what are you talking about you suddenly said your head hurt and stopped dead in your tracks huh did you black out again do you remember what we were talking about hanabi asked me if i was really going to help major general fubuki and then sugumi said she was going to stay in the platoon and after that after that we got attacked by others so we obviously didn't talk about anything right you don't remember luca and gemma's stories what did they talk about about my aging and the experiments luca was subjected to sorry i don't remember any of that did you really talk about that yuito i was listening so i can verify i'm not seeing any abnormalities to your status so maybe it's just mental exhaustion like the doctor said the more you use your power the more you tax your brain it might be better to avoid fights right now i can't do that we have our assignment [Music] are you really okay a snake boat ginger huh what flax pig table slug what none of the words are matching what i'm thinking apple home child i see an abnormality in his cranium what's going on his speech is impaired his brain must have experienced a great amount of stress well what can we do we have the medication the hospital provided but that ampule seems fishy it looks exactly like the ampoules we found at the abandoned subway everyone be careful you have another closing in on you swimming couldn't be worse stay here and rescue it we'll handle the others damn it my head feels like it's going to split in two i have to fight come on can't you use your power this isn't good i can't use my power at all i won't even be able to fight what can we do is there some way to cure him do i drink it yuito no time to be squeamish that other's gonna kill me if i don't take this i have to you ito did he drink the medication sugumi i'm looking now oh the abnormality in his cranium is starting to disappear this medication is really working uh my head is starting to hurt a lot less yuito i can understand what you're saying now can you fight yeah i'm good to go let's take them out i can i can do this do you need help [Music] i'm not picking up any abnormalities on my end how are you feeling you ito i feel fine now i know i had you worried but i'm glad i took it honestly i wasn't going to be any help in that condition that makes sense and i'm not seeing any signs of side effects either perhaps there was no need to worry about the medication after all well it smelled weird and tasted really bad are we going to continue on our assignment shouldn't we go back to the hideout and rest a little bit i'm fine my powers are working normally again i'll let you know if something feels off let's keep going copy that but please don't push yourself too hard promise me okay i promise [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] i need your help i can hit it leave it to me here we go [Music] [Music] the resource reading is close should we get it need your help some help how about we use them in battle they might come in handy if you eat them at the right time [Applause] it's a big here we go [Music] you've got i hit the outer shell everything there's nothing i can do [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] i can still fight nice [Applause] now die don't forget here we go [Music] [Music] wait there's something up ahead the extinction belt is thick above that area so i can't detect anything from my end any other information i think they're trucks two of them they're moving towards ceyron [Music] what is it i thought i just saw something inside the truck bed although it was probably my imagination okay i managed to tap into a nearby surveillance camera feed those are osf transport vehicles enemy or ally uito platoon is the only osf team deployed near mizuhogawa then i guess that means there's ceyron's osf team i see two individuals heading towards us it looks like kagura and cuca of course they're invisible be careful i'm not picking them up at all all right right here they come right take that too late i wonder why kyoka and kaguro attacked us i thought that because sonic was the one after you each other is it because they're on a side for some other reasons don't do it your power is the absolute worst to go against i wonder if that's why we're such good [Music] that's the friends i don't want to do this yeah it's too bad you guys good use this let me borrow this here we go [Music] here we go they're stronger than anticipated let's go we did what we needed to where kyouka and kaguro guarding this area could it have to do with the transport vehicle they were clearly stalling for time i'll try to follow them could you send me their tracking data i can't there are so many coguros in kyokas they're all going in different directions that's kyoka's duplication power they're attempting to confuse us i'm sorry it's going to take time to identify the real pair i also lost sight of the transport vehicles i hate losing it was a diversion to hide the transport vehicle's destination from tsukumi which direction were the vehicles going the last time you saw them i think towards say run they must have been carrying something important if they made sure we didn't follow we might be able to find out some key information give me some time i'll see what i can find out with tsugumi's information [Music] there's a place i want to check out but it's in a different direction from sayron it looks like the duplicates are all avoiding this area i can't be sure but it seems suspicious nice catch water okay we'll go check it out what is this place there's nobody here hey i see the transport vehicles then this must be it we're pretty far from the city do you think this is still seyran's facility i can't seem to find any information on it at all which only makes it more suspicious looks like they haven't noticed us yet but i do feel a strange presence here i can't really put it into words either i will go check the vehicle tsugumi watcharoo please cover me hey yuito are you remembering things okay what about your speech any headaches i'm okay for now no need to worry so much you weren't making sense it's natural for her to feel worried don't push yourself too hard you've always had health problems ever since you were little that's right you did
