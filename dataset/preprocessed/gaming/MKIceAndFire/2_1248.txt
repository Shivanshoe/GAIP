the nastiest sort sack and this year will be no different murder mayhem and fun are all just a big part of any gang kibo and the genius man cat has cooked up an exciting list of never-before-seen events that promise to be even deadlier than anything we've ever seen below hey worse than the grizzly bear rodeo from Genki before there is absolutely no doubt about it wow I'm actually salivating oh my goodness and as an added bonus Bobby we've just learned that the leader of the 3rd Street Saints will be taking part in today's festivities I think they can keep the winning streak going huh we're about to find out the games are gonna begin so let's get down there when I say down we move down to the action [Music] here we are getting fans graded by an angry driver putting her own spin on the classic super ethical reality climax that's right and I hear there's in the deepest darkest corners of the jungle lives a great warrior protected by fierce traps and mascot bodyguards she whoa hold on Mara Tammy what are you doing reading the script angry tiger head through the threats of shark-infested waters so beware all who enter the jungle that was entertaining thanks Tammy you're welcome that amazing new addition to the wheelhouse looks like those mascots better hope they don't fall in [Music] first of action magic contestant [Applause] how's things behind the scenes one of the mascot trainers and he expressed his apprehension of the new format created by angry tiger these mascots have been coming to Genki Bowl for years what has them so worked up with this match and from the streets up Steelport they're more used to the urban jungle than the actual now they find themselves on unfamiliar ground it's just a set dressing reports of malaria yellow fever and gangrene have been pouring in over the last few days putting several up the mascots in the hospital for treatment I call shenanigans on this sack when a contestant is definitely a firearm as the leader of the saints engage people this year they're just looking for a way to get out before facing their impending death oh I have to agree Bobby you know it looks like fear is getting the better of them or being fed to the Sharks this is true [Music] and glad car think I found a new place [ __ ] you were supposed to be looking for Lauren not going hunting see that's the beauty of this place it's owned by the Morningstar I'm just the Morningstar I have a penthouse downtown where they're throwing some a big party for their global context and their real estate agent will be there real funny I was gonna say
