in the hospital someone has to keep an eye on the kids when joss visits him relax don't need to explain right so you gonna stop by how could i say no right great see you at joss's sounds preem pretty young looking for a ripper that a problem depends not if you experience doesn't match your years i worked 10 years in an r d lab at more technologies i hope that eases your nerves mind if i ask why you left i got a feeling more tech doesn't skimp out on its engineers sure the pay was good but i couldn't sleep more as you might know specializes in deep tissue integration titanium skulls spine replacements it's difficult work it takes time before a new implant becomes viable it's implementation repeatable time and lives this hmm look no don't do this do i know foreign so started to think you wouldn't show shouldn't have to be honest why not normally only work with fixers clients that avoid him tend to be bad news i just care about my privacy huh and why's that if i might ask this is why [ __ ] me it's you it's me lizzy wizzy sit please let's talk okay so what's this about i think you can guess i'm in trouble what kind good question been a rough year creative block can't even say the last time i made anything worth listening to and to make things worse i fell in love it's not the worst thing in the world it is to me i have something to say and that it's a distraction i need to focus on my art so we talking a man a woman oh [ __ ] these hands sometimes seems like i just brushed something in sparks fly anyway a man his name's liam liam northam been together a few months but i think he's cheating on me okay why the suspicion ah it's so cliched it's embarrassing whispered phone calls in the bathroom strange receipts secret meetings in the middle of the night any specific event come to mind my mind that's that's a touchy subject why don't know each other well enough for that v you talk to him at all tell him to his face you're adorable imagine this we're never alone not really always surrounded by assistance pr reps makeup artists i stopped smiling at him for one millisecond it'll be all over every scream sheet in this town understood no you don't understand not until you've lived it millions of eyes trained on you constantly it can be beautiful and terrifying liam northam no don't know tell me about him 40-ish sensitive guy who never wanted for anything you know the type heard they exist how'd you meet he's my manager know i know how it sounds i never meant to he's not even my type but but your body can be chrome but the heart never changes it wants what it wants so what's my role here what do you want proof and then i'll end things for good liam goes to riot all the time i think he meets someone there i want to know who you'll find out for me not so fast the scratch you'll get it sure hope so question is how much god how mundane no idea scads and scabs of scratch you happy you know for us mere mortals the mundane matters sometimes means the difference between life and death don't lecture me you want the job or not can count on me perfect remember i want specifics details recordings are picks if you can sure keep it in mind good now go is you want me to break your face huh hmm you look okay go in no messing around hmm you look okay go in i'm looking for a guy name's liam liam northam you know where i could find him no you can [ __ ] off merc i ain't talking oh so you know liam you do time together share a bunk smoke blunts in the back stairs no of course not he's a rich gannock [ __ ] typical suit doesn't even see peeps like you or me or if he does it's just a spit on us so why are you taking his side why make this harder for me cause it's my job what they [ __ ] pay me to do pay you to keep the peace and i'm an easy peace loving chum in and out nobody will even see me and well it's important check the vip room usually sits in there right let's see what's here champagne nice surprise uh considered a token of my gratitude i know you don't often agree to use the relic but well you don't usually make an engram of a living person either ah come on arasaka has taken a keen interest in lizzi's career be ashamed if it ended prematurely a backup copy seems to be the most sensible solution how about that once you made the backup can you tweak it to remove undesirable traits because lizzy ever since her conversion she she hasn't been herself i'm afraid that's impossible engram saved in the secure your soul program cannot be edited but how significant would these edits be significant sometimes sometimes i don't even recognize her other times never mind let's have a drink to our partnership oh [ __ ] you heard what i just heard right relic they want to do her like they did me not exactly they wiped you here they just want to make a backup a backup v we're talking about a person not your vacay snaps guy didn't even ask he's just going behind her back he's got no right to do it nobody has that right especially without her no one [ __ ] how do i even tell her don't have to camera in there where there's a cam there's footage so hello v what's up got some intel on liam and is it what i thought no worse lizzy much much worse what do you mean listen don't know the deets but liam he he wants your engram wants to copy you what but why he said he said he's afraid for you and of you no no i don't believe it you hear me not a single word you're lying got the data to prove it here listen for yourself no no it's no [ __ ] foreign you're in luck too soon for a break right so where was i nice weather today huh i think it was here everything flows oh hey hi hey how's it going over here not coming not really my jam picnics but you have fun spinning a new song anyway rather focus on that glad you're here i need your help cooking what's on the menu jambalaya come on you can stir the meat um soy meat okay you know maybe joss would be more help just did her bit just grab the damn spoon and start stirring this an ancient ward family secret uh-huh onions paprika thyme just need to mince some celery and garlic but you stir please stir i'm stirring i'm stirring that my socks you've never had better jambalaya honestly i thought you were kidding about the cook-off or the jaws that sweat away in the kitchen wow oh josh doesn't know the first thing about cooking actually i like to torture foodstuffs haven't had many opportunities lately how's uh randy holding up he's looking for his old self physically though it'll be a long road before he's back to falafel and uh mentally that was some experience what harris did to him [ __ ] as this might sound might have helped the kid could be wrong but feels like a clean break for him don't mean to spoil a nice day but i gotta ask what about peter pan you're asking if i killed him we'll talk later okay sure no pressure it's just i uh you know i know all right i think you've stirred enough mind grabbing the rice from the kitchen yes sir no randy's always been that way but i'm sure this didn't help none you know his father was a difficult man too that's exactly what he told him but he always got the same speech back nobody cares about these kids who don't exactly fit the mold in those words yeah i wanted to tear my hair out every time i heard him and when can i visit again that's great because i really want to bring him something he loves music so sorry no how you doing joss i'll call you back later there's maddie nice tomatoes in next now you can toss in the rice rice is in okay now this has to bubble and brew patio grab a chair and uh beer or something else it's nice out here yeah seems all good like nothing bad ever happened tell me now about harris i paid him a visit at the hospital he's still in a coma yep and a strange slumber between life and death an empty shell in a hospital bed when shot to the head quick and clean i had the same thought it would be so easy i pressed the gun to his head and remembered something river oh my parents died now sure you want to hear this what happened old man had a farm like harris was dead but when business took a turn well my parents managed to open a small grocery we lived on the floor above a loud noise woke us one night they wanted cash register was empty so they stormed upstairs forced us all to kneel and demanded my dad tell him where he hid the money river you don't got to go on heard sob stories enough no just this is tough i can tell you really don't need to rehash it now okay yeah you're probably right just harris what did you do had the gun to his head and i've ended a few lives in my time but never like that never an execution slipped out of the hospital quick told myself the case was closed that's good but what now you're not going back to the pd pi has a nice ring to it who knows uncle river you said you'd play with us you promised all right all right let's go we join us what are we gonna play uncle river you'll see we're
