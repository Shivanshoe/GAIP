[Music] sorry babe i'm an ambitious girl you're just a small time liberty city is in shock today as the police and emergency services deal with the aftermath of a devastating attack on a police convoy this morning as yet no details have been released about the prisoners being transferred in the convoy and no group has claimed responsibility the convoy left police headquarters early this morning for a routine transfer of felons to liberty penitentiary the attack took place on the callahan bridge leaving few witnesses and the bridge itself severely damaged some of the convicts are thought to have perished in the explosion that followed the initial attack revelations as to the professionalism of the attack struck police hours afterward when identification of the missing felons were further hampered by an attack by computer hackers on police headquartered databases with the porter tunnel project falling behind schedule this disaster leaves portland isolated from the rest of the city

money around than he's earning he ain't pimping or pushing so he must be talking he usually gets a taxi home after work so follow him and if he's ratting us out kill him here comes our little friend mr big mouth himself were you followed you know what goes on here it's our little secret no no i wasn't followed you got my stuff here's your spank squealer now talk okay so the leones are fighting wars on two fronts they're in the turf war with the triads with no sign of either side giving up meanwhile joey leone has stirred up some bad blood with the farellis every day they're losing men and influence in the city salvatore is becoming dangerous and paranoid he expects everybody and everything and with loyalty like yours what has he possibly got to worry about beautiful just beautiful all right just the guy i need to talk to all right there's a car stuffed with a stiff at the cafe near callahan point one of the pharrellis thought he was a wise guy so he got what he had coming to him take the corpse to the crusher in harwood alright yes oh it's you tony ain't here but he left one of his sugary love letters for we're at war the triads have a fish factory as a front most of their business goes down at the fish market in chinatown the laundry still owes us protection they reckon the triads are protecting them now so i say we exact a fitting punishment take those boys over and whack the triad warlords hell if you get a chance pop some of their soldiers too [Music] what a ride she's gonna be huh all right listen get some wheels to the safe house at st marks and pick up a few friends of mine they're hitting the bank and they need a driver i gave my word that you were the man so don't screw this up get them to the bank before five o'clock not a minute after get us to the bank on the main drag keep the engine running we'll be in and out in no time get us out of here okay i've had enough of this we're gonna finish the triads and liberty once and for all eight balls rigged a dust cart with a bomb it's on a timer so if you mess up there'll be no evidence go and pick up the dust card careful eight ball says it's real sensitive and the slightest bump could set that thing off their fish factory will open its gates for a dust cart so you can drive right in park up between the gas canisters and get the hell out of there i want it to rain mackerel we're talking real biblical here nothing low budget painful we should take these colombian bastards out but while we're at war with the triads we ain't strong enough the cartel has got bottomless funds from pushing that spank crap if we make an open attack on them they'll wipe the floor with us they must be making spank on that big boat that curley led you to so we got to use our heads or rather one head your head i'm asking you to destroy that spank factory as a personal favorite to me salvatore leone if you do this for me you will be a made man anything you want go and see eight ball you'll need his expertise to blow up that boat yo my man salvatore phoned the head with a job like this is gonna need a lot of fireworks i need a hundred thousand dollars to cover expenses but you know with me you get a lot of bang for your buck come back brother when you have the money okay let's do this thing i can set this baby to detonate but i still can't use a piece with these hands here this rifle should help you pop some heads get a good vantage point then i'll head in when you fire the first shot so [Music] it's my favorite cleaner i'm proud of you my boy you kicked the  out of those grease balls i just got one little job for you before we can all celebrate there's a car on the block from luigi's club the inside is covered in brains we had to help some guy make up his mind and it proved a little messy take it to the crusher before the cops find it listen salvatore thinks that we're going behind his back so he was offering you to the cartel in order to make a deal i couldn't let him do that i mean the worst thing is it's all my fault because i told him we were an item and don't ask me why i don't know look you're a mark man on the mafia turban i've got to get out of here too i've seen too much killing too much blood i this is a friend of mine okay she's an old friend it's so good she's someone we could trust come on enough of the speeches we better get out of here before we get more hysterical italians wanting less friendly reunions asuka and i are gonna have to talk uh why don't you go cruise around you'll need a place to lie low there's a warehouse at the edge of belleville that should suit your needs come back here to my condo when you're ready and you and me can have a little chat we have certain issues to clear up before we continue any form of relationship business or otherwise let's lay our cards on the table i am yakuza and i know you worked for salvatore leone's family i can give you work with our organization but first you must prove to me that your ties with the mafia are truly broken salvator leone will be leaving luigi's in about three hours time make sure he doesn't reach his club alive meanwhile maria and i will catch up on old times oh asuka you've got a massager that's not a massager salvatore's death comes as pleasurable news you're an efficient killer i like that in a man ah this is my brother kenji asuka has a little job for you but when you're done drop by my casino and we can talk just like kenji always trying to play with my toys my police source indicates that the fbi has mounted a surveillance operation at key locations around the city it is too late to contact anyone and avoid incrimination take out these spying cups but be careful they're bound to have backup my sister speaks highly of you though i'm yet to be convinced that a gaijin can offer anything but disappointment perhaps you could help deal with the situation that has me at a disadvantage of course failure has its own disgrace ayakuzakanbu is in custody awaiting transfer for trial he is a valued member of the family break him out of custody and get him to the dojo at bedford point all units it is impossible to overestimate the importance of etiquette in this line of work to my eternal shame a man once did me a favor and i've never had the opportunity to repay his kindness the man's weakness is mother cards and he has requested that we acquire him certain models for his collection needless to say we must give him the cause as a gift to repay the debt that i owe him you must obtain the cars on this list and deliver them to a garage behind the car park in newport my honor demands it a reporter has been nosing around marie and i have taken a little holiday together until you can get rid of this perverted voyeur he's probably out in the bay as you read this steal a police boat and sink his career it's my handsome handyman maria's all tied up at the moment but i'll tell her you call you know i know i've been a naughty girl but i really need to pee okay it's time you met our man inside the lpd here's a payment for the last little job he did for us he is understandably cautious get to the pay phone in torrington as quick as you can and await his instructions meet me in the toilet block in the park you must be azuka's new era boy you got the money is it all here i know what you're thinking another bent cop well it's a bad world just because i lost a few partners those suckers from internal affairs have started sniffing around reckon they can smell me well this city is one big open sewer but i'm gonna need some non-union help and if you're interested you know where to find me maria and i have gone shopping our source in the police has informed us that one of our drivers is a strangely animated undercover cop he's more or less useless out of his car so we've tagged it with a tracer make him bleed when trouble looms the fool turns us back while the wise man faces it down the colombian cartel have ignored repeated requests to leave our interest in liberty well alone now they are negotiating terms with the jamaicans in order to humiliate us further they are finalizing a deal across town take one of my men steal a yachty car and go pay your respects to the colombians our honor demands that you leave no one alive so you guys will drop man to be truly strong it is important that you never sell weakness the business is fortunate enough to have our protection settle their accounts today go and collect the money immediately so we can enter it into the casino accounts you how fitting you should choose this moment to sow your worthless faith it would appear your attempts to dissuade the jamaicans from becoming bedfellows with the cartel were wholly inadequate yadi pushes line liberty's streets selling packets of spank like they were selling hot dogs those cartel pigs are laughing at us at me i will give you one last chance to prove my sister's faith in you to be well-founded run these scumbags into the ground and wash your shame in rivers of our enemy's blood that's scumbag mccaffrey he took more bribes than anyone he thinks he's going to get an honorable discharge if he turns dead evidence he just squealed he's under arm protection in which that property down in newport some apartment behind a car park touch that place that's at flusha martin you hunt him down make sure he never talks to nobody newport hey chick over here an old army buddy of mine runs a business in rockford we saw action in nicaragua back when the country knew what it was doing anyway some cartel scum roughed him up yesterday said they'd be back for some of his stock today he's going to need backup and in return he'll give you a knockdown rates on any hardware you buy i'd go myself but the old sciatica is playing up so good luck great phone to head but i thought there'd be more of you can't believe those yellow belly bastards left me without proper cover again well three arms are better than one so grab whatever you need those columbians will be here any minute [Music] maybe i still have my arm if you need any firepower just drop by and take what you need from the lockers leave the cash under the bench now get out of here i'll handle the cops i know a real important man in town a soft touch with uh shall we say exotic tastes and the money to indulge them he's involved in a legal matter and the prosecution has some rather embarrassing photos of him at a morgue party or something the evidence is being driven across town you are going to have to ram that car and collect each little bit of evidence as it falls out when you've got it all leave it in the car and torch it we're both gonna do pretty well out of this kids um i think my partner's a rat we gotta shut him out permanently he goes fishing out of his boat near the lighthouse on portland rock most nights steal a police boat make sure his backstabbing plans are sucked i want him sleeping with the fishes not eating them you useless bathroom you're totally messed up my ass is on the line and you can't even kill a goddamn fly i paid you good money to kill that witness and he ain't dead and today he's going to make a federal deposition he's being moved any second now from the carson general hospital up in rockford if he squeals i squeal ah [Music] [Applause] all right first of all let me thank you for dealing with that personal matter people will read something into anything these days experience has taught me that a man like you can be very loyal for the right price but groups of men get greedy a valued resource an old oriental gentleman i know has been kept hostage by some south americans in espatria they're trying to extort additional funds from me but i don't believe in renegotiation a deal is a deal so they'll not see a penny from me go and rescue my friend do whatever it takes there's no problem to kill you hey nothing drives down real estate prices like a good old-fashioned gang war apart from an outbreak of plague but that might be going too far in this case i've noticed the yakuza and the colombians are far from friends let's capitalize on this business opportunity i want you to kill the yakuza wakagashita kenji kassan kenji is attending a meeting at the top of the multi-story car park in newport get a cartel gang car and eliminate him the yakuza
