[Music] hello friends have you ever gazed up into the night sky and wondered at the possibility of life on other planets what marvelous beings might exist out there hands extended in friendship awaiting the moment when we humans take our first tentative steps into space what tales will be told of that glorious day when we are first contacted by our brothers from beyond the stars [Music] five all systems go general four come on baby show us what you got three what the hell two what in the blue blazes is that one no wait stop the countdown [Music] ah incompetent fool i should never have sent you what's shakin pox you look a little what's the word constipated let's just say i hope you turn out to be less of an evolutionary dead end than your predecessor you lost me shall i tell you a secret few of our people know this but the dna patterns in our cloning banks are becoming more and more degraded with each new clone that's bad right only if we want to retain our immortality through cloning of course it's bad i sent crypto 136 in search of a planet we visited many eons ago a planet seeded with pure furon dna but i lost contact let me get this straight you sent me him crypto136 to a hostile planet and he's disappeared maybe captured maybe even being tortured as we speak well i wouldn't jump to any conclusion i bet you wouldn't let me tell you something pox you're a smart cookie but there's a time for thought and there's a time for action and this is one of those times which the second one perhaps you're right one three seven of course i'm right you kidding me a cryptosporidium captured by a bunch of monkeys we gotta go in we gotta crack some craniums we gotta rescue me him he's gonna rescue me i mean when we gotta i gotta brainsman when do i get to blow things up patience crypto patience i take your point prepare the mother ship [Music] that's what i'm talking about so what's the name of this crummy planet our destination the planet [Music] earth [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah orthobox to cryptosporidium137 come in cryptosporidium crypto here how's the view from the safety of the mothership very funny let's just say i'm glad i'm up here and you're down there loathsome little planet now crypto to ensure this invasion runs smoothly it is imperative we identify the dominant life forms on this world those lacteeding bovoids are likely candidates surely you don't mean those foul smelling gas bags beyond the fence yes i'm afraid i do but they're covered in nipples now cryptosporidium and crypto to verify your suit is working under earth's atmospheric conditions get a move on we can peer into the minds of lower life forms via the cortex scan rip the pre-literate thoughts from their little brains no primitive yes profound scan another one again i think these lactating bovoids are trying to fool us they eat with their mouths ah i think i'm going to be violently ill [Music] attention earth creatures this planet is now part of the furon empire your benevolent masters welcome you at this time we wish to abduct you for the purpose of scientific research the procedure will be protracted and invasive do you have any objections creature i am addressing you respond or be vaporized [Music] i don't care how many stomachs you have i don't have time for this we furons have evolved the astounding power of psychokinesis crypto targeted object or creature then lifted into the sky use pk to finish off the belligerent bovines slam them into the ground [Music] perfect [Music] first these creatures good work crypto oh martha he didn't tell me where he's having barbecue for dinner wait a minute that ain't steak that's holy mother martha give me the shotgun this looks like a job for the zappomatic extract and collect the brain stem from what's left of the agricultural engineer [Music] you can consume the brain stem and collect the furon dna harold come on back you gotta see this they got a talking horse on the tv i had never seen nothing like i am not green be merciless let none survived a [Music] work horseshoe [Music] evening ms turnip seed we got a call from farmer dixon over the other side of the state road said he heard some pretty strange noises coming from over this way little green space man what is that like a new silencer that human law enforcement officer is attempting an unauthorized entry of your spacecraft if those p brains were to get their hands on your quantum deconstructor they could rip a hole in the space-time continuum oh the furionity vaporize them crypto get in your flying saucer and annihilate everything in your path [Music] take a spin in yourself get a feel for the controls and then go ahead and start shooting destroy all buildings leave no trace bomb those monkeys back to the stone age crypto move out man move move move i don't know but i've been told i don't know but i've been told joe mccarthy as good as gold joe mccarthy's good ass gold oh great the human military industrial complex we can't allow them to alert their leaders to our presence exterminate them now open fire crypto i hereby give you official permission to destroy all humans [Music] look out there are more to the north in the bushes replenish your salsa shells by training any human vehicle [Music] suburb [Music] the humans are making a final push wipe them out one side for all [Music] perfect [Music] excellent work crypto so did you see what i saw you bet your sweet ass i did what did you see little green man in a flying saucer wiping out the best infantry unit in the u.s army right good me too green not gray don't be a stiff you know what it means absolutely what it means the paper's got it right for once get on the horn to silhouette we've got the worst case scenario big heads we're actually on to something i don't believe it believe it roswell was only the beginning the invasion is on [Music] now then i know what you're thinking what can i a lowly novice do to help bring about the destruction of earth and the inevitable reign of the furon empire well i'll tell you it was in the earliest days of the empire we realized our species was doomed eons of waging war on inferior races with unregulated atomic weaponry had mutated our genes we could not propagate due to our complete and utter lack of genitalia fortunately a furon ship happened upon earth on its way back from destroying the martians human society was young and nubile sailors on a foreign planet letting off steam one thing led to another long story short every human being alive today has buried deep in his genetic code a strand of furon dna over the eons we've learned to clone ourselves but with each iteration the information degrades and the results are increasingly unpredictable the furon genes and humanity's dna are ancient uncorrupted they represent the future of the furon race if only we can get at them [Music] crypto i see a horde of humans up ahead congregating at some sort of holy ground here's the plan i want you to enter the fair find a malleable human and lead it back to your ship for questioning get the picture crypto that human is aware of your presence the more people become aware of you the more chance that those human policemen and the military will come to investigate you and take you down don't forget to disguise yourself crypto you're not exactly inconspicuous you know how the jewel sufficiently disguised continue using the cortex scan to maintain the illusion you wouldn't want to lose concentration while surrounded by enemies every time i go in that barn all i can think what i need is a farm hands union let's see brando make a movie about that i wonder what's for dinner oh yeah beef again i want a salad is that so wrong i love a man in uniform oh wait i am a man in uniform now if i could just find a cowboy an indian and a construction worker i could form that singing group down at the village what would we call ourselves the city people the village folks or something [Music] what we need is the dumbest weakest willed most malleable human we can find admittedly the competition will be fierce you just have to scan them all man oh man she may be the dumbest miss rockwell ever and check out them cantaloupes god i love america this human seems to be onto something will wonders never cease keep scanning the humans nixon is there anything he can't do that huffman should step aside for tricky dick [Music] i want to marry miss rockwell but instead i gotta sit here hour after hour day after day watching this dying wheel go up and down round and round over and over again until somebody dies hell of a metaphor yes yes like proteins from the primordial yeah yeah yeah town's doing great business is booming hope is on the way yadda yadda let's barrel through this puppy so i can get down to the real business of governing making time with the delicious miss rockwell mr ed versus francis the talking mule now that's a debate i'd like to see i put a carrot on mr ed myself that's it two tabs max from now on that guy told me it would help me talk to the aliens i was gonna flip my lid if mama made me take one more slurp of cabbage soup i want roast chicken chicken of the sea or was it by the sea all right crypto i've analyzed all the thoughts you've collected and i think i've isolated the perfect subject for you to probe and vaporize no abduct and bring back to the mothership my ways more fun abduct not vaporize okay but humanity ain't gonna annihilate itself all i'm saying can i finish can i stop you as i was saying the newly crowned miss rockwell looks like a prime candidate for testing she's envied and desired by other humans she's highly persuadable best of all she apparently has a brain the size of a peanut hypnotize her and send her back to your ship for collection implant a command on a puny human brain bend its will to out i want to thank all the little people but there's no time gotta go what is it it must have been my imagination i guess it weren't nothing boy i must really be losing it [Music] which way is the exit gosh uncle stanley sure didn't seem like himself this morning enjoy the bear oh and don't ride the mangler if the freaking death trap must keep going feet killing me damn hills wait i left my purse in the tent animals that is uh from one fear to the next must go to the dark and mysterious wounds there's no reason to be afraid nothing bad ever happens to people who go into dark and mysterious woods especially not in fairy tales for slasher films not that i know what those are nope nothing to worry about here i don't remember parking here of course i can't ever remember where i parked my car seems bigger and rounder and saucer-shaped wow this is just like my dreams and lots of wavy hair like libera wait a minute where am i this sure doesn't look like the pie eating contest what's happening oh god please no oh it's broken down oh yeah right there that's the spot oh that is delicious [Music] never fails hurry crypto the authorities are on their way get in your saucer [Music] wreak havoc by using your saucers abducto bean to levitate a creature or object [Music] [Music] [Music] crypto those nearby billboards appear to have been genetically manipulated by the humans but for what purpose i want you to investigate this bizarre mutated species [Music] brains healthy green glow those human fools clearly they've genetically altered these pathetic gas bags and turned them into radioactive exploding zombie cows show them the folly of their mad science [Music] [Music] yourself good crypto space invaders run for your lives a town's alpha male where did he come from never mind that you must stop him before he publicly reveals your existence go to this town hall and take the alpha male's place to address the pea-brained masses [Music] i know i could crochet a portrait of president huffman i bet he'd be tickled pink by that a restricted area crypto the charming security of this town hall won't let you in without a jacket use hollow bob to keep standards up will you [Music] crypto the gathering is already in progress but before we deal with these pitchfork connoisseurs we need i just don't feel like i'm being all i can be so [Music] keep it together man keep it together evil doers are everywhere it's him the mayor now use hypnoblast to distract the lackeys surrounding him how the hell am i supposed to run in these shoes shiny shiny shoes where is the police commissioner he was assigned to protect me move along nothing to see here oh i sure like saying that [Music] what is it time to take the stage break a leg mayor krypto assure them that everything is normal no monkey business that is only monkey business as usual the success of our mission depends on it now hurry crypto the gathering will start beat that charles atlas better get my best clothes on to go into town oh yeah i ain't got no base clothes i feel a sudden irresistible urge to wear pants and change my name to ellie mae one of the dang cows then it looked like it stuck some sort of device up the poor things crap trapped and after all that i didn't even get to see miss rockwell she just walked right on by with her crocs laid out flat in circles like a fourth of july pinwheel i told edgar there goes our savings no new shoes for the twins and i guess darlene's just gonna have to live another year with that overbite greetings fellow human agricultural engineers there is nothing going on here everything is normal carry on with your pathetic human lives that is all now what just a cotton-picking minute mr mayor i've lived in this town all my life and i voted for you twice in the last election now i'm entitled to a gall darn answer if they ain't nothing going on here how come all my cows is glowing like lightning bugs what you say to that whippersnapper i don't know why but it isn't from the death ray of a flying shawsha i can tell you that you want to know what's been going on around here i'll tell you what's been going on around here communism that's what [Applause] as a matter of fact this is a particularly good time of year for amateur astronomers venus is generally visible in the evening and of course we have the leonid media shower coming up in a few weeks listen you've been a great audience don't forget to tip the veal and try the waitresses and if you liked what you heard throw me a bone and vote for me next election day early and often [Music] now wait just a second how in the world does any of that explain the destruction at the fair read my lips i will not rest until we find the perpetrators of the fairground carnage and bring him to justice [Applause] well now hold on how come nobody in santa mo death has been seen anything like this you do the math [Applause] so as you can see there's nothing to trouble your puny human brains about the mayor's right this was all just a random series of suspiciously coincidental yet easily rationalized events yeah that's right give it up let's hear it for me suckers [Music] good night and have a pleasure tomorrow [Applause] what a bunch of losers minds like mud this planet is easy pickings crypto did you hear what that human said during your speech must have missed it busy digging on the love focus there's another human hive nearby santa duster he called it you must discover its location and make your way there we've got more humans to control [Music] here we are crypto sunny santa modesta first up i want you to find the alpha male of this town perhaps we can gain an insight into the way this whacked human social hierarchy functions crypto the first thing you should do is take a human disguise in this mission it's vital you remain completely incognito if your true form is seen by anyone the mission will fail [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] creatures scan any humans you find they might be able to tell you where the alpha male is located oh there seems to be a human social ritual in progress perhaps you can discover what's going on by scanning them i don't move before that mayor gets any closer that old lech thinks he can grab anything that tickles his fancy [Music] what a great guy he must really love pool parties that mayor sure is one heck of a public speaker shame about his short-term memory just keeps saying the same stuff over and over again [Music] hold on to your hats boys i'm going commando just because a couple of slack-jawed yokos have been drinking too much rockwell moonshine i'm supposed to hand over my civic authority i paid good money for this office this is my town those feds better steer clear this mayor is pathetic so is this pool party it's time to trash the place you have the right to remain silent uh good work crypto unfortunately you seem to have awakened the local constabulary be on your guard you'll need a new weapon to handle the santa modesta police force so i'm unlocking your disintegrator ray try it out on the fuzz good work crypto [Music] they don't look so tough looks can deceive these urban humans are savvier grittier stringier harder to fool keep your eyes sharp and your wits sharper not in the open duck in here hold the frequency head mate but go for phase one our guys inside the station just waiting for the word and the tape in the briefcase all queued up subliminal tv messages what'll majestic think of next search me you know what a rhetorical question is not a clue come on those black suits again what's a majestic i'm not certain but it gives me an idea crypto wait let me grab something to write with if our plan is to succeed simply reading human minds will be insufficient we must control them to ease the harvesting of their brain stems grease the wheels so to speak sounds like a gas how do we do it i believe your eben garbed friends have provided us direction keep up with the black sedan you're being outrun by a vehicle that can't even fly [Music] communists we're under attack little green men the men in black are getting station and cut them off there call the neighborhood forget the black sedan stop those running [Music] the briefcase apparently a human scientist is waiting at the tv station for these orders he's an expert on the human brain his name is sleepy ernst i want you to go to the tv station and scan libyans [Music] [Music] [Music] on your knees [Music] [Music] [Music] the human mind can be controlled by televised propaganda and then i'll start my own cable news network haha there's a heck of those majestic agents america ain't gonna brainwash itself we cannot allow the human race to be sleepy ernst's experimental guinea pigs they should be our guinea pigs destroy sleepy ernst crypto stop that this is some sort of psychokinetic phenomenon i am sure of it with crypto majestic intended to broadcast mind control signals to control their own people by transmitting signals from this station they hope to make the human population paranoid and aggressive well more paranoid and aggressive [Music] i suggest we beat majestic at their own devious little game we'll broadcast our own very special episode a mind control transmission from the mother ship a few minor adjustments to those rooftop antenna i should make them furon ready i'm sure you can handle that damn it i lost it all right crypto here's the plan we're going to use this television thingy ourselves to subjugate humanity to the indomitable will of the furon empire if you can bend the antennae in the direction of the mothership they'll be in the perfect position to receive my furon mind control transmissions that's the good news [Music] the bad news is for complex and highly technical reasons you have only a few minutes if you cannot align the antennae very bad things will happen let's not speak of it again can't i watch the news in peace that fidel was kind of making sense but no i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america [Music] here we go beginning transmission furon signal downlink successful oh this is smashing all right i'm increasing the power wait crypto this signal is too strong humans are weak their minds can take that kind of amplitude quickly crypto you've got to bend the antennae before they do that [Music] disgusting crypto crypto where did you go snack time [Music] i want you to collect any brain stems that may while you're collecting the overloaded brain stems take a moment and extract some fresh brain stems from living humans would you crypto i'm granting you a license for a new weapon the anal probe now portable for more efficient brainstem collection with the multifunctional anal probe attract and collect any extracted brain stems floating about from a safe distance but remember no unlicensed uses read the warning label good work crypto you just collected an overloaded brain stem only 11 more to go well i know it sounds like a lot but i think it's quite an achievable goal [Music] excellent i believe that's all the fresh brain stems i'll be needing at the moment [Music] nice [Music] these things [Music] you're going to investigate the activities of the human scientists i want to establish the connection with the majestic that special seasoning has succeeded beyond my violence dreams these people are now rabid paranoids owned incredibly hostile to anyone who's different and as an unexpected side benefit 78 of them are now registering republican crypto there's a frozen treats vehicle on its way here but my analysis shows it's carrying warm blooded humans no no don't shoot this is highly suspicious wait and scan whomever comes out first i know i'm not supposed to eat from the diner or i'll turn into a mindless paranoid drone but that rhubarb pie is calling my name [Music] more hungry vehicles full of scientists instead of ice cream scan the scientists once they step foot outside don't they live in their labs the two sexiest words in the english language stocks and bonds ever since i was a small boy in stuttgart i dreamed of drugging the food supply of an entire population now it's my job god i love america the psychotropic compounds inside scheissen turned our lab rats into a pack of paranoid junkies clearly the scientists are responsible for carrying out majestic's population control scheme normally i'd ask you to destroy the scientists but we have a bigger problem using the food outlets to distribute their population control drugs and it seems to be working if every human in this country turns paranoid in hostile it will make life for us very difficult replenish your salsa sheets by training any human being [Music] [Music] little green they just took the diner too we gotta set up a line and hold them here well i don't know about you but i'm not sitting around here waiting to get abducted keep your panties on mary i just got a word over the radio there's an army convoy right outside this town with tanks thank god thank majestic silhouette got the army to do something all right for once take some cars and go get them try and stop me if the scientists escape with the formula our whole operation is at risk destroy those vehicles before they leave the peninsula well one thing's for certain majestic are far more dangerous to our mission [Music] i say it's my time we inducted one of these brown and gave him what do you say [Music] i think you're going to have to land your saucer and capture the ancient foot how does he look like that in those [Music] shoes [Music] what if the other guys notice oh who cares lace feels so comfortable under this suit ah go to hell clattu you think i'm scared of a three-foot space hamster i think you should be now we can do this easy or we can do it hard your choice what do you know about a down furon scout ship a what sorry lemmy put it in baby talk a flying saucer crashed somewhere or uh captured i don't know what you're talking about of course not what do you know about majestic i know we're gonna kick your little green ass all the way back to mars i'm not these weapons where are you making them how many agents does majestic have how many other towns are you in a son of a don't get mad get sadistic i think this calls for the jumbo [Music] probe [Music] ah [Music] then give daddy what he needs mind control air experiment rockwell movies furon dna area 42 prepare to return to the mothership crypto we're going back to rockwell for the last time in a second hold still monkey boy let me choose [Music] [Music] sick and tired of this two-bit town nothing ever happens no dancing no rock and roll why if it weren't for that juke joint down by the river i'd never get my rocks off you said a mouthful cupcake there's a whole wide world out there and we're missing it but where can we go billy this town's a one-way ticket for wild hearts like you and me it's tearing me apart what you need is a new direction exactly a real purpose in life freaking a ever thought about homeland protection home what wise up romeo there's a half a billion reds who'd love nothing better than to rip that varsity sweater right off your back no kid take this little pamphlet it'll tell you everything you need to know about protecting your little corner of the country from communist invasion thanks a million daddy-o freaking a wow there goes a real american a real american dreamboat meow the last of them must have papered every jd in the stinking berg and our little film strip spooled up and ready to go the pimply projectionist is none the wiser won't those kids be surprised when abbott and costello turn into jimmy and johnny comey killer in real six good work agent and not a moment too soon we need to be in santa modesto yesterday don't break for yellow read me loud and clear [Music] sounded like secret agent man was taking orders from the one in goggles want me to blow them up thank you crypto but i have a better idea see the plaza over there by the big screen the humans drive their carbon combustion transports in and then view projected images for the purpose of entertainment makes perfect sense i suggest we beat majestic at their own devious little game [Music] [Music] you little freak stop it excellent i've prepared a special film that i'm sure the audience will love be a good boy and pick it up i'm on it [Music] now sit back and enjoy the following educational presentation from oh [Music] i'm letting you off the leash crypto the time has come to escalate this little war against the majestic you would definitely be needing a more powerful weapon be very careful with this weapon crypto it can hurt you as well if you get too close [Music] you've got their attention now it's time to cause this nasty organization some real damage [Music] these things mean nothing to me stop mind it matters [Music] it's time to exterminate the majestic infestation in this town find the majestic base in this town and destroy it for a while [Music] so [Music] however if we can harness the massive power of television we could brainwash the whole country we can easily transmit our signal on normal television frequencies all we require is a suitable guise a persona that humans will my trust indicates one possibility a human television presenter called bert wither but he's made himself scarce perhaps he got wind of what you did to sleepy ernst forgive my impertinence but you are an alien are you not how'd you guess i knew it i knew my prayers have been answered on behalf of all the nations of the earth i welcome you to our planet oh friend from another world gee thanks means a lot enough chitchat we need to find bert wither where is he pathetic crackpot human you want bert wither you got him follow me perfect please come with me follow that crackpot never mind that he's crazy he's our only [Music] lead they've got electric force fields around the perimeter you can turn them off though just shoot the machines on eleven dimensional super strength theory but don't tell anybody okay excuse me scan me scan me you better stay low they have gun turrets around the perimeter too a whole ton of them on the water side watch out for the emp mines they've got a bunch of those around the perimeter too the perimeter is pretty rough actually you can take a human form can't you you could get over there in disguise only one disguise will do though [Music] boy do i love bert wither even though he called me a crackpot in that tv interview he said lukewarm fusion would never work but it would and i know it if only i'd

turrets around the perimeter too a whole ton of them on the water side hey the cook at this diner takes food to bert wither he's the only one who gets past the force field and the guards if that crackpot scientist is correct bert wither is under heavy guard and only this cook is allowed near him you should use this cook to reach bert wither watch out for the emp mines they've got a bunch of those around the perimeter too the perimeter is pretty rough actually [Music] shiny new automobile check wife cooking meatloaf taking valium check monotonous job as a filing clerk check unbridled inner rage hidden sure is weird burt wither all holed up in a damp cave there's got to be a funny story there crypto be very careful this area appears to be heavily fortified that bert wither guy's got to be around here somewhere man walking past all those gun turrets scares the crap out of me lucky i brought a change of pants they're stinking guards with their stupid questions obviously just don't think about the fancy chef who got too close to those emp mines talking about french toast good thing old bert likes his tv dinners wonder if i ought to go hit somebody with my night stick could

got a little job for you spare your life [Music] oh [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] hey [Music] [Music] the success of the broadcast depends on you crypto you must protect those towering transmissions each tower has a transmitter at its base if the army want to stop the broadcast they'll have to take out those transmitters first [Music] regiments two and four warm up in the main junction one and three take the flank attack waves target the infrastructure i want those comm towers out of commission support waves your task is simple destroy the communist insurgents holding the television state no beat eaten vodka swelling trotskyite son of a [ __ ] is gonna hijack this great nation's god-given airways not on my watch incoming from the north tanks rule in the tanks show them some american steel a federal agency behind the new terror on our streets the terror of cops gone bad but if policy is corrupt what are the government responsible [Music] smcbs take out those towers now all units attack attack attack we have only a few moments until the army destroys our buildings [Music] these gentle intelligent creatures are being systematically exterminated by government agencies are these interstellar ambassadors our last hope for a peaceful human future could they help us take back america and play providence smile upon us all this is mark weather saying goodbye move over easy right [Music] let me go you tummy you scattered them like roaches marvelous [Music] now we should be able to discover what happened to crypto 136 my stands have identified several radioactive areas in your vicinity but there is one in particular that looks like it could be a crash site i'm on it any of those baboons laid one hairy finger on me i'll rip on my new [ __ ] oh drop your weapons i destroyed this is where 136 hit the dirt all right you found his ship a few little pieces most of it's gone recover any furon technology the humans may have found and rescue crypto136 monkeys probably hits the ship to their donkeys and dragged it back to their i don't get to shoot somebody soon i'm going to go out of my mind [Music] [Music] now if they send me into cuba bam no more problem that's all i'm saying [Music] the more i think about it communism isn't just an economic system it's a will a will to feel proletarian why won't those commies invade already i want to shoot me

that stupid shiny round hunk of commie metal for those guys in the suits i'd have a gi party with a toothbrush if i told the general to shut up and keep walking past that total ufo they make us guard those majestic guys golly their boss is the real head cheese flying discs are as real as the one crashed on this base just it really is covering it all up this majestic stronghold must be where they are holding crypto 136 come here [Music] i really thought you'd be alive oh crypto look what they've done to us laid us open like an animal how could intelligent creatures do this okay monkeys you want a war you've got a war what what did you find crypto we're dead an honorable death at the hands of an enemy in battle that's one thing possibly they desecrated us they're gonna pay what do i have to do get out of there unless you want to end up like a predecessor return to the mothership we'll use that data tape too are you okay [Music] bring me that data uh fire pain these things mean nothing to me magic [Music] um [Music] the data tape you retrieved from the human research lab has revealed the most disturbing development they successfully unlock the dormant psychic ability hidden deep in their primitive brains due to a dash of furon dna infiltrate the research base and disable its defenses from within then you will destroy the entire area with your saucer [Music] i know what you're thinking ladies and yes i'm available what have you found they got mutants all right here i am brains the size of a planet and i can't get lucky to save my life [Music] i'm dr oppenheimer wearing the same bow tie hmm i wonder how much he paid for it favorite scientist favorite scientist hmm well i sure wish i had wooden teeth like that tyco brahe [Music] humans using furon powers they're training these mutant [Music] don't run into those waves of energy find a way over them [Music] god does not play dice with the universe he does however hit the blackjack tables destroy the lab and kill those mutants it burns oh nice shooting crypto [Music] so [Music] destroy these primitive tesla coils they'll zap you with energy when you're near tesla tesla catching me [Music] man i am good how good um where'd the humans get all these radioactive cows it's killer time [Music] excellent work crypto now get to your shipping let's get busy [Music] getting flashbacks to boot camp it's time to give these inquisitive humans a little negative reinforcement they're entirely too clever for their own good [Music] peace oh follow me nice shooting crypto [Music] so it's time to [ __ ] their military forces i want you to infiltrate the main base and find out what the warlords are planning don't worry pax i wiped out all the smart monkeys in the last attack all they got left are a couple of hairy knuckled alpha males that don't know thing one about intergalactic warfare i mean come on any planet without orbital ion cannons is just asking for it human warfare is astonishingly primitive which is exactly what worries me they're just advanced enough to blow themselves up at any moment and if they do our chance of reclaiming our genetic future goes up in a mushroom cloud i'm gonna go out of my mind that would suck okay i'll go scout the base and scan a few monkey brands not to let them detect you this time we don't need any more complications and you know how jumpy these creatures can be hey it's me good point try not to kill all of them [Music] my di sure is a mean son of a gun [Music] [Music] wait a minute what if evil mccubed my god i just as a hole in my pants by looking around the curvature of space on time major fort always randomly selects the shady southgate geez have a heart it's the freaking desert gets to stand still in the shade smoking like a chimney just to sport one of those cool hats [Music] martin was under the water tower talking about preps proofs and necklace what a nerd if i were a pigeon i could see what those snazzy suits discussed with the general and no one on the rooftop would be the wise change smoking and coffee will steady higgs's nerves before the big showdown with armquist in the main building sounds like your old nemesis armquest is coming to town this could be an opportunity for us to remove him from the picture once and for all sergeant smith's getting green behind the wall again guess he shouldn't know hula hoop with another dinner party i have an office in the main building right next to higgs's if only daddy hadn't burned armquist's roast the head warlord will emerge from the main building soon i've gathered you should get a close look from a high vantage point like ww2 must keep smiling only three blocks till home and mother's little helper all of this khaki that what the hell is wrong with fuchsia isn't ready yet the x-13 was working just fine in the trials last week there have been a few um hiccups hiccups armquist is headed here right now to see this thing fly are you telling me it can't we've had some setbacks i'll give you a setback i'm gonna bring your whole goddamn agency up on charges this is gross incompetence save it why don't you show your guests the nuke instead i didn't pay 40 million dollars to see another goddamn nuclear test i paid to see the best goddamn fighter plane ever built i screw it i'm going down to sector 13 myself and find out what the hell's going on general you don't need to go to sector 13 the test flight will go ahead as planned what a second ago you said the x-13 wouldn't fly i said it wasn't ready but it will be your demonstration will go on as scheduled trust us we're the government crypto it's high time we met the base's head war monger go and probe the mind of the human called general higgs without these egg heads we could never finish the x-13 prototype gotta keep away from all these hazards just a little while longer without these scientists the prototype won't function i've marked the locations on your radar we must eliminate them discreetly do try to avoid attracting attention subtlety ain't exactly my forte fox [Music] [Music] man that guy stepped right on those mines fourth one this week i'm so lonely i don't know i just don't feel like i'm being all

had a breach small word for a big problem somebody got past the guards snuck into hangar 12 and wrecked the place our little grey visitor looks that way which means you didn't catch it we came pretty close close doesn't count agent the second it sets foot on base i want it captured and don't tell onquist we don't need any more help from the military call me when you've got it whatever you say [Music] so general armquest good of you to come thought you might be too busy running damage control out in california never too busy to watch the air force fall flat on its face jack corporal patterson let's show our guests what this bottle rocket can do vertical take-off and landing how do you like them apple that's it that's your ultimate weapon patterson get over there and tell mcgillicuddy to get that bird in the air right this second or he's going to be testing go-karts for the next 20 years 40 million dollars for that well old quest is inspecting their printed aeronautical capsules we'll crush their pitiful air defense forces and destroy armquest once and let me just load up the old disintegrate array and i'll be off no listen crypto at this very moment

one of the humans and command them to drive the vehicle to the airfield i fervently hope we never need to use this fearsome instrument of death so march here march there march it yourself jerk off um thank you sir the private regression think i'm scared of you [Music] uh you do realize nothing will be destroyed if the nuclear device isn't activated those humans want to disarm the bomb stop them the humans the humans are disarming them [Music] [Music] is that simplifies the problem the humans are dishonest stop it right run like the solar wind and get yourself [Music] um quest you want to explain to me why our troops are abandoning area 42 they're not leaving they're regrouping everything's under control really so the airfield hasn't been destroyed by one of our own nukes it's that comedy spy from santa modesto he got in somehow messed with one of our experiments don't worry i'll catch him that's what you said in santa modesta frankly general i'm beginning to question your resolve oh i'm resolved all right that explosion was meant to take me out you're saying this communist spy has a personal vendetta against you maybe you don't get the mindset we're up against i'm taking you very seriously the president should hear this get back to capitol city i don't take orders from you in this matter i speak for the president you know that majestic [Music] crypto i need

[Music] i ain't taking you nowhere without proper authorization marilyn will you take me to the island now now you're talking welcome aboard soldier your ship must have crashed somewhere nearby but be careful the island must be bothered to be crawling with human warriors i have a rifle her name is sue i don't get to shoot somebody soon i'm gonna go out of my mind [Music] wonder if anybody'd notice if i went awol [Music] the humans are moving your ship you must find a way to release it ah something's wrong with this ship i can't take off the humans have removed the power cells from the ship's engine core i've detected the radiation signature of the energy cells coming from a human marine transport vessel near your location [Music] is you've done it crypto you've collected the energy sales required for liftoff return to your ship immediately [Music] i'm [Music] how curious i was tracking armquest in hopes of discovering his secret base but instead he came here to a civilian facility known as the white house to meet with his leader the president i knew it arm quiz couldn't lead an army of ants cut to the part where i crashed the party i want you to seek out this white house find out what sort of place it is what defenses it has and then destroy all the humans gotcha no no stealth is our watchword just disguise yourself and make your way to the white house [Music] to serve and protect to serve and protect to serve and protect to swerve and defect to curve and perfect damn it i lost it okay i'm at the white house looks kind of like a palace big stodgy neoclassical plantation style perhaps they've just had an audience with this president i want you to scan their minds oh that's a challenge the challenge will be impersonating one read as many of their minds as you can crypto you may have to make small talk and conversation has never been your strong suit i hate kandinsky german idiot americans a little art education is a dangerous thing follow this human he said something about armquest i remember this one time at pennamond dr fritzenberger put molasses in the v2 engine ah what a mess these americans are no fun [Music] i've got it the solution to fermat's last theorem it's [Music] military installations up ahead now that you have his password persuade the guards to admit you what would inside do in a situation like this other than take a lot of pennies crypto don't start a firefight the bridge ahead is heavily guarded you'll have to sneak past march here march there march it yourself jerk off the password is blue rider welcome to the octagon sir the general's expecting you [Music] try to get near arm quest and see what you can learn [Music] the more i think about it communism isn't just an economic system it's a will a will to feel proletarian man i feel like cracking some heads you know let off some steam [Music] [Music] which is why the president has asked me to make some changes changes don't worry general you'll still be in command of our military forces that much i've decided you've decided it's only logical my organization has the skills the specialists but up to now we've been a federal agency operating on a limited scale this new threat however demands a radical new concept of national defense the hell are you talking about i'm talking about a project for a new american century the time has come to unite our five defense branches under a single chain of command five branches army navy air force marines and majestic of course you've got to be kidding me it's the start of a whole new era general and the president would like you to deliver the good news are you out of your mind you really think the joy chiefs will let majestic swallow them whole without a fight i think you better convince them to and general don't ever talk to me that way again yes sir so huh majestic in the army getting it on hmm i should have known those sly dogs bit cavalier about this aren't you why the hell not i don't think it makes any difference i didn't clone you to think and it may make a very big difference indeed in any case we have what we came for return to your saucer and report back to the mothership no the humans must not be as utterly moronic as we thought your scout ship has been discovered yeah right pull the other one it's true i'm moving did we take this [Applause] off [Music] [Music] crypto the warlord armquest is heading to a meeting with the other human war mongers his orders ought to unite them against us no biggie i'll just take him out yes but that would still leave the others alive martyring armquest will only stiffen their resolve oh well i guess i'll have to do them too guess it was nothing [Music] it seems majestic is using primitive listeners majestic crypto your forethought surprises me i won't stop just don't let this stunt i don't know i just don't feel this must be what the warmongers are gathering for the tribal war council take the form of a human warmonger and infiltrate armquist's meeting then use your powers of persuasion to turn the others against him lift crate move crates stand on crate destroy crate that's no fun or paperwork [Music] i don't get to shoot

could use some crappy corned beef hash right about now [Music] brass always bust my chops jackasses the evidence is overwhelming first communist spies infiltrated a small country fair in the american heartland and kidnapped the winner of the beauty pageant violating her corn fed virtue and god only knows what unspeakable ways when they were done with her they destroyed the whole fairground civilian casualties were tragically high who cares what happens to the human female that is none of our concern by god armquist's right we can't let an act like that go unchallenged you've got my support general last a communist agent used an experimental nuclear explosive device in a direct attempt to assassinate me at area 42. you know what they say armquest just because you're paranoid doesn't mean somebody's not out to get you are you kidding me a nuclear attack on american soil those commies are a god damn menace let's go get em i don't know who the hell you are general but you

destroy us of course not we were as scared of you as you were of us deep in our hearts i think what we really wanted was to be just like you really really i guess at the end of the day we really are all just human beings [Music] psych pathetic human [Music] i've been monitoring the radio this human river says the president will appear before his subjects today this president must be more integral to their social order than i suspected i have noticed a significant increase in activity in front of the white house right on just tell me where he is and what he looks like the mothership's tracking system is broken i think he uses those convoys of long black vehicles for transit [Music] you think i can't exactly pinpoint the president from orbit crypto it's not like he walks around with a big red arrow over his head i need you to follow those vehicles so we can identify him scanning oh look their vehicles use hydrocarbon combustion how quaint crypto try not to breed [Music] [Music] oh i really must stop watching human television screw it destroy them all it's like basically [Music] uh i ordered you to put me down double ambush gotta hand it to those monkeys that was pretty smooth crypto the winter creature has just made another broadcast he says that the president will be appearing before his subjects in a short time clearly he is a wily adversary much more so than armquest i saw you want me to disintegrate him mercilessly into a trillion teeny-weeny bits roger that big [Music] you're learning [Music] you're terminated [Music] [Music] that's [Music] you wanna be of course i wouldn't expect the humans to take this lying down but hey you're a big girl now right you can take care of yourself freak crypto the dudes in dark have found your saucer i think they're planning to destroy it this time i'm no expert in human explosives but it looks to me like they're laying enough to breach the power cells that could vaporize the entire city hurry they're going to destroy [Music] property [Music] no stop this is not standard how did you escape from the labs good work crypto [Music] now that the president is dead the human senators are voting for a new leader the vote is agonizingly close when the president dies doesn't the vice president become president just shut up and kill those senators before they get inside the capital wake me up when the aliens land ow ow analysis shows they've had a liquid lunch don't hesitate check them out anything you humans want have no choice humans have mass-produced a weapon that threatens our main invasion force these tesla coils are cheap shoddy versions of the ones you met in area 42 and you my impulsive friend are to destroy every tesla coil unit in town interesting some are automated but others require human operators so what do i do with those each unit must be connected to a nearby control console destroy them all i don't care how so i'm taking out the tesla coils and the control consoles once again crypto you have crystallized the thrust of my gist entirely destroy those tesla coils on foot otherwise they'll disrupt your saucer electric defenses just what we needed [Music] the humans are learning they hid the other coils consoles in bunkers you'll have to use your saucer to destroy them you're under arrest [Music] tesla coils destroy these primitive human defenses crypto too bad these tesla coils are only cheap imitations your saucers should be able to hold out against good work crypto [Music] hurry hamsters from space [Music] here you stand at the seat of all human power and they're turning over the keys to the whole planet our victory is complete no more blowing stuff up oh the furon emperor will be most pleased yeah it's uh it's hard to believe silhouette will be

fantasizing about destroying all the humans typical sure you handled the boys armquest hoffman oh that was a challenge but everybody knows which sex is dominant on this planet there's still plenty of time to get your asses handed to you that is if you're not too scared to fight a girl nah nah i'm not hung up on the whole pudenda thing so come on crypto let's dance i'll even let you lead i'm at the

america is the only human civilization on earth that's what all the americans seem to think at least once i scanned smok little insect there are three billion people on this planet and everywhere there are humans there is majestic sorry doll face without you majestics just a bunch of dudes in crappy black suits majestic empty 12 12 all over the world attention humans i am cryptosporidium of the planet furon this planet is now a territory of the furon empire resist this [Music] good evening my fellow americans in recent days rumors have run rampant of flying saucers alien invaders from other worlds indeed of my own demise i'm speaking to you tonight to put these rumors to rest the truth is america has been attacked not by little green men but red and our invaders are most definitely of this earth despite the efforts of this administration our nation has been infiltrated by communists godless deviants who hate us for our freedom-loving way of life their conspiracy details of which are only now coming to light included drugging our water supplies and controlling our media via mind control the result was mass hysteria a national delusion which provided them the cover they needed to execute their fearful scheme but your military and intelligence agencies fought back and i'm proud to report that once again america has emerged victorious however the price is dear at this moment millions of americans are working hard and playing by the rules unaware of the lingering toxic pollutants in their minds to combat this lingering menace we have set up testing centers across the nation at shopping malls local schools even churches the test is simple and painless why our family had it just this morning and i'm back at work doris is in the kitchen baking brownies and little billy's out playing tag in the rose garden right now it's completely safe so trust your government trust your president freedom is on the march my friends good night and god bless america step inside citizen you sure this thing is safe step inside citizen jeez louise i don't know hey buddy you heard the president if it's good enough for him it's good enough for us yeah yeah yeah well i guess a test couldn't hurt [Music] like shooting monkeys in a barrel [Music] and so the world breathes a sigh of relief the threat of alien invasion proved a false alarm as for those who scan the skies for a real visit from outer space they may be in for a very long wait perhaps the lesson is that we should turn our gaze inward remembering that man's worst enemy is often himself [Music] you
