uh so waterfall should be nearby but i see no sign of it if i look about i may yet find a way to see the unseen this land hides seekers well but no secret is safe from me oh the beneath the lake this land is savage but full of marbles look at this place extra cells great temples reach everywhere in this room that must be the hacks clawing up one i spoke off a pungent root must be axe claw there should be more around dank and drear they say hell is the same one more route should do it where are those cursing roots i should find my way out the reek from this route turns my stomach so uh oh see uh so i have done as you asked now where is my wisdom give it a moment to brew there an elixir to ready your spirit how will this bring me the meat it will open your mind to the secrets of the world while we wait let us speak of asgard how fared your defenses after the last attack we um we have been weakened by treachery without time to rebuild we we may not withstand another attack wait i uh i i did not mean to say that i i feel strange hex claw has a way of untying the tongue now you have said you want the mead but how badly how much would you sacrifice to be free to fate shackles would you give your tongue your hand your sight i would i would give all that and more i would like to see that loki what trickery is this i have sapped your strength heavy and i will take your life if your answers displease me did you think i would not come for you after what you did to my son our son fenrir a name i think you have heard before yes in the final reckoning the wolf feminine will be my doom now you know now you can no longer deceive tell me what will you do with him i want to kill him but i cannot i swore an oath to you loki and i will not break it i will not take his life fenrir will be imprisoned until the day of prophecy when we will meet upon the field of battle as we are fated to then we will bind you until that day as you mean to bind our son an eye for an eye oh i see she let you live you must have done something right let me help you down from there no no wait wait wait look you could have let me down gently that would presume i cared for your comfort then why release me at all for the same reason you are in yotenham you seek the mead and i can help you get it i assume there's a price i want a small sample for myself the rest is yours fair do i have a choice of course you do not the mead is kept by sutunger and his daughter goonlother in the vault at their home in utgarder the vault is opened only on occasion of a great feast when sutungur shares the bounty of his seller and it would be a poor host who did not throw a feast for a distinguished visitor say the high one of asgard you are not as oxwitted as i feared why do you want the mead my motives are not your business as yours are not mine all you need to do is get it i must bring a mighty gift to sutunga if i am to earn my welcome that idiot drunkard agyr recently lost his cauldron to sutungra in a wager but it disappeared on the way to sutung god would be grateful indeed if i returned that cauldron to him seek the tree that wears the scars of the world serpent scales the cauldron would have passed by there you might also bring a gift for gunloader there are treasures that would flatter her in thrimmer's house by the lake near utgarter i will bear that in mind when you have the mead join me at the well of mimir there i will show you how to escape your doom at ragnarok should i search for the cauldron now light from us all so uh yeah here's the tree header ken mentioned it's bark cut deep by jormunganda's sharp scales i should look around for the missing cauldron what do you see uh so hate me be my eyes steel and flash met here but you'd not leave no corpses door the bloodsong shut this rages the ditch was dark so the cart would break a wheel this was an ambush something huge was dragged this way they turn to earth when they die back to the tilth they came from this card bears the sign of agate if it was against cauldron they dragged through here it must be large indeed the trail of destruction leads towards that giant route let's see you old friend the mitten of the great yotun screamed dropped here long ago maybe the thieves took their burden inside soft mars all around hard to imagine this place once fitted a hand i must be careful now the missing cauldron but how did they get it into this cave that was not there before hard to know what is real in this realm of illusion oh there must be a way to reach its ah um it seems his sons have been hiding here awaiting their chance to take it back stay sharp hold you hey wait time you die i will you're mine ugh hmm so too big to carry but things are not always as they seem in your tiny uh let's see huh huh the cold has grown smaller i'm getting the measure of these solutions this cauldron should be enough to end saturn i could go to ugartha now but a gift for kunloda would improve my chances at getting the meat oh me be my eyes stood here before ruin came upon it hello no such calluses yes you have to freeze the breath in your body stole thor's hammer it seems his account of thor's rage was no exaggeration ah thor's bridal circlet this would be a gift worthy of gunloaders attention i need to cloak myself i need your eyes my friend lonely miserable nothing impresses the ladies like smashing your opponent's faces show me toil and drudgery is our lot hello no sense trying to change fate what counts is how you face it you are small to my eyes stranger small in stature but great indeed i am the one they call javi the high one of asgard and i come bearing a great gift your name is known to me but what could mighty finger want is a little thing like you can provide your great cauldron stolen by hemius sons let this offering be a beginning to the end of our hostilities such a small thing yet so much steeper than it seems appearances can be deceiving can they not well spoken harvey our people may be enemies but you have earned your welcome here trolls an honored guest has come prepare a feast i hope also to meet your daughter i have heard much of her skill in the mystical arts she will be toiling at her work as ever but be forewarned she shuns the company of others i could summon her to the feast if you like we might discuss matters of alchemy on the way that would please me you will find her in her grotto up the path within the circle of stones have a care though you are safe in my presence but you wonder what guard at your peril i will be discreet and harvey be kind good is different from you and will our children be toil and drudgery is powerless show me what lies ahead here's the stone circle but no way into the sanctum another illusion the way inside is revealed what is this place some time ago we made powerful magic here we sought to see all futures but every road led to ragnarok father does not visit here anymore he sees no profit in it but i am not yet ready to give up you are asir i am i have seen images of the future heard the voices of those who will come after us voices from in there yes i leave them words little packets of possibility waiting for unknown years many ages hence what do these future voices say they seek the wisdom of the past they speak of things to come but even they cannot turn the tide of ragnarok there is to be a feast in my honor your father sent me to fetch you no not yet listen i want you to hear the voices are you there prophet can you hear me perhaps another day another thread come we must not keep father waiting who are you knife cuts deep and sky pearls fall thick in this land it it is cold out here how can that surprise you i haven't been outside and oh i don't know how long you are devoted to your work not my work my responsibility my people ignore the disaster bearing down on them someone must do something we have long searched for a solution until the burden of it has bent my mind i do not think as clearly as i would still i've heard there's one method still untested there is but to activate it would mean defiling our well of knowledge from which all of midgard drinks there is no telling that change it would wreak on humankind it would bring chaos at the least and i do not wish to hurt them even if it means the death of all yetna we will find another way we must my father was a thrall as he's my wife as will our children the vault wherein our greatest discoveries are kept such things would do great harm in the hands of evil people no stone walls will defend us when ragnarok comes all we have built here will be swept away for so long we made magics there in that tower enchantment has seeped into its very walls the wind and snow have nod that tower to the bone soon we will knock it down foreign yeah harvey your feast is prepared i hope it pleases you you are generous and hospitable indeed great sutunger none can say otherwise and see your gift stands in pride of place running with freshly fermented mead enough for a hundred yucna and more this is an unexpected honor have filled it already with meat from your walls then no need it has filled itself such is the magic of the cauldron impressive but what if it should run out of meat do you hear this harvey fears he will drink us dry my cauldron is deep but my vote is deeper do not worry about my stores of need i have plenty to go around father you know revelry does not suit me must i attend this feast i have work to do your work can wait my daughter take a moment to enjoy yourself father we have very little time enjoy yourself i insist the guests are uneasy they see an ace here but they do not know you will you address them i'm ready now we will hear from our honored guest the lord of the asia has come in peace and brought us a mighty gift attend i am harvey deft of tongue and quick of wits here to spin you a tail your stories are wasted on them they respect deeds not hollow talk great yutna i stand here in awe of your might and majesty they do not respect weakness show some backbone i offer its host to great sutunga they do not love me as much as they love to feast now we will drink deep and eat heartily the guests are not drinking fast enough perhaps i can speed things along i should head to the kitchen you're not drinking i do not care for it drink is the heron that steals away one's memory some would say it frees the spirit of worry we call those people drunks i see your wit is as sharp as your intelligence whit i was simply stating a truth let us play a game ask me some riddles i will see if i can guess them i enjoy a good riddle how did you know all great minds enjoy riddles you fashion order from this order sends from nonsense you have me at that very well i will play give me an easy one to begin wood that i had now what i had yesterday find out what that was mankind at mars speech it hinders yet speech it will inspire it is ale of course a child could have solved that one would you like another all right i'm ready who is that shrill one who rides a hard road and has fared that way before he kisses hard who has two mouths and goes only on gold it is a hammer well done i hope that wasn't just a guess one more i feel good about this one be prepared this is the hardest yet white-haired women servants too bore ale tub to the larder no hand turned it nor hammer beat it but there outside the islands the upright one who made it it can only be swans and eggs very clever hobby yes well now the game is over have i raised your spirits at all i feel better much much better i might even go and have a drink come give it a try i should try the archery contest no doubt they will toast my prowess if i succeed my brother greetings harvey will you test your arm at archery you must hit three targets in a handful of heartbeats i can do the wings or the walls ah but can you do it while need adult before each attempt you must take a drink i'll take your challenge on one condition for every drink i take you take two that's a condition i'll gladly accept are you ready show me those targets then take a drink and let fly what can i do to get them to drink faster in the leg what's this second worst did you forget your mead drink from the cup and start again let us hope you hold your beer better than you hold the boat fine shot now have a drink and try another close your eyes your luck will improve steady eye now the last one is the hardest you look a bit more your hand grows steadier with drink where others lose their eye another round not for me my belly royals like a knot of eels and i see three of you i think i should walk this off mighty friend to the assist are you not sorry to lose your culture it was never mind by right thor won it from emir so he might feast in my hall i only kept it on his behalf and after that bloody business with him his son swell i'd assume you're rid of it i'll have no strife beneath my roof the end of strife i'll drink to that and i'll lead to anything is there any sweet amusing than the clash of drinking horns what is a beast they are calling for challengers to face their champion the fight would help them drain their gaps abby show us your might beat the champion and we will drain our horns in your honor bring me this champion and i will shine my knuckles on his jawbone behold do not mock me i will not fight a withered old crone if you are too afraid to face her well that is not if she is truly your champion then so be it i will try not to break her brittle bones but i promise nothing who is don't be scared you are mighty you have fought old age and won no one has ever done that before drink to me then as you promised you would all of you empty your horns for heavy such as the fate of the lowly no guests in the kitchen out i see musicians where's the music somber souls will only sip at their drinking horns counter as a tune to raise their spirits we are keen but my heart has been stolen we cannot play without it who would steal a songbringer's instrument there was a group of children playing around us earlier with mischief in their eyes i will get your heart back and then you will play give it to me i want to go get your grubby paws off my hop my turn my turn not you too you'll break the strings with your sausage fingers that harp does not belong to you little thief you should give it back what are you gonna do fight me for it why don't you give me a real challenge all right you want this hot don't die from that meat climb as high as you can though i want a big splash watch and learn but they won't do it how many broken bones you think 50 at least maybe a hundred we need to empty that cauldron then tsutunka will open his vault there now give back the harp so the musicians may play amias hairy balls that was amazing you must be half raven who taught you such language mother why uh oh yourself um the kitchen here i might find some way to make the guests thirsty the guests are not drinking fast enough perhaps i can speed things alone hot spices call for a cooling drink now how can i use this these guests will drink more with fire in their mouths the cold run is empty i should tell sutungko your guests thirst for mead yet the cauldron is dry all gone i never would have thought impossible father open the vault instruct the thralls to bring more need for my guests do they really need more father several are unconscious already do as i ask daughter give them all they can drink as you wish i will open the vault none will say that is less than generous none will be capable so finally the bolt is open the mede awaits with him javi i i heard a noise and what are you doing here i wanted to speak with you away from the others i i brought you
