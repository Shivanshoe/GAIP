[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] not bad it's a guy they had you surrounded don't worry I taught them well that's not why they outmaneuvered you if you have an insight share it you didn't notice them because you were too focused on finding Tomoya you and I make mistakes a guy no you don't accept with her hmm we should get moving what do you know about the cap archers for the most part the boy had been seen with them on raids all of our customer she wondered trust she's tool - divided conquer now - more betrayed you before she sided with the Mongols but you never told me exactly what happened she used my teaching to help a band of assassins they paid well it still doesn't explain what she had talked to you it's a guy how does a somewhat I deal with necessity you retaliated and attacked her dealt with Tomo is I would any common murderer she was your student I don't make exceptions Sakai first you don't know Lee now go now Tomoya they don't be the next to disappoint me what's that head they hunt people for sports not sport practice they're ruthless indulging violence weakens the warrior too much food or drink you said Tomoya traveled to your dojo to study what did she do before that the mother belonged to a merchant family she never knew her father why do you ask killing is not learned overnight even for a prodigy with the boat she was born with a taste for bloodshed more filmways work their archers hunts the people of okishima like dogs when our allies are through hungry for violence a killer masters a weapon samurai masters himself you've devoted your life to mastering the ball the ball yes not to killing now you're splitting hairs I have tied a wounded man to my horse with a bowstring he was an arrowhead to cut meat when I had no knife you're saying a bow is more than a weapon and I said what I is more than a killer we can't win two more back we have no choice we have to kill her I trained there I share the blame for her actions I will end this you only share the blame if you encouraged to thirst for violence I hate her my student I should have seen the darkness in there you didn't see it and that scares you we're nearly there we'll approach this like port Nakayama observe the camp look for weaknesses make a plan of attack that's right suck I look twice and shoot once I'm gonna go on foot from here I hear them [Music] definitely a cab for training archers [Music] [Music] [Music] Mongolian style archery the hybrid to Moyes teaching them training to fight summer I we will give them more to learn we take the camp then find out why she is a woman you attack my arrows will strike home [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] man what let's make sure the vilest Japanese bows and targets delivery locations all over Tweel Tama she's setting up more training camps the one in old snow another in cushy more planned a message Japanese what is it saying Great Khan conqueror of Tsushima before the years over your archers will know all I do about killing samurai and I will deliver the heads of sensation cover and jinsuk I don't worry they gave her everything and she threw it away she's a threat there is only one way this ends I know what must be done knowing and doing are different you are questioning whether I am Samurai don't worry with my greatest achievement if I must I will destroy her to save this island that is my duty the list we found we will use it to track down the other camps and we will end amorous treachery okay you are a fine warrior you could become a great leader I do not question my integrity again [Music] [Music] blacker than the heart of enemy you look like twilight itself has taken up arms you have my thanks one of 20 spinning camps around here oh don't kill me what's going on take whatever you want I'm not a thief huh everyone knows you're attacking caravans to close gender demon sensei sensei Ishikawa that's a lie I've heard you myself heard us one not long ago tearing up the road like starving wolves our sensei scholar I being blamed for highway robbery at North I thought was responsible [Music] sounds like trouble you're welcome sensei you're the ghost what happened here his Caravan was ambushed lots of attacks lately people say you're stealing supplies or sided with the Mongols rest easy I'll discuss this with Lord Sakai to moyes behind this she saw his paranoia and fear attacking caravans blaming us I called off to his group too late saved him but not the others where was he ambushed close why find the ambush site track the rest of Tomas group to their camp it makes sense what's wrong nothing she has me off-balance you'll put an end to that last year eat the food I gave you and wait a while before you leave Thank You sensei show me where he was ambushed how did you find me someone heard a convoy being chased people avoid the roads because of Tomoya when I caught wind of a merchant chasing a supply run I followed why would Tomoya attack supply runs in Kushi prefecture there's no strategic importance no but Cristiano tempo inspires people could be a [ __ ] effort to break morale here you don't sound convinced I think that's part of it no no treat everything I thought then she betrayed me and after me her home Hunter passed the horizon if I must there's a convoy and more victims of Tomoya let's see what we can learn it's a warning to the people of Kushi from tomo a from lord Sakai and since a school no travel is permitted on these roads on pain of death crude but effective no other survivors Japanese and [ __ ] arrows of course ah they took off down the road and we'll find them this is the last time Tom away and her men were ambushed anyone come cheap adventure come hurry his mouth here quickly what I just got the get those rushing in for this hug of a half tide why is she here alone I'll cut her loose what still no we're here to help she said come boy what did she say she said I could live into the thermal right came [Music] [Music] [Music] okay Tom we're set a trap for us and he walks right into it I spoke with her two days ago Tom oi the captive herder talking about a Japanese woman she saw with the Mongols I asked her to find out where they were camped and report back you did what it could have gone the other way we'd be standing over Tom wayes body instead you talk about what it means to be a warrior how Tomoyo undermines that but you and she are the same you expect us to be perfect your uncle me Masako Adachi but only a child expects perfection of his elders finish your thought sensei we all carry weapons we all choose between life and death and you're too comfortable with that power and if I weren't I would be dead and so would you ghosts not everyone can be a samurai but we're all killers we still have a camp a note so not to deal with [Music] he's off the post I am sensei chic I was waiting for you inside that's right since a he's gone he's all this Tomoya work she and her Mungo's had been busy any woman here named Don knows where to find her lead the way how does she know where to moyes camp is she stumbled on it while foraging in the woods she's lucky to be alive everyone with her was killed is your name fun yes my Lords the Mongols who did this to you they were led by one of our own don't worry I'll never forget the face she used to ride with a group of thieves who lived here that's not possible some ways from Moogie Prefecture she found her way here our ball terrorized what's not oh yes people used to say she could knock a [ __ ] from the sky blindfolded this can't be found where is it the forest without the west of here the between the river and the western sure damn her the lessons I taught her the secrets I shared why does she lie to me Tomo I never told you any of that before we fought I offered to adopt him ways my daughter make her Samurai lose someone like her that's quite a change in fortune and I took it away because she's a hired killer because ever since they failed her she fell back into the life she knew it's one thing to wreck your chance at a better life but to terrorize your own people I am aware okay are you you may continue to do what needs to be done we have a camp to find we need to stop don't worry where she takes more lives good news is Tomo I felt that to a place she knows because she's desperate she has the Mongol Empire on the side the more we damage her efforts the more likely the COG that draws his support we could use that to our advantage drive a wedge after everything she's done she deserves punishment even if she were willing to fight for us would you trust her no the woman we spoke to said to Tomoya terrorized people here it must have been years ago don't worry would have been young in her teens and holding her own among bandits difficult for someone twice her age and you never suspected anything when she began her study with me she hid a small blade in his sleeve and she secretly hoarded food I can see how you could overlook those signs yeah there were others I wanted to make her my heir so badly I've lined it myself to the truth the camp should be nearby perfect terrain for archers lying in wait your eyes dismount here stay low and find a good place to scout the camp up here we've seen this before what do you see bodies used for archery practice don'twe simcha japanese arrows and of course shut this cap down keep your eyes open for Tomoya ready when you are sensei I'll stay heated until you strike [Music] [Music] but she was seen here recently look around ceci oh here could be tomorrow the sensei and the ghost I'm getting tired of you tune your chess are dead it's over ambush [Music] we'll have to come away I hope it cools off come where this only ends one way there's no it's a cool toy you need to work harder okay where's he going what so your odds are high the sense is you're a gifted Archer who had a chance at a better life and threw it away is that what he told you Tomoya why are we talking so I can warn you to watch your back my sense they tried to kill me he'll try the same with you thanks for the warning but I'm here to end this it's already over I have nothing no one put the bow down don't worry she lost her mind no sign of her I should tell sensei she go [Music] [Music] giving life to all our wandering mind searches answers never found [Music] Oh Sekai what happened Tamar could have killed me but she didn't you let her get away she jumped off a cliff I saw her and you saw what she wanted you to she sounded desperate she is because of us what does she think your turn on me she doesn't she's trying to drive a wedge between us and it's working no it's not good but the next time you wonder if I can do what's needed ask yourself first [Music] Tomoya isn't finished yet my guess is she'll go north to curry favor with the Mongols we'll find her [Music] you
