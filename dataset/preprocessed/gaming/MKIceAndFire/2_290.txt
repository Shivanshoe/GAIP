truth it's not my truth danny it's clara's it was always clara's she told me you were the one who opened her eyes sure but when i started i was just spitting in the wind until i met clara i look it went both ways i changed her life only fair she changed mine she might be gone but now clara's going to change yara too danny you're going to put anton in the ground but that skill won't balance you could kill a thousand a million castillos all around the world and they still won't add up to one clara garcia i miss her too italia boom boom oh yeah we don't have enough painkillers we're short on antibiotics and burn gel relax material you just haven't realized yet you don't want it i'm going to be a pain in the ass that's why i want you no offense i'm the ones i can't i'm only with liverpool because of clara they didn't realize you were close but with her i would like i didn't have to be look it's nothing personal but you can't even see my revolution from where you're standing yeah clara was different and she would have wanted us all on the same page so how about you show me your revolution and i'll show you mine what do you think paolo we ready we are outnumbered our gone and they've had time to set up the fences on top of that you might not believe me but clara being dead it hurts i am not finished argentina's have sloppy tactics and terrible fire discipline you're not filling me with confidence paulo still not finished clara and i had our differences but you are the one thing we could both agree on we believe in you dani you brought us together into one family every guerrilla here would die for the other that's the [ __ ] difference between us and castillos couldn't ask for a better god than warrior paolo what's the status the morale is ready danny just try to keep up honey that's all good you ready no but who gives a [ __ ] that's the spirit how are we doing for supplies the black market ride up this happened in 67 they'll hide until there's a winner there must be something i can get you glad i always thought of everything really the way i see it she made plenty of mistakes a little invasion of sanctuario believing that anton had an ounce of humanity but she did one very important thing right this is where you tell me i wasn't a mistake glad i knew what she was doing when she sent you to find us best decision she made but now clara's story is done but
