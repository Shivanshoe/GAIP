yeah have you told anyone else i wanted you to see it first i saw an arm patrol go from town to an outpost over there a few more outposts in between they have electricity guns it's a lot of people we can figure it out okay assuming he's in there how do we get to him we can corner one of the patrols and get confirmation and then i don't know maybe find a way to lure them out yeah okay i'm sure they'll be happy to offer that information well then we make them you hear yourself okay what do you want to do what is going on with you mel's pregnant oh okay it's not just that though should i say congrats everyone else sees this they're gonna want to turn back we can convince him right i [ __ ] knew i couldn't count on you emmy i want what you want but not at any cost hey don't see you back at

being with him with jessie no we've been together for so long look jesse's faith i love his parents they will always be family but we were just on autopilot hey how come we never talked about this stuff i don't know it didn't feel you never really talked to me about cat yeah cause there isn't much to talk about yeah i just i i got the impression that you didn't really like her i don't care about her one way or the other okay no i think she's a talented artist i've grown to like that tattoo of yours what's so big of you and i think she wasn't right for you interesting shut up okay you can tie shimmer up here hey you want to see something spectacular you're gonna point at your face aren't you nothing is that spectacular oh brother come on stupid what do you think of this view huh it's pretty nice yeah this route has its perks where we sign in come on [Music] [ __ ] so [Applause] who do you used to do this route with jesse eugene right oh eugene man he was funny oh yeah plus he taught me about rewiring electronics and stuff may we all be that sharp 73 may we all make it to 73. uh sign us in what was this place uh it used to be a radio tower hey i'm gonna guess this bong was your jeans huh it's mine he gave it to me hey do you have any on you actually oh i wish eugene always had some on him and there come here town up ahead's our last stop take a look there's the town with the big tower thing yep that's where the next lookout is let's get back to the horses question were you wearing those same clothes yesterday they're clean no judgment it's patrol you know we're here to kill infected not to look fancy thank you hate it come on i think we should go out like eugene from a stroke no from old age like living a long life you no way come on you're way too reckless look who's talking you'll probably die from hypothermia for wearing canvas sneakers in the snow i am wearing boots today [Music] hey should we check these houses out it seems quiet but we can if you want i bet they still got supplies what do you know about this place just another evacuated neighborhood infected almost never make it out this far we usually catch him on the outer perimeter what are you doing tonight uh i was thinking of inviting joel to watch a movie oh are you guys good yeah what movie you guys gonna watch what's joel into uh curtis and viper ii that's the one that's been on my radar for a while oh wow we used to watch these cheesy 80s action movies i was really into them oh no i actually really like them too what about you what are you doing later some people were talking about sneaking out going sledding sounds fun yeah you want to meet up after uh okay maybe i'll play guitar for you okay what's curtis and viper two about okay so two former commandos that go rogue to fight bad guys and i think in this one they go up against russian spies or something i'm more interested in this than i thought it would be all right so the young one viper he's a trained ninja and he's a complete badass so how old is he in the first movie uh 10. wait how many movies did they make of this uh i think they made four geez joel actually saw the last one in the theater like crazy yes do you think anybody out there is still making movies it has to be how do you know i mean what if they're all just like us just surviving day to day well i write new music so someone had a camera wait hold on there are original ellie songs why haven't you played any for me well i i don't know come on will you play one for me tonight i'll think about it oh i don't have this one isn't it one of those superhero cards you're all into oh yeah [ __ ] the temperature dropped oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] [Music] smell looks like infected did this how many do you think it would take to bring down a moose more than one where the hell are they let's go find them [ __ ] i hear some inside how the [ __ ] this way that's one let's see if we can get around to the back of the supermarket good idea huh [Applause] oh you good yeah nice throw by the way thanks the way we came in was barricaded how'd that runner get in here yeah that's a good question what's the most infected you've ever taken down on patrol it's gotta be the one i had with joel a year or so ago just like a dozen you cleared about 20 once there was a group passing through [ __ ] maybe we'll get you a new personal record today this let's keep it way see how it goes [Music] oh that all of them yeah looks like it we've still got to get the ones in the supermarket let's keep circling the building there's gotta be a way in ellie help me up there i want to look around all right go ahead um there's a hole in the roof over there here thanks look see all right let's figure out how to get in there under here ellie are you clean yeah just banged up please die of old age and not because you get infected i really don't want to have to shoot you in the face deal cool hmm anything good back there actually yeah nice this way i'm in me too should we check for supplies hey got some alcohol a couple of rags here fix yourself up i see spores in there masks on got it remember i don't want to have to shoot you in the face oh that's

couldn't get to the horses looks like tommy took one now maria's got the stables locked down [ __ ] tommy we'll figure something else out on the way a car or a horse or something okay this makes getting to seattle a lot harder then it's gonna be harder you can still change your mind you know i know i just don't want you to feel like you have to ellie you go i go and a store you need to get your backpack i hit it by the east gates i figured we'd want to slip out that way [Music] hey what do you need oh i can go get it i want to do it okay i'm okay come on i'll hang out down here thanks dino i guess that was a good day hmm um uh so so [Music] everything okay maria i'm headed to seattle i wish i could let it go but i can't i have to bring these people to justice ellie's gonna try to come after me but stop her take her guns lock up the horses maybe lock her up buy me some time so i can end this love you always tommy he's gonna get himself killed he should have taken me with him you should have given us a group to go after those [ __ ] i wish i could you gotta try to lock me up i'd prefer that you stay that's not gonna [ __ ] happen i prefer that you stay but i know you

fully conscious non-fungal person ten wow what happened guy was coming at my mom i stabbed him [ __ ] he got me beat yeah i'm a real badass so how lost are we uh we're not uh-huh they have a little faith what about those crazy cannibals you said you and joel ran into they came after you guys once maybe these wlfs are connected to them no it didn't seem like the same group maybe those black market smugglers back in boston do you not joel crossed a lot of people i don't see the point i'm guessing okay at least until we find out more information ellie cars yeah i'm getting close start keeping an eye out got it oh another superhero card question if you could have one super power what would it be um probably invisibility strong choice is that so you can spy on me yeah that's exactly it here we go guess i was wrong turns out you do know where you're going stay with shimmer yeah [Music] you
