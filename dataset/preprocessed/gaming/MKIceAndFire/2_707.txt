don't be a gunk any news from the moxes events ideas no no don't see all that much of them how come you know how they are pissed me off sometimes is all so what's the latest in clouds know anything nothing of any interest got a new situation and everybody's trying to adapt me too doesn't sound like it's all okay doesn't mean it isn't something got you down all of a sudden um no judy can we please not talk about clouds the mocks or arasaka and militech and how the world's going to [ __ ] just rather not think about any of that today anything dark so ready to tell me what we're doing here well been tinkering with virtues a lot lately and figured out a way to scroll to actors experiences at the same time thought we could try it out if you're down of course how does one marry two separate neural tracks well at first i tried to create a single profile out of two data streams didn't turn out so great must have gotten tangled up interference white noise yeah effect was kind of like a bad art house a couple tries in though i managed to isolate specific sensations so you load them onto separate neural tracks no emo bogeys not bad what do i gotta do you my friend are just gonna scroll me a virtue that's it now now let's not get ahead of ourselves this could be my greatest work ever sounds like we could do this anywhere why do we come all the way out here what is this place cottage belonged to someone i knew it sits empty now i take the liberty to use it from time to time and that's where we're gonna scroll no we're gonna scroll underwater nope no way bad idea tell her to find some other yes man what do you say you in why would you say that i don't know don't like the idea that's all it's just when i think about the dark the deep palms that i don't [ __ ] have get clammy with sweat i don't secrete you're more than welcome to stay on shore hell yeah i'm in awesome so uh let's go got the hardware here all right suit up landlubber let's get this scroller on look pretty damn fine in that wetsuit don't go there dude water's toxic that not a problem whole reason we're suiting up i haven't even asked me if i know how to swim not worried i'll just sink to the bottom like a bag of rocks 50 50 chance i guess willing to risk it for the footage all right let's do this freezing ass water here i come okay we're all set you go first stay close behind me and don't descend too fast where are we headed exactly about halfway to the deepest point it'll be pitch black but the currents are gentle ought to be safe want the precise coordinates now why bother i'll just stick close to you [Music] virtues are more to you than just a way to churn out eddie's huh well duh think paintings songs they're meant to produce emotion responses generally how any kind of creativity works sure right so art's a casing trigger for emotion will be ds our emotion in near pure form this is it swim over here and look straight at me will you great great signal's clear just need your help with a few basic checks need to calibrate our gear first up motion sensors and scrolling circle around me swim great motion calibrated back my way now v next up sound check i'm gonna hum a song you give me the title read me but i hear you just fine need a wider range levels can't be short of perfect hey i know that edda sorrentino only you dead on all right that ought to do it what now prepare to have your mind blown wait for it now grab this and hold on tight down we go impressive huh you want to explore all that not me i want you to explore it it used to be called laguna bend just 15 years ago people still lived here yeah i remember nc dam limited made plans to build a dam people protested and the rest is history houses playgrounds all flooded got some connection to this place right you got it grew up here i haven't been back since laguna bend was wiped off the map why are you showing me this wanna get the right emotional reactions got a feeling this will be perfect for my experiment why is this stand to be perfect hoping you'll be able to pick up all the unfiltered mess of emotions this place brings out in me like it or not you'll react to those feelings that's what i want to capture whatever you want to do judy guess i'm with played you moment coming back so many times in my head taken me years working up the nerve for this why didn't you come earlier good question easy answer would be that i didn't have time gear stars weren't ever aligned the truth is the very idea it just felt weird [Music] [Music] so flow's diner best eatery in town only one at that too burgers weren't amazing too greasy big of course i say that now back then they were the best thing i'd ever chewed and swallowed and next door that's where we lived me and my grandparents just let me know when you want to forge ahead looks like this fell off your one and only eatery let's see now your childhood tasted like scab dogs from caffeine with abanero sauce extra hot of course tasted even better when you stole them off the stand you know what they say it ain't caliente if it don't burn on the way in and out got something here looks like an old photo cam [Music] it's a weird place for a framed picture water probably carried it out of someone's house anything to make out nah not much hockey stick is there a skating rink here i wish played street hockey on rollerblades i'm losing because of you coming mommy you're dead me anyway anyway go out with me here take this camera better off in your hands sitting here collecting algae gosh thanks [Music] what about your parents dad was never in the picture mom died when i was tiny can barely remember her i still have a picture but you know i see a stranger there [Music] what's that those voices voices didn't hear anything but you just now what was it like living with your grandparents how were they granddad had a real knack for things technical taught me everything i know and the stories he told never got bored listening to him and grandma was temperamental hot one second coolest deal the next temperamental huh it explains a lot is that a dominant family trait no idea what you're talking about where'd your grandparents go night city yeah for a couple years rented the unit that's mine now but they hated the city moved up to oregon still go and visit them sometimes let's keep going judy aye captain follow me [Music] looking for anything in particular here no can't hurt to look around though picking up very chill vibes it feels like we're outside of time like in a snow globe after that we can see what lies up ahead [Music] hard to imagine anything that could be more out of place in an underwater world hmm bottled water gotta say i don't really get why they left their wheels behind when they had to evacuate hey how old do you think i am [Music] [Music] though what this isn't yours been here all alone for 20 years so it is yours [Applause] [Music] you took her doll as if hit it was a monster you hit it why because i thought only losers played with dolls what i really wanted was for her to notice me ah the days when dolls were just kids toys and nothing else i want to see what's further on come on then i want to show you something got no idea how weird it feels swimming through here where you used to run as a kid your deadly life grinded along can imagine it a bit [Music] church hasn't aged at all always looked old and like it had landed here from outer space bells were cracked too i gave up this eerie atonal clang weird i had no memory of that seconds ago now i can almost i don't know hear it's possible but i think i hear those bells too seriously you can hear my memories it must be a side effect [Music] did you like going to this church never actually went to church never even really paid attention to it it was just there you know once we knew laguna bend was to be flooded people gathered here to plan a protest did it achieve anything look around [Music] i found an opening i think we're safe to go through here on my way snuck in here once when no one was around stood at the altar and tried to imagine what went through the body's mind looking at all those people [Music] back then i wondered how she could read people's thoughts know everything about them then i screamed at the top of my lungs to check the acoustics [Music] you didn't get chased off ran [Music] ah v please oh thank [ __ ] you're alive what happened you passed out why'd you manage to lift me out i don't know didn't think about it i just did what i had to do hey careful easy now so you're saying you saved my life thank you told you diving into this toxic waste was gonna end badly but you just don't [ __ ] listen i heard something weird just now sounded like complaining complaining is that the best you got kid you heard that it's incredible never happened before but no worries it's johnny silverhand's construct you heard his thoughts not mine johnny what remember the relic reason for the whole damn heist johnny silverhand's digitized psyche was on it and well this personality is seeping into my mind taking over you could say his mind's overriding mine oh [ __ ] b that mean you're disappearing can you stop it and here we go i got an idea a plan he's done all for me work why do i even bother doubt you should go back to the city just now i'm pretty beat too last thing i want to do is drive let's stay the night what do you think stay where exactly we gonna camp on the shore no in there crash there sometimes after dives how about it why the hell not whose cottage is that then you said you knew the owner one of our neighbors was hell bent on staying in laguna bend badges literally dragged him out of his house before the water came in so he built himself another house as close as he possibly could but then he got sick water was way more toxic back then you must be chilled to the bone i'll brew a pot how do you take yours uh black please like the heart of a merc ah forgot to start the generator a generator what's next jacuzzi finnish sauna no but there is running water i can turn it on you're gonna take it easy promise to take it slow i think he could have fine-tuned the emotive wave transmitters better back there feed i was picking up felt a bit flat i want to say power's up your little spa is open for business so be careful of course judy what was that couldn't hear you clearly something to matter no nothing don't [ __ ] me judy we're still synced remember clouds has gone to [ __ ] tiger claw no next took revenge for hiromi
