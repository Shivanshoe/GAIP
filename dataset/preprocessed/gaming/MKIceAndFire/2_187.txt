coming from is that what we're calling them well i was also considering flying octopus monkeys skimmers it is then [Music] [Music] wow [Applause] reinforcements inbound [Music] the door i know the code is being rewritten altered using a forerunner routine [Music] [Music] hostile reinforcements inbound [Music] where is [Music] yours i'm done come get me [Music] what happened back there when i interfaced with the cradle it unlocked something something important cortana was here six months ago i could feel what she felt when you arrived it was joy fear and pain chief is that another's something big went down in here spartans [Music] a thruster module evasive maneuvers on demand now then who are you scan complete spartan theodore sorel special weapons expert died 13 days ago like makkovic the assassin brutes more than one whoever they are they're proficient well trained we've got a score to settle watch out i've been waiting for this [Music] that platform we're too late not yet [Music] they were persistent did they kill spartan sorrell negative his killers are still active [Music] uh this elevator it's taking us back to the surface it doesn't make sense why come all the way down here just to kill the monitor the monitor's purpose is to protect the ring so why kill her no idea [Applause] show yourself [Music] i know you have been following me we are not enemies despondent pyre she had something i required but hear this you are not the future you okay chief i'm trying to get the armor unlocked try harder the forerunner's lies are at an end i am the harbinger of the truth the endless will be found they will ascend now would be good i know i know three the reformation begins two one go [Music] i took too long you could have been killed it's okay you saved us both [Music] that structure yeah do you know what it is no the harbinger said the endless will be found maybe they're inside that thing only one way to find out huh he's taking cover see how he likes this yes um he's over david [Music] the fire on the vehicle um yes i'll kill you for this who are these guys hunters and what do they do don't answer that just get rid of them so i can get us in oh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] to get in we need to activate the graph lift hmm the protocol's not banished in origin it's sturdier than i expected problem no problem [Music] [Music] [Music] we're in wow this place is exactly what you'd expect what does it do unknown find me somewhere to plug in and i'll try to find out there we go plug me in over there interesting this structure has been activated using a protocol that's far older than anything i've ever seen it it knows we're here welcome welcome oh hello i am adjutant resolution sub-monitor of this installation loyal servants of desponding pyre who must be indisposed if i have been activated have you seen her kinda do you want to tell him tell me what the monitor is gone gone [Music] are you sure of course it wasn't us good good good i was worried you were perhaps unfriendly as you can see this fire has been successfully deployed this way i presume you wish to see the observation platform see he seems friendly we'll see did you say something [Music] right this way should have been activated one moment please step into the portal follow me please one moment [Music] let us proceed this is very exciting so the sequence will be set and the revelation can begin [Music] [Music] here we are as you can see we are ready to progress as soon as please excuse me please return get me to that terminal [Music] oh that's not so bad the structure's purpose is simple rebuild the ring well more specifically create the materials needed to repair it not gonna happen why it's such a beautiful oh the banished sorry i was distracted for a second there's so much to learn here shut it down permanently are you doing this is not acceptable you were supposed to be friendly this interference is deeply upsetting what's wrong with this [Music] weapons i'm putting an end to your mentally [Music] here and now [Music] this is exciting [Music] oh how dare you so i have good news and bad news how many okay straight to the bad news a lot i count nine no ten spires more being deployed all the time active no not yet at least they appear to be waiting for an initialization sequence something is flooding the network trying to start it but there's resistance why the protocol that triggered all this wasn't exactly correct it worked well it started the process there's more bad news i can't shut it down exactly but i can remove it from the network of course i can find the source of the attack i just need to wait is it safe come on it's me an infiltration program designed oops i think she knows i'm how are you doing disconnect give me one second to get it now it's done why don't you trust me what was that maybe taking it offline wasn't such a great idea we need to go like now immediate extraction my location oh god it was you wasn't it now i'm coming i'm coming [Music] [Music] open up go upload this fire locations all of them all of them coordinates received um it looks like someone has marked 42 new locations which would be crazy right this one it was the source of the attack attack what's she talking about chief is everyone trying to kill you it kind of seems like it oh wait you're being sarcastic he's fun i like him am i dead i must be i mean this is a punishment right yep this is death [Music] emergency landing [Music] no no you i can't stand it you are breathe no you don't get to tell me what to do you don't get to tell me anything where are you even listening i count three anti-aircraft cannons three what you'll be safe here oh i'll be safe safe i haven't been safe since i found you i found you remember you're out there on your own and you'd still be out if it wasn't for me i thought i was going home there won't be a home if we don't stop the banished you keep saying that we're outgoing outnumbered i know i saw clone doors over there i'm going to dig through them and find one with a working sleep space drive and when you're done with this war we get away from here far away wait here oh please let me see what i can find canon's first when i get back we can look together okay we're not the banished have done what the covenant couldn't that's right the covenant which time after time pushed you idiots to the brink of extinction are nothing compared to us we're like nothing you've ever seen good news doom humans our primary communications array the horn of abolition we just got a big upgrade we can hear every transmission every uh [Music] [Music] fight this cannot be [Applause] [Music] uh right uh [Music] hello [Music] oh [Applause] she swore that she could rebuild the rain allow us [Applause] i have little time [Applause] last left the silent auditorium that is what she called she speaks but it matters not it will belong to the banished whatever secret holds and if he will not share it we will crush her and take it for ourselves [Music] [Music] what [Music] um is the only viable option we have a power vacuum like that would destabilize the banished and win us the footing we need to hold out until help arrives i need volunteers and i know i'll have no shortage of them we all want a part of this but we can't all go and leave reverie undefended so we're doing this the old-fashioned way no i'm not this is the plan a single strike team deep in banished territory agile quiet on foot it's the only way it's going to work this might be a one-way trip so we need people to stay there won't be anything left to protect [Music] without a real stupid god that's it the gravity lift is on let's get inside and shut this gun down plug me in and i'll take care of the cannon they call this security please hold tight i'll handle it [Music] the uranus lost this war months ago your people are broken scattered hunted defeated by me [Music] i wish i could tell you it was difficult but it wasn't [Music] we are one step ahead always the ring is already under our control soon the auditorium is well the harbinger and the banished share the same goal we fight together to honor the will of atriox but without challenge i grew weary lost [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is my last fight a true test of legends our story will outlive us both [Music] set a fire in your heart spartan bear your fans fight hard die well thank you chief that word auditorium what is it i was hoping you'd know the answer to that one i'm new remember okay i'm done here good let's get out of here before the fireworks start the banished are mobilizing in a big way clock sticking chief how much longer one gun down two more to go we are running out of time the harbinger and the banished share the same goal rebuild the ring but why maybe they want to go home too [Music] you
