i didn't ask for this war but once it started i had to finish it hands down kronecker was the toughest enemy i ever faced all my tactics my training meant nothing against a god like her in the end it was a battle of wills it never occurred to me that from winning i'd get her hourglass at first i hoped to right every wrong in history but then i figured out doing it meant i'd have to decide the fates of billions picking who lives and who dies for eternity it was going to kill my soul i'd end up no better than those old men who sent us off to war not giving a [ __ ] about what would happen and that's not the man i want to be it's time to walk away for good this time leaving the pain and the ugliness behind after all i've been through i've earned a little peace shao khan was dead the god of war had prevailed the spell that had summoned him began to reverse itself as he slowly faded from this place and time kratos was approached by raiden and fujin though he did not count them among his enemies kratos had never been beloved by these guards he prepared for combat to his surprise they bowed to him a show of respect he had not seen from an immortal in many an age raden explained that though his motives were not pure kratos had saved earthrealm he was owed a debt of gratitude as he returned to his own world kratos nodded silently their change of heart would perhaps prove useful one day a debt of gratitude is often dearly paid [Music] freddy krueger's bladed hands tore through shao khan the demonically enhanced weapons had been more than a match for the emperor's dark magic though freddie had saved earthrealm nightwolf recognized him as an evil spirit and in a shamanistic ritual sent him back to the dream realm but that decision proved ruinous freddie did not resist he welcomed a return to immortality from the dream realm he will again create a nightmare in earth realm the alien tore through shinnok's flesh reducing him to a bloody pulp the creature then returned to its nest in outworld it continued to venture forth looking for suitable hosts for use in establishing a new hive the alien found more than a few intriguing species and dragged them back to its lair once a queen had been spawned the aliens knew hive multiplied quickly and spread unchecked throughout the realm emperor kotal khan attempted to save outworld in a desperate final attack on the alien's main nesting ground the attack failed outworld belonged to the aliens this world called earth produced many worthy opponents which made for excellent sport some possessed a power previously unknown to the predator's race sorcery the predator sought to harness this new power for use in his conquests he analyzed a trophy from a recent battle and eventually discovered its secrets with the power of sorcery the predator was unstoppable and decimated the whole world single-handedly he had become the apex predator like scorpion jason voorhees was a revenant a vengeful spirit returned to life hundreds had fallen victim to his bloodlust liu kang now ruler of the nether realm took notice an immortal killer like jason would be useful in his plans for conquest he drew jason into the nether realm and offered him an endless bounty of slaughter in return for his allegiance jason's simple reply was to destroy liu kang leatherface had cut down the old man in the strange outfit maybe now that he was dead the pretty yellow-haired gum-chewing girl would notice leatherface putting on his fanciest mask leatherface found the army camp with a pretty girl could be found most days he had to cut through a few guards and more than a few of her friends to get to her but it was worth it he pulled out the old man's face which he'd saved for the girl as a present the girl didn't want the present and she wasn't being nice so leatherface chopped her into tiny pieces for drayton to use in his chili he then took off his mask and set to work on the girl's face if she wasn't going to be his girlfriend she could be his in other ways ocp built me to serve the public trust protect the innocent and uphold the law so when i found kano dealing arms to old detroit's gangs i had one duty apprehend him i never thought the chase would take me to a different universe let alone end in a fight with kano's protector cronica and when cronica went down something unexpected happened her power washed over me sweeping away the limits my designers had put on my programming for the first time i saw the depth of ocp's corruption it wasn't just a couple of greedy executives it was the whole damned company ocp is making a killing playing both sides selling to cops and criminals when i get home i am bringing them to justice it will not be fast or easy ocp has too much cash and too much firepower for me to clean things up alone it is a good thing this will be an interagency effort welcome to the future of law enforcement was an epic accident that brought the terminator here rather than to his own earth's past but it didn't take long for him to adapt he figured that terminating cronica and taking her hourglass gave him the best chance at achieving his mission objective destroying humanity so that the machines prevail turns out the hourglass wasn't the ultimate weapon no matter how many times the terminator rebooted history the war between humans and the machines always ended the same with their mutual destruction he realized this war was a losing game the only way to win was not to play so the terminator used the hourglass to build a future where machines and humans don't fight they cooperate the terminator knew that to preserve this future no one else could learn about the hourglass the information stored in his machine mind was dangerous it had to be eliminated that's why the terminator threw himself into the infinite depths of the sea of blood no one would ever find him or unlock the hourglass's secrets if you could ask him about it he'd tell you he made the only logical choice but in my book that machine's a hero [Music] i'd snuffed out every devil in hell until nether elm and vader showed up to piss me off it would have cost a lot of power fighting them alone but they were being hunted by my new friends call them fire and ice they argue constantly which is why i usually like to roll solo but when it comes to killing demonic [ __ ] these guys don't flinch i can get along with that the grandmasters tipped me off the coalition said she was resurrecting some never realm god named shinnok but that's not happening on my watch kronec is just as much as devil as malbolgia both make promises both tell lies both underestimate me that's why i'll make a new hell for them where they can burn together for eternity the nether realms locked down but there's still eight hells left to purge it's time to bring up the reserves i made choices in my life that sealed my fate i'm beyond redemption but even the damned are capable of doing some good so all you devils out there making false promises and spewing lies we're coming and you don't have a chance in hell this was my dream vacation i saw mayhem mutilation it was all a gas for a while but these nincompoops they didn't really get me not even that pretty boy ninja mime good night sweet prince i'd finish just about everyone worth finishing in earth realm and outworld even lovable old netherrealm i was a lonely heart in search of new friends but as luck would have it i had just the gizmo to find them and oh the hourglass spoiled me havoc and i are going to be bosom buddies and what's that my new pal knows an entire realm devoted to law and order and he exists solely to disrupt it well i say he and i need to get busy meet the league of misunderstood maniacs we're giving order realm an enema and when we're done who knows where we'll crash next maybe we'll come to your house and slip live grenades under your pillow maybe we'll cut your favorite pet or maybe we'll just break your tv right now you
