[Music] you with their preparations for the journey incomplete everyone is gathered at commie house [Music] what's with the hair go on my mom thought I should look more presentable you know when meeting an entire alien race for the first time okay man your mom sure is strict we're counting on you don't come back until you found those dragon balls every day meanwhile justice Bulma and the others left for planet namek vegeta back and fully recovered from his fight on earth learned of his commander freezes absence Frieza was on his way to Planet Namek with his most elite subordinates in tow he was in search of the Dragon Balls that he learned of from Vegeta and the others on earth his goal to wish for immortality Vegeta hurriedly made his way to Namak in an effort to catch Frieza and stop him if breeze is able to attain immortality the universe's history I'm not going to let that happen those Dragon Balls are mine [Music] meanwhile 34 days after Bulma and the others left Earth they finally arrived at their destination Planet Namek [Music] we did it we actually made it to Planet Namek hmm this place kind of reminds me of where piccolo trained me back on earth no use waiting around let's find those Dragon Balls hey check this out I'm picking something up no doubt about it it's a Dragon Ball you're right Harlan do you feel that strong energy over there huh and you're not kidding it's massive and it feels crazy strong and there's something kind of evil about it too what's going on there's nothing to freak out about besides look at the reading I'm getting over there the radars picking up four dragon balls all in one spot yeah you're right it's probably just some namekians we got nothing to be afraid of go on Oh your power level they'll know we're here yeah it's Vegeta looks like it's just him [Music] I am not letting you get your filthy hands on those Dragon Balls Frieza Bulma let the others know what's going on and then head back to earth Bulma let the others know what's going on then head back to earth Gohan sound good to you yeah okay I'll get a hold of Master Roshi and fill him in first once I'm back I'll pick Goku up and bring him here I should be back in about two months right two months what another one hold the phone but another one of those things doing here yeah that's exactly what I want to know we found it Lord Frieza excellent work now only three remain out of my grasp take care not to lose that dodoria it seems Vegeta is looking for the Dragon Balls as well yes a pardon me Lord Frieza cui has just intercepted Vegeta as he my that was fast in addition the two large power sources from earlier have suddenly disappeared as well I will make my way to their location and investigate I should be able to identify them shortly very well but I'm more concerned about ridding myself of that traitor Vegeta what a shame I didn't think him foolish enough to turn against let alone attempt to steal the Dragon Balls for himself we should be on his way to dispose of Vegeta she'll be interesting those who have long hated each other they are roughly equal in power I believe so I assume it'll take a fair bit of time you're not going anywhere Vegeta I'm going to enjoy blowing you to pieces right make sure to let Goku and the others know Thanks [Music] all right I'm heading back to earth now good luck you too I'll be back with Goku as fast as I can [Music] Krillin someone's coming huh is it the Saiyan no it's not Vegeta it's someone weaker probably namekian it should be right around here look what the hell is that what those are namekians they don't look like namekians who the hell are they [Music] their power levels are joke they're nothing but trash I guess it's just some tourists huh well anyway we got orders to annihilate everyone on the planet it wouldn't be much fun if they got away sounds good to me No sucks to be them guess they were in the wrong place at the wrong time okay go on feel free to let loose on these guys they're nothing compared to you here goes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah hey nice going Gohan nice going there's nothing nice about this [Music] our Lord Frieza it seems like there's two power sources from before may warned more of our attention they raised their power levels almost instantly and then vanished after defeating two of our scouts that is indeed strange I highly doubt it's Vegeta is doing correct my lord it can't be Vegeta the sources each have a power level of about 1500 1500 is that right hardly anything worthy of our concern wouldn't you say they do seem rather unruly if you have an upon least you eliminate them let us leave Vegeta's destruction to qui you hear that Vegeta [Music] that was a direct order from Lord Frieza I finally get to kill you don't make me laugh qui do you actually think you can beat me are you blind Vegeta take a look at your Scouter you'll see my power level is leagues above yours [Music] well now [Music] qui doesn't seem to realize how much of a threat I am good space in no time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah you must really have a death wish coming at me like this you've lost your edge Vegeta you don't stand a chance against me with a power level like that don't be disappointed you're in for a treat you see I've managed to learn a little new trick during my time on earth like what how to run away like how to control my power level no way to nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two thousand [Music] well this must be some sort of error but I set my scouted Vegeta's coordinate and it's showing a reading of more than 22,000 but did you say 22,000 that's an older-model Scouter isn't it here I'll get a more accurate reading with mine impossible it can't be is by stouter broken but it's a newer model the readings up to 24,000 are you saying is power level is even beyond ours now [Music] pampered beyond mic you ever buy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] dirty fireworks a genius power level from before not 24,000 reading it was real oh I don't believe it he just took out Queen I'm hardly surprised at this how soon you forget Vegeta as a highly experienced fighter in every right not to mention foolish he doesn't seem to know his error and so brazenly defying [Music] Lord Frieza the scouter shows there are about 10 dimensions in that direction very good let's hope they have what I'm looking for the fifth Dragonball let's pay them a visit [Music] I hate to say it but that's it we're screwed there's no way we can ever get back to earth now boma let's let's at least get away from this place we're sitting ducks out here we should try to find a place to hide maybe anonymity a house or a cave or something we'll try to figure something out I'm sure the namekians can help us fix our ship right I wish I could be as optimistic as you two [Music] [Music] yeah nearly wish I could fly right now but I can't play my location gotta be a good place to hide somewhere around here look really strong [Music] [Music] [Music] hey this hole over here it looks like it'll do the trick so how long do we have to stay in a creepy place like that huh Grillin do you sense that power over there yeah I do but it's not like the others from before this time it might be namekian Oh hide there's some strange energy headed this way what are you doing boma hide those guys we beat up earlier weren't alone it's them you ha they they left who were they bula do me a favor and check the dragon radar please you said for the Dragon Balls were in one spot right well then it's possible that those guys yeah that explains it they have the four Dragon Balls yeah that's what I thought go on did you feel it yeah their power was incredible whoa that small guy he might actually be stronger than Fujita Wow stronger than Vegeta no way cool man wait how are we supposed to get the Dragon Balls from those guys once master roshi learned of the situation on Nemec from Bulma he informed Goku right away Goku who was eager to help his friends then ask doctor briefs to build him a spaceship doctor briefs modified the ship Koch who arrived in as a child and gave it enough power to reach Planet Namek in just six days after bringing himself back up to fighting condition with some Senzu beans Goku left for Planet Namek all right I'm off I'd better get training with this gravity machine right away after all hey you guys are those creeps from before heading straight for the Dragon Ball yeah hey that's wait a minute that's right back where Crillon thought that the numidians were approaching us okay I'll head over there and check things out I'm going to second here by myself well it'll be a lot safer for you here actually you might be right fine I'll just open up a capsule home here in the cave and wait for you guys go on make sure you lower your power as much as possible right freezers horrible henchmen [Applause] [Music] so you think there are really some namekian villages here if they are we need to hurry and find them before it's too late [Applause] go on you know the deal right yeah no energy blasts are flying right that's right we have to move undetected why right now I can't [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we're almost there but what's going on down there you look just like commie and piccolo ah they must be no merchants first introductions I am Frieza I'm looking for the Dragon Balls and if I'm not mistaken I do believe one of them can be found here free we don't have anything it takes a great deal of courage to lie to me with a power level like yours is that device that must be Heather able to find what few villages have spread across the planet oh you know the other elders were all too willing to provide me the information I need Willie that's impossible well they did require some convincing zabun show how persuasive we can be you [Music] perhaps you understand now if you insist on being this difficult those young ones over there will be the next to die what do you intend to do with the dragonballs why I'll make a wish of course nothing too extravagant my view just immortality even if they sponsor us managed to gather the dragonballs and they still might not be able to make their wish I suppose we have no choice but promise me one thing promise me you hopefully a hand on the children of course mind you you could have saved yourself all this trouble by doing sooner No take this and be gone well I have perhaps you can tell me something say the location of the two remaining Dragon Balls if memory serves you need seven of them to make a wish isn't that right don't be ridiculous we Americans are not in the business of endangering our own kind and just when I thought you were less foolish than the rest I suppose I have no other recourse but to kill you and the children get out of here Dendy no house keltus now you won't be able to hunt us down anymore you're all dead [Music] it's not much fun killing small fries like you but you gotta die sooner or later what who the hell are you you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] yo metal now's our chance Murray huh all right after them to Doria don't let them get away bunchy go on if he catches us we're Conners laughter than us wait that's right yeah go on take the kid okay don't look directly at me great yes go there flares [Laughter] my eyes I can't see all right it worked go on hide yo little twerps where the hell you go huh we're safe all right we need to head back to Ballmer fast hey can you fly oh um yes thank you for saving me so um what's your name I'm dead day hmm what a phrases goons is on the move this energy is that DeJoria this is perfect I can more than handle him all by myself [Music] taehyeon freezer now would be downright suicide my next moves generally easy prey [Music] Vegeta hey there it's been quite some time to Doria I've waited for you to foolishly leave Frieza side knocking you around should be easy enough without Frieza here you think you're hot stuff don't you do yourself a favor shut up and just hand over that Scouter of yours do that and I'll let you live just this once is that so you and completely radio silent during your attack on the namekian village which can obviously mean only one thing you've lost every single one of your Scouters haven't you how perfect now I can make my way over there unnoticed you want this don't you I guess you're not as dumb as you look Vegeta [Music] what are you doing why did you break it yo idiot don't you realize you're not going to be able to find any machines without it I recently spent some time on the planet called Earth believe it or not they don't require Scouters in order to sense power there was another saying there as well and he also knew how to use that technique which means in elite like myself should easily master it that's it then isn't it those little runts I was after they were earthlings what are you doing teaming up with those punks what Earthlings what the hell are you talking about there's no way Earthlings could be out here enough of this nonsense stop wasting time and come at me already I see what's going on here you've come to realize just how much stronger I've gotten and now you're too afraid to fight me you saw my power level on your skelter before didn't you number wasn't accurate my Scouter was busted [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] ha [Music] [Music] prepare yourself [Music] [Music] [Music] got a gun [Music] that's what it means to be a mighty Saiyan warrior [Music] [Music] [Music] yourself worthy [Music] yeah don't underestimate don't underestimate me [Music] wait Vegeta if you let me go I'll let you in on a little secret but it ain't so little it's a big one so it's about the home of your people it's about planet Vegeta what what is it spit it out you probably heard all this before how planet Vegeta was destroyed by some huge meteorite but that's not the truth what happened is a bunch of crazy strong Saiyans like yourself started cropping up all over the place and the more powerful they got the more they didn't see the point in following orders from anybody Lord Frieza lost trust in you guys and because of that he felt he needed to lay down the law and oh did he Lord Frieza ended up not just destroying planet Vegeta but every single Saiyan himself but you know Vegeta you should be grateful Lord Frieza saw a lot of potential in you too much to waste so he made sure to destroy the planet when you weren't there I bet that was a lot to take in huh you're wrong about that tutoria I couldn't care less about my planet my comrades or even my parents but what infuriates me to no end is how I let myself be used all this time by bastards like you thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach freezes terrified of the limitless potential of a Saiyans power if what I heard on the scouter is to be believed then all seven dragonballs are needed in order to make a wish come true first I'll get my hands on the two remaining Dragon Balls no one should be more than sufficient if I can hide even just one of them Frieza and his lackeys won't be able to make their wish a reality then all I have to do is wait until their guard is down and steal the rest of them [Music] we're finally back well you guys certainly took your time didn't you took your time huh uh who's the pocket-sized piccolo he's an emetic isn't he what's your name little guy yes my name is Dendy huh it looks like you guys have been through a lot oh yeah that's right I've got great news from my dad really that's great Goku's on his way here as we speak he should arrive in about six days and I hear he's toughening himself up [Music] six days remained Angela would arrive on Planet Namek Doku can you hear me Goku wait huh where are you oh that's right you're heading to Namak could not find you the Dragon Balls wait a minute you mean you don't know what's going on there's some crazy stuff going down on Namek crazy stuff well we can talk about that later I've actually got some guests here with me in fact it's for people you know quite well oh wait you don't mean they've asked me to train them even harder than I trade you hey Goku you hear me we met up with commie in the other world and he told us all about this place you said there's four of them in there right so that's Yamcha ten wait is it pick a little air - huh I'm not about to let you be the only one that gets stronger in all of this couch is here with us too gommi pulled some strings and let us have our bodies back so we can train here pretty cool of him ah that's awesome glad to hear it I'm doing a bit of training myself on the way to Namak I had my spaceship customized to simulate a hundred times gravity for some extra tent training but if I don't get stronger in the next five days I'm gonna be in some pretty big trouble you mentioned that before what exactly is going to happen what whoa you mean there's someone out there that's stronger than Vegeta please are you beats me I didn't hear anything about a Frieza you know him King Kai yes and Goku if it's actually Frieza then stay far away from him get out I'm telling you not just for your own safety but for the safety of Earth Namek and then we are the planet in the universe is he really that strong I kinda wanna meet him now do not go anywhere near him you hear me [Music] I'm looking for some sort of elder I'm here to retrieve the Dragonball [Music] battle for the Dragonborn Krillin do you feel that yeah a bunch of energy just started disappearing really worn namekians are being killed and the one doing the killing has a very familiar energy its Vegeta now it's not just Frieza we got to worry about wishing for immortality but Vegeta - if we can find one of the Dragon Balls and hide it neither of them will be able to make their wish but but they'll just continue killing namekians until they find all the Dragon Balls know who are you people where did you come from and how do you know about the Dragon Balls please if you can't save my people yeah about that [Music] well if you already know I think I think I understand what's going on now come on follow me I'll take you to see grand elder guru huh grand elder guru why are we headed there [Music] those monsters that attacked our villages already have four Dragon Balls [Music] not only that didn't you say that there are more people being killed over there yeah I think I know who did it Vegeta their energy it's all gone there's no one left but then then that means there aren't many namekians left on this planet oh man even if we find the Dragon Ball in the village that Vegeta attacked that's still leaves one weight this grand elder guru have the last Dragon Ball yes not good Vegeta reaches it before us you'll get his hands on the seventh Dragon Ball look we have to hurry my guru no I'll go with Dendi go on and Bulma you two wait here there's no point in all of us going okay right be careful you guys [Music] so this must be a dragon ball fascinating they must be kept safe time to hide it no one could possibly find it as long as it remains at the bottom of this lake if it's true that fries and his worms have five that means just one is left out there this power it's czar bond I'm sure of it it would appear that he's finally off that leash of ease [Music] you
