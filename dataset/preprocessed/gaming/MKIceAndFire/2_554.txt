here's your payment thanks again [Music] welcome [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i know i'm sick but i'm trying to hang in there when i see how hard you're fighting i want to do the same i know yonah but don't hurt yourself okay you need to be careful too i will and i'll be back soon with some medicine [Music] what do you know about this junk heap i guess there are ancient ruins buried there it's full of old scrap and other weird stuff that no one understands to get there we have to cross the iron bridge to the northeast hopeless says these huge metal crates used to cross that bridge all the time in the old world humans certainly were wise back then i don't know if they were so smart why did we end up like this [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] jacob i'm hungry i know hold on maybe we have some old bread [Music] here hey there oh welcome please come in what is this place it's my shop i'm the finest smith in these parts uh usually see my brother and i build items from scrap we find in the junkie but we're a little low on supplies at the moment the junk heap you say that's right oak say it used to be a military base i don't know about that but there's lots of great stuff in there it's not exactly the safest place in the world but we gotta eat you know so it's just the two of you out here our father died when gideon was very young and mom is she's out right now getting supplies but i'm sure she'll be mom's been gone for seven days when's she coming back seven days that's a long time it's getting harder to find good scrap she probably had to go deeper into the heap i said i'm hungry so if you had the materials would you be able to upgrade our weapons well yeah but it's really dangerous in there right now so we no problem we'll go you you will i want to upgrade my weapon and besides you need inventory for your shop right well yes but it's settled then what do you need well to improve your weapon i'll need three titanium alloys you can get them from the defense robots around the mountain got it here's a map of the complex you're probably gonna need it and be careful please it's gotten really scary in there [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] hey it is bright in here looks like the ancient machinery is still working not that we have any idea how it works ruins from ancient times patrol for eons by unstoppable machines yeah and i bet they're full of rare [Music] materials [Music] so [Music] [Music] wow this place is hardly befitting one of my grand stature you sure do like to complain vice [Music] uh it doesn't seem to be working i could stick [Music] let's go [Music] so [Music] it's pretty rough in here yes hardly suitable work for children they both looked so skinny too i'm certain the elder has been giving his share of their food to his brother [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it seems we have been shut in [Music] [Music] [Music] it's done [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] that should do it [Music] so [Music] [Music] you ever wish you could just warp back to the client after you get their stuff [Music] yeah it's apparently a kind of magic that can zap you to far away places in an instant ah that one well i would stay away from such devilry where i knew land how come because all of the sages who attempted said spell were reduced to mincemeat when they struck obstacles in their path uh wow all right then walking it is an excellent choice [Music] it's time [Music] how [Music] so [Music] [Music] i hate being alone i want to go find mom oh hello again we got your materials ah thank you so much i'll get right to work on your weapon normally i charge you something but you can have this one for free [Music] here you go and thanks again this ought to keep us going for a while longer i want to find mom is everything okay i'm sorry he's impatient for our mom to come back and thinks we should go look for her we just need to wait okay she'll be back soon [Music] i want to find mom nice yes yes i know we're off to search for the misplaced mother aren't we [Music] please no i already owe you far more than i can ever repay ah don't even worry about it you don't understand our mother is never mind mom usually goes pretty deep inside the mountain you're gonna need to use the elevator so i'd better give you the activation [Music] all right he said their mom would be somewhere deep inside the mountain right if i may ask what is it that possesses you to meddle in the affairs of these children jonah and i both know what it feels like to miss your mother [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] oh is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] i could still here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this time [Music] i could still [Music] you can't possibly believe their mother managed to fight her way down here [Music] or for that matter that she has been collecting scrap metal for a solid week [Music] open your eyes lad the woman is clearly she's alive miracles don't happen if you don't believe in them okay [Music] miracles jesus [Music] all right [Music] wow [Music] alert alert intruder detected unauthorized [Laughter] [Music] it appears that only machines remain in this infernal place what's going on [Music] [Applause] it's malfunctioning yeah this might be a [Music] problem be aware of your surroundings no mere machine can defy us stay focused advice [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so don't let yourself be crushed oh you think come on now what clear them all out that's the only way [Music] [Music] this thing's got all kinds of moves [Music] now all that remains is that oversized hate it would seem magic has no effect against the [Music] these head are loaded with bombs [Music] [Music] it's working unbelievable such an obvious weak point [Music] stupid machine good keep after it [Music] is uh [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a woman and she's dead i fear we have discovered the delinquent mother so who's this other person um it's a male this bag has nice clothes in it and money too why would she bring this stuff here it would seem she abandoned her children to seek comfort in the arms of a swain oh that's awful so much for miracles instead we have discovered the possible truth what will you tell the children i don't know [Music] what's this a perfume bottle it smells of roses i guess we should bring this back to them where's mom she's uh she's in heaven now what it's true your mother's left this world liar i don't believe you [Music] did she die alone uh well it's okay i know all about it just tell me did she die with the one she loved we found two bodies it appears they left this life as one okay that's okay come again mom was always so frustrated you know torn between her duty to us and her heart i think i think maybe this is for the best are you saying you forgive her i mean she's my mom you know the only one i'll ever have [Music] we found this next to her this is mom's perfume it smells like her damn it i can't let myself cry if gideon sees me like this [Music] dammit i hope i did the right thing hey safe travels okay and thank you for everything your actions were just never doubt it [Music] [Music] [Music] yonah yonah what is it it hurts oh yonah i'll go get some medicine okay just hang on wait what is it just don't do anything dangerous stop worrying already the black scroll appears to be advancing at a furious rate she needs something to stop her pain let's see if popola has any ideas [Music] hey popola do you have any pain medicine pain medicine it's for yonah her pain is it's getting really bad that poor girl well i guess we could try a shaman fish what's that it's a fish found near seafront their livers contain a chemical that's said to dull even the strongest pain that sounds perfect how do i get there you can find seafront out past the southern plains shades have been spotted there recently though so be careful [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] let's go [Music] [Music] right [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] damn shades go away that villager is under attack die you fell

i'm so tired [Music] there's a rough going on these old bones what if he returns today can't let the lighthouse stay dark [Music] i doubt we'll have much luck blundering about blindly for a shaman fish what should we do i don't even know what one looks like so if you've got a better idea i'm all ears perhaps we could try asking some of the townspeople for advice works for me heck we might even find a place that sells them [Music] a shaman fish i think they used to sell those at the fish shop but hey since you're here how about some fresh fruits and veggies for the road [Music] thanks for your business [Music] you're friends with that sexy postman aren't you i just love a man in uniform oh we're not well you're pretty nice looking yourself i haven't seen the postman in a few days i hope he's all right [Music] do [Music] what [Music] so [Music] shaman fish oh sure sure they're a cinch practically jump into the net they do i won't do it for you so take this pole and go fish one up yourself oh and you can't catch them here at the pier go dip your line at the big beach on the west side of town how do you fish is that a serious question you gotta move your body away from where the fish is going got it yeah let me give you a lure while i'm at it fishing is a test of wheels between man and beast never give up the fight [Music] let's head over to that beach the fishermen met i didn't catch a thing yesterday which meant dinner was seaweed wrapped seaweed i better make a serious haul today let me tell you [Music] welcome i'm afraid [Music] [Music] so [Music] yes we're all set
