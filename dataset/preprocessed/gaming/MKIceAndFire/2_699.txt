afford it that's carrie's fave looks like he's showering alone too good thing believe me okay leave the rest to me i'll get him out of there drop one of misty special pills let's go okay ah feels so

you've just popped by the [ __ ] all over my life well i'ma lose my damn mind oh it is a heartbreaker oh [ __ ] remember the one damn time henry showed up sober and clean as a whistle uh-huh and played absolute tripe at least danny was happy looking at him now those really were the best of times playing [ __ ] rap infested dumps argued before every gig had no idea what we wanted to play and never had ned do our name nancy control freak henry smelled like zappers and piss i was always stealing your pants hella good times man never did get what denny saw on that guy i mean smart in that one maybe too smart for the company she kept nah then he always went for losers capable of addressing himself oh hank was perfect half a brain and high all the time she got to rescue him over and over again why'd she never try and fix me i would have to get in line that's why stuff about you being depressed it true nope promo strategy suicide attempts too think putting a bullet through your skull
