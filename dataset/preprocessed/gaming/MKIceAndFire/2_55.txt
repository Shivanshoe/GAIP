concentration here and now where it belongs but master yoga said i should be mindful of the future but not at the expense of the moment be mindful of the living force young padawan yes master this way ambassadors make yourselves comfortable my master will be with you shortly how do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands these federation types are cowards the negotiations will be short when they finally begin you mean is it in their nature to make us wait this long no i sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute [Music] that didn't sound trivial dioxis we need to get out of here [Music] so much for the negotiation a lightsaber should make short work of that glass door or we can simply fight our way around it how should we proceed master oh [Music] over there it's an invasion army we have to get down to the planet and warm in the booth let's go aboard one of these ships [Music] oh no away [Music] your humble servant let's get out of here before more george show up jar jar we need to find somewhere safe and warn the naboo of this invasion excuse me but the most spacious place would be ottabunga this is a

beetles foreign a droid army is about to attack the naboo we shall know we must warn them what is to become of inks here recall with him [Music] ah master what's a bongo or transport i hope i'm more

blockade [Music] little droid did it [Music] there's not enough power to get us to coruscant the hyperdrive is leaking here master tatooine it's small out of the way the trade federation has no presence there tatooine you say do you suggest him home where we should land the monsters baseball seems like our best option for finding the parts we need mos especially but land on the outskirts we don't want to attract attention so [Music] wait her highness commands that i go with you she's curious about the planet i'm padme one of the queen's handmaidens this is not a good idea but if the queen wishes it now we need to find a mechanic selling the parts we need let's ask around i know what you need you need a cute little propeller hat for that grubby looking astromech of yours that'll give the little guy some confidence no fooling nah i don't know nothing about no ship repairs hey how's about you head down the street here to take in a pod race or two much more exciting than fixing hyper drives i'll tell you what let me guess looking for ship parts thought so everyone is you'll be wanting to pay watto a visit you'll find a shop across town 327 nubian i have 20 000 republic duct

tells me you want to sponsor him in the race well i've acquired a part in the game of chance i wager my new racing pod against say the boy and his mother nope is with two slaves [Music] if that's

senate to discuss the matter there the supreme chancellor has called for a special session of the senate to discuss the situation on naboo though i must be frank he has little real power and it is unlikely the senate will act on the invasion i believe our best is for her majesty to push for the election of a new supreme chancellor who can take control and give us justice ah here we are these transport ships will take us to the senate building i have some prior business to attend to so i shall go on ahead once you're ready come find me in my office we shall proceed to the meeting until

senator amidala your tragedy on the landing platform terrible i think that count dooku was behind it count dooku was once a jedi he couldn't assassinate anyone master jedi may i suggest that the senator be placed under the protection of your graces perhaps someone you're familiar with annie my goodness you've grown so have you grown more beautiful i mean well now that everyone's been reacquainted allow us to escort you to your quarters senator thank you mr kenobi but this seems unnecessary i don't need more security i need answers i need to know who's trying to kill me we're here to protect you senator not to start an investigation we will find out who's trying to kill you padme i promise you we will not exceed our mandate by young padawan learner i meant it in the interest of protecting her master of course perhaps with merely your presence the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed is it much farther master is mine and padme's company boring you already my padawan no of course not master i didn't mean we aren't far my apartment is just up ahead here we are shall we thank you for getting me here safely now if you'll excuse me i will retire hmm [Music] stay here there she is don't let her get away and be precise with your shots there are civilians everywhere we'll stop her master i promise hey well if we could not crash before doing so i'd greatly appreciate it you need to relax i'm a great pilot you've much to learn about many things by young apprentice and flying is certainly one of them [Music] [Music] watch out for that power coupling do [Music] ahead they've gone in that tunnel we almost have them [Music] [Music] [Music] keep on the mannequin as my flying improved master and i'm still alive so there's that [Music] who hired you it was a bounty hunter card [Applause] toxic dart we'll have to split up escort senator amidala back to naboo she'll be safer there of course master r4 i think you can help me with something an old friend at the diner nearby knows all about the sort of things let's see if he recognizes this dog shall we um all right don't blow your top i'm going fast as i can that's dex let's see what the problem is you've uh caught me at a bad time my best waitress wanda has blown a fuse and i can't keep up with all these customers think you could help out an old buddy and take some orders to the right tables i gotta fix up old wander as soon as we get finished i'm all yours so what do you say please all you got to do is find out what each customer ordered and take them the right dish if a droid can do it i'm sure a jedi can better late than never that's definitely not a nuna drumstick if it is those nooner are not doing so good sorry definitely not enough layers to be my six six layer cake my jawa juice thanks at this point it would have been quicker to fly wow let me add it that's it thanks a lot looks delicious did everyone get their orders great i really owe you one and so this one took a fair bit of elbow grease but i'm happy to say she'll be back washing tables in no time now what do you want to talk about grab a seat and i'll be right with you tell me what this is what you got here is a kamino saber dart kamino i'm not familiar with it is it in the republic no no it's beyond the outer rim these uh camino are huh keep to themselves they're kroners [Music] no r4 i don't recall camino on any of the usual charts let's head to the archives [Music] i've never heard of camino either let's run the coordinates decks gave us through the jedi archives see if we can find out more about it make your own [Music] won't take you too long just sit back and relax hey thanks for driving with us enjoy your visit to the federal district so where's your final destination on the way bye okay r4 upload the data dex gave us to the terminal according to dex camino should be right here but there's just empty space hmm lost a planet master obi-wan has how embarrassing there's nothing there gravity silhouette remains huh very good go to the center of gravity's pole and find your planet you will master yoda who could empty information from the archives that's impossible isn't it only a jedi could have erased those files but who and why harder to answer meditate on this i will [Music] need a ride cross planet hop in save travels friend hello i've had a fresh update so my existence has meaning again apparently yes this should be the right system keep your eyes peeled for our missing planet [Music] uh master jedi i've been expecting you welcome after all these years i was beginning to think you weren't coming unexpected of course please tell your master that his order will be completed on time 200 000 units are ready with a million more on the way i'm sure he'll be quite proud of the army with built for him the army yes a clone eye but you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself now please [Music] when my master first contacted you about the operation did he say who it was for of course he did master seifer diaz ordered this army for the republic i'm sorry that's decides but he was killed almost 10 years ago i'm so sorry to hear that very impressive i'd hoped you would be pleased clones can think creatively you will find that they are immensely superior to droids i'm sure they're not talking about you or paul these clones how old are you oh yes we use growth acceleration otherwise a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow i see they are totally obedient taking any order without question we modify their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original ghost and who was the original host a bounty hunter called jengo fett a bounty hunter i would very much like to meet this django fat and i would be very happy to arrange it for you apart from his pay which is considerable fett demanded only one thing an unaltered clone for himself curious isn't it unaltered pure genetic replication no tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration ah okay this he's come to check on our progress your clones are very impressive you must be very proud who hired you for this job i was recruited by a man called tyranis do you like your army [Music] i look forward to seeing them in action thank you for your time django always a pleasure to meet a jedi i have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for if our suspicions are correct he'll be wanting to leave quickly we best head to the nearest landing pad i'll handle this oh can see why they wanted to clone him [Music] we mustn't let them get too far ahead let's go horse reflexes have their advantages now there's no time to waste let's follow him [Music] oh um uh um [Music] [Music] [Music] dad i think we've been tracked hang on son we'll move into the asteroid field then we'll have a couple of surprises for them [Music] stand by this is going to be a bumpy ride [Music] he's around here somewhere i've got you now this won't be much of a fight homing missiles splendid type of charge get out of here you're making my life more difficult than it needs to be [Music] [Music] you can't shake me that easily bounty hunter you this is a waste of my talent [Music] anakin would be loving this [Music] actually going into an asteroid field i must be crazy don't come any closer you're trying my patience [Music] what are you hiding who hired you i'm not here to play silly again your move why don't you just give up [Music] so [Music] you [Music] get him dad get him r4 jettison the spare parts [Music] [Music] there's an unusual concentration of federation ships over there r4 hmm yes my lord i trust our plans are proceeding accordingly certainly with these droids the republic and

thank you master mundy supportive as always perhaps fully would insult me more oh oh [Applause] huh [Music] the jedi have amassed a huge army my master will never allow the republic to get away with this treachery i will take the designs to coruscant it will be much safer there if dooku escapes rally more systems to his cause he will look over i can't leave her don't let your personal feelings get in the way follow that speeder we must follow dooku into that stronghold up ahead padme we have a job to do anakin what do you think padme would do if she were in your position she would do her duty how are we gonna get up there master there will be something in that wreckage we can use come good to see you alive we were following dooku this way but we took a direct hit knocked us out of the sky like a sack of karelian spuds this gunship isn't much use now so if you need it for parts or jedi business help yourself oh we're trapped [Music] it is imperative that dooku does not escape we can worry about our exit later yes master which way shall we proceed master it matters not so long as we reach dooku before he flees the planet [Music] [Applause] if he asks it was like that when we got here yeah [Music] [Music] huh uh obviously doesn't have many guests huh um [Music] time to make our big entrance remember keep your head welcome young jedi i trust your padawan is behaving himself
