to that goal you know the arrest protocols all memorized sir first thing we do first thing you do is apologize we're legitimate business-like folk on legitimate-like business we're not hunting an illegal creature in illegal space illegal there's so much wrong with this arrest hey no way a kid should be i'm an official trainee and b i'm very very close friends with the captain uh-huh hold it right here is there a problem yes no fake energy no power no power no containment a single scenario techs are looking at it they say that they cannot even fathom how can they fix what they cannot understand put the grand unifier's mind at ease run the scanners again but the flark is a grand unifier grand unifier raker leader of the church of universal something he was floating dead in the quarantine zone looking for god pirates let's go we caught him just like we caught you the difference is i know the captain as i was saying if you just tell the captain that mom explicitly said she doesn't want to see you yeah quill wait did she just say i admit it you know nothing just to be super clear hold on [Music] hey kid are you there nova girl yeah yeah i think so let me just see if we

you know you have a cadet butt saver okay peter so listen i have some good news and some bad news about your friends uh start with the bad i guess your friends have been processed and couldn't break so what's the good news they're not dead one of them actually seems really active flark pipe's mr first should we try using that thingamajig of yours to call someone we don't need help i know what i'm doing now help me block this fire so we can get through sure just that everyone must be worried captain's kid goes missing captain's kid is still a corpsman now are you gonna help me or not easy does it there see you don't need to worry about me enough people around here do that already for what it's worth i think you're doing great as good an arresting officer as i've ever had are you seriously trying to sneak away on me right now you literally just said i was doing great you are doing great top five best arresting officers i've ever had cool so can you please just show me the same respect you would any other arresting officer that's exactly what i'm doing so we're agreed that you owe me one right no by my count i've saved you at least as much as you saved me unbelievable yeah i get that a lot is that robot wearing makeup what oh yeah that's just it's i um i know all the bots down here they're kind of my friends i guess i reprogrammed most of them i gave them faces maybe no i mean it's cool gives them personality very cool come on this way you're in luck by the way the brig got disinfected recently okay wow that's just blatantly gonna ignore me and go crawling into a dead end regulation two b prisoners must stay close at all times where do you think you're going just making sure this place is safe and secure from the you know fire does your mom know you play down here probably not but what else am i gonna do not like there's any other kids on board you know i didn't have a lot of friends at your age either granted i was in prison but still so mom was right about you it was a shittari prison i was just a kid i have so many questions were your parents in prison too no my mom [Music] died i didn't know my dad how do you know my mom exactly uh we fought together on mercury during the war she was a is a real spitfire more like real controlling and bossy and judgmental you're just a kid nikki you don't know what's good for you nikki stay out of the escape pods mickey i kind of know what you mean you do this is a new low peter even for you peter it's restricted space peter yep that's her i'm still in charge here you know of course you are this way quick reminder that only one of us knows the way out could have fooled me it's a dead end trust me of course i trust you clearly if this is an attempt to escape your mom's ship i really need to know because i may or may not be super interested just really need to make sure it doesn't look like a kidnapping what no no oh wow don't laugh no no this is cool it's like your secret hideout right i definitely prefer this to the brig we're not staying i just need to check on ultimo these gyros have been all screwy take your time is this your mom single-handedly winning the war obviously i know she didn't do it by herself no that final push was uh it was a massive team effort were you there uh i contributed the war effort differently pirating raiding which is you know the good kind of pirating hey this is mercury right uh-huh it's supposed to represent this big battle mom was part of you said you were there right oh yeah your mom was dead in the water until me and the ravager showed up you should really fix this you want me to draw you in in the interest of historical accuracy a universal translator i wonder if it speaks group something tells me you and rocket would get along or really really not get along one of those two the raccoon thing yeah he seemed real charming i just mean he's also really into all this tech stuff is this creelar uh yeah long time ago kid stuff i could do it way better now no no it's good morbid but good need a hand nope but thanks i'm almost done hey secret stuff off limits no adults i get it anyway i'm all done here we should probably give back before mom completely freaks yeah i've seen your mom overreact before it's like i'm not a kid anymore you know tell me about it so you get where i'm coming from right like if you do end up talking to my mom the subject of me happens to come up because the truth is i wasn't exactly supposed to say no more i'll make sure carell knows what a good job you did no i mean thanks but ideally mom never needs to know i was in the hangar at all so i never saw you exactly never saw me never saw my pesky you may have heard of nikki gold and how cool she is but that's it almost at the elevator we're home free almost there seriously just give me a sec come on come on need a hand yes got it mom i can explain i'm fine i'm seriously a-okay barely a scratch what in holla's name were you thinking sneaking out with an arresting squad running around with criminals alleged criminals you almost died do you have any idea how grounded you are right now mom you promised to give me more leeway lee weight doesn't mean lying to my officers or sneaking around behind my back look it's my fault some guy's ship blew up restricted areas are restricted for a reason you treat me like a prisoner you're a child are you even listening oh whoa we've all been through a lot today let's just all take a deep breath and recognize that maybe we've all made some mistakes make sure the fire is out and the hanger's secure yes commander and find out why that churchman's shuttle exploded grand unifier raker has been less than cooper make him cooperate and you two with me i knew you'd overreact you always overreact even peter was saying so oh he was was he i suspect peter misspoke something he often tends to do so i suggest you worry less about what he said and more about what i'm saying now what you did was extremely dangerous for what it's worth nikki totally saved my butt if you handle herself really well you have every reason to be proud of her coming from you peter is worth extraordinarily little why are you being mean to him just listen to what he's saying i don't care what he's saying upper level captain's quarter initiate log down locked up initiated what are you gonna kill us in theory these doors don't open until i say so yeah i know how lockdown works i don't think you do because somehow you keep bypassing every security measure on this ship and i want to know how or you can just show me mom i seriously have no idea what you're talking about isn't this like against galactic law or something you know this reminds me of the last time i was stuck in an elevator i was with the shia girl and she ew what is wrong with you she was a lovely person someone please get out of here no one leaves until you tell me what i want to know [Music] you already know everything no i don't i know you're a magnet for danger and that you somehow keep getting caught in restricted areas of this ship i'm small okay i fit into places being small doesn't get you past security or through the hangar bay checkpoint or the maintenance tunnel blast doors or even into the sub-level i just found you in there was that system-wide glitch remember yeah yeah security was down for a while no it wasn't seemed pretty down to me are you seriously lying for a 12 year old right now 12. oh wow i thought she was at least 16. peter what she really knew her stuff she's a smart kid too smart she keeps bypassing security unless you have a level 6 access to my ship all of a sudden didn't think so new collect gold empty your pockets no do em to your pockets nikki what i know you're hiding something i'm not i still have feelings for you excuse me not like feelings feelings more like emotions you know because the explosion and me and you and everything we went through back in the war [Music] i'm good now okay good now if you don't mind [Music] look mom i'm not hiding anything i wouldn't do that to be continued disengage log down lock down disengage so can i go help secure the hanger now no you can go back to your quarters and you can stay there for the next 30 rotations but mom i can make it 30 cycles so rough day huh exploding shuttles quarantine zone trespassers missing kid i have no idea julie i can't believe you still have them i can't believe you survived mercury was white like a thousand degrees more like a thousand cycles ago you can keep him if you want he is yours hey i ordered him to look out for you expect him to keep doing his job especially you now have a daughter apparently 12 year old daughter we didn't have during the war 12 years ago when we peter when we picked up your ship part of me was excited at first then after all this time you haven't changed at all you're still the same i've changed whatever the fine is i'll pay just give me three cycles let me prove that i'm not still whatever it is you're going to finish that sentence with you're going to pay 7 000 units in three cycles wow um okay that is a lot of money here i was thinking that maybe the fines non-negotiable my search party found a disturbing amount of prohibited tech lying around your ship well that's all they found right okay okay you'll get your money on time no problem this guardians of the galaxy thing we are this close to getting it off the ground and if i didn't have these handcuffs on i would show you just how very close we are why do i feel like i'll regret this no come on when have i ever you won't regret it promise you've got three cycles peter not four not five three contact me when you've got the units and if we don't the device we installed will deactivate your ship and you will all go to prison gotcha we won't let you down what the hell peter you said you could get us out of this i did seven thousand units is a small six thousand units that is a tremendous sum where are we gonna get that kind of money in three cycles by robbing a freaking bank apparently okay so we got fined so we have a nova tracking thing on our ship that's gonna shut down our engines if we don't pay that fine in three cycles at least we're not on a prisoner transport not yet oh come on guys you're drax the destroyer man you killed thanos allegedly are you gonna let a little fine slow you down and gamora you're practically an mi6 agent but way harder and cooler there's nothing you can't do here it comes rocky you're an actual genius and the scrappiest dude i know how many prisons did you break out of seven seven you are groot guys we're supposed to be a team all we need to do is figure out how broke we are and come up with a plan so check your quarters check between the sofas check under the crafting bench if you find any spare units lying around grab them i'll do the same in my quarters all right this is why you don't sleep with cops quill they put bombs on my ship my ship i am watching you rodent what's that supposed to mean it is common knowledge that rodents hoard nuts stolen technology units ah okay first off i ain't a hoarder nor a rodent i know you have a stash hidden aboard this ship fetch it now there ain't nothing to fetch groot blew our stash on contraxia and the rest i gave to quill and gamora for the das quarantine zone access code peter quill tell the rodent that his selfishness endangers us all rocky we could really use any extra units you have how do i gotta spell it out for you i don't got no units fair enough you believe his lies oh i ain't lying now why don't you leave me alone and bother someone else instead i intend to what do you want quill if you're looking for units check your own room so you're here to talk or uh you just want a gear upgrade it'd be a lot better if we didn't have three cycles to pay a fine hey remember that time on conlar with the badoon and that really hot azkavarian girl yeah her buddies would have spaced your stupid humy butt if me and groot hadn't busted in i had things under control mostly too bad you're broke quill i should be charging you for all the times we saved you name one other time you saved me contraxia nowhere paramitar ceres contraxia again malador okay okay okay so i owe you big i should have turned you in for yondu's bounty sure scott wouldn't be scrounging for units to pay off your nova girlfriend ex-girlfriend but admit it you like being a guardian of the galaxy still on the fence about the brand name but uh keeping the milano as collateral was a pretty smart move never agreed to that if you'd rather i turn you in don't worry i know you put a lot into this team i'll make it up to you you better if you want to make it up to me find a way to pay this flark and fine if i had a unit for every minute of my time you waste with your flark and ideas guys don't forget to close the fridge sure thing mom lord peter quill order the tree to open this door i am certain that the rodent has hidden a stash of units within the latrine he must have asked his well-meaning accomplice to retrieve the sum and hide it from us all right i'll check on him and tell you if he's doing anything weird acceptable you okay in there i think you could open the door for a minute is that my toothbrush great now i need a new toothbrush any units i uncover will go directly to you but i am unsure the others will do the same so you're taking the whole find the units thing pretty seriously it is a serious matter yeah yeah i totally get it we're all afraid of going back to prison i am not afraid of going back to prison oh good because i'm not either mostly in the kiln i was surrounded by criminals murderers and thieves they taught me a harsh lesson assassins and bounty hunters cannot be trusted okay wow don't you think maybe you're calling the kettle black i have not mentioned kitchenware it it's an earth thing what i mean is you're a convicted mass murderer i used to be a pirate we're not exactly upstanding citizens you and i honor our word i cannot say the same for the others you could be wrong drax you won't know until you give them a chance we will see hey gamora you're supposed to knock what are you doing you're supposed to be looking for money i did and i don't have any also what's with the dolls do you value your life is that a trick question okay yes mostly i value my life good then pretend like you saw nothing and get out see you in the lounge out got it why you gotta be so paranoid big guy you didn't mind trusting me on hanshi trust you repaid by attempting to rob our employer i told you i was just testing their security measures so you claimed let me guess you're watching me i am what do you think i'm gonna do conjure some units from thin air can you do that no ah looks broken maybe rocket can fix it group hey buddy i was just uh checking to see if everything was okay and it is okay too bad this translator's busted i was hoping it might have groot stored on it or something that way i could download it into my translator i'd love to know what your thoughts are on stuff without you know rocket always filtering it [Music] you know i didn't always have a translation implant i mean i was feeling spanish before i left the earth not that spanish would have prepared me for all of this man those first few years do you know how hard it was to get by without having any idea what people were saying half the languages out here sound like white noise weird birds and messed up theremins i don't even want to know what rocket actually sounds like tv did not prepare me for the realities of living in space let me tell you honestly man you're lucky you have rocket i mean i know what it's like to be surrounded by people and have no one understand you how lonely that can be i'd have been lost you must have been lost too before rocket and and us i probably don't say this enough but you really are an important part of the team i can't imagine the gardeners of the galaxy without groot and who knows if this thing does have your language in it and rocket can download it somehow or hack it or i don't know it'd be nice to finally talk to you for real actually hold that thought yo rocket what can you come here for a sec what do you want quill i'm busy think you can see if this translator has groot's language on it it doesn't you didn't even check don't need to cheap scut like that don't have rare language packages and even if it did it's beyond salvageable really wait do you have groce language package installed in your translation implant do i look like i'm made of units only folks have got that language package they're rich people so you actually speak groot then you mean talinism and yeah i speak it more or less me and group and bounty hunting together for a decade before you came along quill when you've been working together that long you develop a common understanding you say misunderstandings i say open to interpretation they didn't go sour we didn't need those jobs anyway so you guys learned to understand each other over time and with the help of a spreadsheet of groot's lexicon which ain't no easy feat when your entire language sounds like i am and groot so there's hope for us yet glad we had this little i chat awesome cool so got any ideas to get those units together do you have investments you think i look like an investment type of guy you are a risk taker exactly i don't sit behind no desk all day hoping for real estate fluctuations i go out and i do stuff perhaps we are somewhat alike smells like llama breath what is in that container on your work table your mom's love letters my mother did not write love letters she displayed her affection by hunting large game animals for my father to cook ugh now i'm hungry hmm what if we contacted one of the assassin's disreputable sources sure you don't really mean that what were you saying one of those informants is bound to be of value to novacore you want to sell out one of gamora's guys if they are murderers then justice would be served and we could negotiate an extension of our fine huh well if uh i wasn't so sure gamora would stab you in your sleep just for suggesting it i think it was a pretty solid plan so how about a plan that won't get us skewered by a resident murder crumpet murder isn't always about you but i thought that yeah yeah i was talking about her so a plan i suggest we wait to hear what peter quill will propose quill he got us into this mess in the first place he ain't got a plan hey bluebird you copy i know you think i sold you out and uh gamora i was just who are you talking to what's a bluebird it um was yondu's call sign he was bluebird and i was the kid [Laughter] let me get this straight yondu danta leader of the ravager space virus scourge of the serious system and all-around scoundrel used bluebird as his call sign even added embroidered on the back of his jacket amazing it was amazing pretty much from the day we met how did you two meet terrans and centaurians aren't exactly neighbors we met on shitari prime about three years into my sentence wait yondu was a prisoner of war i i thought the ravagers were neutral they were and they also weren't yondu and i were cellmates first thing he said when they put him in my cell was boy don't be going and getting attached cause i'm just here for the food and the food was pretty terrible so yeah that sounds like yondu i had cellmates before and none of them lasted long the shitari have these gladiatorial games and you got used to people dying not sure about that but i didn't expect anyone to last long i also didn't have my translation implant back then so i might as well have been alone but yondu he actually spoke english said he'd offered to translate in exchange for extra rations so even in the snake infested hell hole ever the schemer it's something we had in common i've been scheming for a way to escape since the day they took me i just needed someone like yondu to make it seem possible how did you escape let's just say it was equal part simple complicated and kind of embarrassing but it ended with the two of us delivering a transport full of stolen supplies straight into the hands of the resistance for a buck a load of units too i bet anyway once we did there was no going back i was a ravager the ravagers had a simple code steal from everyone yondu said it made them neutral but they weren't i specifically remember several shitari transports being hit when i was still you know they hit just as many resistance ships until a shitari cruiser uncloaked in front of them during a raid and yondu ended up on chatari prime with you um after we broke out he could have left me on some space station or dropped me off the nearest nova corps base but he didn't instead he invited me to join the ravagers you were with them a long time must have enjoyed it i did being a ravager was the first time i felt like i really belonged if that makes any sense i felt the same way when i joined richard ryder and the resistance like i was finally in control of who i wanted to be yes exactly those first few years it was it was like i had joined this really big really dysfunctional family which now that i'm hearing it would make yondu my space dad could have been worse well if you don't mind i think i'd like to be alone for a bit oh yeah sure i'll see you around well well well let's see if we can find some stray units in here really 37 units we appear to be 6 963 units short if we intend to keep our ship peter quill i know i know we clearly need a plan and reconsider my initial proposal oh no not finn thank fume again yes we should go after finn fang phuong drax there are easier ways to get paid like what about selling gamora's crap what oh come on you've been hoarding them stupid knickknacks ever since you first joined us i mean don't tell me they ain't worth nothing quarantine zone was always my figurines are not knick-knacks team's in trouble then you can't be bothered to make no sack of course i will sacrifice your head and take us to the majestic mountains guys let's just hear drax out this time finn fang fume is the fiercest most legendary monster in the galaxy shatters the bones of all who go after it the skulls the greatest hunters are impaled upon its fangs imagine the glory of such a death our goal isn't death drax glorious death out of the question well in that case you're not selling my stuff i am he says we should combine both ideas sell gamora's trinkets to fin fang foom that is brilliant yeah you know the only problem with your plan is that lady hellbender only buys monsters and you are not a monster he's not he's the sweetest most no you don't this ain't something you can pretend oh yeah you want monster i'll show you monster whoa guys groot are you really offering to no no he is not offering that okay it could work sell groot i guess we could bust him out after absurd lady hellbender seeks the monster within the small ugly one is clearly the correct choice he is cruel sadistic and his soul is filthy and filled with rage monster queen would pay a great sum for such a creature really how great how are you okay with this cause i know what i am and i know what he ain't i am groot i vote we sell groot i honestly think lady hellbender will go for yeah well i vote for not i also vote for the creepy little beast two votes each peter well rocket's definitely scarier on the inside he's unstable and vicious and totally oblivious to the needs of others okay we uh we get it cool the point is is i think you'd make a fine monster and we'll definitely need that tactical brain of yours to bust you out once you're in there but just to be 100 sure you're definitely okay with this uh are you kidding i can't wait to hold this over you all right let's do this let's go sell a monster we're not seriously flying into that they say the weather patterns of secnarf9 are tied to the temperament of its ruler that's not how women work or weather anyways i'm sure it looks worse than it is there that's lady hellbender's fortress yes in close quill i don't want to walk in this no problem flying the wrong way nah he's not flying at all guys relax just one adjustment piece of cake you can't be serious what this way we can scope things out before we finish the transaction we're like a hundred clicks from her base you know how much i like scoping nope next time i'm flying monsters do not fly ships monsters do whatever they want [Music] don't you get all gloomy right now don't help because your constant complaining does you you are complaining about the short one complaining we're all complaining happy dry up that's what i want to do after this mission i don't know after we pay this fine let's he's going to say contracts again who cares if i'm predictable antraxia's got nice weather this could all have been avoided if the rodent had relinquished his hidden cache of units how many times do i gotta tell you i ain't got no units at least 43. that's how many times i've had to deny being a shape-shifter before drax moved on to something else i still have my doubts it's not possible for you to slip into combat armor this fast i use a lot of lotion why does this thing look so sinister hey who said you could touch that i don't go into your room and touch your stuff quill what you hacked my visor and added a scoreboard to it while i was sleeping ah that was different i improved it also did anyone tell you that you snore i thought drax was bad but wow quill you should really get that checked you sound like a torque i don't snore that loud yeah okay so what is this thing anyway it kind of looks like a metal face hugger that is clearly a spinal control unit yes right of course a spinal control thingy back on half world cree scientists use these to keep us super soldiers in line they'd press a big fun red button and zap instant obedience holy crap rocket what exactly did the cree do to you they ripped me apart and rebuilt me over and over and over again until i became this half-finished thing they could mold and shape and control oh rocket i had no idea i mean i knew the kree empire was desperate but do you know what it's like to lose all control of your body to be in constant pain trapped inside yourself and able to stop the horrible things you're doing [Laughter] that control unit made sure i did what i was supposed to do oh yeah whether i wanted to or not a neat furry little machine of death didn't take long to figure out i was better off not fighting it okay then let's shoot this thing out the airlock have a little middle finger salute ceremony to the bastards who built it uh i don't think i'm ready to let go of that part of me yet maybe one day are you 100 sure you want to keep it what if it controls me i decided a long time ago quote that i would never let anyone control me again as far as i'm concerned this is just another useful piece of junk and a few bad memories how many of you super soldiers were there on half world when decree started a hundred maybe by the time i escaped just me and lila she was the first one not to die from the control unit and lila is also a what a raccoon or not a raccoon you gotta understand she was afraid of them and the control unit made sure we stayed in line that i stayed in line oh that sounds awful i can't imagine so i did what i do best i found a way to overload the control unit when the blue skins let us out of our cage kaboom i blew a hole into the side of the lab well we didn't know what i didn't know was that the lab was protected by century bots we got to the security fence and lila covered me while i hacked the modulator frequency and as soon as it opened she pushed me through the door i heard a die quilt rocket matter now past is the past right and that thing it's just a reminder i'm sorry you had to go through all that rocket for real uh why don't we ever get missions on nice warm dry planets paramatar did have a nice forest because it was dry no we should not go we got it it's different hope that jacket of yours is waterproof they say that sectnarth9 is inhospitable to soft-bodied beings we shall see how you fare peter quill of course it had to be raining i hate wet are we going because i'm ready that's sweet but we both know you ain't got money to buy no umbrella we accomplished nothing by lingering in the ship how about staying dry that's an accomplishment okay here we go i ever mentioned how much i hate rain hellbender's castle isn't even that far and it's not a castle it is an impregnable fortress so how do we impregnate it ask peter let's just get closer we'll figure it out on the way there is nothing to figure out as beast merchants we will easily gain access to lady hellman good we've already got a beast all that's left is the merchant park good thing i put on my official merchant costume whoa that is some really crazy lightning out there never seen anything like it meteorological suicide is what it is ouch hey is my jacket all right at least you got a jacket some of us are soaking here less whining more walking hey storm lord we ain't seriously walking through this it'll take forever in this storm stop complaining the hardship will strengthen your spirit i face more than enough hardship thank you very much at least we'll have time to think about our sales [ __ ] small furry creature lightly used underwhelming the rodent has menacing fangs she'll focus on them talk about underwhelming you won't be so dismissive when i fight off your we got this we're still falling we'll be fine agreed let's face lady hellbender's rage almost sounds like you want to get hit by lightning i would not expect a chitari traitor to understand the underlying value the underlying value of getting killed or being direct you child of subterfuge what is your problem ladies duplicity and gentlemen your reputation is why she tests us blow your worst monstrous queen you know she can't control the weather right can we refocus here we're here to trick some lady not kill each other she's not just some lady lady hellbender the known warrior and the queen and sneaking wrench exactly she's a stinking rich warrior queen businesswoman and she won't be able to resist a good deal same as us perhaps some of us if lady aches that was way too close well played lady hellbender so we're still doing this yes guys keep an eye out on those big blue ones that take cover when they hit or we'll get thrown right off okay this might be more dangerous than i thought i thought you lived for danger yeah keyword live if any of you die i'm going back to the ship okay yes who landed on the wrong side of the planet everyone okay we should have gone to machu 4 hey check out the old resistance ship thing's been shot to hell no doubt by this one and they're chitari friends we weren't friends uh guys not sure [Music] but it ain't moving now it would be wary uh you know what i survived freaking half world [ __ ] scared us he's not alone get ready anyway [Music] vegan cake nice to meet you [Music] general life advice 12. slime speeding up the jelly is charging come on dude stay away from its problems i can't believe i needed help with that the jelly is got bigger charging right now no mushy whose idea was it to make these sharp on the inside so that's what a monster around here looks like we are outside lady hellbender's sanctuary creatures here are not her pets these sort of do look like food we're gonna be food if we don't climb out of here where the flock of figo you think it leads to the fortress hopefully this is having fun didn't think i'd ever be shooting at a resistance ship drax you could pull this reactor out gently right if it were combustible the rodents would have shut it by now he makes an excellent point i'll continue ripping it apart no no i think we're good great we made it halfway up now what maybe if we can lower that wing somehow there they are wind controls all right rocket that wind control panel is all yours i hope it still works great everyone watch out for beeping red lights what why this is a resistance ship we'll be lucky if there's only one booby trap on it that don't sound like no jelly thing they say that lady hellbender's call echoes throughout the planet that don't sound like no lady either what [Music] careful looks like something big moved through here yay let me guess some kind of monster thing good guess well done any chance it doesn't know we're here nope only question is which one of us that'll jump first it's probably not gonna jump us so uh these tracks gamora you're just messing with us right nope are you frightened rodent you sure you want to get lost out here relax i'm just looking around i am eager to experience lady hellbender's legendary menagerie yeah i bet you are what's the weirdest monster you guys have seen i once uh brewed transformed regalia wearing a clint car parachute you can fit a lot of teeth into a head that big you have no idea [Music] there's further proof if we turn back every time we have wanted we never go anywhere good point good thing we have a plant guy to take care of a plant problem he says plants aren't problems can you get us through here gamora whatever it takes to find help respect this from the guy who calls me harlot spawn of thanos an accurate description we all know which harlot spotted first what about her sister nebula i forgot about the blue harlot spawn gamora's actually adopted so not even that accurate uh yeah also not a harlot right right that too we'll need to find a way out of this jungle why it's dry down here wouldn't you rather be wet than lost not particularly this jungle is majestic and then everything's trying to kill you that is precisely why now where'd he go hey will you outlaying your eggs or something that is not how terrance reproduce not how most karens reproduce that's what makes our quilt so special interesting i don't lay eggs hmm looks more alien than the other ones they are all aliens i know dead end that's just great wait is that shitari tech over there ask the chitauri no no it is it's a retractable bridge they used them at the prison i was in to buy the controls are on the other side of the giant chasm what do you do not have time to dawl in this jungle i shall hurl the creature over the chasm so you might activate them i may activate a hole through your face put me down no we're not throwing rockets very well you sons of [ __ ] dogs how will we cross look around we'll find another way not a chance we both know it's too far for you to stretch there has to be something we can use maybe a tall tree taller than groot it would be easier to throw the rodent no it would not what if he breaks a leg he would still have three no one's throwing rocks i think tech doing on a backwater mud ball like this perhaps lady swamp hellbender was among the spoilers maybe or maybe he was real cozy ridiculous wow it is dark in here if you bump into any monsters let us know monster planet right right hey my shooting's not aimless everything i do is with purpose and you know heroism hey i found more ruins down here a miracle that's still standing in these storms extracts think you can topple this i may have angered them all right let's try not to fall that's your pep talk great place to leave a sculpture wait hear that what's up people incoming we can fly these fish good luck with that let's lose so glad you parked all this way away well think of it [Music] i'm starting to miss most buildings [Music] genius enough of these inferior creatures i yearn for the monsters yeah i'm feeling all turned around as well where the flark are we just look around there must be a path here somewhere all right gamora pretty sure it's this way 50 units yesterday no way are we almost there still got like half a planet to walk across lady hellbender could cross this jungle in seven could strides she would have flown over the mountains oh she flies now she possesses flying creatures i heard she shoots lasers out of her eyes now we're talking i have not heard that one i heard there are actually nine of her that's why they call it sec dark 9. that is preposterous that was preposterous drax want to clear a path gamora mind cutting us a path they say that lady hellbender feels it every time you cut the piece of her jungle an old nova bomber i haven't seen one of these since the war i remember it used to take a dozen ships to bring one down a dozen ships or one chitari infiltrator i'll take that one as a compliment still no sign of the fortress nope we even sure this is the right way yes no just thinking someone else could cross the death pit first being brutal the merchandise only one of you is the merchandise plan a and plan b okay just go no you just go don't leaders usually cross first not if it's dangerous because i need to cover everyone right see it's fine perfectly safe fine do not even think of pushing the assassin there are so many better ways to kill someone [Music] easy does it says there's something down there monster it doesn't matter of course it matters [Music] nice catch you're welcome don't get used to it peter cliff you're not alone here yeah i got it all right guys anyone know what that is a monster [Music] the is oh is [Music] [Music] cowardly beast finish the battle ah stumpy's running away that it's tail between its legs i say we go after it finish the job anyone ever tell you you're scary yes i mean there's obviously a way out up there which is exactly what we need plus it'll give us eyes on where we need to go and it is settled how to scale this down contraption yeah okay how do we do that good question the reactor thing there is pretty loose and pretty gunked up ugh yo quilt check out the upper wing strut looks pretty compromised to me [Music] you
