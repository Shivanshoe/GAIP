no we need her killer now better look around he must have left a trail this way why would someone kill Hina to keep us from finding Sadao the traitors knew we had her it was a long journey from the woodcutter many people saw her with me you made sure they did you used her as bait I hoped her husband would take it you should have told me your plan so you could stop me I promised a protector only one set of tracks whoever the killer is there alone with ena gone we need them alive to him she didn't they help no not you [ __ ] sodoes brother why did you kill Hina tried to free her she wouldn't leave wanted to save sadawa she's praying for you I didn't mean to where's your brother I failed him I won't betray him you can't die tell me where he is he's gone Hina died for nothing she was murdered by traitors just like my family I can't give up the hunt he carried the messages for his brother maybe he had one what did you find a map of supply routes he delivered food to survivor camps may be sad au is hiding at one go to the nearest camp and talk to the monk in charge he might know what the map reveals what about you I will bury Hina I owe her that I'll find you at the camp when I'm done that's a good boy [Music] good horse Mazz it was said to find the monk in charge of his camp may be able to read the map I found on the traitors brother [Music] [Music] [Music] misako said to find the monk in charge of his camp he may be able to read the map I found on the traitors brother farewell my lord anything to offer from your hunting only the best for you an excellent choice I'm sorry I need more for that I look forward to hearing of you Lord sucker how good to see you juicy I should have expected to find you here how may I serve you my lord do you know these lands well I set up all of these camps does this map mean anything to you we give these to our wagon drivers who deliver food they mark where the camps are so no one gets missed is that blood do you see anything that isn't point of your camps I hear rumors of our own people killing each other in our yaki traitors are preying on innocent people they murdered the women and children of Claire Netaji you can help bring them to justice this map shows Rocky's lighthouse we have no camps there but people have said bandits have taken it over not bandits something was lady Masako has arrived I think she prefers to speak with you what have you learned the head man of kuta village might be at the lighthouse man Adachi builds that for Ariake this traitor has no shame shadow has men protecting him there's no way they won't see us coming good I want to give that traitor just enough time to feel what's coming let's go why would saddle betray they accused him of stealing rice stuffing our people to turn a profit you think he caused the rice shortages that hit could have I could never prove it to it but it was such a disaster I knew he was trying to hide something bad men are good at hiding their true natures guards outside the coward is hiding at the top I'm right here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you killed inna my brother it sad because of you you should have died with your family I wish I had you killed subtle merciful he helped kill everyone I loved and for what to satisfy his pathetic hatred when the Mongols defeated the samurai I wanted to die with them I threw myself into a battle I knew I couldn't win it was easier how do you survive I remember that I have people to protect and the debt to avenge with solder dead whoever is responsible will hear that I'm alive and hunting they'll become afraid make a mistake just be careful was it go you too you are a part of this now the other traitors are somewhere in Toyama we'll find them together that's without you boy let's go [Music] [Music] like I say say any word on to Moy yes but I'm not sure you are ready for her you make it sound like a demon that's not far off the mark dumb way is fearless she is not samurai but she is a born killer I know the type no you do not come where are we headed an archery range locus of Mongols training there I suspect Tomoya was with them if Tomo is truly fearless she'd make a useful Ally a starving leopard is fearless too leopards can't master your way of the bowl let it go Sakai you will never join us why does she turn against you I took a risk sharing all I knew with her when she betrayed my trust I punished her it must have been harsh you saw what she did to the prisoners at fort Nakayama that was no mistake it was a choice not the first time she's made it we don't know it was her fault you don't I do you have to climb to get there sure you can make it sensei what are you waiting for us tonight you need a hand sensei not bad guy he said the only way up was to climb no I said you had to climb it's good exercise arrows [ __ ] and Japanese if they were here they're long gone we might pick up their chair by the practice target there is no target [Music] near that watchtower not bad since they find out where they went move it's like I how many Mongols is to my training a severed head used for target practice was here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay resting your bow arm sensei observing your response to an ambush you knew those Mongols were still here yes you didn't think to mention it if you can't handle a few Mongols what good will you be against him oi this is war not a test and how many wars have you fought well test you as I see fit I can see what he's told my attacked you [Music] [Laughter] [Music] know where did she go okay now look around a lot of tracks a dozen men maybe more follow the trail if we catch her do not wait for me attack and keep moving oh you'll die do you plan to use your bonus time if we find her and if not can you take a dozen enemy soldiers without me if I must [Music] look at them they're practicing botamo he taught them murdering the innocent did you see a Japanese woman with these Mongols I couldn't believe it she was giving them orders what did she say something about the sensei and the hot springs that's all I heard My Lord forgive me I taught a monster how to hunt they heard Tomoya giving orders to the Mongoose she mentioned he or she Springs she's just getting started it's a guy the way you fight it's not your uncle's way and it's not mine you've never faced an enemy like this I do what I must defeat them a solid I is a guardian not a killer or Dutch around like a thief you didn't see Komodo I've seen enough I know it was voodoo but I won't train another monster I know I won't let that happen if domo hey is going after he or she Springs I need to prepare so do you I'll see you at my dojo Sakai [Music] it's okay any news of Tomoya travelers have been shot dead on the roads in and out of he or she Springs people are free to leave or deliver supplies you think that's our doing a few archers a strategic points can isolate a whole town atactic a few so when you a clan now goes archery master Tomoya was a good student too good we're fighting your own reflection we will turn that to our advantage [Music] [Music] you
