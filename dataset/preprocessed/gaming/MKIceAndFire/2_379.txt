[Music] for a moment my king your father gave me that much respect is did your father's father long ago a media plunged into the land of wakanda wakanda was not an advanced nissan den it was a group of warring tribes the media brought them together because it contained the metal we now call vibranium vibranium made wakanda with it we advanced we were built outside forces we connected with our past and our panther guard you challenged your uncle to become the black panda but you were born to be king not all can do both not all receive past blessing when they do you made a difficult choice closing wakanda's borders when you thought your friend had died i do not be graduate but this new threat is different you have no idea how far these people will go to take what they desire a corruption has followed in the wake of ulysses claw made of the vibranium that keeps the heart of wakanda beating and that corruption is spreading only one man now stands in its way you [Music] [Applause] we're clear clear let me see the next charge foreign what [Music] [Music] no [Music] beloved you let him go yes akoye for now won't he warn the others and still they will be at a disadvantage he will lead me to his friends then to their leader claw yes huh yes with me how many times must i teach them this lesson it's the black painter i do believe you're right good yes ugh [Music] uh she will receive the after action report plans for some kind of sonic cannon claw is targeting the shield around the city i need to get that burst at the tunnel to benin i am going there now now you will regret this you're outnumbered give him everything you got you should have brought more leave this place [Music] [Music] we can't keep this up stay down wakanda huh that is finished i can bring you to get over the collapse no send your forces to the shield that is where close men will be headed i know another way hmm a way you have not shared with the dora milaje i am so [ __ ] with you now somewhat begrudgingly you will enjoy this is it a secret shared with you by previous black panthers yes but not in the way you think no walk through that jaya was needed just an uncle to teach his nephew okoye the corrupted vibranium has spread to this part of the jungle too how is it moving so quickly i do not know yet it must be destroyed [Music] ah [Music] one fire down another one the spire is shielded when in this state [Music] the corruption has been destroyed enclosement pacified time to open my shortcut that never gets old i will admit it that was very nice hmm it is not every day i earned praise from the leader of the doremiraje huh wow bruh she does all potential black panthers do i have not seen this cave since i was training with my uncle like stepping into a memory i remember breaking this looking for a way in explosives were not a good idea oh ripping the souls of invade us she protects us always [Music] huh [Music] another puzzle for future black panthers their hours i spent in this room the bruises no not that one yes that one i remember yeah that wasn't right wrong uncle sian was always changing this puzzle [Music] ah it is open finally huh [Music] uh [Music] well strange to walk this as the black panther my uncle did his best to prepare me for nemac i hope i do not let him down i feel like i am competing with my younger self now i wonder what uncle would think about all this it is clear ulysses claw fancies himself a technologist a sonic cannon perhaps the one thing capable of taking down wakanda shields i have underestimated the length to which he will go to obtain vibranium i remember when they modernized the technology behind this tram angle was vehement that it still looked the same as it did a thousand years ago what in boss's name this was not dog but cut some kind of sharp metal drill huh [Music] so these have been cutting holes in my cabin [Music] yes this room used to be for sparring with other perspectives like panthers are fired in this way claw and his minions must be stopped if this vibranium had not been refined thousands of years ago it would have mutated everyone who passed mother to remember why he received the title ten thousand years ago the tribes of wakanda were at war [Music] the media caring vibranium crashed to earth that media became the vibranium mound that overlooks the golden city inside the mound grew the heart-shaped herb a gift from past herself [Music] [Music] ate the heart-shaped earth and fast blessed him with the powers of the neck panther [Music] [Music] the avengers what are outsiders doing in wakandan airspace i will deal with the avengers later first i must take call sonic cannon offline [Music] okoye they have the dora melange and the avengers keep close men busy draw their attention away from the quick side there won't be a problem but if that shield comes down they can help you stop him he can't get to the cannon i have it handled sister we don't have much time before they are through the shield i must hurry roof [Applause] guess claw wasn't exaggerating yeah hey panther boy you want this to hurt more or way more you always this well spoken nah darling i pulled out all the stops for the kitty king strange choice for the last words damn it looks like you can only shield one thing at a time your cannon is unprotected keep hitting this is hilarious let's switch things up doesn't look like you're getting through i know how to take a punch cat king you know how to run from it at least i can't let you do that the cannon is down maybe next time the avengers to the palace well okay then put your weapons down and your hands up we're here to see king good because he wants to see you too oh we're in trouble [Music] uh [Music] we didn't know aim was following us if we had do you know why aim has taken a certain interest in my country it likely has something to do with us stealing a very powerful weapon of theirs and destroying another one i see if it is any comfort you did not lead advanced idea mechanics to our doorstep we've been swatting them like flies for weeks so you know about the corrupted vibranium what it can do to things and people we are working on a treatment for those affected by it and are narrowing down its sauce but how do you know about it because we've seen it outside of wakanda that's not good this means ulysses claw is doing more damage than we anticipated he's the head of aim operations here from the information we've gathered is deeply entrenched in the black market vibranium trade like his father was you're not concerned only by his sonically based technology it disrupts anything made of or powered by vibranium including our shields and scanners but aim will not be clocked forever i can promise you that we believe that technology has something to do with the corruption [Music] and we made it just in time ah to offer help to ask for yours now that we know aims involved we can give you information if you need it but vibranium is your specialty met the locations of corrupted vibranium outside of wakanda we need to know how far it has spread and plenty dispersal method for medical treatments i'm on it have a look around you can see what we are already doing to fight claw and him and hopefully make ourselves useful captain rogers can you meet me in my lab you will find it to your right i'm on my way apologies captain but i cannot let you through princess shuri tony there you are you mentioned you would be willing to share some information whatever you need wakanda will have access to all resistance intel thank you now i am surprised the corrupted vibranium has spread so far beyond our bodies we will need to contain the damage claw has done you got eyes on him oh tell him about the key moyo network kim will this is the chemoyo network well part of it in cap speak it's the internet but better much better the kimoyo network provides our people access to all of wakanda's collected knowledge we use it for communication transportation and a great many other things all thanks to our kimoyo beads and she won't let us have one citizens only we have been using the network to keep track of clause movements he is quiet for now but if he makes any noise our warriors will find him well i don't doubt it thank you for the data captain and when you get a moment there is someone else who wants to meet you if the honored guest could come down down down to my chambers i would appreciate it follow this walk oh that's new the corrupted vibranium you found i think it may have a more unnatural source than we thought more of clause doing most likely should this hey steve have you seen this shiny what is it i don't know sure he refuses to tell me i think she enjoys torturing me i thought you scientists loved figuring these things out oh tony he's having a blast but i'm stuck here with a very serious case of imposter syndrome this sounds rough buddy i mean there's so much we can learn from wakanda i i just don't know if they'll let me well respect and understanding go a long way hey is it me or were those guards staring for an uncomfortable amount of time you think that's weird sounds like you know why you're the minority now this is just how things are what really yep oh man that sucks it's not all bad for every person who stares there's like a thousand to smile for you we welcome you for being different for being you that's really nice actually i have my moments our daughter gets it from you you know a spirituality good it has kept her connected with her grandmother that woman never liked me and now that she has passed she spent every day turning you all against me well you don't exactly make it half ahead yes yes we heard you the first time to jotter you feel forgotten i can't imagine how is they named the city after you or pipe down i have a guest ah steve rogers the captain of america i am honored we can finally meet face to face king azuri always spoke fondly of his encounter with the american ice man the feeling is mutual you may call me zawa vari i am the mystical advisor to the wakandan royal family may i ask you a favor captain always the young king seems to trust you do not make him regret that decision i won't take our position lightly i promise in return a secret the guards have far more to do with wakanda's impressive technology than you might guess as sneaks the princess is assisted minion i will tell him ice and true your guidance is appreciated and may the orisha guide you as well captain the king does not respect our values your communication bead is still functioning on your commodore bracelet right because sending people messages inside their head is unsettling oh oh they're here this is quite the workstation combat research and development all of which is now available to you as well you may thank princess shuri for that i will you working on anything interesting take a look zawavari has been helping me uncover the more mystical properties of vibranium perhaps you'll reap the benefits should you prove yourself a worthy ally of wakanda that's a lot to live up to follow our king and all will be well it's nice meeting you next steve we need you in the war room upstairs something wrong captain okoye wants to brief us something about malfunctioning security systems hmm i'll be there asap take your time oh i think you will be pleased with that captain okoye what seems to be the problem king t'challa has a request our scouts have reported claw is mobilizing his forces throughout wakanda with remarkable ease we believe claus found a blind spot in wakanda's security systems okoye will investigate and we'll reinforce if necessary claude does seem to know what he's doing many have tried to conquer wakanda to rob us of our heritage as you can see they have all failed and so will claw we'll help you however we can good you have permission to use our wall table let's put that vibranium of yours to good use captain thank you okoye this crossbars you know him personally no but i've seen records he used to run some gangs in new york before he went pro man let's keep an eye on that be honest you just wanted to show off this suit as usual i have no idea what you're talking about i recognize the avengers as allies of wakanda thank you i hope we do you justice you will have to get used to keeping up with me that's my brother's version of a warm welcome you will also have to get used to that you finally agreed to accept help and it is from outsiders that is not like you i am not accepting help i am giving it then let me send teams to the corrupted sites take the dora milaje with you when you confront him do something other than driving yourself head fast into danger i am not just a king on a throne i am the black panther then show us you can be both i will avengers i hope you have familiarized yourselves with the palace by now your people have been most welcoming i'd like to see more of wakanda once claws been dealt with you're such a tourist a tourist in asgard we call that adventuring it's an emergency transmission this is okoye we are being pushed back we need assistance you cannot handle close forces alone he's not just claw he has turned our defense systems against us impossible we've lost her signal if claw has broken the chemo your encryption something is very wrong then i think it is about time the avengers see what the black panther is truly capable of it would be an honor to tag along move fast i do not like the idea of claw hacking our technology [Music] sister any news of akoye she's still unresponsive okay can handle herself right are the finest warriors in wakanda but even they can be surprised let's hope for the best okoye's last transmission originated nearby we will find her if our defenses are truly compromised it will be a dangerous trek through the jungle no matter i welcome the challenge i am detecting heat signatures up ahead human and robotic in origin we will catch them by surprise since our father died i can hear both of you we are terror itself [Music] ah can you join us beloved it would be my honor i love it it is [Music] [Music] wakanda forever them we can rebuild them later yes nice yes [Music] [Music] [Music] yes invaders hacking technology is a nuisance not just our nuisance a legitimate security threat i'm receiving another distress signal a tower has been hacked near the border okoye clean up straw glass the avengers and i will secure the other tower at once there's a cabin pass we can use to reach the other tower this claw is no run-of-the-mill goon he will pay for his transgressions they can't get into the vibranium mount what is aim trying to do out here in force vibranium ley lines stretch outward from the mount itself most concentrated in wakanda glo is found a way to extract that vibranium from the groundwater uh [Music] keep it up [Music] we are approaching the shortcut to fort hunt garrison use the pressure plates to activate the terminal to a secret passage just in case you got too cocky our passage is it i remember you saying i was not allowed if that were true you would not even know about it i was not about to make it easy for you get to the console in front of the waterfall quickly it will disappear again hey no boys allowed keep outside would have worked just as well sister you should keep the timer makes things interesting now that i know you like it i won't huh claus men are here that was impressive thank you i will track the ones they used shut them out of the network this will take us near the border any word from the hack tower i'm having trouble getting through apologies for the turbulence your highness i'm still familiarizing myself with your little network is this the man who fancies himself the general of a corporate ulysses claw at your service when i find you i will have you begging for mercy you won't receive better hurry than orphan king i won't wait forever he's toying with us brother i know where he is as do i the kimono network control center that sounds bad if khloe gets full access to the network it means he could [ __ ] our communications or worse turn all our technology against us change of plans avenge avengers run [Music] circle around him here we go again have you met this ulysses claw in person not yet where she should be thankful more corrupted vibranium we should destroy it yes got a couple toys oh oh i see you've met the welcome party what's being done to our men don't worry they didn't suffer much another one down um um [Music] [Music] good work everyone come every second counts um foreign we are heading down to the control center what are the other towers i sent the talon jet and okoye and her team are on their way but claw has left me completely blind from here then we shall be your eyes and my claws we have arrived power everything down before crossing full control of the network much appreciated why is the power still on it's claw sorry i can't stay men charge they are targeting the komodo salad banks without them there is no commodial network and no way to get it back online until we build new ones you have to stop them avengers with me his men are attacking the access points i need you to keep them away while i try to get back in i can access the turrets from here that will buy us some time you could also overcharge the generator an emp would disable closed forces for a short while it would take down our turrets as well until you can reactivate them yes just make sure they don't destroy the access points before i get them back leave that to me [Music] [ __ ] bring the pain people come ah [Music] yes [Music] huh oh [Music] [Music] [Music] ah aah huh [Music] um we must protect [Music] ah oh [Music] ah yes it didn't have to be like this my liege you have no more men there are always more men and now i'm inside every system you rely upon give me your vibranium and i won't turn your technological utopia against you return what you have stolen or i will take it with blood how about i talk to the little girl in your ear ask if she can see sense oh i bet she's beautiful in person [Music] [Music] i have a message for the people see wakanda and die this isn't over [Laughter] we need to evacuate the borderlands bring them all into ben and zana brother i have sent out the evacuation order we can use the conference center to house refugees that's for claw no one will steal from wakanda while i rule this land sister what news of the border tribes the evacuation is nearly complete the final tribes are being moved to the conference center as we speak and the jabari zijabari were pleased to hear that claude compromised our evil technology and will reward him with a quick death should he ever set foot in the mountains ah generous hey so if uh if claw crippled your uh paraphrasing hyper advanced super internet are we still safe here birnanzana is in full lockdown no one enters or leaves the city without my permission we may have lost the chemoyour network but the palace is still running on a private hub my lab remains functional that means claws advantage is smaller than he might expect club believes wakanda relies solely on its technology for protection my class will prove him wrong akoye has your team returned yes my king good i will meet you shortly i am glad you are here romanov your knowledge of aim will be instrumental in wakanda's retaliation thank you for having us it means a lot especially to steve i would not dare turn away an old friend of my grandfather such bonds must be honored and when the world's at stake where will your honor lead you wherever the fight takes us you have my word what is the status of the mound secure minds are functioning at full capacity keep eyes on it claw is here for our vibranium we cannot allow it to fall into his hands i am glad you arrived safely i need you and your sisters to escort everyone into the city our shield will protect them as you wish you have something to add your decision to evacuate the borderlands has been a controversial one some believe you are scared of claw have you lost faith in me i did not say i agreed with them but any men capable of bringing down the chemo your network is a bigger threat than we first anticipated i will bring claw and his thieves to justice you have my word i hate it when he does that [Music] my bones have grown too witty to chase the mighty panther to the palace so you claim now tell me what you need it is what you need my king i am saddened to know you have not sought my counsel in these trying times vast walks with me is our body we will deal with these fallen invaders through blood sweat and metal i have no need for your dark magic oh dean what have your kimoyo network and the technology had turned against you you should embrace your spiritual side not continue to neglect it enough i will call upon your wisdom when needed until then enjoy the comforts gifted to you as you reach will you walk as swiftly and strongly as past my king you have spoken to many of my people what have you learned well um a lot of people lost touch with their families some even believe they won't have a home after this is all over houses can be rebuilt belongings returned lives however yeah i just want to help everyone you know i know your network all southern villages remain in the dark now i can see why you'd fight so hard to protect this place especially from guys like claw that guy sure is a blemish on the well flemish nazi father belgian citizenship studied and delft of all places delft my ancestors have all dealt with colonizers before car were in no differently oh i don't doubt that for a second do you think we will have to evacuate does shuri have you helping with network le pass uh well first i'm i'm trying to just make sense of it all it's a bit of a rabbit hole ah yes my sister does not always come into code it is quite frustrating claw is everywhere and now we cannot rely on the camoya network i will do everything in my power to stop him my king where are we with getting the commodore network back online clown has done a lot of damage a few of us are headed out to see what we can salvage rebuilding it will take time take thank you my king now you are sounding like me hey it's shuri i need you in the war room now welcome back sir misaki the river child believe they have discovered this source of corrupted vibranium well one of these sources good news for once not exactly claw has deployed many violent machines that tear through the earth's crust with ease they will burn down my panda if left unchecked then we must act quickly give me the coordinates way ahead of you brother the award table has everything you need good work please without the chemo network we have to rely on wakandan citizens for reports on close movements we need the network back online sister i am working on that until then takami the river tribe's lead scientist will meet you nearby the machine he believes is causing the corrupted vibranium and explain more understood [Music] we are on our way balls fast takami should not have put his life at risk for this how else were we going to learn about the corruption machines i would have found a way that is my responsibility as king huh ah [Music] your king is here ah [Music] let's go ah [Music] uh you should get your people back to safety that was fun to watch how are your people faring without a kimoyo network orphan king you think you are clever i've had a decade to play with vibranium i was bound to learn a few tricks you're a black market vibranium will never match wakandas i agree why do you think i'm here more of class forces what has claw done the destruction here we will fix it we always do my focused underground sonic emitter if you won't give me vibranium i can take it you can certainly try your fuse is corrupting the vibranium you so badly desire a negligible percentage the rest will be mine target the legs there's a mechanism above each leg stop them ah any other ideas yes a flaw in your design claw those frequency coils the machine injected his tower at the very top to produce an explosion pity it won't work [Music] yes yes that fuse is only one of many for now your grades will lead to nowhere claw i will make sure of it [Music] now that we know what is corrupting vibranium our people will be able to track the rest of the fuses do not put our people in any more danger i will find these fuses and destroy them myself why can't you just that is an order sister ah fine i will gut him where he stands let me see it and i might not stop you this is a message for the princess it would appear not every wakandan is a warrior after all i'm extending an invitation princess come to me alone or your people will die now you keep me waiting and i'll pick them off one by one see you soon can i gut him now those symbols behind him that is azuri's temple yes yes but you are not going i am you want to walk powerless into a trap of that madman's making those are my laptops zawavari gave me everything i needed to know about that temple my team knows vibranium better than anyone the only trap i'm walking into is one of my own making let me do this brother see our plan through really we do not have time for this rapper jet and go i want to follow her quietly she is my sister and those are my people if something happens i must be there to pick up the pieces okoye are you receiving loud and clear my king i have disabled the locator beacon on the jet fury should not know you are following excellent you will be landing in a remote area west of asuri's temple must guide you adore milaje training was accompanying shuri's technicians her name is ayo we have not heard from her and she was not in the med men's ransom video i will watch for her thank you beloved the tracker is live but the princess's signal is weak she must have gone on the ground through the cave pass except that claw has people following her there is a pocket of their forces between you and she i will handle it sure he is even more capable than i knew but she is still in danger huh [Music] that is the group following the princess not anymore huh go [Music] [Music] took us through this gate we're almost to the temple i will let you know when we re-emerge understood i think you could have let princess shuri know you will follow her you'll disapprove of this decision or all of them i can tell you have something to say captain the princess just seemed like she had a plan and it is my job to make sure that plant does not get my sister killed hey i hear you i want everyone to get out of this safely then we are agreed she has not moved in a few minutes she's about 500 meters from the temple not yet my king the princess has gone inside understood hmm not just yet panther cup he knew we were coming [Music] uh hmm um around to the back of the temple there is another entrance here we are there should be a target on that pillar [Music] huh the door is open brother what are you doing here oh i thought i told you to come alone princess hurry inside i had that why are you still here i could not let you go alone what if i find the girl before you reach me panther hmm brother i cannot believe this is how little you trust me you are not the one i must trust i don't believe you were invited to this party let them go my father came to your beautiful country when i was a child he had heard about the mythical vibranium and at first the black panther listened to my father showed him wakanda release them my father asked for a gift to save his dying nation but the black panther said they had no vibranium to give your father did not ask he demanded he threatened and azuri the wise said no oh oh he did not just say know your highness he slit my father's throat and left him to bleed out on the ground you now stand on that panther is dead so you will have to do you and your people everything is shaking [Music] finish the job boys [Music] that psychopath killed him and ran away goodbye sweet princess oh i will be right behind you cut every one of you down ah yes [Music] [Applause] did you really think that was it i needed an insurance policy [Music] uh oh thanks fast where are i am so sorry no no it is not possible they were i was [Music] okoye we are coming home my sister will need medical attention yes beloved and get me the next again for the lab technicians i will i will pay for this i promise i am here you had something to tell me i could not sit by after what claudette what you watched him do the barrier he brought up i so i hacked into his communications he is talking to aim scientist supreme monica rapuccini i think we should listen in don't you piss us through i keep an eye on all of my operations ulysses the reports from your inferiors are concerning at best you destroyed a heritage site is that correct i made a statement now wakanda knows aim won't back down until we get the vibranium we deserve ancient wakanda knew more about vibranium than anyone in my company you may have just earned thousands of years of research notes and experiment logs to the ground perhaps i just believe more in the capability of aim i'm building an army to fight an alien invasion no one believes we can survive your daddy issues are no longer my concern excuse me you little you're fired good luck with your crusade against the panther without my company's protection men we have been forsaken but no matter history will prove who the victors are what we are not given we will take stone the vibranium mound brother the mount he's actually storming the mount then he is both reckless and vulnerable the avengers and i will stop him please they cannot have died in vain i promise you what is happening inside the mount claw and his loyalists have barricaded themselves in with their fused devices are there any wakandans in there with them the minds are unmanned unprocessed vibranium is toxic to the human body and you want us to run straight into it i want claw and his men out of my minds we have nanotech pills to help with the rest if claw turns on all his fuses inside the mount he will corrupt vibranium at its source we will not give him the chance dr repuccini may be finished with claw but she is not done with wakanda she has sent aim forces to storm beninzana as long as the shield around it stands the city is safe we cannot let claw poison the vibranium mound [Music] this is the door we gotta bust down the closest one to the first fuse device yes why don't we let clone know we have arrived it is only polite they will regret challenging the panthers these switches are kinetically tuned getting them from afar will not do much we're well to fish them all ugh kill the black panther and the avengers do not let them near the fuses desperate already claw you have lost your touch keep moving do not let close minions stop us hmm [Music] your journey ends here we will extinguish your fuses core [Music] we will dispatch them quickly there goes one [Music] pride fall to your deaths won't you claws done something to the hoverpads a good hit and they will appear but but they will not stay substantial you will have to be fast where's the closest fuse through the vibranium filter prepare yourselves this will be difficult huh how long before these vibranium particulates start affecting us with the nanotech pills we gave you the old man it's just right [Music] ah we are through ready for the filtering chambers now excuse me what happens if we touch the glowy bits you will be broken down into your component molecules if it helps your death would be instantaneous why would that help you sure this is the quickest way there unfortunately i am hmm oh um hmm like moles scrambling through the bowels of your ancestral mountain pathetic you're close to the first fuse should i mute him let him film i need to monitor the progress of his madness roof if my father could see me now or yours my king at least my father could still look me in the eye after all i've done however aim for the feet right right we will dare it limb from robotic limbs [Music] night [Music] that is have you met mechanism uh oh oh yes [Music] ah feeling pretty crappy this is bad what is it i'm seeing more fuses than we anticipated powering up inside the mountain a lot more the plan remains to defeat them you will not go any further look directly at the the beam of asgard keep going ah yes [Music] are putting it into overdrive this is the only way to the power banks the only one that gets you there in time please hurry are you all okay we're fine we have reached the door to the power banks [Music] not now panther shooty the barrier and fuse devices are both being powered by the kiln's generators so i can get them onto the chemoyo network and make them self-destruct but once claw realizes what you are doing he'll destroy the generators what do you need from us protect those generators at all costs and get close to one or two of his hijacked turrets while you're at it okay i can multitask judy take over the power banks we will give you as much time as we can now all right [Music] [Music] [Applause] um yes oh wow uh yes um wow [Music] uh yes wow let's go uh huh [Music] uh no crossmen have control of one of the powerbanks food blue [Music] uh aah [Applause] i have got it ugh [Music] you think you can stop me my brainium doesn't belong to you it is mine and i will happily move through you to take it back you are right vibranium does not belong to me [Music] uh brother we need you what is it it's aim they are attacking the shield around beninzana get above ground now in the elevator now [Music] so how big is the force attacking the city big these aren't close loyalists aim is here as long as the shield is up the city's fine right yes but wakanda is not just ben and sana we must remove every last invader from within wakanda gladly we are almost there get outside hurry judy direct me to the shield's weakest point do you hear that do you feel it in your bones your country crumbling at my gate [Music] crossbars i see it the vibranium has ripped claw apart he is pure sonic energy now how do i defeat a man made of sound if if i reverse the polarity of the sound dampeners around wakanda they can amplify sound instead get the wavelength just right and it will resonate with the sonic waves that make up claw you could beat it to get enough power for a maneuver like that you would have to drop the shield around the city only until you defeat khloe wakanda can protect itself until then trust your people trust me do it [Music] ah you won't have to we'll destroy the turret [Music] you're going to have to deal with me first party thank you for that this is uh let's see how you do without your friends crossbones you cannot beat me oh um too rich for my blood um i will win what is happening where am i going stop stop [Music] thank you sister [Music] [Music] [Music] some injuries but everyone is all right we beat him back beyond the shield are picking up stragglers we were able to do it together you are right say that again so i can record it maybe later for now i am coming home t'challa how old are you that you're still playing hide and seek back you off are coming just tell us what you are going to tell us drama king i asked you here to announce i will be joining the avengers in the fight against advanced idea mechanics about the job of black panther in wakanda your panther will not turn his back on his people but i acknowledge that my attention would be split and wakanda needs no deserves more than that wakanda deserves a leader that believes in them more than anyone else alive who trusts they will fight for their country and who knows what they need even before they do wakanda is this how you greet your queen regent i just wanted to try that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
