up our cab and I didn't get you anything attempting to neutralize the virus Carol you're breaking up say again failed entered the atmosphere then there's nothing more you can do get back to the city we could use you here acknowledged sorry cap so what options do we have let's see death by explosion death by virus or death by symbiote or all of the above how the hell with this I'm done babysitting Nova major get ready I'm coming yes there is a way if you are willing to trust me rocket we need X and zero back here now working on a cap we have company dammit protect the time stone they say that

stone 2x definitely your color [Music] ready to fire can you redirect of course captain I haven't now the Sigma butters we're too late captain the air town well what do you know the dispersal of the virus was relatively limited no more than 10 blocks have been exposed and at minimal levels it could have been much worse but we were exposed confirmed I'm detecting traces in the system of every one of us synthetic and organic alike how much time do we have a full return it's hard to say hours rather than days I can find no way to suppress the progress of the virus if we're to stop it Ultron Sigma must be destroyed you've all fought well and with honor we've lost allies and friends no one could ask any more of you and yet I must Ultron Sigma has two of the six Infinity stones space and reality we have three but if we're to stop Ultron Sigma stopped the virus we need a fourth we need the soul stone Jenna has returned to the Dark Kingdom with the soul stone in his possession his mind has been corrupted by the stone I can no longer reach him I'll handle Jetta you're sure he's a demon I'm a demon hunter it's a match made in hell even if we retrieve the fourth stone we cannot yet regulate the stones power thank you dr. downer much as it hurts to say it the docks not wrong the device is trashed the towers reactors toast Wow holed up with a text speak there Stark only the technology of Abel city can save you now he's not lying not about Abel cities Tech at least how know you this trust me take me there and I will help you complete your device Abel city was destroyed when our two universes collided no Abel city was the epicenter for the convergence Sigma's Laboratory survives a suicide mission into the heart of enemy territory I'm interested tell me more we have no other choice there seems to be a lot of that going around and what of the rest of us we'll take the fight to Ultron Sigma keep him occupied you know we barely made it out of there last time this time is different the reality stone is cracked he's hurt vulnerable and we're desperate but we're not alone you must strike now before he can repair himself before this virus consumes you follow understand everything depends on you two on the soul stone and the device if you fail it's an awesome responsibility hey we're awesome guys hey nice my God we're doomed listen do not let your guard down with that guy even for a second I'm serious they say vanos risked his life for us yeah sure just watch yourself okay this is it my friend see you on the other side [Music] you
