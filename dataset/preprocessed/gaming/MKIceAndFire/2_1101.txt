that hurt you more than it hurt me do us a favor and keep it quiet Dalton if they don't shoot me I won't you then how's that [Music] [Music] I've got loads of dead set gear down here now why'd you suppose the highs what how did they get their hands on it I don't know but someone wants to make it look like dead set was here [ __ ] you need to proceed with extreme caution daughter who are these men in black anyway nothing identifying I suspect that's by design [ __ ] me the entire place is rigged to blow Jesus those canisters [ __ ] is that RDX nitrogen enough to level Parliament can you locate a detonator badly not exactly but there's a device streaming a fuckload of encrypted data from the floor above you yeah now there's the Bell on my way Bagley is that not the detonator no but it's a transmitter sending a signal to a device on the floor above us safe to assume that would be the detonator we're looking for their profiles are heavily encrypted no identifying information ghost an assistant I staged that SEC propaganda all around the bombs these pricks are gonna blow up Parliament and hang your nose not if you get to that detonator first in the House of Commons whoever these men in black are they've got brushed bollocks to self in the center of government [Music] magli update let's just say I'm both impressed and annoyed by how sophisticated this anti-tamper security is still working Badgley tell me you close i'm through security now waiting from terabytes of decoy code looking for the destination sequence [Music] problem Dilton I need your physical appendages now Sabine what's going on being rated it's a bloodbath a protocol is to wipe everything including badly I need him for the transmitter I know but if they get him they get everything names ops locations okay I'll do it the old-fashioned way wiping yes wipe me do it Sabine and get the hell out of there [ __ ] okay Bagley's down you're on your own Dalton if this goes it won't I'll see you at the rally point I promise good luck finding cover [Music] well now the dead sex risen from the attic of this smoldering City let's do what Dalton would have wanted roll up our sleeves and get to UM [ __ ] London I've taken the liberty of adding two promising leads to your app this is strange one of our service is being pinged constantly from the Wi-Fi have a particular star Roger coffee do I give her Dan yes I thought it was noise at first too but then I decoded the pings it's Morse code three letters repeating over and over keep talking s o wait for it s time to investigate send me those coordinates you good I got you hello there have you got an hour to set the world right anytime anywhere [Music] [Music] [Music] strucked anyway [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm here what no that doesn't seem to be any obvious peril does there have a seat and I'll ping back the IP sending us the distress signal mom I flip for well this means both members if the krypter phone it's secure every device on CTOs can be compromised if we're overheard we're dead both of us who the hell is this not important what matters is that I have an inside information on si RS and I believe the people who framed you are rogue officers and loathe as I am to say it dedsec may be my only hope to stop them all right we'll listen bye that's all for now good I had coordinates to a meeting place on a device in that establishment [Music] Berkeley City walk maturities what do you think alright that's a wrinkle so this size bloke says zero day are a bunch of Secret Service [ __ ] I mean suppose it doesn't make sense the bombings were too sophisticated for randos but says could pull it off officially s IRS or the signals intelligence response service abuses surveillance data drawn from CDOs to identify large-scale terrorist and criminal threats then listen Delvian to shoot the threats in the face for example and in the wake of escalating violence in London the s IRS is extending the right to use lethal force to law enforcement and Albion cetera station unofficially FRS use the data to read your mind and arrest you for having naughty thoughts so we have means and opportunity which leaves motive so as a fascist pricks but they're supposed to stop groups like zero day from doing terrorist shouts why cause one when you meet this guy ask break it [Music] problem there's been some sort of fight here our contact is missing s IRS might be on to him if you get access to the area surveillance infrastructure I can rebuild the scene in AR I'll make it up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's done it now return to the scene and I'll reconstruct what happen to our contact yo can I ask what you're doing here ain't say nothing of what you mean why you don't know ah bollocks you're undercover aren't you trying to see if I'll talk ain't gonna happen it's all good take it easy I ain't seen nothing ZG Lopez they are natively construction in progress that appears to be our contact Jesus yes it certainly doesn't look like his best day does it analyze the clues in the AR workspace to find out what happened to him this is a non-lethal weapon so odds are he's still alive though he may not want to be [Applause] they've taken our s IRS contact away but they may still be nearby I can reconstruct the vehicles path from unsecured CCTV recordings that should allow you to follow it [Applause] [Music] [Music] you
