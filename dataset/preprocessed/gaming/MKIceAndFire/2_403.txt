realized the promise of smart cities with ctos a city-wide operating system merging big data with surveillance security and transit programs with a few hundred lines of code hackers were able to hijack its central servers and [ __ ] the entire grid many believe the attack would be a killing blow for smart city development they were wrong coordinated from the heart of silicon valley ctos 2.0 has been implemented across the united states ushering in the internet of things 6.4 billion connected devices now serve as collection points mapping and recording our daily routines making a more secure and more invasive system but who else is listening big brother no longer works alone thousands of little brothers monitor and aggregate your every move building a complete digital profile of you to be bought sold or stolen in an instant toys study your children reporting their play habits back to marketers appliances consoles and home security systems give corporations a window into your private life control of your vehicle and mobile device can now be breached remotely by anyone at any time you may think that you are immune or underestimate the risk but your digital shadow is already compromised insurance companies use algorithms to monitor your life habits and limit or deny coverage health providers determine if your cancer is worth treating search results and news fees are skewed to bias mood and influence your vote engineering social uprisings on a massive scale you are now less valuable than the data you produce this is the new reality going dark is no longer an option with threats to personal freedom rising many are stepping forward whistleblowers activists and hackers have drawn their battle lines putting the establishment on watch but are they threats

you josh we spent all night modifying our app so you can get followers to download the app and we can use their processing power for the cause this is happening it's really happening man this is happening you better get to it hell yeah man barbarians are at the gate and ready to bust some roman heads yeah we're going to focus on some high profile ops playing for exposure and laughs to get people to download our app don't worry so it was something fun marcus check you out alive and dry i wasn't sure after your moonlight swim come here you've got to check this out behold our very own open source research app so like all of us here pool vulnerabilities that we find and we encourage everyone to share their work their research etc okay so what's the research app do why didn't our skill set make us irresistible to the gender of our choice what so it's like uh i know kung fu kind of deal if kung fu was a gender and not so absolutely [Music] [Music] behold the wonders of technology a 3d printer this is the army of printers it is capable of pumping out an arsenal of lethal weapons down seriously yep once you master it voila hipster merchant of death all good except i'm no hipster you keep telling yourself that now try to make something but don't blow us up [Music] [Music] good to have another brother here good to be here man are you all hackers yeah kind of a basic requirement to get invited into the hacker space but we all have our specialties like josh over there always building [ __ ] that shouldn't work now he's trying to build this big-ass drone and wrench good engineer too but better at breaking [ __ ] apart and yo satara sis got skills as an artist and a graphic designer without her dead sex walking around without a face or voice what about you what's your superpower tactical coordinator or cat herder take your pick i make dead set go where it has the most impact you heard of primate those are some real dirty hacking [ __ ] yeah i've brushed up against him before it wasn't pleasant all right that's what i like to hear link up with me when you're ready to do this and i'll fill you in there's always someone running ops against prime mate bet they'd love your help it's something right this whole place is something we used to keep track of news feeds on here but now it's our follower wall so it knows if we're trending no no it's based on hard values how many people downloaded our app how much processing power we have access to you know nice and speaking of which we're downloading the dedsec app into your phone as we speak when it's ready open it up click the suggested up and hit the park outside so we can test it sounds good one more thing i put a reminder on your phone so you remember what we're gunning for get enough processing power to take down bloom [Music] the spiritual organization new dawn is accusing oakland city councilor miranda commae of defamation in a recent interview the council i described the organization as quote a fraudulent pyramid scheme the organization seems to have fought back with more than just lawyers the counselor's private life was recently revealed when medical records of the counselors transgender treatments were mysteriously released to the media a spokesperson for new dawn said that the organization had nothing to do with the leaked medical records and in her statement accused councilor khame of desperately seeking attention the app's downloaded and i'm in the park what am i testing start profiling things around you people devices see what you can pull from them that's what helps us figure out our next ops and running ops that are important to people is how we get them interested in dedsec the more followers download our app the more intel we get it's the circle of life and see if you can find some components to help us with our research the app is your data mining tool [Music] okay okay i got this so what now up to you man you're free to do whatever catches your eye we post ops to the deadset app and doing them helps us get followers and followers are our skriller followers mean computers which boosts our processing power which lets us do bigger and better ops is whoops oh i'm so sorry hey so what's this about bobo diggs you know bobo's working on a new album right yeah i heard well you won't get to hear it [ __ ] gene carcaney just put

name ah the the red room they called it the red room oh yeah man and one last thing man like your last five movies have been just disappointing as [ __ ] so act better all right keep your chin up peace all right i have a new lead on how we can burn new dawn but i'm missing a key piece jimmy siska is afraid of something called the red room jimmy in the red room the red room seems to be some kind of rehab center where they send problematic church members people who go there sometimes they stay gone if they're kidnapping people this is potentially huge for us this goes beyond my resources want me to reach out nah i got this damn miranda speaking hi it's me marcus marcus all the way how did you get mine up right i forgot i need something it's about new dawn have you ever heard of the red room miranda texting you an address me me there i just need info [Music] marcus have you looked at our follower account lately yeah we're making waves we've got to make people see bloom for what it is marcus the longer it takes the more they rely on ctos they'll get used to things the way they are and then dead sec becomes a conspiracy theory fringe it won't matter if what we're saying is true if people don't want it to be yeah but this is just the start when we show them the [ __ ] that's brewing behind bloom's doors they'll join us in droves what kind of trouble you in we're making

area and there's one that just doesn't check out over there hmm they have it marked as an educational center doors are locked nobody answers security comes and goes does that sound like an educational center to you no it sounds like a re-education center i'll stick around go see what you can find thanks miranda marcus did you meet with miranda i did we think this is the place but we don't know what

completely bulletproof your privacy is absolutely secure bold claim steven aren't you worried hacker groups will see that as a challenge i'll say what you mean surely dead sec now if they want to go up against us i invite them to try home 2.0 is an os with teeth no he called us out by name yep you don't know who we [ __ ] with it's on now that's why i've been trying to crack 2.0 there's just one see little problem what here hold this stand back great [Music] chip it's a little oh hard to get out but there's no point in trying to use the previous version's hardware to jack the new os why because they changed the ports following the capital sky to force obsolescence uh but luckily a little birdie told me that 2.0 should be packing a farm fresh zero day now that might just be a shame damn right and that is why you my friend are going to hijack me a 2.0 pre-order shipment before some do-gooder white hat tells home how to cock-block us you've got a weird relationship with technology you know that right he didn't mean it um get me started [Music] go so where are you got it i got the list okay great so now all you have to do is stroll over to the distribution center and match the number plate of one of their trucks to the one that's headed downtown and this is so analog i told you luddites and when it rains where are they supposed to go are you supposed to be here i don't think so that is the dumbest [ __ ] you dead sect move it i need something like i'm so proud [Applause] [Music] i found the truck great and what are you waiting for smash and grab my friend [Music]

if you think i won't whoa whoa whoa can't destroy your system well then please allow me to introduce myself [Laughter] tell me it's just kiki it's just kiki we're house cleaning the felines josh is brute forcing the crypto key all right so are we going to work for this absolutely we're not letting these trolls drag us into their sewer detect doesn't back down so what what good is going to work with them it won't break their lock on us it doesn't change anything they got in no [ __ ] that hey listen up we're not gonna let primate derail us let's be smart about this all right primate sells zero-day exports to anyone with money yeah [ __ ] governments bloom noodle even goddamn terrorists sons of ragnarok what hell yeah sons of ragnarok they hire themselves out to sons of ragnarok right so we find out as much as we can about their people and their operations we're not gonna roll over not for anybody yo josh man where you at now it's war move i'll put a message out on the back channels these guys are bound to have enemies who'll give us some intel let's cornhole these [ __ ] keep working on kiki i'm gonna go have some words with lenny you know where she's at she likes to hang at that club in castro i know the place yeah bad ass looks good ready for the chip then uh hold on i'm savoring oh look at this dick bag so how many lap dogs you got scrambling behind the scenes to crack my uncrackable lock credit where credit's due now uh you want me to ask nicely because you could just give me the key and i'd be on my way what it's ransomware [ __ ] which means you want what oh i want you to make one of those idiotic vids of yours wow i didn't know you were a follower oh you want the precious pros to adore you not on my [ __ ] watch [ __ ] i want a public broadcast that says dead sec isn't worth two seconds never mind 15 minutes of the public's [ __ ] time spice it up add some tears is that all sure for now but if you don't do it then i start naming names oh that's right names identities a veritable zoo [ __ ] damn looks like you're not leaving us much choice yeah go ahead get good until then why don't you run along and make the video i want what does she want she wants us to release a vid where we smear ourselves no way are we doing that we're gonna send her a message all right we're gonna blow up her [ __ ] instead ragnarok just hired prime hate to upload malware into atm bank machines it is folks they run that through their main club hangout rhonda's diner i'll send ghoulie there to scope the place meet up with him when you get there uh so [Music] local police are increasingly alarmed by the violent acts of the tesca street gang they have recently been linked to several east bay killings the violence of which has been described as extreme even for gangs according to experts the chief of police issued a warning that ctos and law enforcement will protect san francisco from criminal organizations by the full extent of the law uh party dude we're at the bar in sausalito come on over wouldn't miss it [Music] hey [Music] [Music] hmm what's up goalie what say retro ragna boys hired primate for some machine hacks huh ragnarok has been using credit skimmers for a long time low scale payoff but hiring pa to load malware into the bank machine has tripled their cash flow i'll bet it has the code skims the data and sends the copy to pa neither the user nor the bank have any way of knowing ah but we know yes we do won't take much to mess with their code imagine how pissed sons of ragnarok will be with lenny and primate if anything would have happened to that operation that's the idea it's going to be dangerous you hang back googly all right man good luck time to [ __ ] up this operation [Music] hey you all right atms are here destroy the machines however you want [Music] uh [Music] i'm nah man lenny's cool she keeps it real right fair enough i hope she can keep her team yeah not so sure we can trust any of them just [ __ ] kids what do they know about real life anyway hey [Music] right now it makes sense that we rigged them here rig them with the sniffers no like i said we'll upload our malware because think we made our point it's as though a bajillion people exploited by zero day fraud cried out in gratitude lenny's gonna have a hard time explaining this to the sun what is this [ __ ] [Music] search for him and don't [ __ ] stop till you find him [Music] you stupid [ __ ] hamster septic ways purple dragon snot [ __ ] lenny that's some telemarketing charm right there so we're not gonna do that vid thing you know what do whatever don't even care not two shits given i know my lock is still on your server [Music] lenny's right kiki's still locked marcus doesn't matter game time is done we go to their digs and get the decryption key back channel info says p8 has a bunker a bunker but there's no location lenny has a rfid implant can we find the bunker with that yeah it's possible sweet time to go see lenny no more [ __ ] around wrench you're my backup yes hackers flagging terrorists for the fbi see you sure you want to keep going with this i hate you [ __ ] and you know why the propaganda vids the graffiti the anti-whatever do-gooder [ __ ] you [ __ ] take yourself so [ __ ] seriously oh you coming at us but you need to understand we are all in this together we can all hey what kind of [ __ ] nude do you think i am and what kind of [ __ ] stain are you for getting caught i just thought it was worth it okay [ __ ] see how far you get with dead servers we gotta ping on the primate bunker and lenny is clueless about it maybe come on you guys give her too much credit [Music] wrench important question tom aliens versus predator the question doesn't make any sense i mean aliens basically use predators as an external womb to perpetuate their species and the predators well they come from a world where you hunt or you die they need xenomorphs to hone them into elite warriors it's a [ __ ] up ecosystem that doesn't really have a winner okay ignoring the science behind it purely hypothetical one-on-one who wins are we talking ridley scott or cameron i like the sequel better let's go with them marcus that's a bold statement we need to have that conversation later but versus a cameron alien they're more aggressive so the predator wins easily he's way ahead on a technological level so he's going to stand his ground when the xeno rushes him but that's like asking who wins between one man and one zombie the aliens hunting packs okay okay how many aliens would make it a fair fight with one predator three i could see a predator spearmaster keeping two away with a young chuck combo stick but a third zeno is gonna be able to get close even if he kills it that blood splash is gonna melt right through him it's a hard call you'd have to plug their stats into a probability algorithm yeah they both fought judge dredd which is pretty badass aliens fought batman so did predator let's not forget superman and batman versus aliens and predator who won can i remember doesn't matter you know what i give the overall win to predator yeah enlighten me prayer has taken on archie [ __ ] you're right archie's basically the top of the food chain you think predator's more of a betty or veronica type of guy neither gotta go with sabrina oh you make a good argument i buy it predator comes out on top what's the plan get in get the key free kiki can we have the bunker can we can we you have to help clean it this time she always makes me clean let's start with getting in first [Music] [Music] okay guys what's the plan well lenny's got that door seriously locked down so plan b i got something there's an old exhaust duct probably overgrown so i'll find it uh oh hey get him oh easy man [Applause] ugh [Music] is that lenny she's rigged the place to blow what what are we looking at two no three it looks like [ __ ] maybe four they don't seem connected so i don't think the order matters how many notes just find another way out guys guys i need to concentrate [Music] oh ah good t-minus two minutes [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Applause] jesus you [ __ ] filled donut hole look at that seems like i handled the booms this is not [ __ ] over um yeah it is hey marcus home sweet hacker space it's finally rid of that prime eight smell is it ready yep wrench had to spray a bit of bombs be gone and then whoosh go check it out hey marcus you used to try roxanne in tang war that's that's elvish hey so tara hey put this up on the screen josh it's from miranda you're being followed a friend of mine has given this to you at great risk watch your backs as a target on it hard what that's us [ __ ] right now hey check this one out someone's spying on us from right outside [ __ ] fuckify his [ __ ] up hey be cool man sneak out i'm gonna go out the front and see if i can uh spot our tail yeah there's a van yeah that's them get what you can [Music] oh man who are these people they got a ton of stuff on us lots more photos and looks like a map of josh's daily movements other stuff what the hell oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] what it's fbi you hacked into the fbi listen i got into their comp channel somebody's trying to access our data source get all agents out here converge on the suspect spread out and start looking [Music] hear that what's going on some hot [ __ ] auntie hacking damon picked up on what we're doing hold on a sec oh man this about time oh we're getting an incredible amount of stuff here man we got to broadcast some of this i'm a little busy right now wrench totally [Music] you're making it harder on yourself [Music] [Music] marcus we're good get the [ __ ] out of there [Music] we're messing with the fbi man we gotta totally restrict communication on this okay but minimal communication em face to face is best meet me at the place where you know where wrench damn to the cafe then uh you like this place huh food is average get anywhere i can't tell she thinks my mask is hot or creepy the main fbi office isn't a dell in this building we really need the rest of that data because because something hanky's going on something big different hackers i know we've been noticing vans falling around and [ __ ] um well it wouldn't be the first time the fbi's tried to strong-arm hackers join us or die type [ __ ] why now the timing is suspicious given her popularity how much do you trust ray he might have cut a deal oh man no way hey trust me on this one maybe miranda could help yeah maybe she uses a car service all the time i'll tap into the feed and show up as a driver can i uh can i get you anything uh i'm just leaving can i ask you a question do you think my friend's mask is hot or creepy you staying for another cup of coffee oh my god [Music] uh [Music] [Music] i'm gonna hurt marcus what are you doing hey miranda just making a few extra bucks taking fares as if where you going going to visit my mother you followed my lead yep fbi i cannot confirm or deny that we want to strike back but i couldn't get all the data i need to get into the oakland office you're coloring way outside the lines marcus yeah and is that why you showed up as my driver you think i'm being scoped by the feds too isn't that why you wouldn't tell us where those photos came from i was merely being prudent and i'm being prudent by talking to you in person so marcus i'd be remiss if i didn't point out that a young man who discovers that the federal bureau of investigation is after him should probably re-examine some of his life choices good advice particularly a young black man guilty good we got not out of the way so how did you get those photos of us in the bar let's just say i have a source does your source have anything else i should know word is the feds are going after hacker's heart [Music] oh yeah word is the feds are going after hackers hard they're trying to co-opt or blackmail every group they can for what they want control of all the zero days and they don't want competition damn now the fbi is in on it hacking might not be cool anymore i'm not joking marcus they're gonna come after dedsec and they're serious [Music] what it's for the fbi office i have a friend that can help she'll have to use the moscow rules what's that mean it means there's an old-style pay phone outside of delums pick it up identify yourself as fred record the signal you get oh that's [ __ ] dope i'm gonna give you a [ __ ] rating on the drive around [Music] [Music] stay calm this is fred [Music] [Applause] bye-bye totally quadratic 15 years ago so every time i go visit him i go over his favorite taqueria [Music] [Music] [Music] open sesame okay marcus they gotta have some data pointing us to their spying post just tell me where to go to get it that's the thing em they're clever bastards looks like they've separated up all the data i don't know which server to hack oh great so glad you waited until i'm inside to discover this little fact get up to the antenna on the roof and put a transceiver on it if i can track the data coming in i can figure out which server is which sure no problem go up on the roof place a transceiver got nothing better to do oh dude this is gonna take a second don't waste time enjoying the view [Music] this buddy [Music] so it's set great hold on i'm tracing the flow now i got nothing but tom up here on the fbi's roof got it okay i lit it up for you on your map hmm ah oh so uh uh agent down right here [Applause] wow [Music] more stuff on us incredible man profiles fingerprints in high school sitara got in trouble for spiking the principal's coffee [Music] there's a ton of stuff coming in but i don't see any hideout location wrench they're onto me oh get out get

hideout's frequency we just got to triangulate and we'll find out where it's at i get it the transceiver i left on top of dellums is our first point right i found a couple other antennas to complete the triangle i'll hit one you do the other marking it on your map now hey wrench i'm about to get the third point here get it done man you get anywhere with that waitress gonna hear about next thursday dude yeah she seems pretty together i'm not like hold it right there i'm not doing anything on the ground now i'm just walking my rinse went dark the fbi got him i heard that jesus give me his last location it's no good they'll take him to the hideout you've got to finish the triangulation to find out where he is hurry come on come on i gotta get this [Music] [Music] transceiver placed triangulating now it's the old 16th street station let's see what's going on hack into their security cams hacking in now this is like a roy orbison thing or something you see my dad told me that roy

standing here none go ahead call your boss call chief agent monroe call her now what the hell is up with marcus oh he's a nice guy he's misguided but come on he can't protect you from what's coming the fbi is going to make an example of him i mean that's kind of what they do it's too bad but you you have a decision you can decide to be on board the the ride or or just get run over by it you're rendering everything we've got against this guy inadmissible excuse me his agent fuentes is having a really hard time seeing the long term so you're free to go tell your friends about the deal if they want to be off the fbi's radar they just got to come see me yes me or else things ain't gonna be pretty no no no no no no no no see i think it's time you saw the world through your own eyes like a big

look he's got the fbi on speed dial and he's gonna come after us hard so i need all of you we can't do this without each other we won't thanks the fbi has been coercing hackers into providing them with hacking software for their own use fbi uses this software to bypass the legal system and gain access to your private data with no oversight or warranty the fbi also illegally detained a dedsec member in an attempt to coerce us into working for them as well to the fbi why we do not live in a police state you are not the secret police and the constitution does not exist at your whim here we've exposed your plot to force hackers to help you dedsec will continue to watch you for the sake of every free american era dedsec has given you the truth do what you will [Music] ctos verified

my time is it's the galilee rocket so what man yeah well that there galilei rocket is number four the satellites there karen all blooms [ __ ] yeah this just got interesting uh-huh those satellites are putting a lot of data out of our reach this is next level [ __ ] my friend you've been waiting for your chance to hit bloom oh yeah and now we can hit him [ __ ] hard you're thinking about putting a little something something on the next satellite launching piggybacking in the orbit uh-huh you a crazy [ __ ] man i'm out of this world baby oh [ __ ] you drive yeah [Music] drop me off at the hackerspace i'll look through our intel on galilee and talk you through the building if this works we'll have a martian's eye view of bloom's server farm and all the sweet juicy data contained therein a big company like bloom must have server farms across the country well with any luck we'll key into one farm use it to find the others we've been trying so long to keep up with silicon valley i want dedsec to be on the same playing field for everything we've done we still don't know exactly what dushan's up to you think we'll find dick pics have you been listening in on our convos tara if we get a hold of a douche and dick pic we have the ultimate leverage yeah especially if it's small or worry guys and knowing him his dick probably has his own [ __ ] man bun on it dude hipster dick i like i like hi i'm hipster dick i only wear skinny condoms yeah i wasn't circumcised before it was cool i'm surrounded by children all right all right guys that's enough we've upset pops over here [Music]

followers of the hacker cell dead sec have been growing over the past few months rumors are spreading that certain silicon valley insiders are bracing for another attack from hackers this anonymous hacker group has been escalating their targets to expose various corporations and institutions for alleged illegal practices and this has drawn the attention of many citizens who are now supporting dead sex efforts if not necessarily their methods [Music] [Music] [Music] greetings to you hi there i can see it's a miracle marcus excellent you got my back now i got your back your fourth and your side to side bro dope seriously on human culture welcome to galilee from here you want to get to the clean room it's environmentally controlled full of sensitive equipment so try not to leave any

they've got the whole place locked down with trip lasers and guys with guns greetings fellow security personnel everything conducting is duties status [Applause] i've reason to suspect illegal network access we need to go off the grid uh nothing to report [Music] oh [Music] what was that okay they're doing let's go [Music] [ __ ] yeah i've heard every one of our rockets contains a message from earth you remember the golden record they sent up with the voyager spacecraft same thing or so i've heard but what the message remains to say is anyone's guess no i've never seen them but knowing this bunch it's bound to be call to action sorry buddy this is a hands-on operation [Music] well done let's see where do they keep the mobos in there it's cool i got this he's not here all right kid plant my magic non-clipper chip in that rocket and ding fries are done the rc's not going to be able to hold on to the board damn if only we had somebody there with working hands touched you know my dad took me to the air and space museum when i was like 10 years old that was nothing compared to this rockets and dinosaurs man i mean you never upgrade status oh [Music] [Music] greetings fellow security everything [Music] my control complete [Music] [Music] out find him so [ __ ] difficult yes oh all right where's the funny bone at don't forget the water on the knee hey ray you think i can officially put rocket scientists on my resume now what do i look like career counselor but they just failed so far that's not going to end well now that's a [ __ ] up language [Music] and that kids is how you bug a satellite i've got a sack full of cookies waiting here for you it'll be a while before the rocks regular launch we'll call you when it's time until then you'll buy yourself something pretty but or don't i mean i don't really care what you do yes there are no cookies um [Music] marcus the rock is being prepped for takeoff yeah get your ass back here launch party [Music] foreign [Music] the man of the hour come on what's the crusher launch wait oh [ __ ] please i'm clearly cisco jake captain cisco we are minutes away from having bloom at our mercy well we're gonna cook the [ __ ] out of there goose t-minus 20 nineteen eighteen seventeen ninety five qwerty googleplex you know just imagining that big data load is enough to get me to half mast and touching cloth at the same freaking time three two one [Applause] holy look at that hell of a view up here time to blow the living [ __ ] out of bloom bloom's network covers even more globe than we thought even a web this complex has to have a way in somewhere i'm picking up some points of entry a few of these data hubs have their share of vulnerabilities love it let's go sml gateway with adaptive security no way through it i could spend months and still get nowhere with this no there is always a way hey what happens to data centers during a power outage their ups kicks in what else what if that goes too the firewall would drop we'd be one step closer to delaware wrench that's brilliant you should do that funny you should say that cetera what what foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] foreign we're [ __ ] what the [ __ ] did you do wrench shut down the power any other requests why use a hammer when you have a wrench that's what i'm about yeah i pulled a stun like that once wrench riots ensued people died i don't that kind of thing doesn't bother you look at all this tech wrench am i drooling i'm sorry i can't hear you over the sound of meech ruling you know your way around these servers joshua i think i can speak to them [Music] josh you are definitely the man uh thank you ray um so welcome to dublin ireland boys ah i thought this was dublin ohio let's look around make ourselves at home [Music] i think you'll find everton here in shipshape well it doesn't hurt to take a look don't get me wrong i think security on it for a good practice you know how it is anyway take your time no hurry what the hell jesus christ look i gotta look after this circle back shortly don't touch anything [Music] okay security guru locked by pc now i'm waiting around with me hand on me boom there you go [Music] hey we're clear to delaware what he's right look we've got access to delaware time to get what we came for pretty goddamn spectacular let's get them [Music] all the bloom's metadata is about to be out this is the big one you got this [Music] oh [ __ ] look at the size of that guys we still got this right [Music] man they really have this locked down [Music] [Music] hey marcus how's it going you know it's a little stressful doing this with all of you watching marcus marcus seriously you're gonna do this now marcus marcus shouldn't you guys go [ __ ] yourselves or something [Music] yes [Music] [Music] three [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] this [Laughter] [Music] uh [Music] oh i'm gonna leave these guys a little memento of my visit marcus what are you up to uh-uh it's a surprise what what hey not yet did it work wait for it you see what i did there oh mad skulls bro [Music] so yes marcus you beautiful bastard okay all right okay guys guys look oh it'll take forever to go through all this uh focus on why the satellites are in play ray yeah already got eyes on it holy loving [ __ ] it's a backbone satellite backbone what about the latency there's no way they can match the speed of fiber optics if i'm reading this right they are bloom did it they're bypassing the undersea cables with satellites that's a quantum leap in tech i mean if this works it'll take hackers years to catch up here and not for us we're already in hey who's on bloom's client list we got noodle we got invite we got titus we got galilee we got the government the new york stock exchange wait so all these companies just agreed to up and funnel all their data through blue does anyone else find the suspicious all that data at bloom's fingertips that's like the world's most powerful monopoly can we do tobacco no no even if we could we still need answers hey everybody listen up our work is far from over but with this score at least we're on the playing field so pick a target invite titus whatever and start digging look for [ __ ] they're not supposed to be doing right do sean wants to paint us as an enemy let's show them what going to war with us really means yeah yeah hey what's up you know what's up i saw those wheels spinning look i don't want you using marcus as your personal weapon against bloom where the [ __ ] is this coming from i know about raymond kenny and his great collateral damage we're using each other here that was always the deal satara marcus is a big boy he knows how to look after himself sure weird in a free and just society every person is treated with dignity in a free and just society leaders are accountable to those they govern and in a free and just society individuals can rise as far as their talents and hard work will take them do you believe your society is just just do you believe you are free free perhaps you trust in the power of democracy that your vote counts companies now buy politicians and manipulate elections do you believe in the power of the free market the stock exchange is a puppet show for the rich your wealth is controlled by people you've never met or met do you believe the government protects you national defense now aims to protect the government from you don't take our word for it join us as we launch our biggest operation yet and see for yourselves the foundations of u.s policy have failed us all democracy free market national security getsec will give you the truth do what you will uh marcus josh is swimming through the deep end of the galilee data and he's got something he wants to show you cool what's the scale of the thing come back home when you can this might be big what's up ray joshua picked up something strange from the galileo hack it's code but the comments are in chinese oh tell me the chinese didn't hack the satellite backbone already not the satellite the submarine cables connecting china and the us that's not even interesting to drop your pants apart bloom's been monitoring the hack joshua says the hackers are stealing data and using it to make a mint on the new york stock exchange the hackers turned inside a traitor so it's not the first time it's happened yeah we'll get this the program the hackers are using drumroll josh please pattern recognition software sure [ __ ] looks like bellwether to me and bloom knows so why are they sitting on it well that's why we're talking we have nothing solid to go on except our chinese hackers these are access to pre-clear a cargo ship landing in san francisco there are shipping containers just arrived at the board i'll check it out uh um yo sitar what's the container number i'm looking for lv four two six oh seriously you testing my geek food i bet yeah it starts with sibu 707 okay i see it but i got other containers in the way then i have to find a way to unblock it [Music] so [Music] uh jesus christ calm down calm the [ __ ] down oh [ __ ] riddle me this who around here is chinese and deals in human trafficking auntie shoe boys for sure well it's some high-end human smuggling like i ain't never seen before his container is nicer than my last apartment i'm sending you a picture got it who is he in why does he have a bloody nose noodle translate isn't his friend hey he's not your run-of-the-mill cargo either not sure what i can do with it let's see if he can match his face online my guess he's got an education if they went to all this trouble right i'll start with chinese schools and get back to you if i find something okay oh and by the way uh welcome to america marcus i found your guy what you got graduate of shanghai jiao tong university he's got a double masters in statistic in business he's a quant they definitely need him to number crunch that stock market data which means the auntie shoe boys are in the business of insider trading i have a contact in chinatown who's connected with the anti-shoe boys i'm sending you his coordinates maybe he can help you get answers [Music] heads up i'm checking up on a lead in chinatown i think it's an auntie shoe safe house or something i'll let you know if i find anything okay keep an eye out for anything we can use related to the stock market hack we can't lose huh [Music] enjoy your last few seconds of life can i help you you're a monster oh god hello ah [Music] okay system's clean i think bringing it back online [Music] we're wasting time he's gone now this is promising let's see what you're hiding you got anything good documents you read chinese nah but i do read maps and diagrams maps and diagrams of what looks like a floating server farm computer nodes generators they're in international water somewhere near the china u.s cable the pacific fleet's been chasing boats and submarines away from that thing for years but that's a lot of wet to cover now when they also feed you coordinates thank you auntie shoe boys great now get out of there [Music] check over that way [Music] i swear if this happens come on this is scary as [ __ ] imagine what happens if bloom takes ctos global countries without any regulations countries where the government will actively use it against their people it would be catastrophic a nightmare scenario and it's probably already in progress so how do we even begin to stop it we keep hitting their corporate allies expose the risks the abuse we're not fighting against bloom itself that's a losing battle we've got to wreck its image and destroy its brand okay i made it and i'm good to go hey ray no lie about the view i do not lie my friend uh-huh you two play nice you ready ray yep protocols are ready for you i'm gonna see what's up with that barge what's the plan if i read the blueprints right and i know i did it's got cameras that i can hack i'm going for an inside peek and then what i jack the [ __ ] out of it as soon as i figure out how that's crazy i love it i want their main server and that means bringing it closer to us i'm going inside come on man don't keep us in suspense what do you see damn they're not [ __ ] around here i see a lot of top end hardware i also see an admin terminal but i'll need to snoop around and find some login credentials [Music] i think i found the password you read chinese it's a numerical sequence can't hurt to try hey hey now someone here likes toys josh toys or zotero toys the kind that needs batteries the kind i can control remotely now you're just playing with me now this room looks important this is why we love people who check that little remember me box i found a login name i think i have what i need to access the ship's systems sweet get yourself back to the admin terminal [Music] i'm in any idea how you're bringing the barge in closer to shore you should totally spoof the fuel gauges make them think they have a leak yeah sounds good okay i spiked the fuel gauges made them think they're low on fuel they're coming in the gas up nice we've got a boat waiting for you at the marin docks [Music] [Music] what you do he looks at you [ __ ] if he's [Music] not great i don't even like [Music] retro i line this up for you nice you coming with this is all yours when the barge comes in range this will get you there fast [Music] marcus i timed every barge hack with activity on the new york stock exchange every time it matched up with periods leading up to volatile trading all the way back to 2007. 2007. wait you saying the financial crisis was an early bellwether test to manipulate buying and spending patterns on an already susceptible market but how did the auntie shoe boys have access to it that early unless unless they were given the access to it plausible deniability maybe [Music] i reach the barge keep the line open keep the line open you're out there without a lifeline i promise not to drown i'm going in wish me luck what's your plan there may be hundreds of servers on border ship of that size i need to hack the admin terminal to locate the server we want oh my god [Music] nope not here what's that look out one [Music] ah that should do see if the back door is still good i found the main server on that system just need to physically locate it come on what they describe as portable may not be what you're thinking oh how big you think this thing is industrial size i'll keep the line open found the server how exactly am i getting this off the boat the blueprints you found show a service elevator shaft they say that shaft is a bad mother shut your mouth i'm talking about elevator shafts i can dig it get the server up on deck and we'll take care of the rest [ __ ] how do you get away from us so so [ __ ] that's not good what's the plan i'm almost there josh what the [ __ ] watch the clock [Music] i'm 29 seconds away damn man what i like to be punctual okay where are you you should see me right about now what am i looking holy [ __ ] that snow moon is that your drone surprise custom built for us [ __ ] oh god oh [ __ ] stop [ __ ] down oh god okay okay oh what [ __ ] hey yo josh man how many times have you flown this thing you know michelle we're just glad that these hackers were finally brought to justice it frankly shows a flaw in the system from the submarine cables to the spying and sabotage by groups like dedsec now i will tell you this bloom is working on a product that will eliminate this problem [ __ ] gave the hackers bellwether axes so they could test it then spun the attack as a vulnerability on the submarine cables got to hand it to the [ __ ] no more companies are going to sign up for bloom's satellite pipeline okay so we released everything we have on dusan okay let the public hang him like they did [ __ ] mussolini breaking his neck isn't the answer well sitting on our asses isn't either okay so before once shut up he's baiting us think he's trying to neutralize us one last time as a threat and we are a threat we agreed all of us to play this thing out on our own terms has that changed good we almost have everything we need to hurt him permanently so let's all get back to work and let's bring this thing home hmm all right so we've got all of dedsec dumpster diving through that galileo intercept anything good metric as [ __ ] times are good i've already picked out a serious opportunity for us turns out congressman thrust's re-election campaign is getting logistical support from invite that's weird and illegal right why not just give them money the invite's got years of collected data i mean that shit's worth way more than money but why back a doofus like thrust dude couldn't tell his ass if someone [ __ ] handed it to him well uh let's mess him up break some windows see what he does yeah create a reaction might flush him out let's announce this marcus you think you can uh bitch-slap him for us oh yeah i got something for him i'm gonna go [ __ ] up that big ass billboard with his dumb face all over it send a clear message and i'm gonna hit up his campaign funding and i am going to [ __ ] up his social media and i am going to [ __ ] up his website and i am going to [ __ ] up his online ads i'm gonna go for another beer freedom is going to only be protected if democracy thrives but corporate interests are rigging the elections your elections your favorite social media giant invite knows everything about you and they're manipulating your feed to tailor your opinion to their interests they are holding you into voting for their puppet congressman mark russ invite wields the single most powerful population control tool ever created defend democracy help us tear down info lend us your processing power by downloading our app and together we will expose congressman for us join us [Applause] all right i can work with this [Applause] so [Music] so [Applause] you there i'm looking right at a giant congressman thrust up on the billboard do your thing man here goes mmm [Music] he'll know we're after him now way to go i've got a whole team of dedsec members out working on thrust's other signs nice meanwhile i put together a payload to deploy an invite server meet me outside invite and i'll fill you in sure see you nice work on the billboard we wanted a reaction we got a reaction yeah we got an email between thrust and his cronies he's seriously pissed he's trying to pass a law against groups with the capability of revealing proprietary directives and actions that's us it sure sounds like something invite would want it's part of the reason why they're helping thrust mm-hmm you need to hack into the ceo's office oh married catskill and here's an exploit to open up the back door under the servers another usb i could start a damn store with these just don't sell that one you know last time i was in here things didn't go so well worst time ever really yeah bad memories they've increased security because of that by the way well that's just great news [Music] oh mean you understand me right here because i don't know what you're saying what's going on uh my way home move away or i'll be forced to shoot only registered operatives are allowed beyond this area is closed to the general public what's that [Music] friends okay [Music] okay [Music] god [ __ ] [Music] god [Music] go uh oh you're the man okay what's up with this you seeing what i'm seeing looks like [ __ ] they're using bellwether damn that means bloom is behind all this oh man they're manipulating people into voting for thrust know what should be easy to refactor this to push against thrust ah that's genius do it don't forget to tap the ceo's phone headed there now why the hell hey the hell [ __ ] up ah phone tapped we'll record all her conversations we'll get everything she says hey you how's it going now get the hell out of there [Music] [Music] wow [Music] okay i'm out josh is working on changing the invite algorithm to screw thrusts hey one of the other candidates is having a campaign rally out in front of city hall i might just meet you there cool uh [Music] running more [Music] hmm and the big data companies are geniuses at separating you from your data yo theresa moretti seems to have a shot right if invite gets its way no election is safe what bellwether has the power to influence every voter in the whole damn country and thruster's gonna be the guy covering for him that's why he's so important well ever since we messed with invites code congressman thrust has taken a hit in the polls invite is freaking out yo am you gotta hear what we recorded all right this is thrus talking to mary catskill and vice's let's meet in ceo i have something that will square this away oh thank goodness let's meet at my penthouse up the security and i'll see you there thanks so much mary we'll keep it all on thecube i'll go record what's happening and we'll use it against him and i will help you out your carriage oh wait why thank you sir something tells me security's gonna be crazy i did some research whole place has security cams we can use those to find out what's up security cams that break their security you know it [Music] the vote's one of the few things people got left you know invites tracking everybody's voting patterns of course why wouldn't they this invite thing drives me nuts i mean companies manipulate people all the time but they're so [ __ ] insidious they control all the traffic they know everything about everybody and how to take advantage of [Music] stupid [Music] seriously [Music] i'll go take a look-see i'm gonna scout the area let's see if i can see the penthouse directly check in on your laptop you want to see what goes down mr nemich i'm surprised surprised to be surprised you look like you shot the bet that's hardly fair now you and miss catskill made promises i never promised you anything mark promises are something a five-year-old says mark blackmail is it i know i wish i'd come up with something better but cause the cliche still works this state forgives sexual dalliances far more than it does drug abuse mark i am a united states congressman long story [ __ ] short mark your baby your numbers are taking and we can't afford that now it's time for plan b you do remember what plan b is don't you and here are the schematics if you're interested i thought your program would get me re-elected no miracles are for losers mark don't you want to earn this yourself now anything goes wrong remember you just keep your mouth shut like you in those photos again i'm so sorry about those i'll try better next time you see that dusan's part of this man there is a ton of activity going on over there marcus the building just went off the grid we can't get in or see inside i got to get over there there's got to be some evidence of what's going on i'm on top of the next building he had this penthouse from up here plenty of grains for that on my way so yo bridge hey marcus how's it going [Music] yo check it out huh you can see the whole city from here a lot of people out there man a lot of people yeah getting screwed you don't even feel it just no it's [ __ ] up i know it's gonna be a hell of a fight turning them back into people [ __ ] amen okay dude you find the evidence and i'm on our exit strategy hey is that the congresswoman uh no i do believe that is a helicopter [ __ ] you [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yo sitara i'm ready to go in play me something fresh oh my god oh [ __ ] [Music] wait what was that who's this punk you're in do your thing [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] christ your exit strategy is ready oh man you're gonna love this we lost [Music] which this is crazy [Music] marcus we got their plan b they're going after the voting machines josh please tell me you're not in there marcus marcuster sniper's on the roof snipers what are you talking about they're human i i'm sorry they're they're not supposed to be here duchamp must have hired them why are you whispering we're sprinkling hey man i'm not going in there look so tomorrow they're trucking out these machines to the polling places and what are we supposed to do reverse engineering no that's not feasible given our time frame the virus is military grade the only prudent course is to destroy them all destroy them all what do you want to do blow them up the fort's a military base there's plenty of explosives no voting machines as delays the election yeah we expose the tampering and give people time to make an informed decision hell yeah hey i'm sold josh you sold okay all right isn't blowing up voting machines kind of extreme hell no it's like josh said we buy time for the election it's a civic service essentially [Music] what do you think idiots [Music] he's not here ah ah foreign foreign bye [Music] got em all now you should probably get out of there [Music] [Music] i'm out great hey we put together a video using the stuff you got in the penthouse check it out citizens invite corporation has been using your sacred vote as a play thing targeting you individually invite manipulated your emotions to give support to their puppet mock thrusts but dedsec hacked into invite and changed their algorithms pools reversed instantly [Music] desperate to elect thrust resorted to their own form of hackery here invites ceo mary catskill delivers a virus destined for voting machines to mark thrust himself so the election has been delayed citizens use this time to think do not allow yourselves to be manipulated that sect implores you to think before you fall deadset has given you the truth [Music] i will run you over i swear i will hey [Music] hmm yeah yeah did you find something in the data though yeah um okay well let's just say that all the taxes and the government grants and the research programs you'll notice the koi signs there none of it adds up okay they're collaborating with bloom on something they call the ten-year plan again quality signs which is supposed to improve c2s security then why are they filing patents on military because the ats is going the way of all control systems that's what junior here is a little bot on a mission no he's not that is not your [ __ ] call you think you're just gonna skip through titus's front door and steal all their dirty secrets even uncle sam buys his biometric locks from tardis that's the level of security we're dealing with amigo palm reader that's easy we just need to find a hand i bet you could get one no problem hey that's your plan cut somebody's hand off it works not here there are heart rate monitors an infrared scan the check for blood flow no blood flow no unlock no power okay fine then we we grab someone alive and we get them to open it for us no the heart rate monitors a flag if he's nervous okay then we we inject someone with a with a sedative to bring down their heart rate for [ __ ] sake we already had a working plan here not with him junior off and listen to me you don't get to walk in here like your own place okay this is my garage my hardware he wants to turn junior into a bomb an emp bomb trojan horse style we hit the right hardware fry the database and the doors reset to the default codes easy [ __ ] peasy then all we need is the defaults huh it does work man huh one night one night in the desert together and the two of you are best friends when you all go ahead marcus go ahead take his side okay don't let me get in the way right i grow the [ __ ] up son [ __ ] you hey hey hey hold on chill out man chill out how do we get him inside well first of all we're gonna have to get rid of all this meaningful propaganda stop guys stop just keep the paint when one of these things breaks down titus picks him up from a service depot oh that's your way to get him inside that's good that's very good nice wrench all right all right ready to roll when you are marcus yeah got junior loaded up and back yep he's in there so we'll macgyver and emp at the repair depot hard to believe that's all you really need to break into the world's top security company well not counting the 36 000 robot you stole so what you're saying is i'm the key contributor in this plaque nah i'm saying you're basically a shoplifter a highwayman highwayman oh i like that the masked highwayman stalks the twilight roads ever searching for the kingdom's most treasured relics no job is too small or too demeaning for the masked highwayman the masked highwayman and his underperforming but big-hearted companion the dark stranger you know what i take back highwayman you're now the mass cracker all right i'm gonna whip us up a nasty little emp bomb i don't think i'll have a problem finding the right parts in this place man the robots we could build in here and maybe next time you shouldn't i don't care if it's healthier than cigarettes everybody's walking around foreign foreign no nothing to report so [Music] [Music] everything is in order all clear everything is in order wrench i got the emp ready where's junior now i got him ready at the drop-off zone can you get the door for me you got it visitors are prohibited from this area so okay little guy today is your day make us proud all right junior's ready for pickup next stop titus ranch you and i need the pow wow i have an idea i'm sending you some coordinates to follow ooh a special mission marcus you meet me outside titus when you're ready near the big silicon valley sign are you running the show now nope this one's going to be mostly marcus but i'm going to do everything i can to make sure he gets in there i'll see you there ray [Applause] no someone's firing a gun [ __ ] where you trying to top a glass the more than we drag into the light the more torches and pitchforks we're going to see in response you sure you want to compare your followers to a bunch of angry villagers yeah well no man but the people are angry and they should be they're taking back what's happened yeah just make sure you're pointing them at the right monsters all right anyway you get to go inside titus and play with the robots oh [ __ ] when was this decided man we did rock scissors in dynamite yeah but i wasn't even there no but if it was a tie you went wrench did paper i did dynamite it was a regional thing it's technically they cancel each other out it sounds sounds fair and i sent him into one of the titus warehouses now he's got the delicate job of reading the [ __ ] manual then you are going to go to the front door get the model numbers and send back to him for the default codes i will be nearby looking at blueprints and power plants yo let's do it all right yeah happy hunting happy hunting ah i've got a new bobo track the world has never heard before how's the sound board coming yo a bobo jakes [ __ ] perfect so how do we contact car connie i'm gonna visit his mansion i need to see his face when we do this [Music] hmm you've been randomly selected an investigation has been launched to determine whether invite corporation along with former congressman mark thrust attempted to illegally influence the congressional election evidence of their malfeasance was provided by the controversial hacker group dedsec as a result of their evidence the election itself has been delayed our followers think nailing thrust is the big win here but it's only the frosting on the cake people are going to be doubting their own opinions now nobody's going to admit to getting played with this election but every pro thrust voter is now wondering if they were we've welded bloom and the ctos to the idea that big data is invasive and shitty yup one big invasive shitty cake you're terrible you love it my turn so it's not going to work unless you stick jr i'm going to spew look for a switchbox there's got to be one somewhere we can get through this ah this is fun but don't forget what you came here to do marcus i haven't forgotten just enjoying the ride keep heading toward the loading bays the security room is just off to one side the pain [Music] i don't know if i could go on aight junior's in place everybody say night night to junior [Music] [Applause] the emp worked like a charm right yep call me blessing with surprise you had doubts i always have doubts but i also have an excellent poker face amigo not a skill mind you more due to years rampant men's drinking ranch picked up titus's default door code 4545 thanks everything is in order [Music] greetings fellow security personnel all right i'm on my way to the server room you should be able to walk right up to the database server now well except for all the alarms lasers and guys with guns oh that easy huh thanks everything is in order [Applause] all right ray send it something your way oh yeah that's definitely something yeah this is going to take some time to parse you should be close to a private lift in the ceo's office my blueprint doesn't show where it goes which means it's exactly what we're looking for damn will you look at this place she even got her own private elevator going down [Music] marcus first impressions on the data you sent me looks like titus has the 10-year plan brewing in some kind of prototype lab all right let's see what they're keeping in sub level six and smash the [ __ ] out of it what wrench means is find and record evidence that titus is up to something naughty well if you want to get technical sure all right i'm in the nuclear bunker slash parking garage you got anything else on the prototype labs only that there's one thick ass iron door in your way no idea what's behind it if you get through when i get through within the next two years titus will begin field testing assault and defense capabilities of our robots for use in both domestic and military situations featuring reliable accuracy and superior reflexes our robots will provide safer alternatives to soldiers or security personnel one of our long-term goals for titus robots is to construct armor capable of withstanding the strongest ballistic attacks in a combat sorority in domestic security situations these new models will easily be able to withstand small projectile attacks molotov cocktails and other improvised riot weaponry [Music] while the current titus watcher robots have limited offensive capability we plan to fit them for a much more active role in conflict zones over the next several years we're currently testing damage resistance within urban suppression contexts we are also in negotiations with galilee to build walkers for their space program people i've recorded all kinds of ridiculous robotic [ __ ] down here here you're not gonna believe it anything usable for the video titus and bloom plan to put ctos functionality into armed robots and use them against civilians how does that sound yeah all too familiar what does that mean feeding big data through war machines was a wet dream of some of the blue concept grunts when we first were designed on the ctos i made sure it got the veto back then that's why you've been so involved with this one yeah yeah i had my suspicions and now we've got the proof to burn them head on out not done here yet more to see i'll be in touch guys guys i can't even where'd you find it oh i can't even oh man why does he get to play with all the toys system online all right i think i got this beast all figured out just got to get it through these security

there now violating the public trust manipulating the stock markets the lies the fraud [ __ ] bellwether all of it you're bluffing what happens if you actually answer it this time maybe it's bloom sending you to face the firing squad alone or maybe it's your lawyer telling you there's no place to run maybe it's just a telemarketer you really should answer it this time whoever it is you're done [ __ ] people over [Music] ah you have the right to remain silent san francisco hacktivist cell deadsec has allegedly revealed what might be the biggest scandal in silicon valley yet the hackers exposed evidence that bloom's chief technology officer duchenne nemec was abusing his access to ctos data for his own financial and political gain nemic was taken into custody and is facing numerous counts of fraud while authorities have begun seizing his accounts bloom's pr representative charlotte gardner said they are as shocked as anyone and are looking into the matter while cooperating with authorities evidence highlighted by deadset could put nemic in jail for a very long time uh you should probably listen to this we stood together middle fingers a silicon valley attacked on price demanded our complacency and violated our freedoms we caught bloom making backroom deals with each of the biggest tech giants companies already specialized to track and manipulate every aspect of our lives luna thought they'd use us as a boogeyman to drive these companies to their ctos all that data was to be protected and controlled by one master program but we didn't play fair we shut down their ctos for days we exposed them one at a time strictly credibility and prevented an unprecedented state of public control together the dead set gave the untouchable big brother its first blackout bloom's man behind the megaphone who shawn nimik will spend the rest of his days in prison thanks to our efforts he was an opportunity using his connections to exploit bloom's systems they will scapegoat him paint him as a rogue element claim it was a singular random incident but we won't let him off the hook so easily we have demonstrated their weaknesses both human and technologically with great power comes great vulnerability bloom and their fans now face an onslaught of legal action and government investigation faith in the ctos is at an all-time low we did this we know the greed engine will never rest and to that we promise neither will dead set we outnumber them with every indiscretion every scandal in every scam they add to our numbers and we will be watching dedsec has given our warning how much of this is hyperbole has it really gone global there are new dead sex cells popping up everywhere the middle east south america europe and not just them we can't even keep up with all the new hacktivist groups all right make the call you sure do it [Music] you
