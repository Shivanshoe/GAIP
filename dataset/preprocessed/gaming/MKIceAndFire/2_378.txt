looks like the samurai wants a word with us you both look well feeling better with the eagle gone nice work by the way same to you the eagle tribe will lose their foothold here if we keep fighting yeah that's funny he said we find me later sakai i could use the help of a samurai who knows how to keep a secret looks like you're healing up it only hurts when i laugh so i should be fine around you you only laugh at your own jokes anyway but i'll never swing up late like i used to no more robbing innocent merchants on the high seas how will you make yourself useful too many people here still suffer from the eagle's poison there's no cure but i can ease their pain maybe even help some recover like you the eagle's medicine forced me to live my father's death gave me another chance to avenge him what did you do i realized i didn't need revenge i've spent my life running from a dead man trying to live up to him blaming myself for his death hating myself for choosing to live so i turned my back on the past and put my guilt behind me and that cured you the darkness never leaves completely but it recedes maybe that's how to heal the others guide them through the memories help them face their fears i hope you're right years ago i could never have imagined saying this but i'm glad we met tensor never thought i'd do this either but thank you samurai bowing to a radar now i've seen everything [Music] you
