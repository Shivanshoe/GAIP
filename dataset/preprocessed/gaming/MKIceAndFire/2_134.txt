nurses doctors are the real heroes they always were even before the 2020 pandemic broke out hey you want to be sent back to the outlands keep that biomarker in plain view [Music] don't just matt told me to see you yes he wanted me to give you this a little reward for helping us peacekeepers a uv flashlight could come in handy thanks we said something about a plan the vnc tower now that the lights are on we can use the tv antenna to broadcast our call for mobilization but first we need to get to the top and that's a long road what do you want to know tell me more about this radio station on the tower it's the tallest building in vilador it was once a symbol of the city's greatness now a symbol of its fall how do you say that that antenna could bring the city together once more but anyone who goes up there trying to fire it up guess what happens nothing good i bet damn right the city's potential shining beacon is a death trap we're hoping it'll be different this time we're gonna light it up with uv lamps [Music] what makes it so dangerous a volatile nest inside so we think it's the biggest dark zone around once night runners tried to take it over they wanted to use the antenna to connect all the separate groups of survivors give the people some hope but they never even got close to the antenna and in the end the night runners were wiped out [Music] wiped out you mean every last night runner that's the problem frank had it all carefully planned but for his plan to have worked he'd need everyone all hands on deck and that didn't happen not everyone believed in the plan so there was a rift frank thought they'd come around in time but not everyone came around after all the plan went to [ __ ] it was horrifying those who heard the night runners screams on the radio that night still have nightmares about it what happened to the group that refused to join the mission split up drifted apart whoever led the descent was branded a traitor and the night runners faded into a shameful memory after that we shouldn't waste time on the past we need our heads in the game here and now [Music] okay let's get going are the lights in place they would be if juan from supplies would just do his job for once i take it that he didn't he's been playing hide-and-seek the last few days and he's late getting on my nerves so look in on juan first see what his deal is and when you do find him kick him in the ass tell him it's from me hope that flashlight serves you well [Music] you instead yesterday my youngest said when i grow up i want to fit the winner gates too not work on the boat like you and daddy that's dispatcher sent me to check on the status of an order yeah yeah [ __ ] pks think we can just make the stuff appear magically just point me to your commander and i'll get out of your hair juan's pretty busy right now he doesn't have time for you we'll tell him to find the time jack matt sent me no one supervises juan buddy juan is just juan get with the program besides he ain't here you want to find him ask his assistant where he is just remember you're on supplier turf now mind your manners traps [Music] looking for juan rainer you don't appear to be on a schedule it's urgent the commander sent me so much sends you jacques jacques messierena is not here i can't take a message no i need to talk to him in person where is he unfortunately i can't help me reina's whereabouts are no one's business what if he must anything else oh wait but you're no fun what about your boss what's he do for fun mr reiner is well known as a connoisseur of the finest things in life food drink and pretty much anything that walks on two legs is he near any of these so-called finer things right now maybe i can drop in on him there nice try but no i won't say matt's not going to be happy ron is not particularly concerned with the little mages feelings do come again in the one hayden getting settled in the city working on it meyer and jack sent me to supply interesting bunch not like any of the other pks i've met that might be because they're not bks eagle eye business is their true faith i see anyway i can't track down their boss juan he likes to make himself scarce probably lurking around the fisheye the canteen the slick bastards even got his own table there bribes the cook to bring him off menu goods he lives like the fall never took place look for him there good luck finding him and good luck if you do find him excuse me yes what are you reading cannival of the sad into um afraid not people trying to tie me down bad memories no no of course you're not but don't worry maybe you'll grow into it one day why don't juan and jack matt uh like each other because jack matt wants everyone to be like jack matt and i for example want everyone to be who they want to be maybe that's why juan and i get along so well after all the world has ended yes the rules have changed so i do what i want and don't ask anyone for permission anymore gotta go now audra [Music] [Music] up with [ __ ] now [Music] what's the matter i'm hugh and you're the pilgrim who turned on the electricity right word travels fast and word is you you help people sometimes is that why you called me i i need help my kid went off the water tower earlier and hasn't come back i'm worried how long has he been gone about six hours now that's a long time wouldn't normally worry oh he's such a strong kid built like an ox but it's been such a long time hmm how old's your son does it matter i just want my kid back i would take care of it myself but but there are three young children waiting for me at home i can't leave them unattended okay i'll take a look for you it's not safe here let's meet in my place after you found him it's down on lower damn promenade [Music]

my name's i know who you are aidan after that bang-up with the renegades half the canteen wants to name their most precious offspring after you including vinnie here but you interrupted our meal state your purpose in one sentence then please make yourself scarce oh you know perfectly well why i'm here the uv lamps meyer says you owe the peacekeepers at delivery and you think your barking will make an impression on me the lummoxin chief jack thinks he can send his terrier and everyone will wet themselves in terror but what can i expect he can't tell the difference between champagne and a crystal chalice or water from a dog's bowl he has an ounce of refinement isn't that right vinny i don't know don't be afraid it's not like jack is gonna march in and have you hanged at least not now ah vinny when will you grow a spine you want my attention aiden show me you deserve it what can you offer me look i could help you out as easily as i'm trying to help matt i don't doubt that i've heard you were a pilgrim but you're new here smashing the skulls of a few peasants doesn't mean everyone wants to lift you up on their backs you have to be more subtle with people everyone has their own desire their their own price your pitch just isn't working for me quite yet try again how about a court martial matt can do that right a court martial you have no idea who you're talking to do you who would hash out the contracts with the suppliers who would feed the army provide it with weapons and clothing a week without me and the peacekeepers will be left with nothing supply is everything try again man and don't improv this time i'm you've used up all your time didn't pique my interest what is it you want juan like they used to say if you gotta ask the price you can't afford it we're turning to more pressing matters and what should we try did you make headway with the papa's ass never met a guy quite like him before i told you you don't have a gun come see me back at my place [Music] let me guess he scarfed down five horses and had a hot young woman at his side a young man but the rest is accurate he's a piece of work all right well i need him to get back to work jack needs uv lamps and juan's dragging his feet hmm that'll be tough juan barely listens to jack so he'll be an even tougher audience for you he has his own men and power base and he loves rubbing jack's nose in that and what can i do about that same as everyone else bribe him he likes fine art antiques expensive [ __ ] from before the fall when he sees something that used to be valuable he can't stop himself zero self-control hmm all right where can i find something like that i heard of an old polish guy who lived in a penthouse by liberation passage they say he was an art collector you can try his place you can only get there via power glider that's why there's a chance something is left i'll be on the radio and guide you to him what about you huh going on a hunt no a party it's daniel's birthday but you never know when a guest list will overlap with a hit list why don't you come and have a drink with us when you're done with one i don't think daniel likes me he doesn't like anybody we'll be in touch detected hmm [Music] uh [Music] ugh [Music] the one there's nothing left in here daniel said it's a virgin spot keep looking he took his paintings but no room for jessica one romantic son of a [ __ ]

still in the canteen i saw him leaving seemed to be heading back to the ship probably to his quarters okay i'll go there and listen that vodka daniel is a big fan if you're planning to drop by which

get to pick the dare you wish we decide whether it's a truth or dare if you don't do as you're told you drink so have you slept with anyone in villadore [Music] no are you for real oh maybe the guy

wonder who were you before all this good call we really didn't want to hear him sing believe me who was roe before he became a tough-as-nails peacekeeper a father and a husband you were a father i lost my kids at the beginning of all this i uh i tried to save him i almost did but at the end i was the only one who survived now i'm alive with regrets how how did they infected worse people a group of raiders typical bandits at a time tried to take our food i wasn't gonna stand idle and give up everything we had i had to defend my family i was proud stupid outnumbered i didn't for the follow-up [Music] okay enough of this anything you want to ask the master assassin here i always wondered about that hit list shut up bro it's not your turn oh yeah the hit list how did it start with a bastard who had to pay for what he did it started with one then there was another one and then a whole bunch of them but who was the first one that's another question drink no he's just making you answer the first one who cares what he asked it started way before that when i escaped from waltz frank helped me he showed me that there's something else i can do with all my anger back then i thought i'd join them be a night runner someday who was i kidding they were wiped out at the vnc tower frank lost almost everyone the night runners fell frank started to drink gave up on life on himself so i'm not a night runner but at least i have my list good night did i ask the wrong question that's the beauty of this game pilgrim sooner or later you get to the wrong question i'll see you soon i guess [Music] here you are thank you thank you for the vodka thank you let's drink for me and another year in this [ __ ] you're not the worst you know why are you finally warming up to me nah it just means there are worse [ __ ] and that i'm drunk where's levan i saw her with you now we played the game and i asked the wrong question how the hit list started ah god y'all gotcha you got her thinking about the past listen and i'm not telling you this because i like you i don't even [ __ ] know why i am telling you this but never never ask lavan about her past you get it good now get lost it's my birthday [Music] hmm hmm he is a snack isn't he dear care to join more the merrier no thank you oh if i embarrassed you i'm sorry i do have that effect on people i'll wait for you but make it quick i must admit i admire your persistence almost curious what you do after i send you packing yet again you'll regret it year old highland single malt bottled a year before the pandemic broke out [Music] i've read that one barrel of this stuff sold at auction for over half a million dollars what a sublime present [Music] to your health handsome what can i say you broke down my defenses so you're still after those lamps did matt tell you why he wanted them and why he really wanted them yeah to take control of the tv tower wait he's serious is he crazy nobody tried that for over a decade so i guess it's dangerous that's what the lamps are for but lamps need electricity to run the last i heard the juice ain't flowing there people have tried to take it without power heroes and fools alike all ended up as volatile snacks that's matt's problem what do you care i care because something's not right can't you sense that as well aidan matt wants to prepare to defend the city from the butcher's coming attack so we should start building him a monument right only problem the butcher isn't planning any attack how do you know i have my spies among the renegades as well since the end of the war we have occupied the city center while the colonel squats in the dam one push of a lever and half the city will find itself under toxic water the kernel is not stupid he knows war would be the end of everything so why did the butcher attack the canteen that's in the city center good question maybe it wasn't the colonel who gave the order something more is going on is something we don't yet understand what about the uv lamps why does he want them then jack is hiding something for a while now he's been ordering way more lamps than he could possibly need and then some of those lamps always disappear no accounting for them once we deliver why would jack skim uv lamps and here friend the mystery takes flight jack never got over the fact that he didn't defeat the butcher back when he had the chance years ago he knew that if he attacked the dam the colonel would close the floodgates and the rising water levels would push the chemicals up out of the ground burning through everything that lives in the city has been a stalemate for over 10 years each waiting for the other to make a move but then someone turned the power on and something changed and the renegades attacked the canteen i'm not here for my health juan i need the lamps to find out what happened to your sister right aidan i told you i got my spies might be able to find something out about waltz and your sister specifically about the gre scientist you and matt are trying to contact i'd even say with my resources i can find this person faster than matt i actually doubt he's able to find them at all let's help each other smart man aiden barely in town a minute and you picked the right side already i'll give you the lamps that'll keep matt from getting suspicious but then go to the cathedral there's a guy hiding out there total nut job but a tech savant get him to fix this old piece of spy tech if we get it working we can bug the transmitter jack once the place is on top of the vnc spire have him do his thing by tapping matt's comms we'll find out what he's doing with the extra lamps and knowing's half the battle kiddo [Music] wanna talk more about whiskey [Music] [Music] [Music] ugh foreign [Music] uh two [Music] hey i'm aiden what's your name [Music] match i was asked to bring you home what about the infected up there there aren't any it's safe then uh i'll just hang here tell hugh i'll

real story never mind i don't want to get other boys into trouble no it's okay you can tell me stay out of it okay it's none of your business fine i'll talk to him myself you really want to stay here

people say it's haunted haunted by what a ghost yeah right anyway the cathedral's been locked up for years but there's scaffolding around it you can probably use that to climb to a window and get inside still sure you want to run errands for juan might as well suit yourself big boy elmo what happened where's match he says he's not coming back it doesn't want to work for you anymore what's he mean hugh none of your business you made it my business when you sent me after match got me there so what exactly are you doing with these kids hugh mats seemed desperate not to come back fine i'll tell you i'm training them to survive come again i taught him to steal that spy for you or anyone who pays are you crazy hugh if the peacekeepers catch them they'll have no mercy that's the first thing i teach them how not to get caught it's a [ __ ] up world pilgrim no one's gonna go easy on these orphans i'm living proof of that i teach them how to survive isn't that what fathers do for their children match doesn't understand that not now he's at that rebellious age when he makes it in the city he'll realize it's because i prepared him you're not gonna go after him not holding anyone

would be easier to deceive me rob me my first reflexes and sharp dagger taught them otherwise how'd you end up in villadore i got this goddamn job a guy wanted me to deliver a package to velador to some woman who was well known before the outbreak apparently she played video games professionally weird job eh anyway the guy paid me a lot but on one condition i couldn't know what was in the package and that was my big mistake i carried this damn thing for 50 kilometers and with each step it got heavier i sneaked into villadore found this woman and delivered the package she opened it in front of me found out it was a jar with a human head inside whose head i don't really know i got the [ __ ] out of there right quick is that why you quit the life well i felt that actually that i was constantly running away from something maybe from myself this is a big city even a pilgrim can belong here nobody judges you for what you were before like they do in the smaller towns who you used to be beyond the walls what you once did they kept you on the move you can disappear in the city that's how i found my place and what about you aiden don't you want to stop running uh maybe someday but first i have to finish what i started here i understand just remember this you can't run away from yourself good luck pilgrim [Music] welcome stranger what is this place i concoct and sell everything

elixirs by the looks of what's in these jars someone's been scavenging graveyards they are talking about my ingredients both rare and potent i combine them to create one dose some emit ascent that can cause an infected to come running no matter what lies in its path others pheromones that can cause most infected to flee and still all those grand fists are fire that will burn an opponent with each blow theatrics aside i'm intrigued tell me about your healing elixirs i sell anything from cells for the gravest wounds to potions that cure illness and disease a young man like you might wish to try my virility boosting a pass i have my doubts but i'm willing to try some of these items i'm sure you'll be delighted my elixirs are worth every kind and they're derived from monsters in part yes some unusual mutations in rare creatures produce hormones with special properties when i combine them with the red herbs and other compounds i can create both powerful weapons and healing items as it happens i am running out of some key ingredients and could use some help if you're willing to do some hunting for me why don't you send this guy i am nowhere in boy josh carvas this is why we're running low on ingredients and customers you keep scaring people away i'm not scared of monsters or your boy here it's settled then if you can't hunt i'll buy what you bring me you stand to profit

stevens thank you for your support as i take over the role of chief physician of the gre while i understand the higher-ups need a scapegoat for the virus leak your expulsion seems counterproductive all the more reason to thank you for agreeing to review my reports before i send them to the gre board october 20th 2021 a gre report on the state of the epidemic with the first cases in zurich and paris the plague spread like wildfire or dealing with a variant of the 2014 stream we call it tachytransmissive heron virus or thv it's deadly and highly transmissible we recommend immediate action all european borders must be closed immediately all civilian air and rail services suspended national governments must introduce civil procedures as follows isolate individuals thought to be infected quarantine anyone who's been in close contact with them issue shelter at home orders immediately as for the dead bodies should be incinerated implementing restrictions now will slow the spread of the virus we need time to create a vaccine and have begun working with private sector companies our diligence in the coming weeks will decide on our fate i'm recording this for posterity so they can learn from my mistakes to warn all who follow about the worst of plagues and i am not referring to the virus i was born into a very religious family my earliest childhood memories prayer every morning and every evening knees scraped from constant contact with oak floorboards when i grew up i had a very hard time i was lonely i suffered despite my upbringing i turned to religion for solace it gave me the answers i sought that i came to realize my father had tried to give me to endure bullying is to earn heavenly rewards god was my best friend my only friend i talked to him every day and i believed that he listened to me and answered and loved me too i felt like i owed him a debt that's why i enrolled in seminary i think i became a fanatic in a way the urge to spread his teachings convert others it was not about god it was about my own shortcomings it was about me there was something unhealthy about it and dangerous at the age of 23 i became a priest still just a snot-nosed kid and i was supposed to be a shepherd of souls i felt i was meant for this i had answered the call if god was with me then who could be against me i was full of conviction faith that i could make the world a better place but the world had other plans many times i performed someone's last rites i held their hands as they died and in that last moment in the millisecond before their last breath i saw in them relief not because they were moving on to some kind of better world to heaven but because it was the end of something painful they could finally bow out of the futile and exhausting dance of life their chore of living would be over their suffering would end it was something completely incomprehensible to me how can a person reject the gift of life to accept death joyfully for a person as strong as me this was something very disturbing or maybe they knew about something that i had not seen did they see it in their last moment this was the first crack in the edifice of my faith and then the epidemic started there's a term for what came next a crisis of faith and with me it started long before the epidemic but when people started to turn into monsters when city after city was eaten by darkness and poison i started to wonder where is god is he putting us through a trial or has he abandoned us when black monday came i no longer had any doubts there is no god there never was because of the thv genmon bombings two million people lost their lives the streets carpeted with human corpses what god would allow that he would have to be infinitely cruel of course other so-called men of the cloth offered nonsensical observations that this was the will of god punishment for our wickedness that colonel williams himself served as the hand of god but that didn't matter anymore the curtain had been torn off people lost their faith because what were they supposed to believe in no one wanted a god like that and in that moment to my own surprise i felt free as if i were a puppet who finally cut the strings that controlled him since birth free at last my name is anton novak and i'll be a [ __ ] legend sorry i couldn't help myself i'm recording this for you pops you want to hear a secret you know when you do i bet you'll be ashamed of yourself all my life you told me i wouldn't amount to anything then i became a pk what'd you do called me a traitor and dad's playing that the pk don't give a [ __ ] about us the people of the bazaar thanks for the vote of confidence pops there ain't no one i don't give a rat's ass about pops i'll show you what i'm made of today some guy i didn't recognize approach me said if i was looking to be a hero i was looking in the wrong place and that i have potential i never heard that from you said to meet him on the roof of the old textile factory at midnight and here i am like an idiot what am i doing here maybe i wanted to show you i i wanted you to see oh [ __ ] dude jumping between buildings like [ __ ] panther [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] i can't let them find me come on out kid i know you're here i'm killing him tell me pilgrim do these ancient walls not whisper their sacred history into your very ears saint paul's cathedral is along with orla castle the oldest building in the city it originated in 1010 as a christian church that was built on the site of a former pagan temple subsequent work continued to expand the church which became a cathedral in 1207 its catacombs host many holy relics including a toe from the left foot of saint paul this made the cathedral a popular christian pilgrimage destination in 1444 another relic a finger from the apostle to the gentiles was stolen eventually the cathedral's popularity began to wane until it acquired a molar of saint paul's the cathedral briefly regained its status only to see its pilgrimages declined steadily once more finally after a hundred year period the finger of saint paul was recovered and the cathedral was again able to attract thousands of faithful dear listeners you may find this strange but to me this is something very important my daughter renata is getting married in a week she was supposed to get married over a year ago she had invited over 200 guests she was so happy but then you know php happened we had to cancel everything we were hoping that the gre would get the situation under control that the restrictions would be loosened over time but as you can see it's only gotten worse some of the overseas guests we invited well they're gone in the end we decided to hold the wedding with only those closest to us in attendance it is very important to renata and waldex that this happens and for me it's important to bake a cake for them it has been a tradition in my family for generations the mother bakes a wedding cake for her daughter unfortunately a week ago someone stole my hands i realized that now most food down to each small egg is worth its weight in goal but if some kind soul were to share some eggs with us i would be eternally grateful stay healthy daria hello my dears i hope you are holding on in these difficult times you're healthy and safe i trust i am life over the past 77 years has tried to kill me time and again i guess i'm immortal i live alone in a large heart my beloved wife valerie passed away in 2018 actually i'm glad she died then so that she didn't have to watch the planet go to hell i have a son daniel who lives with his wife and my three granddaughters in berlin but i haven't been able to contact them for months i'm afraid that that they have turned so perhaps they have gone somewhere and
