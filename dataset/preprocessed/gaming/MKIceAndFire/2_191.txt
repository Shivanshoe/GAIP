hey there true believers watch as once again frightening forces are at work in our world ready to wreak havoc with our very existence who or what prowls the halls of empire state university after dark none other than the master of illusion himself the menacing mysterio ah the tablet of order and you chaos the black market is gonna make me a min good you can use a mint i can smell your breath from here spiderman wait how would you eat a mint through that fishbowl [Music] nice don't get me wrong your illusions are nifty but if you ask me they could use a little more souvenirs are available in the gift shop stop it cease your incessant practice but incessant is the best kind of practice what watch this hey bubble head think fast okay can somebody tell me what's going on here spiderman you are needed madame webb as if this night wasn't strange enough already the tablet of order and chaos is the most powerful of all the mystic artifacts in the world and you shattered it yeah sorry about that yes they don't make tablets like they used to huh the pieces are now fragmented across other dimensions dimensions that are strange reflections of our own are past unlike ours a present day out of sync and a distant future which may or may not come to pass is that a cartoon pig focus i require your help yours and the help of these three other spider-men the heroes into whose realities the tablet fragments fell oh slow down other realities other me's yes i have explained our dire situation to them they will be your allies in this quest but i'm the most charming right you must gather all the pieces of the tablet before they fall into the wrong hands or our reality as well as theirs will be utterly destroyed yeah right no pressure let's get started these neighborhoods aren't gonna friendly themselves if you follow my instructions i will assist you in finding a fragment now who am i to refuse a lovely lady lead on mw all right you will need to reach that ledge to begin your quest wait this quest involves jumping and now scale the wall with your unique adhesive abilities uh i believe the technical term is stickum powers i'm crawling up a wall i am augmenting your spider sense now instead of just detecting danger you have the added abilities of seeing through objects locating enemies and discerning structural weaknesses in your environment cool i will bestow it upon the other spiderman as well don't let weak structures or other obstacles block your path use your webbing to pull that wall down and that's called breaking and entering hey look what i found excellent work a job well begun is half done now to another spider-man and to bestow a different gift upon him the black suit what am i doing in the black suit i hate this thing stay calm young peter this suit has extra abilities you will need in your quest like what trying to take over my body i said stay calm my psychic powers will keep it from overwhelming you yeah well i hope you get the result now let's retrieve the next fragment split spot did you just say split spot first with your ability to web zip you can travel quickly from purge point to purge point try it now occasionally in order to reach distant approach points you will have to jump towards them and web zip in mid-air talk about a leap of faith and you can run across narrow walkways such as this one without fear of falling due to your natural agility and powers repetition they're called stickum powers did one of the other me's make that joke already yes and it was no funnier then the fragment is at the end of the corridor can you swing across to it can i lady it's my trademark i gotta admit this suit does feel fairly under control and i feel stronger faster this will work out after all fingers crossed they're all going to be this easy to find right no but now i must turn my consciousness to the future and to miguel o'hara spiderman of the year 2099. that's me ready to save the universe and looking good while doing it the next fragment is close just ahead in fact i'm on it gotta watch out though this area is property of the alchemics corporation and that means the public eye will be everywhere and what pray tell is a public eye not a what a who a police force owned by alcamax and i'm not sure which is more corrupt speaker the devil here comes the public eye now many enemies will try to stop you from collecting fragments you must defeat them in combat tell me about it i tried to defeat him in cards once didn't go so good this one looks easy try a light attack you're not getting away here comes another perhaps something stronger keep the battle tips coming lady it's like evan sun tzu is a life coach hold the dog with your incredible strength you can probably even knock enemies into the air sure can you want to see it we must never miss an opportunity to subdue an enemy even in the air try to hit him while he's airborne perform a combo now this is just overkill and yet now try to grab your enemy stop spider-man come here oh no i didn't mean to make him disappear you didn't i have saved him from peril and transported him to safety thanks to a dimensional rift caused by the tablet but please try not to be so cavalier next time good to know you got my back guess i'll just worry about my friend beware spiderman like it ah that was a good warm-up so when do i get a real challenge i fear it will be sooner than you think and finally i turn my attention from the future to a world set in the past say your prayers punks here comes the spider-man what do we got here looks like criminal forces in this world have already found one of the fragments they've taken over the station and this used to be such a nice place use the shadows to your advantage see if you can subdue these opponents silently with stealth attacks you read my mind sister yes that's what i do those typewriters are slinging to no joke that won't last long if they open up on me agreed if an enemy spots you it is imperative to defeat him quickly or retreat either into the shadows or high above i have gifted you with new web swinging powers they will be useful in this respect oh i like this thanks for the enhanced powers lady the webs normally just kind of splatter everywhere use your spider sense to locate the fragment there through that gate [Music] another opportunity [Music] ugh [Music] the fragment is close i feel its presence [Music] time to grab a flop big guy and that's the end of that no spidey it's just the beginning across many dimensions these four fearless spider-men in all their various incarnations must fight to reassemble the tablet of order and chaos not just for the sake of their own worlds but for the fate of every world in every dimension webslingers we're all counting on you you've recovered the first quarter of the tablet excellent i've always been good at scavenger hunts like moths to a flame those with evil hearts will be drawn to the unleashed power of the tablet gaining new and frightening powers so far you have been fortunate that none of them have fallen into enemy hands why'd you have to go and say that man what a jinx ah useless hunk of nothing wait what's this ah yes power this is what real power feels like no more parlor tricks and sleight of hand mysterio is now the master of real magic and this is just the beginning what do you know i swing around long enough and my new upgraded spider sense points me towards a fragment definitely sensing something from inside the uh jungle room hey look at that if it isn't mr tablet fragment right

is up to third followed by soggy corpse and four but on the outside moving past his tidal wave tidal wave making his move as they come down the stretch for that eighth of a mile and swing and spider
