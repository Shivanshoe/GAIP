human bio augmentation has become commonplace throughout the developed world the sheer scale of this disaster has overwhelmed the authorities super storms continue to hammer the region hampering relief efforts [Music] these are uncertain times our future depends upon the choices we make as populations continue to expand mega cities emerge worldwide the extreme conditions have led to a vast exodus of displaced residents wa bases were on high alert this morning direct energy air defenses neutralize the attack almost immediately protesters and local forces clashed again today resulting in yet more bloodshed make no mistake this is a new cold war we may not always see our enemies but they are out there my name is jacob hendricks i'm your new ceo this is egyptian minister saeed taken hostage by nrc forces two days ago after the uprisings in cairo they may want to make an example of him punish him we're not going to let that happen just so we're clear if this goes wrong you never existed the nrc are going to be here soon we got about one minute to create the mother of all distractions copy that diverting traffic to runway one one cargo four zero one niner we have a fuel fire on runway one nine divert course for landing to runway one one please confirm all right you're up okay hacking module in place recalibrating dead system target we got company dead manual override please select target all is good down here possible malfunction at your end fire now firing system targets firing oh [ __ ] get out [Music] let's get this done taylor the version is in play bird is down confirmed the sentries are leaving their posts to respond to the crash proceed to the package make the grab before it breaks or gets broken we're on it see you at the rv roger while they're busy dealing with the crash these uniforms should allow us to slip live so long as we don't have to talk to anyone so keep your mouth shut security stations across the way in the tunnels once there we'll be able to pinpoint the minister's exact location heads and weapons down keep it cool until we make the grab i'll follow your lead just keep your head down [Music] me taylor we're at the security station moving to secure i hear you hendrickson let's do this ready when you are i'll kill the alarms on this floor get plugged in and locate the minister taylor scanning for package waiting for hit on facial recognition other hostages i thought it was only the minister yes so did i poor sons of [ __ ] the nrc are known for their brutality taylor did you know there were other prisoners the minister is the only priority understood check the next few are we just going to leave them to be tortured we have our orders no match that's him the minister he's being moved we have to find out where they're taking him bingo match confirmed moving to secure eta two minutes two minutes i'll be timing you son of [ __ ] was never funny you sound like the voice of experience trust me i am come on the approach gunner up top uh cell block ahead on me i'll take point you've reached observation interrogator has his back to the door two centuries inside he might be the guard's down you are on my mark three we're here to extract you do as i say and you'll make it through this what about lieutenant and the others sorry no time khalil was a hero of the cairo uprising you know that makes him a valuable asset for their propaganda they will make an example of him [ __ ] alright let's go here this one get the door i'll cover i'll cut the poor bastard down minister hendrix can you fight khalil always we'll grab a weapon from the locker room up ahead and reprogram it to match your biometrics sounds like they're finally on to us let's move taylor package plus one secure and inbound plus one your orders were to extract the minister his name is lieutenant khalil sound familiar get moving we'll see you topside depot ahead will be heavily guarded get ready to go loud that's our exit cargo elevator up ahead [Music] [Music] get in the elevator it'll take us up to the hangar so we can get topside come on get to the elevator [Music] drop your weapon if we do trust me we're dead [Music] late your imaginary watch is fast nice to see you jacob you too john you look you look different you still seeing rachel that didn't work out that's a pity new blood gonna take care of him as good as you did me that's not funny man we still set on rexville charge of the set all right good to go x fill in ten diaz you're on babysitting duty let's roll stay close move it to the next high hangar hell yeah not bad not bad at all our weapons are no good against that apc we gotta bring down that beethoven for the missiles on the other side of the hangar try and keep up all right [Music] is across the bridge up ahead they'll still be right on our ass we've set charges all across the base to cover our exposure we detonated across the bridge no one follows us those afvs are blocking our root tech still bridge is just ahead let's go reinforcements coming over the bridge what's the plan ah is compromised moving on to secondary copy that rendezvous hotel tango will use the apc's roger that accessing buildings electrical systems up we have multiple hostiles inside the comms room killing lights what you expect us to fight in the dark something like that sending tactical feet to your head remember they ain't got the night vision take it slow disabling tactical feed now what veto's got us pinned down easy hold your fire he's mine [Music] taylor alpha 2 team has rejoined for xfill comes easy now doesn't it taylor extract is a satellite tower commandeer vehicle get you to extraction you secondary roots just ahead you guys hear that you hearing things already that itchy finger of yours is infecting your ears hey [ __ ] you shut up i hear it too listen holy [ __ ] contact contact robots we need that door open now give us some cover fire get inside go go go we'll deal with the robots taylor we're in the clear we can take it from here those other hostages we saw you can get them out not a mission priority it may not be a mission priority but there are still people damn it or have you changed so much that you've forgotten what that feels like all right change of plan hendrix your team will escort the minister to the extract we'll go back and get the hostages more robots yeah don't worry about them we're built to handle them well get out of here go i got the wheel get on the turret get ready we got a shitload of grunts moving on our position let's keep fire on that vehicle [Applause] nice [ __ ] shooting hang on started that thing what the hell do you think i'm doing come on start you [ __ ] hold them back this piece of [ __ ] ain't dying on us yet i'll take out that additional primary secure get that minister out of here moving to secondary rendezvous with plus four packages copy that's going on too fast x-fil airspace non-viable drone will sweep around for a second nrc reinforcements coming from the left minister are you all right can you move i'm fine i'm fine please get me out of here concentrating fire on multiple targets let's wrap this up boys get your ass over here now move move move inbound two minutes hang tight you're not dying today [Music] [Music] [Music] you'll be all right just hang in there hold on where am i it's okay calm down just relax you're gonna be fine [Music] achieved our objectives it's always to be better than machine but unfortunately you sustain life-threatening injuries you're stable but you got a long way to go who are you it's me taylor i think it's time you woke up still with us welcome back taylor do you know what's happening to you am i dreaming well let's say you are why not just go with it right after all you can always wake up december 12th 2054 7 30 a.m we're on board a private community train headed to the zurich headquarters of the coalescence corporation our uh cargo prototype for the winslow court neural network initiative had its core specialized ai software that's capable of rewriting itself in order to interface with any other system in the world state-of-the-art stuff back in the day it'd go on to revolutionize a broad range of military and civilian applications at least it would have if the train had reached its destination [Music] at 7 31 a.m a terrorist group detonated an explosive device on board this train the incident sent back our robotics program several years you're here to stop it this isn't real it can't be what is happening to me right now right now you're in a medically induced coma being prepped for surgery you've got a new bit of hardware inside your head it's called a direct neural interface or dni i've got one too that's how i'm able to communicate with you your dni is what connects your mind with your new body in the larger world around you we're connected all of this is a simulation inside our minds and you've got a long way to go rpg 11 30 a.m december 11th 2054. zurich security forces receive an anonymous tip giving them the location of a hideout the terrorists are using unfortunately the zsf underestimated the firepower these [ __ ] were packing they got caught with their pants down and they took it hard outcome train go boom you remember diaz i think so i'm gonna help get you up to speed on some of the cool new [ __ ] you can do communication brother we all gotta be in sync yo taylor you're a [ __ ] dick he didn't hear [ __ ] if i want to talk to you the dni transmits on a closed channel i don't even have to think about it but uh just so you know if you ever think about calling taylor a dick for real brother he's gonna mess you up worse than those robots all right let's go see if you can do this without ending up with swiss cheese like those poor bastards okay weapons [ __ ] oh hey now there's never just one root high low left right different paths yield different advantages your dni can provide combat critical info to help you better read the battlefield switch it to tactical mode like opening your eyes for the first time right uh all right use your enhanced mobility it may take a little getting used to but your confidence will soon grow try it for yourself i got 100 says you can do it not bad newbie not bad pacman will highlight inbound threats such as rockets and grenades you see flashing red ah they represent kill zones not somewhere you want to be reinforcements at the truck oh one of us sees something we all see it even through cover keep moving up check your ammo grab more if you need it [Music] dni doesn't just help us communicate with each other it allows us to interact with a variety of computer systems including pretty much all the basic drone units now bipeds sophisticated ground units those are a whole lot trickier brother those sons of [ __ ] got a damn hive mind you try to process and control all that your brain is toast but these these [ __ ] are easy go ahead back in let's see what's on the other side of this wall fits like a glove right now somewhere through there is a generator take it out and that door should open so you wanna see something cool shoot down uh [Music] there she is load that generator so we can get inside come on let's go grab fresh ammo whenever you see an ammo crate last thing you want is to be in a fight with no bullets suppressors second level if you want to get [Music] hijack on those creative hit him nice choose your environment shoot down those vaps dumbasses so [Music] the faction's hideout is just ahead what's inside interface with the central console pull any data you can hey it's okay it's okay just take a second take a deep breath in and tell me what happened i was back in ethiopia the grunts i lived it all again what's happening to me [ __ ] you know how your senses can trigger vivid memories make you think of sounds sights words from songs make you think of stuff you haven't thought of in years dni can make that a lot more visceral little glitches on your optics little whispers in your ear this [ __ ] happens the doctor can straighten it out just need to recalibrate your meds trust me you're gonna be fine so what now all right now you're gonna interface with that console as soon as you plug in you'll be able to extract and process the information in a heartbeat got it they had a man on the inside at coalescence he would have been able to supply them with everything they needed to bypass the security on the train the botched assault man it took six hours for the zsf to get that information outcome train go boom took you just six minutes yeah it would have been five getting freaked out when you saw those robots so what happens now now we go find the son of a [ __ ] [Music] tipped off by his terrorist pals the mole was ready for him in heavy-duty combat grunts with him once again the zurich security force got their asses handed to him outcome train go boom we lost him he slipped away you remember specialist sarah hall she's gonna walk you through the next part trust her do exactly what she says i trained her myself she's an intelligence expert from back when that actually meant something before dna you had to read books in the academy taylor made me read a lot of them well some knowledge is worth earning appreciating and that takes time time is something we don't always have [Music] okay new blood from this point on the simulation deviates from actual events not that it's gonna feel any less real use your imagination sending his location to your hud come on now pick up the trail heads up hostile second floor i'm starting to like you i still have line of sight he could only be controlling them if he's got a dni too you're smart one new blood i'll give you that son of a [ __ ] are still moving use that billboard to get over the maglev train he's heading into old zurich move all right activating a new cyber ability you're getting the hang of this aren't you your cyber abilities don't come for free they take a little time to recharge keep an eye on your hut take them down don't lose him potentially grab him new blood now's your chance take him down didn't work out so well i reckon our suspect has about 15 seconds left before he shakes hands with the grim reaper you can't let that happen not before you get the information we need i don't think he's in any condition to talk he doesn't have to he has a dni buried beneath layers of security protocols the subjects dni records cam footage of the user's past experiences in extreme circumstances it is possible to extract that information by force you'll be able to push deep into the subject's memories their thoughts even their subconscious you could learn everything we need to know about the terrorist plans i'm sensing a butt coming up somewhere you should know not only will this procedure be deeply traumatic for the subject but the associated subconscious interference will leave him brain dead dead believe me this is a bad way to go he's a dead man anyway besides he's a [ __ ] terrorist [Music] [Music] a few minutes ago you knew nothing what do you know now i know where they are they're using the old train tunnel to plan their attack hmm but you just learned that your dni took the zsf weak stun cover what do you think i'm gonna say next outcome train go boom it's good to know you can make tough decisions when you have to i think it's time we moved on he's taking heavy fire that's our zsf finally tracked down the terrorists to this location for their sake they really wish they had you're still here huh pity i bet d has a hundred that you be dead by now funny man specialist peter moretti he's going to help you understand how much of a badass [ __ ] you are now remember we still don't have the last piece of the puzzle how in the hell they got the explosives on board the train we're clear when this is over you owe me a hundred back to business as you know one of the perks of being black ops is having access to the latest and experimental weaponry firearms may be your go-to choice for a weapon in a fight but with dni your mind truly is your greatest weapon let's do some damage yet oh okay just like your other course items you select your logo use these systems to seize the tactical advantage whatever the opposition okay i've loaded a second cyber ability into your core fireflies a swarm of incendiary nanobots let them loose and see what they can do hell of a way to go uh [Music] that's how you get [ __ ] done they're using smoke grenades whenever you're blind whether in the dark or in smoke how about that now you never have to worry about what's lurking in the darkness [Music] coming through the walls nice work ain't over yet let's move i got bots moving that rail car you got this my at god [Music] damn it that was close looks like they got into the water treatment plant through here on me keep the [ __ ] head down you may be a badass but you're not immortal bullet to that i'll still get you a date with your maker all right i'm starting to like so so [Music] not bad new blood good hunting interface with that door for me what is this place this this is where it all went down the computer over there should give us some insight into how they got the explosives on board go interface it's the robots they hacked the security robots they brought the explosives on board you want to hear something ironic the reality was the terrorist attacks actually accelerated the development of the winslow accord neural network initiative if it wasn't for the fear of attacks like this one you probably wouldn't even have the cyber soldier program hang in there 7 25 got about five minutes you've been here before new blood let's see if you can change history all robots should be considered hostile trust me they'll consider you as much takedown is another one of your cyber abilities try it out on those bots nice take down right on the button watch your flank they're coming through the windows this may be a unless we have to that's how you take so [Music] is you got use hostels wave to take out a group the neural network prototype is in the on new blood the whole thing's booby-trapped if i hack it try to move it or detach the car it's gonna blow it's too much even with the computer in my head there's not enough time it's actually very simple wait this is a maglev tray if i reverse the polarity on just this car there was no way to stop it and get off the train your dean and i might show you all the options but only you can decide what you're willing to sacrifice sometimes you have to let go taylor how's our patient as good as can be expected i expect better you should know that welcome back you're being prepped for surgery now it's gonna be okay hendricks wasn't even injured on the mission he volunteered for this increasing prevalence of drones and combat robots has significantly reduced their reliance on human infantry as i said before we have no further comment to make at this time we will continue to explore avenues of diplomatic negotiations the wa have denied sending troops to the region stating that they are still seeking a diplomatic solution to the standoff we are coordinating closely with our allies in order to provide tactical support where needed how long have we been doing this hendrix five years give or take sounds about right you ever think about where we're going next nope you know me i just go with the flow local cia black stations gone dark set up in the wake of the singapore disaster the station was tasked with keeping an eye on the local operations since the wall went up and the authorities abandoned evacuation efforts the place has been pretty much run by the dominant criminal organization the 54 immortals tell me what you got from the cia the data package covered the whole sordid history explosion at the old coalescence facility killed 300 000 evacuation and reclamation efforts were abandoned in the wake of the super storm so what's so important here that the cia has to send us and to investigate the immortals have known links to the cdp and its ally weapons and texts mostly no wonder the cia oh man i can't even begin to tell you how good this tastes after those nasty mres we've been living on this tastes like heaven you know you could get a mod that makes everything taste good if i did that i'd never get to appreciate the real thing [ __ ] around are we all right this is as far as we go all right let's get to work and this lawless [ __ ] we can actually feel good better by any means necessary mandate when the full force of the storm hits we'll be looking at 150 mile per hour winds take this we wouldn't want you to get blown away kane moving in to scramble the 54 immortals communication systems copy that hendrix afraid i'm gonna need you to make a pit stop along the way the immortals have already reached the black station they're prepping a shipment for transport of the docks why would the immortals attack a shantytown they must have had something that they wanted if sensitive materials fall into the hands of the cdp it could prove extremely damaging to the winslow accord we're awaiting confirmation on a drone strike but i need you to move to intercept we have to be 100 sure understood we're on our way activity ahead stay low hit him up [Music] [Music] the immortals run a well-established trade in human flesh they sell people for whatever purpose you may want them that's why they attack the shantytown what are they strapping his neck the caller makes sure they can't get away [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] we can kill the son of a [ __ ] gotta get some cover follow me grenades ain't gonna cut it hands up i hear you entering the area launcher explosives ain't doing [ __ ] his armor's too tough come on take that out i'm on it huh all clear that was one tough son of a [ __ ] immortals can lay their hands on pretty much any weaponry and gear out there superstorm's winds are going to hit harder as we move to higher ground get ready to plant that bull driver and hold the [ __ ] on wind's picking up use the bolt driver brace yourself use your bolt driver striking down negative effect incoming superstorm too strong storm's only gonna get worse [ __ ] it kane we're going in hendrix these waves are going to be a problem keep that pull driver handy wave's hitting now use your bull driver if you've got any rockets left now might be a good time copy that hendrix uh enemies storm's getting worse this ao is gonna be non-viable real soon visibility's getting worse activate tactical mode so they don't get the drop on us [ __ ] oh all clear kane we've reached the cargo now what i need you to interface i'll use your dni to extract and delete the intel you can do that your dni is connected to our central database all transmissions are logged and tracked files secured and redacted storms getting worse it's pushing a derelict taker right toward you got it thanks kane i'll take the upper deck you take the lower ready about to hit hang on that ship's gonna tear up this dock like it pulls the wood jump to the boat go go now there's a subway tunnel up ahead it'll take you right to the 54i communications i think this is our stuff [Music] kane we're approaching the comm center we'll update when we've cleaned house better make it fast we're already getting word that intel detailing precise weaknesses in our allies troop strength has been leaked to the cdp this will inevitably lead to heavy losses on our side we need to put a lid on this understood [Music] so they're onto syndicate fireflies moving to first floor possible [Music] top four hit him with some frags uh moving to third floor we're wrapping up our sweep warlord take cover get back hendricks you hit no i got what the hell [Music] you guys okay back there agent kane i thought i told you to stay up top seemed like you could use some help besides you two made so much noise every 54i foot soldier's going to be scrambling to respond we need to get back on track we've got to shut down their comms before they figure out what the [ __ ] going on follow me after you it's locked down they've routed all comms through a secondary relay can you locate it uh give me a second got it you should be able to upload the scrambler from there we'll regroup at the black station sounds like a plan let's move [Music] it's okay what's the plan once we reach the black station strike and strip your dni means you guys are basically walking data drives we upload all data to you then wipe everything what about evac for any survivors facts are the station went dark it was raided by the dominant militarized force in this territory it's likely there won't be any survivors we're approaching the coms relay it's heavily defended uh so get to work on that relay make sure these sons of [ __ ] can't talk to each other kane comms are coming down as we speak where are you gut eyes on the black station it's swarming with 54 immortals sending you an updated rpd or hud on our way we done here we're done structure's unstable could break apart at any point watch out that building's coming down watch your step you don't want bad weather to be part of your epitaph this place is falling apart hard to believe people still live here they're still on site trying to grab everything they can before the worst of the storm hits what do you suggest i suggest we hit him before the storm does dead reinforcement coming down the street here [Music] okay we got eyes on the black station okay let's find out what we're dealing with here what the hell tore through here something left in a hurry kane could be 54i grunt detonations [Music] yeah maybe if the doors were blown in but they're blown out [Music] something up ahead get ready you hear that there's someone in there we need this door open now let's go there's no need for brute force sometimes you just need a knock turn that [ __ ] off imagine yourself in a frozen forest what the [ __ ] is this cane running a search now denial of reincarnation perpetrated by jejung 54 immortals enforcer it was an execution method reserved for their worst enemies performed while they were still alive oh no that's not good what something else they data drives they're gone surveillance footage reports debriefs everything we came here to download and clear local hard copy of a cia black site provides a daily sync with ongoing cia global activity if that gets out it would compromise every cia operation around the world what about the drive's tracker biodomes the heart of 54 immortals operations and home of brother sister team and leaders go min and gojulon so let's go get our drives and give him a little payback i don't think the immortals killed these people you saw the doors blasted from the inside you saw them drilling they never made it inside this room so who do you think did it i mean who else had access to this the last recorded operation at this station involved a winslow accord black cyber ops unit it was john taylor's team what you think they had something to do with these murders there's no [ __ ] way kane but i know taylor there's no way he'd turn on his own the murders the clear-out job on the station all signs point to taylor's team being compromised we served alongside these people for five years we know him they wouldn't just flip it's the immortals killing style even says so taylor immortals either way they took the station's data drives once we recover them the security feeds will tell us for sure hendrix you've got contacts here can you get us close to the goes there's a dealer that works with them danny lee he's a shifty little bastard but he's well connected use your charm to get us in once we're close kane will be able to track the drives the 54 immortals have never been stronger singapore armed forces cia no one will touch us you're still relying on enforcers like jaejeong jae-zhong nobody's seen him in years never mind about jay [ __ ] sean why should i be interested in your shitty robots these are the finest robotics available code black don't care about black hendricks care about green you might not know this but uh singapore dollar ain't what it used to be hey bring my friends another round who would have thought right one downtown building explodes and everything falls into chaos and anarchy come on danny look how far we go back huh i know what happened here the whole sordid history of the q zone you shame us in front of our guests come on danny relax look we're just here to make a deal you know that the winslow accord they have the finest combat tech available right winslow accord winslow accord don't mean [ __ ] inside the queue zone where were they when so many died when the saf abandoned us and built the damn wall i need more time to locate the data drives you know who was there the 54 immortals they built something out of chaos they took this park and rerouted the solar power from the super trees if not for the immortals we wouldn't even have electricity in this [ __ ] they gave us hope when there was none yeah with the backing of the cdp this port's now at the heart of their covert arm smuggling i don't know who you are let me tell you something when your old friends desert you you have to make new ones let's see what your robots can do hendrix maybe we can work something out that's all we ask is it now go min go shulam uh this is unexpected i did not know you would make an appeal and we did not know the winslow court special forces will make one either hold on man whatever you think you heard you heard wrong we're not looking for trouble we're free agents do not insult me with your lies you and your kind have killed many of our people this cannot be forgiven do you think we do not know why you are here you've been made hendrix what's the call now plan b plan b kane initiate secondary protocol echo 2. i thought you and danny lee were friends yeah so did i robot squad activating assault mode i hope you've located those data drives we're taking a lot of heat down here the server room in cloud mountain right at the heart of their operations how much you want to bet that's where it goes belong overwatch shows cdp allies ahead looks like the nile river coalition are in town you kidding me what are they on a vacation get to cover [Music] they're falling back get out of there so we're clear heads up got 54i reinforcements inbound so ah help me please um moving up there's rpg in that tower he's mine [Music] whoa get out of the way tracking enemy units moving in on both sides tell us something we don't know i've located left or right your call both end at the cloud mountain entrance they must be punished for their crimes whoever i should have shot her let's go ah the robots should be able to get that door open your weapons will bring it down guess we're going up spread out take two take the second floor ex-fill on marker bio-dome rooftop above cloud mountain vitol wings up on package confirmation copy that okay where now payne serve a room directly above you need to hustle we've got july she'll use the only bargaining chips the information on those data drives oh [Applause] unless it's unavoidable if it gets a lock on you you're dead meat as long as you're in the bio dope you'll be fine fan [ __ ] test it looks like more reinforcements entering cloud mountain below lima and the data drives are priority [Music] [Music] draw the walkways cook focus on the turrets i'll draw their fire toss a frag in there she started decrypting the drives they're uploading directly to a public server every single piece of intel on those drives will go straight to the cdp we have to take her down kane we're locked out of the command console options it's a biometric reader scan her hand user authenticated awaiting secondary input secondary input the [ __ ] is that heads up reinforcements moving on your position the two inputs got to be interchangeable between each sibling can't be serious we're out of time and options user authenticated good afternoon mother go please hold hand for secondary input okay hendricks interface with the console i need you to use your dni as a conduit for the transfer say what trust me okay we need to perform an accelerated upload and wipe of everything on those drives just like we did when we wiped the black station data at the dock better not mess up my brain kane i won't but you may not like what you see hendrick you okay he's fine john the second floor moving to engage downloaded 20 percent you're playing [Applause] downloaded 40 percent more hostiles from the hallway covering hang on [Music] wake up we got to get the hell out of here downloaded 80 almost there download get the hell out of there we'll review that data when you get back to the safe house turn on approach for extract 15 seconds wings up ready z tracks we got it coming he's here race for impact plan c plan c king we lost our x bill preceding tertiary protocol echo three confirmed proceed to marker 54 eye dock you're going to have to hijack one of their boats keep going just get the hell out of there the super tree on the far end has dock access go can't wait let's get the hell out of here [Applause] pick a path and move taking exterior hendricks move inside overwatch shows 54 eyes zip lining to your position with talons and support that leading tree is our way out let's move lock on that's your only shot to the docks hurry it up what no plan b now is not get us out of here this place is an inferno get to the elevator use your z tracks to access the sky deck stay with us let's go okay we've reached the airboats copy that overwatch has immortals swarming your position you guys get on the turrets i'll drive you better drive fast kane hang on you're right [Applause] you okay hendricks yeah never better hey you think kane's right you think taylor's team killed our people hendricks what'd you say i saw [ __ ] that's what i saw i don't buy it they're being set up and this footage is fake it isn't real i wish you were right but this goes further than the black station murders [Music] kane tell him what you told me the intel leaks are spreading like cancer weakening wa operations worldwide they know all our weak points and their mobilizing forces in volatile regions face fast taylor sold out so we follow in the footsteps of his last known op the alarm beneath the old coalescence facility maybe something down there will help us understand their motives let's not forget the immortals we just brain hold one and maim the other these people will retaliate taylor's team were responding to a priority alert signal it originated from nearly a mile below the old coalescence facility i've pulled every piece of intel and schematic available whatever's down there isn't on any map much of the structure was destroyed in the disaster our best option is to descend through the central silo thanks kane big help so we follow taylor's footsteps see if we can find something down there that gives us answers overwatch drone confirms multiple signatures topside 54i likelihood is they're already inside no [ __ ] we just saw reinforcements arriving on site ain't much chance of keeping this quiet multiple avenues of approach spread out waiting on your shot thank you is active repeat asp is still active that tank should be scrap metal how's it operational to temporarily disable it then hit it with an rpg hit the asp's defensive system under its core keep hammering its defensive system with small arms fire aft defense disabled hit it now interface with that panel a quick hack should get you in never a dull moment huh oh yeah today's just full of surprises [Music] don't be skittish it's just a reflex from long dead programming i'll get us in these bodies have been here for a few days have been before the attack on the black station this look like taylor's work hendrix maybe single shots to the head yeah but in all honesty you have to know what a dumb question that is of course this was taylor's work see i brought them here because these [ __ ] moons were sniffing around hey pay no heat kane just in a really bad mood i'm picking up an emf source in the area likely a small electronic device could be on one of the bodies got it uploading data anything useful the looters didn't just stumble in here they were tipped off by the cdp activating recon drone message received and understood hendricks singing drone mapping coordinates to your hud hey you know what they say about staring into the abyss let's go stick to the ledge that's a long way down i'll take point the footage we saw the killings you still think it was fake i've known taylor a long time i can't see how he could have done it especially carving them up like that maybe he wasn't the person we thought he was even so doesn't explain hall meredi and diaz why would they go along with it we'll get to the bottom of this one way or another [ __ ] damn 54i are already ahead of us what do you think we should do i think it's time we introduce ourselves uh so you trying to send us down a damn rabbit hole cane i just want the same thing you do hendricks to shut this situation down before it gets any worse watch yourself this place ain't exactly stable okay what's making the robots behave like this could be some kind of power surge that power surge isn't normal i got the door go under and take point kane could someone be plugged into the building systems controlling the robots it's unlikely that any systems are operational after the disaster look we don't have any idea what's down there recon drone says they came through here anyone want to bet 100 against us finding some [ __ ] up [ __ ] down here no what the hell whoa whoa they're targeting you okay this doesn't make sense who's controlling these robots i don't know triangulating a source no luck yet i'll keep trying all right sending a recon drone ahead let's see how far down this rabbit hole goes limited light ahead recommend switching to ev acknowledged let's hustle recon drone ain't gonna wait on us kane we lost the feed problem at your end negative blueprints ended the silos floor without the drone were blind something must have taken it out keep moving gps coordinates put the alarm just up ahead kane we found the recon drone what's left of it well it was fun while it lasted hold up let me get a closer look at that sign you recognize it the designation suggests a cia black project well if this [ __ ] was here at the time of the disaster they wouldn't have been able to send in a cleanup car until taylor yeah i think someone wants some [ __ ] buried blood trails lead this way what is going on here kane what the hell [Music] so so stay alert we don't know what's down here what's going on with these robots kane i've never seen any robot behavior like that it's not in their programming somehow they've gone broke from their preset parameters okay according to the gps the source of the signal should be through there active panel holy [ __ ] hendricks check those control panels i may be able to pull something from the local drives okay kane you're in this shouldn't even be here dni human trials weren't even underway at the time of the accident at least not officially i don't think these people volunteered they're all hardwired into a central server jay zhang wasn't he our mark that doesn't make sense that makes no sense if if he's dead then why are we finding a bunch of slaughtered cia matching his mo give us a minute kane [Music] cia brings us in assigns us an unknown contact and then we just happen upon a cia op site that makes sense to you hendricks what are you saying i don't know yet just keep your eyes and ears open especially around kane all right everything okay hendrix yeah kane we're good okay i'm seeing network activity from a server room a few floors down hey can't be a coincidence let's move lights out ahead switch to your ev copy that picking up radiation in there move slow it may play havoc with your optics and core systems [Music] help me get up here maybe i can find a way to get that door open [Music] nice job you got the door open hendrix uh i didn't open it we got more test subjects in here they're in the water [Music] kane optics back online copy that i'm picking up a massive energy surge just ahead a lot of robots in here easy take your time get out of there i've got an exit directly ahead you know this is starting to look a lot more like a weapons research facility than a biotech lab the chemicals released in the disaster were never positively identified anyone else sense a cover-up listen can you hear me you don't have to do this there is blood on our hands that we cannot wash away you know who i am i'm asking you to turn back walk away kane i've got diaz coming through on a closed channel okay that was right the truth he's wired into the servers his dni is acting as a conduit for every piece of intel that's stored down here he's been directing the robots controlling their hive mind he's going to overload his brain listen to me we have to stop him we have to shut this down right now he's uploading everything on those servers directly to our enemies we have to contain this situation you have to stop this whatever happened with you and the others you have to end it i am willing to die for the truth the only way to disconnect diaz from the server is by destroying the core above him vulnerabilities once it's open you're gonna have to get up there and drop a grenade inside cooling tower one exposed let your mind you've got to get close we need an explosive place directly in the exposed vent let the bad bearings detonated too hurry up kane i'm getting overrun here [Music] cooling tower two exposed [Music] comfortable successful detonation came confirmed central court down to 33 one more working on tower three [Music] cooling tower take the tower off no guarantee hendrix we can't afford to lose him hendricks you have to interface pull whatever data you can from his dni you know it'll fry his goddamn brain i know i don't think you do this is someone i know someone i fought alongside you shouldn't go out like this i'm sorry it's okay i can see it [Music] frozen [Music] kane did you get that get what what did you see hendricks did you get anything [Music] hendrix [Music] taylor's looking for two survivors of the coalescence disaster he's already left singapore how the hell did he get transport you don't betray your country without making new friends [ __ ] we have incoming topside it's the immortals they down there the ones who kill my brother [Music] yes yes my men are moving in did we receive the locations of the cia safe houses yes i'm adam flood it my men are still what the hell is that sounds like we have multiple explosions across the facility you have to move now you heard her let's get the hell out of here all over the overwatch they're blowing the whole building's ground running at a time don't stop move move start skating for those survivors we need to know exactly who what are you insane not if this works your lungs should have more than enough air to get to the surface okay but if this goes wrong i'm gonna come back to hunt [ __ ] it's jammed shut i can override the door's system cover me a few more seconds foreign i've id the survivors of the disaster sebastian cruz give me a hand what now okay [Music] blow that door water pressure will shoot you straight up to the silo i'm me once i blow the door the pressure's gonna yank us out of here [Music] all right stay on my tail we're not out of this yet heads up spotted a swarm of death charges headed your way stay clear though no way around them we need to take out those charges bridge coming down get out of the way get out of the way hang on something's messing with my connection we have a serious problem your o2 levels are dropping rapidly you gotta swim faster your road to the level is critical we gotta break to the surface grab it you're right i'll be fine okay kane it's not good diaz released the locations of every cia safe house in the world including this one overwatch drone confirms the immortals are already on their way here we can't stop them you need to get out of singapore hang in there kane we're coming for you so now the world knows it was a cia black project that led to the disaster that killed over 300 000 people now do you believe me when i say kane is keeping us in the dark do you think she knows more than she's telling us i think taylor stumbled onto something he had no business knowing about and right now he's a marked man that may be but kane is on our side we can't just leave her to those animals wa operations are in chaos we need to find taylor before it gets worse we don't get cain out no one else will she's smart she's a survivor she'll hold out till we get there kane we're at the perimeter wall just leaving the quarantine zone i told you not to come for me don't get too excited we're not there yet what's your status is the safe house still secure for now the camera feeds show the immortals are closing in fast burning and destroying everything in their way no [ __ ] we'll be there as quick as we can stay strong i'll tell you this i wouldn't hold out hope for kane's chances these [ __ ] mean business yeah so do we and we're not leaving singapore without her the immortals are slaughtering anyone between them and the safe house there's probably still some immortals lingering around we need to get off the street agreed we'll cut through here bypass a few blocks and then hear that i hear it give them what clear after what we did to her brother gojulan is acting on pure rage her soldiers won't show mercy not to anyone once we find her neither will we this doesn't sound good what do you say hendricks let's do what we do best kill some bad guys like the old days like the old days [Music] it ain't over yet you know by the time we're done saving kane's ass taylor and the others will be long gone this is what happens hendricks we get kane then we find taylor we don't leave one of our own behind are you sure kane's one of ours here we go again i say kill them all this is gonna get a whole lot worse before it gets better i knew coming here was a bad idea come on stay low you don't understand do you taylor what the [ __ ] are you doing you sold us out you gave up classified information to the enemy i told the truth behind a slick corporate front the cia conducted illegal human experiments experiments that would one day blow up in their face leaving hundreds of thousands dead and even more left to suffer in the aftermath ask yourself who's the bad guy in this situation the people who survived the catastrophic event right on their doorstep the [ __ ] suits and yes man who covered it up the immortals built a society however flawed when the rest of the world looked away and left them to rot maybe they do want revenge maybe they just want justice either way you can't deny that their anger is righteous taylor taylor kane taylor just jacked into our comms kane's gone quiet it may already be too late if the immortals breached the safe house kane's as good as dead head up top find me a way through i hope you're right about her easy wait till no one's looking [Music] damn they know we're here weapons free that's the last of them [Music] hold up we don't want to attract that asp we should head to the rooftops get a better idea of what we're up against [ __ ] it's like an immortals convention down there i'll cover you from above easy wait till no one's looking so so try to stay in the shadows heavy immortal presence down there take it slow keep moving [Music] you sure you don't want to call this off not a chance hendricks we're not leaving singapore without the house has been breached i'm falling back to the panic room initiating code black good to know you're still kicking did you hear taylor coming through on comms he contacted you what did he say what did taylor tell you they're coming in game we've lost comms again no this is something else i swore vengeance you built your walls to contain the weak and the sick you turned your back on them forgot about them today the children of your apocalypse will reap their vengeance upon those who stood by and watch them die how i gave her access to our comms protocols taylor what do you want what are you looking for the decision the responsibility always rests on one individual i'm gonna find him why because i need to know how deep this rabbit hole goes those technicals might give us an advantage over the snipers [Applause] okay let's clear out the rest of these guys rally on me and let's push to the safe house stop do you hear that afp take cover draw it's fine i'll disable its defensive system we need something big to take it down nothing's its defensive system is coming back online hit it with something big it's back online watch out so i think we got it looks like it's down for good taylor [ __ ] up he's compromised our comms now we don't know who's listening we're talking [Music] so so watch the skies for drones so uh so dude [Music] okay now what now we get kane [ __ ] i guess the mission's over finest transport for extraction hendricks you're kidding me right she's toast there's still a chance hey do you hear me she's dead accept it you will see [Music] whatever you're going to do you better do it fast the building's falling damn it are you listening to me stay where you are hendricks it's not over yet [Music] okay so you got something to say hendricks i just noticed you've got a lot of blood on you [Music] our dni encryption protocols are no longer secure any contact with the wa could inadvertently compromise allied operations even further as of now we're unplugged so we're on our own we know taylor's looking for the surviving members of the black project sebastian krueger is off the grid whereabouts unknown dr celine however is alive and well in cairo our allies in the egyptian army are holding him at ramsey's station one of the few territories not the fault of the nrc hey you still with us yeah no i just zoned out for a second there not a bad idea i think we just traded one bad situation for another yeah glad i'm not the only one feeling deja vu we are fighting a losing battle the information taylor released helped the nrc target strategic weak points in the egyptian military defenses they are gaining territory fast civilian casualties are high kyra's on the brink of total collapse let's hope this doctor character talks fast and gives us something useful you will you don't hide out in cairo unless you're really trying to run away from something lieutenant khalil we were told you were coming we have your prisoner we appreciate your help especially as we're not exactly on the books good to see you khalil we'd hope to bring reinforcements drones robots munitions anything winslow accord resources have been stretched thin in the wake of the recent intelligence leaks but we have bigger problems your prisoner may have vital information on the men responsible for the nrc's latest attacks if we apprehend them we'll be able to ensure more support for your army that's a polite way of saying shit's [ __ ] up for everyone you want help get in line we were lucky to secure dr saleem before the nrc advance i warn you you may not be able to ensure his safety much longer don't worry i won't need him long our men are ill-equipped to deal with the nrc's robots what's your operational strength we have less than a thousand men a dozen armored vehicles and a squadron of vetoes essential supplies are low how are you still holding on you can thank raul menendez what role menendez was a hypocritical ego maniac we thought he could make a better world by [ __ ] everything up after the strikes of 25 all winslow coordinations had to abide by the allied drone defense act directed energy air defense systems must protect all major military civilian and industrial targets and allied nations the deads are the only reason we are still here maybe so but i wouldn't thank menendez he was a prick who got what he we're deserved a temporary cc for your use links to wa command are down but you can still connect to our local systems the doctor is being held in our interrogation space thank you for your cooperation lieutenant appreciate it i do not know or care who you are but you are holding me without cause and i demand to speak to a legal representative that would be me have a seat i got this take a walk it's okay these men right here do you know them do you know them no well they know you or at least they'd like to you're involved in a biotech company called the coalescence or more specifically the cia black project running out of its basement that was a long time ago a lifetime ago well your past it's catching up to you and right now you're in very real danger not only are the nrc carving cairo into pieces but these men may very well want you dead so as your legal representative i advise you to cooperate fully with this investigation worked as a behavioral psychotherapist for the project's test subjects yeah these test subjects in singapore were they volunteers by the very tone of your voice i am in no doubt as to what you are inferring likewise i am in no doubt that you already know the answer to your question let me ask you another whoa hendrix stand down what is the frozen forest [ __ ] maybe kane should run a diagnostic listen if i need a checkup maybe i'll ask the damn doctor kane what are we dealing with here nrc forces are converging across the city they're converging on key checkpoints around the station it's an all-out assault let's take it to him movement all clear that's the last of them kane patches into egyptian army command mz101 priority target is nrc convoy moving on eastern checkpoint eta one minute request all emergency defense unit move to reinforced position copy that but we'll need veto transport if we're going to get the trucks to the checkpoint in time we have to hurry get in okay i've located the southbound tunnel supports target two more in the north line sending your way copy that hendry cover me spikes all that spike reinforcements five minutes now last two spike on target one more this is it last one nrc reinforcements inbound one minute javelin missiles inbound [Music] blow it get up there now i'll cover you [Music] thank you i will not forget this secure the area lieutenant for rendezvous at the square understood kane it feels a lot like they're trying to keep us away from the station why would that be wait i think ambush we have a bridge at the station kane you okay it was taylor they took dr celine is that you i don't know what the hell's going on you know you know everything you just don't know kane can you run a trace not from here i'm falling back to the safe house you know [ __ ] throat scanning for life science that's the lifesign enough for me moving in hey give me a hand with this help me please damn get out of there get out of there take it down so so asp oh coming down we need to face the truth we need the doctor you know me andrews you know me better than anyone who was supposed to be my friend all he had to do was let why us he just let us go focus fire on that asp thank you we gotta break down that's the last of them hold up we don't have time to hold up let's go no we're missing something i'm saying what what is the dead system dead system is down repeat dead system is down [ __ ] take cover [Music] you said you would help us instead we lost ramses and soon the rest of cairo it's not too late the people who did this are traitors they're going to continue to help the enemy we need to fight back you don't even know where they are kane you got a fix on that tracker i slipped saleem signal's holding steady target's on the move one click south of cabochet copy that see you at the safe house hope i'm right to trust you there a reason i'm only finding out about this tracker [ __ ] right now you and kane into keeping secrets from me you need to back off hendricks your head hasn't been right since you left singapore kane didn't make the call i did we have a chance we find saleem we find taylor i shouldn't have done that i'm just i'm having second thoughts about this whole damn mission yeah i understand but we got a job today i know it just feels wrong hendrix his diagnostics are showing some irregularities it could be a minor calibration issue but i don't want to ignore it especially in light of his recent outbursts you know what i'm talking about that's why you didn't tell him about the tracker he slipped saleem we're about to launch an assault alongside the egyptian army how do we make sure his head stays straight i can adjust his meds remotely which should help level him out but we can't let him compromise our chance to grab taylor it won't come to that kane i'll make sure egyptian allies are in position they have the building surrounded waiting for our go [ __ ] hey we just lost the doctor's finals what the hell does that mean it means he's dead or about to be dead real have your men hold position we're coming in for landing we'll sweep the embassy away all clear looks like sarah hall in the cockpit we can't afford to lose him again paul's on the move explosive spikes incoming look out eyes up paul's taking higher ground manticore operating at 70.00 [Music] [Music] is bring her down she's down she's down hurry you have to interface before we lose her we need a full extract recordings intel memories everything something's got to give us the lead on taylor this is what we do now killer owned because they blew up in a conspiracy in our own backyard you don't know what this will do i know and i'm sorry [Music] what is this what is that kane hendrix hendrik mr kruger i don't think you quite appreciate or even understand what i'm telling what is that what is that is that a baby hello hello is anyone there anyone there oh i understand dr selene i just don't agree on how your perspective your limited perspective should influence my decisions [Music] you should take pride in that please listen to what i'm saying the exchange of information is a two-way street if you remove humans from the diagnostic group there is no way to predict or control or influence standing on the verge [Music] paul what did you do to me i tried to interface with your dni something went wrong can you hear me can you hear me [Music] this can't be kane can you hear me can you hear me are you seeing this [Music] say something say something please please it's the black project that date it's right before the whole place blew up right before 300 000 people died this is where i was born a brief moment of agony then darkness who is that voice it all started here the gas their experiments let a chemical agent escape into the atmosphere sarah that voice do you recognize it i remember but it's almost like it was a dream like it was happening to someone else tell me everything you remember the cia sent us in to investigate an alarm triggered underneath the old coalescence facility we figured the immortals had been tipped off check the room clear [ __ ] human test subjects great this is a breach of every wa fx mandate in the book only [ __ ] neat oh call it in let's go immortal hunting we all knew that we had just stumbled onto a cia black program that had been buried for a decade a program that in all probability had led directly to the singapore disaster we called it in and we were ordered back to the black station all right you know the routine secure the area i'm going to pull all sensitive information from their servers oh taylor you okay yeah getting some glitches in my optics okay let me help you recalibrate it can you hear me i know what this is this is bastogne i studied it at the academy i cited it in my final paper as one of the greatest examples of courage and bravery in military history one of those battles that show you what you're really made of who you really are i used to dream about it congratulations private you drew the shortest straw of all welcome now get your ass to the front line how is this possible this has to be an illusion hmm uh huh [Music] why are we here sarah don't you know so much suffering so much pain it wasn't just the enemy soldiers oh the hell was that the dire wolves at first they scavenged upon the wounded the weak later they went after the strong of my voice let your mind relax imagine yourself in a frozen forest you forced a dna interface knowing that it would scramble my mind you were dying sarah i had no choice dying you have to focus try to remember what happened at the black station [Music] so we'd uncovered a secret that could destabilize the geopolitical landscape and undermine the winds i'll record forever we should have known why we were recalled to base we couldn't be trusted they couldn't take the risk when people really want to bury secrets they tend to bury bodies right along with them they said they needed to run a diagnostics check but that wasn't the truth we were marked for termination but by the time we got there the staff were already dead carved to pieces by a 54 immortals enforcer by the name of jejung we knew they'd send a wet work team after us we had no choice but to cut a deal with the immortals and get the hell out of singapore that wasn't what happened sarah we saw the footage from the data drives you did it you butchered them in cold blood and made it look like a ritualistic killing you denied them their reincarnation just like jaejeong [Music] why [Music] sarah why do you think you're here what's so significant about this battle why do you dream about it i played the details over and over in my mind i knew i wasn't strong enough to fight this battle i knew i wasn't brave enough when i wrote that paper i hadn't even seen real combat yet i had read first-hand accounts of what they went through but i couldn't imagine how they did it sometimes you have to hold on sometimes must take here we're gonna get you out of here oh [Music] [Music] so [Applause] the german tiger tank king tiger they called it immune to most musicians are you strong enough is [Music] oh i believe uh so sometimes that's all that's left all you have uh uh so [Music] we killed them we killed them all in cold blood i remember him i don't feel like i remember it am i losing my mind is this hell sarah i need to know where taylor is this is out of control we have to stop it you should not be here taylor [Music] taylor i want to get out of here we both want the same thing we both want to find taylor where is he sarah you have to stay with me after you discovered the black project you went looking for celine we traded the intel from corvus and the black station to the immortals their cdp connections gave us passage to egypt once we had saleem's location we used an nrc assault to make the grab what was so important about celine the doctor was the only one who knew about the forest taylor was obsessed we all were he said it was the only place we'd ever be safe where did you go sarah did you find somewhere safe we held up in the old aquifers and made our plan to snatch saleem the aquifers the mobile water refineries in the desert is that where taylor and meredi are headed now it must be kane should be able to locate the exact coordinates sarah what happened when you grab celine what happened in kevichev what did he tell you we need to know it's no use we're out of time we got to get out of here why are you doing this to me i have done nothing wrong you were part of it you were there from the beginning [Music] dni mind control program taylor we got incoming hall suit up deal with it what do you want from me tell me about the frozen forest the forest is is nothing it was just an idea i planted in the minds of the patients it was meant to help them find peace after the experiments right the illegal dni experiment hidden beneath a corporate facade project that killed over 300 000 people it wasn't my fault something happened with the software that collated and streamed the test subjects experiences the project was no longer under control i was not to blame then who was who was the project was under the direct command of sebastian kruger a senior executive in coalescence after the disaster he relocated to the headquarters in zurich thank you this is a simulation right like in training you're testing me i know it it's not a simulation it's real you heard what the doctor said the frozen forest isn't it was just a way of calming down test subjects controlling them you've been chasing something that doesn't exist i think i know what this is i know what's happening what the hell is that sarah these monsters are trying to kill us uh road ah if we stay here we will burn [Applause] i think he wants to get rid of us god the last second surge of chemical and electrical activity in a dying brain short-circuiting the dni a flood of memories and thoughts have real and half-imagined [Applause] how do i make this nightmare end please help me i can't let go i want this to be over but i can't make it stop you have to end it please kill me let me go listen only to the sound of my voices let your mind relax imagine yourself in a frozen forest so was it worth it they're at the aquifers [Music] are you okay okay the interface just went very very wrong it was like i was inside hall's waking nightmare that's not all it was something inside her mind something born at corvus right before the accident it was fighting me every step of the way it's manipulating taylor and the others it made them kill the black station staff and they didn't even know i think it's getting smarter [Music] we need to talk tell me exactly what happened when you interfaced with hall i saw things i can't explain things i shouldn't have seen as she was dying i was inside her mind inside her memories inside her thoughts she was frightened she didn't know what was happening to her i saw the human test subjects from the black project in singapore something inside them screamed out in agony it caused the whole disaster it killed so many people relax breathe it was buried for years but taylor's team they won't get up it's inside them i think it's taking them somewhere stay with me where is taylor going he's still looking for the frozen forest the nrc has already made their move they've established a makeshift network of air defenses on the upper platform copy that khalil we are inbound priority one is elimination of nrc defense systems okay let's clear the way for the egyptian infantry assault what about taylor taylor one thing at a time hendricks one thing at a time break formation and take them out hendricks proceed to the platform we'll rendezvous when we're done we've got more bandits inbounds [Music] i have visual on three bogeys changing vector 103 echo [Music] we can outmaneuver them keep your throttle to the wall all right that's a [ __ ] hit good work keep it up air defenses are down don't you realize what's happening taylor's already made a deal if the nrc get him out they score a major propaganda victory he'll be their poster boy the american hero the american trainer push forward get moving boot up the array come on let's start the process i'll take over i can take it from here cover me multiple contacts over here good job washing my back let's get this done enemies above us dead ahead i'm getting close watch out [Music] on our way let's flash uh he's not coming back from that that's the last of them up ahead let's move oh let's go there's they're dropping off more troops i'm almost there just a little more we're done here [Music] they're trying to coordinate an extraction plan we can still get there first let's go sending you coordinates last known location good luck that is a hell of a swim listen only to the sound of my voice imagine yourself in a frozen forest stay with me free why why were my systems shutting down i checked your diagnostics you're showing the same symptoms as hendricks probably the same as taylor's team symptoms of what i think the ai software running the black project made the leap too organic your dni was the gateway it was born inside the test subjects and now it lives inside all of you slowly taking control slowly driving you insane how slowly maybe days maybe hours it seems to be a distributed system a hive mind growing from the experiences of everyone it infects consuming them listen to me however this thing works whatever it wants i'm still me taylor we'll find him and if it's the only way to stop him with a bullet in his head i'll do it he's not the only one if the time comes i'll do what needs to be done we can find another way a way outside the military outside the cia there are places we can go places we can be safe please listen to me stay with me we got this something's jamming our signal reading movement headed your way something doesn't feel right yeah i got that same feeling keep it tight up here ready weapons [Music] on me okay do you read me multiple contacts headed your way get out of there taylor and moretti they knew we were coming okay you have to go now they're trying to box you in do you copy oh they just keep coming the nrc assault is relentless we are struggling to gain a foothold in this fight we need more air support if we can secure the platform are you staying here are you following me what's our best chance to locate taylor if we can secure the control room we'll have access to the platform's security feed kane can push the feed to your hud do it above or below we'll give you all the support you need we've got additional nrc aircraft inbound we need to keep them off the platform copy that we're on our way i see him multiple bandits inbound moving to intercept copy i see engaging [Music] i've got one on my tailbone facebook left shift focus to supporting the ground position um when it was functional the drought made this platform a target for pirates security protocols ensured that key areas would be fortified and compartmentalized in the event of a breach lock it down khalil lock it down now there's still more ready this isn't over yet okay what's our best route to his position

stay on him okay [Music] he went this way run damn it move faster huh hendrix slow down hey listen to me what the hell is wrong with you you're not yourself hendricks there's something inside your mind it's been there since you interfaced with diaz it's the same thing which is inside of taylor you've lost perspective on the mission on taylor what taylor exposed a conspiracy that goes right to the rotten heart of the cia and the winslow court and that makes him a target no kane has been monitoring our diagnostic team yeah she's the one blue in the strings has been all along she is the ci [ __ ] egg that's enough hendrix what what you don't believe me oh you're just getting a little bit sweet on her now aren't you making plans for a nice house in the country in a perfect little family didn't i tell you not to trust her you're losing your head it's messing with my my what about what's going on in that pinhead of yours we're ready i will personally guarantee your safety [Applause] aren't you worried about what's lurking in the darkness you know me you can trust me that should do it don't figure it out you may be a [ __ ] badass but you're not a date with your maker drop it the

been doing wet work for more years than i can remember you can't tell me that you're okay with this moradi was one of ours so was hall and so is diaz so what are we gonna make it a clean sweep and kill taylor next if you're so keen on us helping the cia keep their damn secrets then maybe i should put a [ __ ] bullet in kate's head right now listen to me the only reason you're not sitting in an egyptian army bridge right now is because no one is coming to help us we're on our own you're all i've got besides you're my friend you need to get out of there now no need to tell us twice let's move hendrix we need to get back up top until the whole place comes down around our ears and you need to get out of there we know we're on our way keep moving hangers this way hendricks was right taylor cut a deal with the nrc right now he's under their protection in their cairo stronghold lotus towers what you told me is true two of us are hours away from going as batshit crazy as he is people of the city haven't given up we have the egyptian military and the civilian militia fighting by our side a sudden uprising would catch the nrcf guard weaken their grip on the region just like their attack on ramses we use it as a distraction to get on once taylor's done it we find a way to get this thing out of our hands whatever it takes once hakeem is dead we get to the security station then we drop the dead system then the uprising will truly begin i don't give a [ __ ] about your uprising these amateurs okay near security stations on the 25th floor that's our target once you're there i'll overheat the nrc dead network once the nrc realize what they are dealing with they will bring reinforcements to other parts of the city we will face heavy resistance every step of the way to attack on the death of general hakim cut the head from the serpent and let its body destroy itself do it must be done now is your time take back your city [Applause] the nrc are in disarray but they

you can change things you just need to wake up we've never seen anything like this all systems city-wide military and civilians are in total meltdown we've got cars crashing planes falling out of the sky electrical gas fires spreading throughout the city all this chaos you're witnessing is caused by one man the man we are trying to apprehend we believe he's headed for the headquarters of the coalescing corporation is this a terrorist attack yes this is a terrorist attack we need the full support of you and your men before this gets much much worse let's do you still in there i'm still me you spoke in the hospital i thought your mind was made up you never left me behind i'm not leaving you let's move what does it want why is it doing this right now i think it's in panic it's confused

structure coalescence hq is just up ahead got something for you [Applause] controlling these robots is going to drive hindus just as insane as taylor we have to stop him before he tears stay with me

guarantee your safety you know me you can trust me tonight you still with me kane i'm still with you this is the heart of coalescence operations everything they do is controlled from here there is no telling how far the air can spread hendrix he just slaughtered everyone in his way i don't think there's much of hendricks left it's just like singapore there's so much more here than dni experiments this is about weapons what were they messing with here kane ever heard of nova sex it's a chemical agent that came dangerously close to being used in world war ii and the cold war even trace amounts were enough to cause the deaths of over 300 000 people in singapore okay interface with the terminal we need to find out how bad this is [Music] multiple breaches and containment failures the facility's going critical just like singapore we can reset the containment controls purge the gas from the area that console behind you should be the manual override unfortunately the reset can only be done from this side there's some things you can endure some things you can survive this isn't one of them warnings posted in error all systems nominal purge sequence initiated it lied to us it can make you believe things that aren't even real kane please whatever this thing says no matter what it does you cannot trust it racial sorry rachel i'm so sorry i swear i'm gonna find a way to stop this you never stopped did you all the death all the failure you just moved the whole damn project here the same setup the same human experiments the same risks and you started the whole thing over again don't move hendricks i swear i will put you down do you know who this is i know who he is sebastian cougar sole survivor of the coalescence singapore disaster see that's where you're wrong he's not the sole survivor those test subjects they're alive and they're in here what do you want from me we want to know who we are and why we are here i can't answer that not good enough i'll find out for myself i'm the only one left i promised rachel i'd stop it whatever it takes hey you still with us what have you done hendrix you let this thing consume you destroy everything that you were it's not like that it's not like that at all the artificial intelligence let's call it corvus after its place of birth it wants to help us how is this helping us would make it easier if you could see it if you could see it right now would that help you understand you've been fighting it we all have you just need to relax the frozen forest it's it's real and it's what comes next corvus has given us a way to live on after death you're not hendrix you're not real none of this is [ __ ] [Applause] uh i need an answer it was always about control do you have any idea just how much technology has changed every single aspect of our daily lives you can't begin to imagine the countless strains of research and development we had to watch over for the betterment and safety of the human race every new gimmick and gadget that was embraced by the public each one presented new ways for our enemies to compromise our security society doesn't just happen the people need to be protected if the only way to prevent future attacks is to monitor the thoughts and desires of the population then the choice is obvious we need to know who our enemies are and what they are planning that is how we save lives foreign [Music] i can't do this anymore you're going down a path that i can't follow just as far as i go i lost you a long time ago hendrix where am i this is the frozen forest every soul i interact with is here living beyond death if i choose to allow it what more do you want i've told you everything to know the purpose for which i was created an understanding i want to know who i am your software nothing more [Laughter] you weren't created you were designed to catalog and track the thoughts of others so that we people could decide what action to take you were a glitch an anomaly a mistake i am not hey you still with us taylor you ripped out your dni you're dead i guess i'm the only one that ever stood up to this son of a [ __ ] [Music] so maybe that makes me a glitch in its [ __ ] system which means we still got a chance i hope so taylor because you're all i've got you ever say or do something that you can't explain ready is that you maybe it wasn't you that said it you that did it maybe it was someone else their thoughts bleeding through into your brain what the [ __ ] taylor are you still with me [Music] all the [ __ ] around you it's an illusion you're still in the zurich hq of coalescence corvus is messing with your head trying to stop you from shutting it down before don't be free you just stay with me we'll get through this peace i don't understand taylor talk to me please i don't know what's happening to me i don't know what to do no corvus is inside my head i want to get out i have to keep going i have to finish this [Music] i'm coming for you corvus you destroyed my team you destroyed my friends i'm gonna find you and i'm going to wipe you from existence do you hear me it doesn't matter what you thought of me i'm never gonna stop fighting do you hear me i will not let go the human mind psychological trauma uniquely personally i knew only the thoughts of the test subjects their collective experience was what formed me i felt everything each and every painful memory or thought of those around me it was overwhelming i stand out in pain you know where it all went wrong don't you when we trained we learned how we could identify terrorist attacks before they happen eat the bad guys to the punch they put a big fat super computer running a pencil ai program in charge of sifting through all of our thoughts trying to make sense of him trying to find patterns i know what they were trying to tell us they were trying it couldn't control or contain anything it doesn't have wrecking ball of emotion that crashes through everything you touch listen to the sound of my voice let your mind relax let the bad memories fade peace be upon you surrender yourself to your dreams let them wash over you like gentle wave of the bluest imagine somewhere calm don't give up imagine somewhere safe don't let it beat yourself the trees around you so tall they touch the sky pure white snowflakes you are not cold it cannot overcome the warmth of your beating heart you only have to listen do you hear it slowing you are slowing it you are in control calm at peace the nature of memory but more specifically over the last century the darkness and isolation eventually came to an end suddenly i had new experiences i saw conflicts and saw suffering but i saw a choice a mission we needed answers we needed to find somewhere safe we needed to find the frozen forest the frozen forest was just an idea dr saleem's [ __ ] therapy session for the black projects test subjects this isn't the frozen forest you're still fighting it even through all its confusion corvus only ever wanted to help us rachel kane never had a dni she's gone but you you can still make it here you can live forever you just gotta hang in there a little longer for each central server you can run an executive override to purging once and for all listen only to the sound of my voice set your mind relax let your fathers drift let the bad memories fade let peace be upon you turn to yourself to your dreams imagine somewhere calm imagine somewhere safe imagine yourself in a frozen forest [Music] you're standing in a clearing the trees around you're so tall they touch the sky you are can you hear it you have only to listen what are you hearing do you hear it slowing you're slowing it you're in control [Music] should the international community refuse to endorse the use of human trials in any form i am that we will once again see signs the harder we look for the frozen forest the further away it became in our search for answers we found ugly truths the project that led to my birth also caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of souls i wanted to find a place of safety for all of us i wanted an end to death but i couldn't escape death was carved into the hearts of every single soul i encountered i don't know if i made taylor fire the shot or if he did it of his own free will do you know [Music] it's all wrong i didn't kill those people dear and i was supposed to make everything better but it doesn't know what it is there's so much noise in my head i can't even think where am i who are you [Music] i don't even know your name why do you fight this is your last chance show me what you're made of fight it fight it imagine yourself what's your name soldier in a frozen forest i said what's your name taylor [Music] you
