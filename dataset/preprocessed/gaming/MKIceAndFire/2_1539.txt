[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Kaycee with the goddamn one I'm about to put my fist through his teeth we did what we had to do live with it and the story now the [ __ ] that beanpole made it through basic is beyond me soft as a melted [ __ ] marshmallow different story with Kenny I respect the guy but that doesn't mean he gets a pass the questioning has to stop we had to protect what was rightfully ours this bunker is our home the supplies are our lifeline if we did not defend it we'd have all been dead within two weeks now we can last months maybe longer we can survive this but we have to [ __ ] stand by a unified if Kenny and Casey don't fall in line soon I have no problem marching them out of the bunker door with a gun to the back of their heads wasn't about to let those bastards steal all our shields it's dog [ __ ] dog now and I'm the mom of pitbull Foster and Trent understand what's up when you go through something like that together something that ugly but necessary you develop a bond to the group no doubt the other two [ __ ] they don't get it Casey acting like he's innocent bunch of [ __ ] she knew that this moral high horse routine I'm not gonna put up with it much longer I'm watching there's so much just blow a [ __ ] faut in my direction I'll put their asses down zero hesitation only the rumors will survive this [ __ ] I'm a good person I know I am well I saved my cousin Billy that one time for blowing off his fingers all the other kids dared him to hold that m80 unlighted and I said no Billy even though I really wanted to see what would happen what happened says the right thing Foster says it too so that means we did the right thing do anything wrong us well then we chose us I'd do it again probably so that means it was right right when you couldn't look back on something and know that you would do it the same way all over again that's deja vu I think something happens and you say you know that's the way I do it a second time deja vu that's how I know I did the right thing you you there Casey I'm back hey tourist did you discover anything all your squadmates are dead Kenneth kill them how do you know I stumbled onto Kenneth he told me what he did and why he did it it's alive where is he could I talk to him no he's dead but he told me some interesting things before was over yeah rest in peace Kenny my friend why did he tell you he wanted me to tell you something you want to know what he said yes of course What did he say he said you a good guy not to feel guilt about what happened outside the bunker to let the massacre go he told me all about it from his perspective but I am curious about yours well if he told you what happened why do you need to hear it from me you know what you need to know right and you've told me my friend is dead so we can move on yeah I know it must be hard Casey to talk about it but it's okay tell me what happened now you're right tourist it's not easy to me there was a massacre three dozen people at least civilians right at the reserve entrance innocent people that we should have been protecting I should have done something to stop it but I didn't I stood there a coward and now I don't sleep I have a nervous twitch in my right hand that gets more pronounced every day and the guilt is like a ten-ton way crushing my chest there you satisfied now those are just facts Casey I already know the facts what I need to know is your perspective on the whole thing there's a reason why you can't sleep you're twitching like a junkie and your chest feels like it's caving in okay give me a second to gather my thoughts but wolfy escalated really fast the first bullet was Foster I wanted to scream no but it's like I just left my body everything after that moment it's like a nightmare Jess and Trent started firing Jess she was she was smiling Kenneth hesitated he looked right through me like he expected me to have his back I did nothing so he started firing after that all I've been able to retain her weird details Oh sounds a hat across sometimes when I'm here lying trying to sleep I can actually feel my finger shaking on the trigger of my rifle even though I haven't touched the thing since the day it happened the feel of the trigger did you pull it yeah I didn't want to but I did basic training kicked in follow orders no matter what good I don't know if I killed anyone I may have thing is all I'll never know maybe that's worse than actually knowing for certain that I did across like in the church I said all about yeah [ __ ] strange tourists I see it real close up everything around it is hazy bullets killing it up splintering the wood from my church back home the one my mom used to drag me to you know but that makes no sense it's just my mind [ __ ] with me guilt digging and deep I guess fearing judgment what are you here when the sounds come the sound of Tara please the gunfire my own shouts the thump is bodies hitting the floor this just cacophony will just swell up inside my head when I least expect it this chaos but I can still make out every single [ __ ] sound I just can't shake it you mentioned the head what head there was this old man shielding his wife he had on this bright blue fishing hat and I watched a flurry of bullets rip it right off in this spray of blood and gone and this [ __ ] hat I swear to God it's the exact same hat my uncle used to wear and the bullets drove it into the wall and and it they'd hung man for a second dripping then it's lopped down to the floor the image I just I can't get it out of my head I'm worried it'll be there forever and I keep thinking was it me did I shoot those bullets you never know for sure Casey that's exactly right tourists and I can't [ __ ] do you with that we've all piled up regrets impossible not to when the world is this [ __ ] up what sets the good man apart from the evil one is how you live beyond the regret do you make better decisions moving forward I have to I can't live with myself otherwise I have to be better then you will be simple as that if you say so look Taurus this little chat it's worn me the [ __ ] out then I've got rewiring to do to keep from getting electrocuted next time I use this radio not that it really [ __ ] matters doubtful I'm getting out of here alive without that key that has everyone riled up this is all a waste of time I'm gonna go I'll talk to you later I guess [Music] in the tower [Music] I don't even like the way you walk hey beat it ah ah [Music] all patrols return to the tower after 1830 stir through the narrow reserved assault prep begins 83 to 10 days hope for 10 we need [ __ ] time reserve stripe immediate when Luke is known any day it seems during prep patrol sweets reduced only once per day and only through the southern bump and Northwest corridor reserve assault troops that moved through there with reserve secured and tick infected removed should have all routes clear in three weeks back to business retic infected less still developing currently at fifty will be higher roundup raid for immediate exon anyone protests they taped the wolf no time for [ __ ] tired of eating JB's army with dissidents elimination the better option Georgia [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey tourist the Intel you've been gathering for me has been enlightening to say the least Georgia is planning on a mass exile in a very near future many lives are going to be at risk I have a few things to discuss with you I know we were gonna try to avoid the face to face but the plan I'm formulating warrants it appreciate you here meet me in the same spot it's the first time churchyard thanks for all you do know me hey tourist I'll get right to the point after looking over the Intel you brought me seems like Georgia is planning to toss out a large number of people real soon a lot of lives are gonna be in jeopardy we have some hope the map you scored shows a safe way out of NOLA just need to buy some time and some space to organize exiles on a large scale get them ready to move I think the Reserve is going to provide the opening I need Georgia and the tower so obsessed with it don't think they'll be concerned with what I'm doing for a short while and with the reclaim salivating over to once the reserve is unlocked and revealed to the world courtesy of you there's gonna be a bloodbath you can count on that that's when I make my move when there won't be open long though it'll be tight I gotta take the chance I don't know me sounds risky trying to get that many people out at once without Georgia noticing you've seen the posters everywhere she's trying to turn the whole city against you maybe you should just get out with ambra while you have the chance you can't be serious after all the work my daughter and I have put in to make this dream a reality you think I should turn my back on the people I've been working so hard to help no I'm all-in tourists I appreciate your concern we are going to uphold our promise to these people do or die I will leave the key to the reserve in the drop spot for you lantern will be on when it's there when the [ __ ] goes down for the reserve if you're thinking it's all too much and you want out come find us the exodus could use someone with your particular set of talents my hope is you won't be a fool but my mind suspects you'll be too hooked on that damn reserve pipe dream just like everybody else all I can do is wish you good luck and good judgment tourists they carry yourself [Music] [Music] you
