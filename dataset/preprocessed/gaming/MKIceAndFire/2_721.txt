[ __ ] evie i let her down i thought if i gave her some space time she'd get back on her feet can't wrap my head around it i never saw evelyn as the type to give up come on what she went through i wouldn't call it giving up remember fingers how he said evie was with him for four days yeah did say so she disappeared from clouds a week before you turned up tom told me later i couldn't sleep at night knowing that kept thinking what the hell happened to those other three days so i did some more digging in her virtues i found woodman he kept her and had his way with her the things he did and once he got bored he pawned her off wait so you found other recordings had another look at the corrupted ones you know lots of static hard to pick up anything really at some point i stumbled on something like an echo of the spat we'd had last time we saw each other but i know she wasn't scrolling then why was it saved as a virtue she got no explanation for it maybe she recalled it later relived it almost implant could have been on when you know as a defense mechanism escaping into the past so as not to live in the present what did woodman do to her did you see it yeah and i really wish i could unsee it i zeroed woodman didn't plan on it just how the chips landed glad i did though me too i can't even imagine still it's not enough there's so many more like him gotta be something i can do about it like what don't know yet i think i'll call suze thanks bee sorry but uh i'd rather be alone now promise to keep in touch sure you don't need anything no but sweet of you to ask if
