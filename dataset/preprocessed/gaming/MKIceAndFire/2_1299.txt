gotcha look um unguarded e right so can I go with you don't want to be here any longer than I have to yeah sure just follow behind [Music] [Music] I'm sure they're safe but we live right by sector 7 and I keep calling and calling but I still can't get through I heard that all the phone lines are dead it doesn't really you sure pretty sure depending on the Board's decision we may start two projects simultaneously rebuilding the plate and the city members of the urban planning division will likely take point on both director - st has ordered teams to come up with three five and ten-year plans each team needs to come up with a detailed proposal and schedule we're going to have to put a lot of man-hours into this so we'll need to start ASAP does anyone have any questions at all if not then we'll wait for the director to return [Music] this it I'm telling you I saw him with my own eyes sauntering down the corridor we don't have time for this nonsense he was as close to me as you are now the shock of it made me spill my tea enough already if there are intruders in the building my men will deal with them but mr. president sir I swear to you Reeve sir I have the damage assessment for sector seven and I'm afraid the figures are catastrophic spare us the doom and gloom was there anything else well sir I've also drafted a reproduction plan for not with the ancient in our custody once more with respect sir I don't see how it's Reeve neo Midgar [Music] in their promised land we will build a new macaw powered metropolis mr. president we still don't know for sure that the promised land even professor Hojo the test results were within expectations the specimen is somewhat lacking compared to her pure blood mother but for our purposes she should more than suffice so she can lead us to the promised land well mr. president that remains to be seen I would like your permission to secure her cooperation through more forceful means forceful yet gentle she is a precious resource that must be handled with care personally I've never had a problem with torture my armory is at your disposal should you require anything I had something more psychological than mind better to scar the psyche that Mar the flesh [Music] proceed as you see fit however you will not make the same mistake twice is that clear if I may mr. president I have an idea how we might mitigate the risks simply put we could have the ancient we produce in the absence of a second specimen we would need to identify an alternative mate I would start with candidates from soldier these would of course include s and G types quite frankly there's no telling what kind of properties that crossbred specimen might possess so what see you all if there is nothing else mr. president meeting adjourned please sir something stinks anything the man in the lab coat head of R&D we follow him okay and then we kill the son of a [ __ ] not until he's led us to Aerith that's the plan walking the halls of this very building who would have believed it I wonder where I to range of face to face how I should like to meet their offspring but that can wait first we must have answers a simple psychoactive agent should suffice nothing likely to cause any long-term damage let's go right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] first don't fool I love it what is this a dozen bullets in your head unless you open that door right now you must be the ones who've been stirring up trouble lately the eco-terrorists if so I can't imagine what business you have with me the president's upstairs go on sue shut up keep walking no y'all better move a muscle you stop pushing unlike you I am less accustomed to physical violence you'll get used to it what is it that you want our friend she's in your lab really tell us where it is oh so she's your friend well well that case but mine do the trick I'm speaking up so it's nothing just imagining how she might react if I were to present to her your fresh corpses I promise you [Music] [Music] Sonia [Music] [Music] I got this don't overdo it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] let's switch it up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey Oh Jose get away [Music] valuable combat data cocky little egghead age the results provided by my predictive models indicate that this force should be more than capable of handling y'all about to learn predictable we're taking Aerith back oh come back you say correct me if I am wrong but did the girl not come here of her own free will or do you mean to tell me that she is your personal property she only came here to save Marlene I'm afraid you misunderstand but I really can't be bothered to explain Bologna is home to extraordinary specimens that seems to acknowledge do try to be considerate [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like your models got it wrong yes well no matter but will they get here in time to save you from me [Music] yeah No oh now I recall my memory was mistaken my what where are you taking me one of those things up to this time Barrett God stand back [Music] you came for me yep you good I'm great hey

and got away so we're gonna go get the son of a [ __ ] [Music] everything goes reclaim [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] you know Reno I think you might be due for some R&R no I'm good what are we going to do about sector seven we are going to do nothing been thinking was all that necessary and we refuse to someone else would have completed the task we have spared that someone the burden of the guilty conscience perhaps that will ease yours yeah no let's try another tack then they were a sacrifice to balance the scales say what after everything we've taken from the planet we were due to give something back do you actually believe that does it matter [Music] yes understood the VP needs us cloud oh thank goodness you're awake you okay yeah [Music] where are we where I lived when I was still a child [Music] [Music] are you okay maybe you should rest a little longer [Music] I don't want you to push yourself we're all worried my mom and I stayed here years ago when I was just a little girl the room looks exactly the same [Music] every morning they'd come and take my mom away I remember crying here alone [Music] Aerith before we break out of here talk to us there's so much we don't know I'm a descendent of the Ancients that's pretty much it really oh but just so you know that's not their actual name they called themselves etc we who were born of the planet with her we speak her flesh we save unto her promised land shall we one day return by her loving grace and Providence may we take our place in paradise you know it yeah well honestly I thought that part was just a fairy tale Shinra thinks it's true they've been searching for the promised land for a long time and they must think you can lead them to it can you nope someday maybe I'll find it in me but now not even if I wanted to even if you could that land belongs to the I mean to you and your people shinra's after it because they believe it's rich in Marco Marco they've got no right to claim but they'll try to take it anyway won't they hmm greedy bastards and never stop okay new plan y'all take Aerith and get the hell out of here me I'm gonna go bust some syndra heads there it wait you can't do that oh great these [ __ ] are cute probably some Shinra science experiment whispers perhaps best described as arbiters of fate they are drawn to those who attempt to alter destinies course and ensure they do not like capital D destiny the flow of the great river that is the planet from inception to oblivion and you're saying that that flow is somehow fixed yes for it is the will of the planet itself so if we're destined for a bleak future these whispers were try to keep us on that course now wait just a damn minute how in hell can you possibly know any of that spouting that cryptic stuff which could all be [ __ ] I mean ain't you a Shinra lab record dog I'm not a rat dog when Erath reached out to me I found this knowledge of the whispers listen to me please Eric the Shinra Electric Power Company isn't the real enemy it started with them sure but I promise you there's a much bigger threat I just want to do everything in my power to help all of you and the planet Eris what are you not telling us lost in the maze and every step is taking me further from the past [Music] every time the whispers touch me I lose something a part of myself [Music] all of them [Music] it's okay we'll find a way out together okay weird hey guys you're here I'm feeling HQ Bell in the South I doubted not after all the [ __ ] we pull them really nicely like super duper nicely thinks wedge just get to the roof okay Oh I didn't ask him to do any of that yeah well I'm glad he did almost Dale to amount for later [Music] you
