[Music] [Music] people caring for people compassion that's the foundation gotham was built on and i have proudly built golf corp on that same foundation that's why we're called the people company thank you so much please mr boyle seems to be after your title as gotham's biggest philanthropic industrialist gotham needs more people like him bruce hey i am blown away by your support it's well deserved you're going to change the world ferris hey we'll change it together right pardon me mr boyle the press is waiting this way please okay the future is looking very very bright for gotham now it's almost midnight and you all know what that means let's get this new year's eve party going with uh forget to pay your heating bill bruce don't move alfred hold her right there yeah got him gone crazy are you crowds afraid of an old man just take it easy hope that vase wasn't worth something wow look at the original bruce crap are you okay i've been through worse these are penguins men what do they want with ferris i'm not sure they're being led by someone in a mechanized suit i need to find ferris before they do well you're no use to us dressed like that you need to put on your other suit the closest entrance to the batcave is in the study there's bruce he'll help us bruce bruce do you have a minute someone said an iceberg just appeared exploded in the ballroom i need details what happened who do you think where's ferris he never made it to the interview wait you're not going out there alone are you stay with alfred he'll keep you safe with these guests about perhaps you should look for that item in the wine cellar those men are armed i'm going to have to take them down quietly if i don't want to get shot oh man look at all this stuff i'm going to be rich don't forget i called dibs on those perks i'm taking them before we torch these [Music] [Music] the wayne's ruined the cobble box back in the day so he says makes sense you don't get to the top without stepping on a few hats you know what i mean ain't nothing back there said more wine boardiaux is that expensive it's not boardiucks is that expensive or what we're inside wayne manor it's all expensive so why is penguin got us working with this mr freeze why do you think did you see that ice way you mean ah i hope i get one you you probably just freeze yourself i'll freeze your damn trap shot that might hurt if it came from a guy who didn't live in his mother's basement hey i rent that room for here [Music] sir if you'd come out of that cave more than once a week you'd know that the batcave entrance is in the wine cellar's tasting room look for the statue watch yourself in that tunnel sir it's still suffering from the damage our visitor did on christmas eve police are urging south gotham residents master bruce i caught a glimpse of your mechanized man these hooligans are calling him mr freeze you might consider donning your extreme environment suit the xe suit it's not ready for deployment oh dear i hear helicopters more penguin brute do hurry i don't have time to prep the xe suit for deployment i'll need alfred to put the finishing touches on it i need to get back to the manor and find ferris before penguins men do sir before you ask the formula we used for your glue grenades was unstable what was left after christmas eve was degraded into dust [Music] alfred what happened to the power sir you must hurry they're setting the manor ablaze i managed to get most of the guests into the east and south wings but hey it's a butler alfred alfred welcome [Music] is [Music] still no signal from alfred i only need a few hundred but by all means get out of here oh is oh i'm going gonna hurt you [Music] damn it you want to get shot oh man cover me got a man down oh yeah but still alive hide and seek huh yeah well we're playing games [Music] this is just what the boss eddie do take us out one at a time [Music] come on get up where are you hmm [Music] i have to get these people to safety but the wayne crest is blocking the exit please the crest is blocking the way out you have to move it so we can escape this way that was amazing you just picked those goons apart quiet they've got ferris boil in the next room i i think they're going to kill him sir are you all right thanks to you the hero of christmas eve come to rescue us from the can i trust you'll get these people to safety um of course now that you've dealt with most of these hooligans you should restore power to your sprinkler system to deal with these fires not to worry i won't allow wayne manor to burn to the ground the people want to know what you're all about i've got more important things to do this is important you've become a hot issue for this city you need to state for the record what you're trying to accomplish my actions state that loud and clear you've got a new supporter in me thanks again so are you here are you here to stop these maniacs don't do this uh we need to get you out of here i i heard about you i have no form with you then you crashed the wrong party freeze what do you want with me just require a moment of your time let me go help help i think he's angry go ahead it looks like freeze isn't the only one with a cryogenic weapon this door is frozen shut i'll need to enter the ballroom through the balcony freeze is gone one of penguin's goons will know where that chopper's going how the hell the back hit you're so fast that don't matter nothing we banged boyd trashed the place and our frozen friend made his escape that's mission accomplished in my book i do time to counterpart loot and bug out all right thank uh [Music] where is he taking ferris i i don't know i promise do you have any idea how many of your friends i sent to the hospital on christmas eve look one of penguin's fears she's throwing out the weapons freeze gave us he must know we were supposed to meet up in south gotham you can meet up in the emergency room instead mr freeze has done with our friend targeting someone like ferris boyle it's sickening i know you'll bring him to justice sir i'll see this one wheeled into black gate on a gurney day two dispatch confirming that code three looks like these anarchy fanatics are taking advantage of the lack of police presence down here no chance of that i should deal with those anarchy followers but first i need to track down penguins dealer and find out where frieza's taking ferris that would be he's got a spiral on it and then that's why you need to shut up hmm everybody keeps [Music] yes [Music] we are monitoring a group of masked individuals gathering and coventry god get up you piece of crap rise of that [Music] it'll be a miracle if we all get through this keep your mouth shut and your eyes peeled he could be anywhere enough already let's get this over with uh finding penguins dealer is the key to finding freeze i should scan this area for clues that might tell me where he went they're in temporary cryostasis i'll need my thermal gloves to safely release them whatever this substance is it's slowly shutting his systems down putting him into cryostasis i won't be able to safely remove him from the ice without the thermal gloves built into the xc suit the officer just chanced upon penguin's men he wasn't equipped to deal with this cryotech but the cryogun was leaking if i hurry this trail will lead me right to penguin's men then i can make them tell me where this tech came from alfred penguin's men are using cryogenic weapons to encase innocent people in ice i'm going to need the thermal gloves in the xc suit to break them free i'll get to work immediately sir any idea where these weapons are coming from i'll get that answer when i catch up with penguins dealer [Music] any last words i want my maybe you [Music] just trying to you know damn thing in this i got nothing [Music] he's a machine wipe the streets where's freeze you think i know you plan on celebrating the new year in traction okay okay he he made a deal with penguin weapons in exchange for some stiff a ferrous boyle he's in god court blast i saw you're lying goth corp doesn't make weapons what no i uh god corp i swear look i've got the entry codes i'll take those it doesn't make sense goth corp involved in weapons tech there's got to be more to this we got no contact with units on the bridge they get a better pair of gloves my fingers feel like they're gonna snap right off sure thing boss what are you going to do with me you assuming your friend keeps cooperating i'm sure we won't have to do anything you know trash those men were armed how'd you do that where are they taking ferris mr boyle they uh they're heading to the propellant research wing these guys have been raiding the whole facility do you have the codes to this security door no i don't have clearance but my boss does a bunch of them took him to the organics lab through the lobby i'll make sure they don't hurt your boss get yourself to safety [Music] what so right end of the road you told us you were the boss though why so shy of a sudden huh what happened to that spirit of share i i'm cooperating i'm cooperating i know i know but we all got jobs and my job is to shoot you if i don't think you're telling me the truth i told you there are no weapons here it's just plants tissue research [Music] where the you [Music] you alive yeah man just let me walk out of here [Music] what the over here we need backup damn it where are you holy crap i saw you on cnn you just saved my life you have codes i need to access the propellant research wing i do here take them you're going to save mr boyle right it's not safe inside goth corp you need to get out of here don't worry i won't be hanging around and thanks you know not just for me for gotham security please report to propellant research unauthorized access detected alfred how's work on the xc suit coming slowly i'm encountering ice formations impeding my progress the thermal gloves would certainly help you with that i'm working as quickly as i can keep me posted now where the hell is rick supposed is here with the security pass i know that that's why i'm asking where he's at why are you asking us we've all been with you knock it off penguin's got trouble if we don't get to him that'll go double for us uh h so special delivery [Music] like can i go my boss has the codes you need those goons have them in the organics lab this guy ain't got to pass let's just figure out a way to get in there [Music] i don't have access to this door i need to find another way into the propellant facility stage one fueling complete docking process initiated danger temperature anomaly detected in potential breach of danger multiple breaches in coolant outtake detected security alert unauthorized activation of access panel d17 security alert give me boil or i'll freeze this entire room i know you won't all you've got the code you need and i ain't giving him up unless i'll get what he's giving you what's behind this door is of no interest to you what i think is the weapon i would [Music] now now you belong to me i'll give you one chance to let him go threats are meaningless to a man who has lost everything [Music] you this is your you get me out of this what's freeze after why does he need boil what he's got codes he needs to access some kind of super weapon and now you let him have it that ice is the only thing saving you from getting the beating you deserve yeah yeah yeah look you want to save our friend mr boyle yeah but you'll never break fruitless eyes golf club has a device so uh like a drill a cryo drill tell me where it is i had my bed bring all our uh acquisitions to the my alibi nightclub for safekeeping of course then you better hope your men are still in my alibi if i want to break through this barrier of ice i'd better get to the my alibi nightclub before penguin's men decide to relocate critical failure in propellant research please evacuate danger critical failure in stage 2 [Music] i'd never survive in that cloud of cryovapor [Music] start figuring it out since you're the one who brought us down here you gotta stay calm and think of something okay warning critical failure in propellant research wing please evacuate cryogenic reactor has failed containment breach i'm no cryo engineer i'm just a guard you want to break the dead you better make it your friends this cryovapor is lethal i need the xc suit if i hope to survive inside these clouds where'd you come from that was incredible come with me i'm getting you out of here thanks for getting me out of there what are you gonna do now after i've recovered the cryo drill i'm coming back here to save ferris but isn't freeze gonna try to stop you with any luck alfred what's the status of the xc suit i've just finished loading it into a drop container good news i'm on my way to my alibi to recover a stolen cryogenic drill have the bad wing drop it there it's on its way [Music] wow i heard about the protests there's a party going on this guy's something else he can't take us off um i suggest you secure the area before i initiate the problem he's making us look stupid how is this possible drop incoming sir [Music] the thermal gloves should help you deal with most isu encounter and the suit will provide protection from cold and cryovapor i just hope it's bulk won't slow you down the honeycomb structure insulates against extreme cold without increasing weight it won't slow me down a bit he's i mean i thought last year we said we were gonna take a trip someplace warm i can use a thermo-charged batarang to bring that ice down on top of those thugs hang up on it security lock damn cold survived listen you stole a cryogenic drill from goth corp where are they maybe next time you so sir your map has been updated with the locations of the components you'll need to rebuild the cryogenic drill thanks alfred i'm on it how much longer penguin said to wait for his call he's setting something up with a buyer yeah he ain't called you don't think i mean hey he's here i got him i got him uh i wonder how much it's gonna cost to clean up this mess gotta be millions in damage how will they pay for it they'll probably raise taxes they're always raising taxes and wondering why we're all so pissed off hey come on what do you say he wants us out here working a break having a drink for the road like they've let you wait what's that supposed to mean for the way you're dressed [Music] screw you [Music] it's here i'm retiring alfred i've assembled the cryo drill but it requires some kind of super conducting fluid to operate ah here it is sir an organic super coolant used in an experimental lab run by one victor freeze as in mr freeze it seems too great a coincidence to ignore it says here that ferris had mr frieza's lab shut down if he's a disgruntled employee out for revenge and this is about more than just stealing weapons tech frieze's lab is under quarantine some kind of accident i'm on my way back to goth corp now [Music] cold it just gets right into your bones the worst though the worst is when you take a breath freezes at least we got some clouds tonight get you let's take them out fitzy's here to save you sorry assessment no one can help you now [Music] is i'll need to evacuate this lab of cryovapor before the lockdown protocol on this door is disengaged i thought somebody was supposed to kill that son of a i think [Music] breach in progress now's our chance get in there and blow the hell a thermocharged batarang could break up the ice encasing that vantage get off me hang on i'm coming i'd go to all that trouble he ain't afraid to bring the pain that's for damn sure well what do you think he ain't taking it easy on us so don't take it easy on him i know i heard it still here and don't lose them need help huh [Music] good oh look out now you're important i'm in shock all right i'm in shock alright can't believe what i'm seeing it looks like you drove off the bat maybe this freeze guys i'm gonna keep talking like i'll need to evacuate this lab of cryovapor before the lockdown protocol on this door is disengaged there's more going on here than a simple accident this security guard's skin has the same blue coloration as freezes i should set up a crime scene data analysis indicates that he died from heat stroke but the control room doesn't show signs of overheating this is some kind of crystallized chemical residue traces lead back into the lab the trail ends here i should scan for more evidence two men struggled one of them ran out of the lab that would be the dead security guard i found these palm prints are a match for victor freeze he must have watched the security guard [Music] die freeze scavenged what he needed from various prototypes to build himself a super cooled survival suit extreme pressure built up inside the tank when ice sealed these outtakes it appears that this guard was frozen by the cryovapors from the resulting explosion the evidence suggests the guard was frozen before the tank ruptured perhaps by frieza's cryo cannon these dna traces are a match for victor freeze spatter analysis suggests a blunt impact someone assaulted freeze with a weapon the cannon was knocked over and fired when the tank exploded it released a plume of cryo-chemicals the plume enveloped freeze on the guard but the shockwave knocked the assailant clear i need to find that weapon it may have evidence i can use to identify the assailant dna analysis confirms the gun was used to bludgeon victor freeze and fingerprint analysis shows ferrous boil it was ferrous something was wheeled through this fluid possibly a gurney the fluid must have frozen almost immediately for these tracks to have been preserved odd frieze was secretly doing research on huntington's korea but this is a cryogenic weapons lab the test subject was nora freeze now i know what happened here boyle hired victor to help advance the secret cryo weapons program within goth corp in exchange boyle agreed to devote goth corp resources to finding a cure for noris huntington's but boyle was more interested in how victor had managed to put nora into cryostasis when victor realized that boyle had no intention of following through on their deal he decided to do the huntington's research himself but boyle didn't like that the cryo-chemical cocktail altered victor's metabolism as well as the guards boyle escaped ahead of the pool and had the lab quarantined victor survived but he knew that leaving the supercooled lab would kill him so he built himself a suit and utilized an organic super coolant to keep his core temperatures sub-zero all this violence he's just trying to save his dying wife [Music] the super cool invictor uses in his suit is the same fluid i need for the cryo drill alfred send gordon the evidence i've gathered on boyle's crimes i'm sorry master bruce i know you had high hopes for what ferris could do for gotham that doesn't matter now victor's plan was never to kill boyle he needs boyle's security access to get his wife out of gothcorp that's all he wants and now you're going to stop him i have to and are you still going to need that gurney i am but not for victor you know what i'm gonna do when i'll get out of here i'm gonna have candy pour me a nice hot bath again i'm gonna drown you with it uh i'm trying boss this ice is tough oh you completely and utterly dense get over here put your scrawny little neck in my head it what are you waiting for kill of your bloody workers punch in the face short you're gonna get me out of this damn iceberg you're good right where you are but you can't leave me here i'll freeze to death not my problem oh so you come back to glow to have you oh i'll hang you with that bloody cape you hear me oh yeah oh you can't leave me here batman we're freezing again holy thanks you have [Music] emergency [Music] giving you the code i'll see you both dead before i give you a damn thing then join me in my fate and freeze peon victor plead you've got nothing no money no resources everything around you i built without me you'd still be turning animals into ice cubes you stole food you thought you can't stop me i know the truth and so will the police boyle will face judgment for his crimes it was an accident you don't know what you're talking about nothing matters do you understand nothing but minora [Music] you've endangered lives all over this city nora would never have wanted this what she wants is to live a long life in the warmth of the sun her hand in mine because of him shall only feel the icing touch of a man whose emotions run as cold as the blood in his veins sir you can overload those cryogenerators using your thermal gloves look for the control panels none of this violence would have been necessary containment breach [Music] containment great containment bridge let's see how well you do when the air freezes in your lungs he's here now wash him out now get in here and find the batman not allow him to escape again mine remains as strong you have forced me to do this this is the batman rewards impossible you alive multiple where are the rest of you get in here and honor our bargains search everywhere find him search the area damn you batman for force he escaped find him my suit is resilient batman search the area incompetence mine remains as long you want to stop me and come out of the shadows well batman come out and do what you came to do only anger means cryogenic containment laura if i can get underneath him i can take him from below [Music] thanks for doing the heavy lifting but you shouldn't have stuck your nose in my business and here i thought i was going to have a problem explaining what happened in your lab i mean the police are never going to look at me after what you did and with this battery dead there won't be anyone left to say otherwise cryogenic containment is failing and that just leaves you please you can save her you just have to bypass the wild victor she died i'll keep you alive long enough go [Music] take a seat humanitarian cryogenic containment restored [Music] i'm sorry victor i can't give you peace but i can't give you justice now [Music] breaking news out of north gotham at this hour where protest has turned to celebration under extreme pressure from gotham citizens mayor hill has just announced his resignation while hill has not ruled out a possible run for re-election in the new year his resignation means that peter grogan will likely not be the next police commissioner of gotham speculation has already begun about who the new mayor will appoint as commissioner with many pundits naming gcpd captain james gordon as the front runner and now to south gotham where vicki vale brings us this live report thanks janine i'm standing at the corporate headquarters of gothcorp where captain gordon has confirmed that gothcorp ceo ferris boyle has been taken into police custody police report that mr boyle stands accused of manslaughter extortion and attempted murder shocking accusations given that just earlier tonight he accepted the wayne foundation's award for humanitarian of the year also in custody is the notoriously elusive underworld crime boss oswald cobblepot better known as the penguin as well as a goth corp cryogenicist victor freeze mr freeze is being held under heavy guard at gotham general receiving treatment for an undisclosed medical condition quincy sharp has suggested that mr freeze is yet another example of the type of criminal that needs the specialized care that only arkham asylum can provide police credit these arrests to solid police work but this reporter suspects the vigilante known as the batman had more than a small role to play on a personal note i owe batman a debt of gratitude for rescuing me from almost certain death earlier this evening so thank you batman for all of us back to you janine thanks vicky the batman continues to be one of the top stories this holiday season so as we here at gnn wish you all a happy and safe new year's eve we'll leave you with just a few of the comments you've made about gotham's caped crusader i was surrounded next thing you know bam boom kapow the bastards are all on the ground ko'd i didn't even see him coming oh it was all a blur he just whooshed in out of nowhere listen i'm a cop i can't condone what he does but i can be grateful he's doing it oh he's real all right i got the bruises to prove it he's real he's ruthless and there ain't nothing in the world that's gonna stop him [Music] congratulations uh victor ferris and even that scoundrel cobblepot are all in custody shall we call it a night then not yet alfred there's still work to be done you
