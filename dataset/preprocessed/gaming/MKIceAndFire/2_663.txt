look at that gorgeous view you know it will be worth it everyone's going to be beyond jealous oh you're so right the colors alone and the lighting could you ask for better lighting in a million years it's like golden hour times 20. i'm not going to lie though this gravel is making me really nervous uh yeah same we just have to get the right framing though and snap it and then i can liquify our jawlines a bit so we're snatched and then we can go right super quick ready pam three two one and for more than two decades new york based law firm morgan yates and cohn has been among the most successful and the most controversial companies in the united states founded in the greed is good downtown era of the mid-1980s by kenneth morgan don yates and theodore cohn the firm quickly amassed an impressive client roster counting such corporate behemoths as top investment bank milton fitzpatrick and van orton tobacco a reputation for ruthlessness and dirty tactics no doubt originating with the notorious affluenza defense of murderous socialite chelsea whitmore has long stuck to their name but despite the persistent outrage of progressives the firm has enjoyed a seemingly never-ending streak of successes and legal triumphs this however may be changing just a few months ago senior partner ken morgan passed away unexpectedly at the himapan hotel in bangkok and now another of the founding partners dawn archibald yates in front of whose argentinian vineyard i am currently standing has announced his retirement from the firm and so the burning question in the upper echelons of corporate america is this i mean they fade has morgan yates and cohn finally run out of steam i am pam kingsley reporting live from mendoza argentina on gnn news mustn't be late the gear is fairly common in these parts after all i'll get a picture later i didn't see you at the club last weekend i got orders sir i can't let you through hey man you're being told politely come on i have to spend a few days in that aaron ford jr i'm with the firm don yates is expecting me okay checks out but leave the paperwork with me absolutely not mr yates asked me specifically to bring him these documents you don't want to keep mr gates waiting do you where are you junior partner with morgan yates and cohn the most powerful law firm on the continent now enough of this foolishness let me through okay okay i'm just messing with you step right in here [Music] looking good enjoy the party if he considers me a threat [Music] don't i know how to deal with the likes of don yates the one we need to worry about is corvo black yates fixer you know him i see a regular i always suspected he was a middleman for morgan yates and cone i never took his contracts nasty piece of work below my standards but plenty of my colleagues were less picky well they certainly got theirs i wonder how your agent will feel if he saw you now he wouldn't 47 is a weapon and weapons don't judge they go where they're pointed oh that's cold i like you more already [Music] hey what are we care not just a punt we're talking knee deep the whole place looked like a horror flick of course jace came down until the poor sold in charge of the tanks a new one you think there was some kind of fail-safe mechanism or early warning system in place yeah you would but you'd be wrong if the pumps malfunction the tanks overflow that pretty much sums it up so pay attention to that pump flow unless you're in the market for an extra orifice lightning never strikes twice we'll be flying these fermentation tanks are accident prone if the pump malfunctions the tanks overflow this has happened before provoking an appearance from don yates it's likely to happen again you might want to keep an eye on the pump why is that yeah we weren't doing much anyway apparently huh sounds pretty uh over the top get it over the top we've all been there must have lost his mind [Music] well i didn't know we had investors come in a private tour mr yates with all due respect we are about to harvest them all back i hardly think this is the best use of my time fine if you say so who is the audience tiana barnwood okay and the last one corvo black is he your fixer the scary one okay i'll clear my schedule a private tour of the estate diana vidal and this fixer corvo black black is a threat but also an opportunity yates's own machinations are inconsequential joining the tour will give access to vidal away from the crowd enjoy the why does he want me to play tour guide to his socialized friends it's our best day he probably just wants to show off patrons i know i would sir this is a no-go you can't pass through here amigo sorry you must be burnwood and vidal and you must be your disturbance man it's a living what's your excuse well we're all here it seems except for our guide mr vargas suppose someone ought to fetch him black i'm looking in your direction yeah let me know how that works out for you well this is fun [Music] um go um [Music] okay [Music] okay foreign i heard the news this morning oh excuse me remember if i don't have more important things to do than babysit socialized friends it's only harvest season better do what he says patron big shot new york lawyer like that don't want to get on his bad side well i'm not going anywhere until i have decided that the crop is right for picking bring me the three malbec grapes to taste ramon if yes doesn't like how i prioritize he can weigh me down with concrete and toss me of a bridge how's that three grapes was it i'll get my picking knife oh come on i left it right here seriously who takes another man's picking knife [Music] okay i got it is thanks i feel much better now oh yeah [Music] okay [Music] oh oh come on so [Music] okay you know no no no i'm a fan um it's i'm gabriel vargas chief winemaker and i will be your tour guide any questions before we start yes but they're all above your pay grade we're good lead the way senor vargas follow me hey yo what's up first stop on the tour is the production floor where our prize-winning malbec grapes are processed our equipment is state of the art including a dragon freezer unit and last but not least our great crusher industrial size for your disposal purposes interesting follow me please this is an industrial cold storage unit useful for preventing cellular decomposition it easily reaches temperatures of minus 10 degrees celsius trust me you don't want to stay inside for long no kidding hey there's no doorknob on the inside seems like a pretty glaring safety omission if you ask me probably sound proof too and good luck getting a phone signal follow me please this is our grape crusher the de-stemmed grapes are crushed into a thick pulp by a powerful rotating cylinder making each grape quite impossible to id have you heard any workplace accidents what fall into the vat and get crushed to a pope you'd have to be a bona fide idiot a waste of space if you ask me follow me please next on our tour is the fermentation atrium in these spacious tanks which could easily be able to contain a couple of hundred human bodies the sugars in the wine are converted to alcohol this is also where we squeeze the must into a fine juice using our great presser fascinating come along this is the facility's grape presser where the freshly crushed pulp is pressed through a fine filter leaving only the flesh and skins behind much more efficient than the ancient practice of grape stomping but also less personal so this is what the little guy feels like our large fermentation tanks are constructed from solid french oak and each contain up to 500 gallons of grape must you don't want to fall in but if you do at least you'll die happy well looks like an accident waiting to happen occupational hazard neighborhood final stop the barrel room nothing dramatic just wine biting its time the vault next door contains our most precious bottles but the access doors are made from ballistic glass and can only be unlocked from the security room high above our heads so unless you're the sparrow don't get any ideas remarkable ah here comes mr yates now perfect timing ah miss burnwood is it not don yates pleased to meet you become very highly recommended as chief of the heralds let me be the first to say welcome aboard why thank you mr yates rest assured that i will be following your every lead very closely say that reminds me we're about to have a little herald get-together up the house just a modest toast to celebrate my forthcoming inauguration is constant you are of course most welcome to join us i believe you shall make a fine herald once the training wheels are off i wouldn't miss it for the world capital right this way into the lion's den oh almost forgot cortazar please nip down to the wine cellar and tell mr flowers the sommelier to prep the 1945 grand paladin and bring it up to the house for our special occasion got it chief [Music] you
