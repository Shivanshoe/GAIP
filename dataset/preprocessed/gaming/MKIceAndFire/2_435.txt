[Music] ah goku daddy daddy goku has died it stood tall against the deadliest of foes but the mighty warrior was no match for the virus in his heart though those close to goku were overcome with sadness they continued to lead peaceful lives for some time but six months later two monstrosities appeared on an island to the south earth's defenders met them head-on but they stood no chance [Music] piccolo was the first to fall then vegeta yamcha tien and krillin all lost their lives the two androids plunged the world into a state of constant fear and chaos it is here 13 years later that our story begins a story about a world without goku vegeta and bulma's son trunks has grown into a young man with a strong sense of justice how could the androids do this how could they be so cruel [Music] gohan is the only warrior left alive to face off against the android threat trunks admiring gohan's strength and burning with a desire to defeat the androids makes an impassioned plea gohan i want to be stronger i want to put a stop to these monsters please train me so i can help you fight gohan and trunks the last surviving warriors trunks okay i'll do it thank you gohan you won't regret this i promise several days later trunks begins his intense training with gohan hoping to improve his skills enough to contend with the androids all right let's get started with today's training right i can't wait i know i don't really have to say this but i will anyway the androids are insanely strong i'm gonna fight you as if i'm fighting them if you don't do the same you're gonna get hurt understood here i come [Music] we're going to become strong enough to beat you and then beat the androids that's the spirit keep it up thanks [Music] wow you're a quick learner trunks i'm impressed still got a lot more [Music] [Music] huh that attack wow trunks seeing you fight like this reminds me a lot of vegeta [Music] you're good trunks you're definitely vegeta's son i'm still not good enough i don't think i'll ever be able to beat you at your best [Laughter] no way you're gonna be even stronger than me someday i'm counting on it i sure hope so all right we better head back bulma's not gonna be too happy if we stay out here any longer right definitely can't let her know i'm training with you i'll go with you part of the way thanks [Music] [Music] [Music] huh trunks wait somebody help go on that guy over there is in trouble right i'm on it [Music] are you okay who are you two you were attacked by that thing weren't you oh no huh what is this the that alarm it's going to get the androids attention what [Music] huh you hear that 18 yeah i hear it sounds like fun to me [Music] we're doomed doomed the androids are no doubt on their way now trunks quickly take this person somewhere safe i'll do my best to distract the androids if they show up right we'll do [Music] i sure hope trunks was able to find a safe hiding spot oh it's only you i was hoping for a change of pace but i guess that's not gonna happen this sucks we're just repeating the same fight over and over again it's the androids so what that guy was saying was true they actually showed up what are you doing here trunks uh i thought i could help you fight them no you're not strong enough yet to take him on hey he's already showed up for the party so why not let him join in on the fun huh i guess it's too late now try to avoid them and stay right behind me as much as you can [Music] right you got [Music] we it [Music] [Music] look alive [Music] [Music] [Music] on this check on god [Music] trunks now's our chance to get out of here [Music] right well damn looks like they got away whatever they weren't that fun anyway let's get out of here sure maybe they'll actually put up a fight next time but i'm not holding my breath [Music] okay i think they're gone now yeah looks like it i sure hope that guy we helped out earlier is okay yeah i'm worried about him too you mind showing me where he is sure i'll take you there [Music] sir are you okay oh it's you two so you're still alive yeah you look like you're doing okay too you know when that thing found me i thought i was a goner but fortunately you two came to the rescue thank you so much ah it was nothing by the way what exactly was that drone that was one of the red ribbon army's old patrol bots dangerous little guys what it's programmed to fly around red ribbon army facilities and if it detects any potential intruders it sounds an alarm to call reinforcements okay but there aren't any red ribbon army facilities in this area though that's true but it appears the bot is operating on its own it's forgotten its patrol routine and instead detects threats anywhere all around the world to make matters worse the androids are the ones around to hear and respond to its alarm if you don't intend to fight the androids you only have two options either evade the drone or destroy it if the alarm does trigger you should be able to avoid alerting the androids by destroying the drone right away i see thanks for the information you really do seem to know a lot about drones and stuff indeed that's because i'm a researcher who specializes in mechanical engineering anyway the red ribbon army robots make use of some experimental technology their state-of-the-art command drones control other drones and inside those command drones are some particularly rare parts i thought i'd try to procure one of those rare parts and finally do something about those drones but then one of them spotted me are you serious that's dangerous he's right you should stay far away from that drone ah maybe you're right but if you two could destroy that command drone for me and help procure that part it'd really help me out think it's possible i'll reward you for your efforts of course huh if that thing's still around to alert the androids it could end up getting a lot more people killed so you'll help me will you i suppose at least as much as i can oh that's perfectly fine with me i'll be counting on you two so stay safe [Music] so we're after a drone that can alert the androids we definitely have to stop it right but if we don't handle this carefully we'll end up fighting the androids when we don't need to we have to be smart you can say that again i mean as much as i hate to admit it i'm no match for the androids right now okay let's try to make our way back as safely as we can right [Music] oh foreign uh made it i bet you're pretty tired get plenty of rest you'll need it for our training tomorrow right thanks for today gohan see you [Music] tomorrow okay mom i'm gonna meet gohan now see you later you've been hanging out with gohan a lot recently trunks you better not be putting yourself in danger are you putting yourself in danger of course not is that so okay then as long as you're going to see him why not ask gohan to join us for dinner we've got more than enough food that's a great idea mom gohan will love that i'll ask him okay bye [Music] be careful out there [Music] yes [Music] foreign sorry for the weight gohan you get enough rest yesterday if not you're not gonna get as much out of this training as you should i'm good all right i'm sure you know firsthand how strong the androids are and that's why we need you to become a super saiyan as soon as possible okay let's get right into it it's gonna be tough but once you're warmed up i'll help you out so you ready yep let's do this okay here i come good bring it on key to becoming a super saiyan is rage once you're filled with enough of it you'll transform looks like you're still not warmed up no i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] huh [Music] what's wrong you're tired already no i'm [Music] fine [Music] good get mad pretend on an android let the rage consume you you as an android well that's gonna be tough but i'll try [Music] [Music] nice work that's enough for now [Music] [Music] it sure is hard to become a super saiyan i mean i'm really trying to get angry [Music] i never said it would be easy [Music] it's really just a matter of increasing your energy and exploding with rage sounds simple but to actually pull it off you're gonna need more training right i won't give up oh yeah my mom wanted to know if you'd have dinner with us tonight you'll come right uh dinner you sure it's okay yeah i think she's already making enough for all of us i see well if that's the case and i guess i'll head over awesome okay let's get going [Music] [Music] another red ribbon army drone has shown up don't let it find you my mom's gonna be so happy so you've known my mom for a long time haven't you oh yeah what happened well it's complicated but my dad's long-lost brother kind of showed up and kidnapped me then i had to basically survive on my own in the wilderness for half a year what really you mean that all happened when you were four years old sounds unbelievable but it's true that's so incredible i don't really know what to say flying around recklessly with a drone nearby would be asking for trouble they look simple enough to beat thank you [Music] it's just me and mom living here i'm back mom and i brought gohan with me pleasure back safe trunks and it's good to see you gohan yeah good to see you too your timing's impeccable i just finished preparing dinner the androids have made it pretty hard to get everything i want some ingredients are hard to find but i try to make up for it with my ability to adapt in the kitchen i really appreciate this bulma [Music] and so thanks to bulma's efforts the three were able to enjoy a nice meal together and relax [Music] hmm thanks a lot for the meal it was delicious whoa you sure can't eat a lot gohan oh well he was just so good i couldn't help myself [Music] oh you just like him huh like who seeing you in that outfit eating like you do you remind me so much of your father it's almost like he's still here i wear this as a way to remind myself that i need to be strong just like him my dad was a really carefree person he never let anything get to him even my mom chewing him out that's so true but that didn't stop him from risking his life time and time again to protect me and all the people he knew and loved he was amazing i want to carry on his legacy and fight for those i care about for everyone but i feel there's more i should be doing wow gohan's amazing he's such a strong person [Music] you're doing plenty rumor has it you're out there giving the androids a hard time all on your own i'm impressed thanks trunks is impressed too and unfortunately now he thinks this is his fight as well go on tell him she doesn't know right that i'm training to fight the androids again [Music] you know it's already pretty late you must be tired gohan why don't you just stay the night yeah you should sleep over come on stay gohan well i i am pretty tired i'll take you up on that offer then good i'll prepare a bed for you now you two go clean yourselves up you both smell like you've been working out together all day sorry about that [Music] man i was freaking out the other day at dinner i thought my mom figured out we're training together well trunks bulma's one of the smartest people i know if we keep staying out late she'll eventually figure out what's going on yeah so what should we do well for starters we shouldn't train every day it might be best to incorporate some rest days into our routine it'll be good for our bodies and prevent bulma from worrying yeah that's a good idea let's do it now that i think about it it'll help me out too since i'm probably worrying my own mom and grandpa oh yeah i've been wondering about chichi and the ox king have you seen them recently how are they doing actually you know i haven't been back home since i started fighting the androids on my own so uh i'm not really sure oh okay every time i'd come back beaten up and broken from a fight with the androids my mom would go crazy on me she'd yell at me and tell me not to fight him but i can't stop fighting i have to avenge everyone the androids killed and i have to protect this planet that's what dad would have done go on but honestly i am worried about how my mom and grandpa are doing look at me i guess i'm just as much a warrior as my mom anyway enough about me and my family let's call it a day all right okay see you later maybe i should go check on chichi and the ox king for gohan [Music] time to head to chi-chi's place i remember hearing chi-chi used to be a martial artist i wonder if she's still as strong as she used to be [Music] i heard the ox king used to be scary a long time ago i wonder if that's true [Music] they look simple enough to beat my mom's known gohan's family for a long time thank you [Music] mom's still toiling away in her lab [Music] hmm hmm um [Music] [Applause] actually [Music] um [Music] thanks all right [Music] so this capsule's got supplies in it better hurry and deliver it [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] free i hear everyone's living in the submarine now hi minnie thanks [Music] cheers true [Music] hey [Music] right true huh hmm yep hmm very well huh oh [Music] yep um [Music] yep sure right now that the supplies have been delivered time to report back to mom [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] uh [Music] um [Music] sure okay true hmm huh what [Music] wait the androids made a real mess of this place please please let everyone be safe [Music] they look simple enough to beat they look simple enough to beat yeah what [Music] nope [Music] what [Music] jeez [Music] [Music] oh [Music] idiots yes let's go let's go stop you're done [Music] [Music] idiots look alive look huh take this let's go stop you're done idiots take this look alive [Applause] [Music] wow [Music] give me a break hey hey [Music] um jeez [Music] hey huh [Music] huh what in the world no surprise here [Music] jeez yeah [Music] [Applause] nope [Music] yep huh yep [Music] hey hmm yep [Music] sure [Music] thank you for the encouragement master roshi i swear i'll stop the androids one more is that him need to hurry have to hurry [Music] huh what's all that noise what is that something's attacking chi-chi not good i need to help her get back your mechanical meanies leave me alone chi-chi watch out trunks is that you yeah what's with these robots i'm not sure they came out of nowhere and started attacking me okay leave this to me you go find a safe place to hide no i can't leave you to fight these things i'll be fine don't worry i'm a lot stronger than i look looks like these things attack anything that moves all right bring it on you're nothing compared to the androids i think my training with gohan is starting to pay off [Music] that's all of them i hope chichi's okay [Music] chi-chi are you hurt no i'm fine although i totally could have handled those buckets of bolts on my own glad to see you're still full of energy yeah i might not look like it but i've still got some fight left in me i am glad you shut up thanks trunks it was no problem what were you up to me no i was just on my way back from checking on the fields cool i'll escort you back to your house then just in case any more of those robots show up really well then escort away mr bodyguard yes ma'am [Music] trunks my boy i really appreciate you saving chi chi you know you'd make vegeta proud oh it was nothing nothing no need to be so modest trunks you fought just like my gohan when he was little really oh that reminds me i heard you were out there helping gohan fight those awful androids you did not good not good how did he hear about that if he knows then my mom might find out well you shouldn't believe everything you hear you know oh so you're not well i guess that's good right those androids are way too dangerous for a kid like you to fight i don't even like gohan fighting them he was going to be a world-class scholar when he got older i know how you feel gg but gohan's made up his mind he's our boy and we should trust him we just have to hope he stays safe gohan doesn't fight because he wants to but because he has to and he's still thinking and worrying about you [Music] at least that's what i think you're right anyway if you see him would you please tell him to keep fighting but to try to come home like every once in a while i will okay well i'd better head back now stay safe you two thanks give my regards to bulma okay have a safe trip back home thanks oh uh could you maybe not tell my mom what you heard about me helping gohan fight the androids it'll just stress her out [Music] of course [Music] i should let gohan know how chi-chi and the ox king are doing i wonder if gohan's where we were before [Music] foreign i knew chichi be worried about gohan i need to make sure my mom doesn't find out what i'm up to they look simple enough to beat [Music] gohan oh hey trunks i thought you went back home for the rest of the day actually i was just visiting your mom and grandpa at their place oh really why would you do that you said you were worried so i went and checked on them there was a small issue but they're okay small issue yeah some weird machines were attacking your mom but i took care of them really oh no is my mom okay yeah not a scratch on her that's a relief thanks a lot trunks seriously if you hadn't been there there's no telling what might have happened um chichi wanted me to tell you something she said keep fighting but try to make it home once in a while oh uh i can't go right now obviously but i guess i'd better start making regular trips back to make sure she's doing okay she'd like that right speaking of family you'd better head back yourself before bulma starts worrying true see you later [Music] if i really want to put everyone at ease i need to defeat the androids and bring peace back to this world the area around west city suffered numerous casualties today as the androids continued their rampage residents in nearby areas have been ordered to evacuate immediately um chichi wanted me to tell you something she said keep fighting but try to make it home once in a while mom just hang on a bit longer i promise i'll come back once the androids are gone the next day trunks and gohan continue their training with a new resolve right let's begin the training what are we gonna do today another sparring match we can and we'll do that but i think we need to focus on making you a super saiyan so let's start there i'm sorry this isn't going well i don't think i can become a super saiyan today it's not supposed to be easy don't worry we'll take our time with it okay that explosion it has to be the androids i cannot let them destroy another town then let's go gohan no trunks still can't transform into a super saiyan he's not ready for this fight yet i'll be back you stay here wait gohan i can go with you and help you fight you're still not ready to take them on just stay here for now but like any help would be better than nothing right gohan fine but try to keep up okay and don't push it if you think it's too much thanks [Music] let's go if we don't hurry people are gonna die right those androids are going to pay there is only some way of knowing where they are hard to do that when we can't detect their energy we're gonna have to hunt them down the hard way that's enough androids how could you monsters do this oh great you guys again what a drag let's get rid of them so we can keep having some fun there are tons of other far more interesting people left to kill i'm not gonna let you do that go on let me help you fight them fine you can be my support but try not to put yourself directly in harm's way okay i'm more than enough to handle these losers on my own try to make it snappy okay we've got places to be one slip up and work done for you need to be careful trunks right give it a rest already ah gohan how much longer you planning to keep this silly game up after all you're just gonna die like the rest of your loser friends and family give it up already you have to realize you're just delaying the inevitable shut up i won't let piccolo krillin and everyone else's death be for nothing they and the rest of the planet are counting on me it's it's because of them that i could do this go on guess we have no other choice but to show you just how far out of our league you are [Music] here i got how long are you gonna keep babysitting the brat a huge letdown as usual you're gonna be in real trouble if you don't start taking us more seriously yeah i'm gonna beat you [Music] here we go [Music] uh [Music] if you think we're actually trying and you're in for a big surprise then fight us for real we're not gonna lose let's see from this let's see [Music] [Applause] [Music] go by you [Music] i've trained long and hard to avenge those you've killed [Music] [Applause] hmm [Music] [Music] provide you that much way to go that was amazing gohan it's not over yet stay focused get out of here [Music] what we're doing it we're winning gohan not yet there's still a long way to go before they're done trunks [Applause] you thought you were winning give me a break it's lights out for you guys well would you look at that at least they're good at running away they're pretty nimble for a couple of meat bags [Music] wherever you're hiding we'll find you [Music] so you think we got him 18 yeah they're dead but even if they are alive we'll find them come on 17. let's get out of here okay sure [Music] this is my last senzu bean trunks you take it you're our last hope trunks the androids they're gone no gohan eat your arm go on gohan good you're still breathing you're gonna be okay we need to get you home this is bad the androids are too strong i'm only getting in gohan's way several days later though gohan had lost an arm he was spared the same fate as the others after a miraculous recovery he had regained the strength and determination needed to fight once more trunks on the other hand felt responsible for gohan's injury and struggled to find the courage to face his mentor oh you seem out of it trunks yeah i know you were trying to keep it a secret from me but i know all about your training sessions with gohan i'm sorry mom you used to head over to gohan's place to train right you haven't been there in a while it's because of me that gohan that he how am i supposed to face him it wasn't your fault trunks i know that and more importantly i'm sure gohan knows that you'll feel a lot better if you just go see him and and tell him how you're feeling trust me i guess you're right i'll head over there now good be careful okay [Music] i'm sure gohan's feeling better and can move around and stuff but he probably can't do much training anymore [Music] the androids made a real mess of this place [Music] i bet his arm would be a lot better if he'd been able to eat a senzu bean they look simple enough to beat good you're here let's get started with huh what's with the long face [Music] go on your arm are you okay yeah it's gonna take some getting used to though oh i get it so that's why you seem so upset trunks i'm really sorry don't worry about it man it's in the past so no use thinking about it now besides i'm just grateful i only lost an arm but okay if your head's not completely in this then this is no time to be training no i can still train with you relax it's okay sometimes a warrior has to refocus you know what i've got an idea what do you say we go catch us some fish sound good uh okay [Music] you want to go fishing where exactly right that should be a good spot for us come to think of it i don't think i've ever gone fishing with anyone before you know how to fish trunks yeah i think so while we're here how about a little competition the one who catches the most fish wins what no way hmm wait a sec i definitely can't beat you in a fight but i think i might actually be able to beat you in a fishing competition good then that settles it don't let me down trunks i'm ready for you i'm not gonna lose let's see where should i fish first seems gohan's already looking for a spot [Music] this looks like a keeper [Music] so [Music] this looks like a keeper so all right i did it i wonder how gohan's [Music] doing wow you caught a lot go on [Music] let's count them up huh i think you caught more all right i beat you i beat you way to go trunks you might be a better fisherman than my dad so what should we do with all the fish i don't know about you but i'm pretty hungry let's cook them [Music] i think i ate too much we did fish up a lot didn't we yeah we sure did is something wrong no just glad to see you're back to your old self oh thanks you went out of your way to make me feel better sorry if i worried you i didn't go out of my way at all think of this as just another part of your training uh-huh you mean catching fish and eating them totally it's part of the turtle school teachings the ones my dad learned from master roshi according to him you should be moving learning playing eating and resting every day he'd always say that enjoying life is part of one's training too oh okay that sounds like good advice training you makes me nostalgic it takes me back to a time when piccolo trained me when i was a kid back then though i thought i was training with a monster he was so ruthless seriously it felt like a year and a half of pure torture actually if i remember correctly i was training to help save earth from vegeta and the other saiyan jerk napa that came with him seriously you had to go through all of that because of my father i'm so sorry [Music] you know it is pretty strange to think i'm training the son of a guy who once tried to destroy the planet a long time before he trained me piccolo supposedly fought my dad as his mortal enemy weird how fate works isn't it yeah it brings people together like us exactly and all of those people my dad yours and everyone else they live on in you now trunks go on [Music] that's why it's so important that you stay alive and i'll keep training you to make sure you stay that way if anyone's gonna bring peace it's you you're our last hope don't worry you'll surpass me in no time [Music] i promise i won't let you down [Music] good we'll get stronger together and we'll make sure our world is safe again right trunks right piccolo sacrificed himself to protect me back then i was too young to understand but now i know what he felt in that moment you're the last warrior alive who can do this trunks it's all up to you i'm afraid you're our last hope the people of this world are going to count on you to protect them when the time comes but i believe in you with all of my heart you can do this trunks a few days later trunks and gohan's training reaches a fever pitch get angry angrier no why can't i turn into a super saiyan you're almost there trunks it's not easy my dad and i struggle to become super saiyans too it's like i said before rage triggers the transformation true rage thinking about piccolo krillin and everyone else dying i was devastated with grief it upset me so much that i was overcome with anger and it was then that i became a super saiyan you've got vegeta's royal saiyan blood coursing through your veins you're going to become a super saiyan i know it believe in yourself if you say so all right that's enough super saiyan training for now let's far okay let's do it come at me with all you've got right you can't fight me while i'm at a disadvantage but you've got no hope of beating the androids i know you're holding back on me aren't you no i'm not i swear i'm not that injured why would you even need to hold back understand right if you really get it then prove it go all out sure good trunks that's how you do it i'm still not on your level [Music] is this your best your defense needs a lot of work watch your opponent [Music] carefully coming at you full force well done that was great thank you [Music] you're a lot stronger than you were before yeah if only i could become a super saiyan though you will you just need something to help trigger the transformation the city it's the androids they finally found their way here this is it go on are you sure you're okay i'm worried i might not be able to keep trunks safe this time [Music] trunks stay here got it do not follow me no if you're going then i'm going to you said it yourself i'm a lot stronger now trunks you're underestimating how hard this fight will be i promise i won't drag you down i i want to help you fight them [Music] i get it fine trunks let's go okay [Music] trunks your humanity's last hope if both of us die then there won't be a single warrior left to protect the planet as the only one left who's capable of ending this nightmare in a few years time you have to survive [Music] i'm sorry trunks i might not be able to stop the androids but if you were around i'd be distracted as long as i know you're alive and safe i can give it my all [Music] [Music] [Music] and if i do fail you'll have what it takes to finish the job [Music] give it a rest would you seventeen we've already killed almost everyone here we should head somewhere where tons and tons of people are hiding it would be way more fun why are you in such a rush let's just try to enjoy ourselves if we wipe out all of humanity now then the fun ends and we've got nothing left to do right [Music] so gohan back for more huh [Music] no more running away we're gonna kill you this time [Music] i won't die even if you destroy my body i'll live on in someone who'll become stronger than me and he will be the one to stop you once and for all let's do this you freaks hey no need to get so worked up though we'll make this quick you humans sure do go down easy yeah we've grown tired of playing with you where's all the macho hero attitude gone [Music] [Music] i was hoping we could have at least a little more fun [Music] okay hey where's the little rut you brought last time ready to call it quits it's none of your business jerk you're weak extremely okay [Music] yes [Music] yes here i go what look a lot yes nowhere to go my senko we're done [Music] okay you're really putting in some work go ahead and mock me while you can [Music] goodness what you're done try to keep up okay [Applause] [Music] you're a real pain in the ass i'm going to finally win this world of you two what a pain in the ass there's [Music] what let's go [Music] [Music] oh [Music] okay [Music] damn you're done [Music] okay [Music] [Music] here i go what you're planning on winning all by your luncheon i'm more than enough to beat you yes [Music] you know that you're done give it up the only one who's done [Music] you here i go didn't we tell you we're gonna kill you this time you two are history you hear me [Music] [Music] job okay [Applause] [Music] where did he get all this power [Music] ah [Music] yes [Music] whoops psyche [Music] i feel awful for having to disappoint you like this but we've only been fighting at half our full power [Music] you're not going anywhere gohan [Music] energy come on you've gotta have more in you than that you gotta give up or what you should guess you don't have it in you to fight back anymore [Music] bring it on already you said you were going to defeat us right [Music] it's cute you're trying so hard this is your last chance to stand up to it come on go on all right i think it's time you finally died if you even can even if you beat me someone stronger [Music] well me huh [Music] ah now to survive you're our last hope go on i i can't sense him i can't sense his energy go on go on something's not right where are you gohan go on go on go on can you hear me this happened because i'm weak he was trying to protect me is that him come on go on no go on please no this can't be real gohan go on it's [Music] me [Music] trunks had finally become a super saiyan however the transformation came at a great cost three years have passed as the only warrior left to stand against the android menace trunks continued his training hoping to one day avenge gohan and the others holding on to hope end of the android apocalypse i'm back mom welcome home trunks how was your training you won't believe it i feel like i'm finally making some real headway i might actually be as strong as gohan was back then good you definitely look pretty confident but don't let your guard down right i know well you can never be too safe oh that's right it won't be much longer until the time machine is finished what kind of a response is that this is a time machine we're talking about a time machine i i know i'm really impressed with what you've done once it's ready to go you'll be able to head to the past and meet goku gohan's father you've probably heard of him and give him his heart medication with goku alive and able to fight something ought to change then you can head back to the moment when the androids arrive to help with the fight oh and gather some useful intel for me i can then use that information to figure out their weaknesses and exploit them here in our time but no matter how much i travel to the past our world won't go back to the way it was all the people we've lost they won't come back will they probably not no right that means my father and gohan will still be gone but i should be strong enough to stop the androids now i shouldn't have to go to the past oh that reminds me trunks there's something i need you to do for me really what's that something small should be a pretty simple thing remember how i told you the time machine's almost complete well i actually don't have enough of what i need for a super important really critical part could you help me out sure i can do that where can i find what you need mount pow zoo you know where chi chi's gohan's house is you know how to get there right oh yeah i do unfortunately i don't remember the exact spot where you can find the materials maybe try asking chichi or the ox king it's been a little while since i've seen them so i could see how they're doing while i'm at it good that's my boy if they need anything make sure to help them out okay sure oh i almost forgot here's what i need you to bring back for me thanks got it i'll see you later [Music] first i'd better go talk to chichi [Music] one [Music] one [Music] foreign four four [Music] one [Music] one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one [Music] hello it's me trunks trunks hold on just a sack [Music] well aren't you a sight for sore eyes what brings you here sorry it's been so long my mother needs my help with something do you have a minute sure we weren't really doing anything right now anyway isn't that right dad yeah the androids never show up here so we've got it pretty good at least not as bad as people in the cities oh okay i wanted to see if you guys were doing okay or if you needed anything nope we're okay glad to hear you were thinking about us though what about you you and bulma all right yeah my mother's actually working on something oh that's right she asked me to come here and help find something she needs i'm looking for this do you know where i can find it in this area [Music] hmm i have no idea what about you dad well uh let's see oh there is a place somewhere on this mountain but the thing is it's is there something i should know about it yeah some weird machines are wandering around the area nasty little thingamabobs they'll attack if you get too close i think they're old red ribbon army robots oh yeah chichi you were attacked by some robots before maybe they're the same type if we don't do something about them they might make their way here and attack you again i'll take them out while i look for what i need oh that'd be a huge help thank you oh no you don't digi i can't send you off somewhere where you could potentially get hurt if something were to happen to you i wouldn't hear the end of it from bulma she blamed me no doubt cheeky it's okay i can handle robots like that no problem after all gohan was the one who trained me besides i'll be careful you don't need to worry about me i promise once i'm done there i'll head right back [Music] okay fine if you're going to give me that look i guess i can't stop you but if you find yourself in trouble you get out of there got it right come straight back here if you need to of course okay then i'm off [Music] i suppose gohan did train him after all he even sounds just as confident as gohan [Music] i should take care of those red ribbon army robots before i look for the materials gigi seems to be doing okay but i can tell she's still having a hard time i need to finish what i came here to do so i can put chi-chi at ease that might be more than i can handle the red ribbon army sure did leave behind some real nasty machines so these are the things that have been giving chichi and the ox king some trouble they look like real pushovers compared to the androids i'll wipe them out in no time [Music] i don't have time to waste on these stupid things i can still fight [Music] i can [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right which one of you is next i can still fight [Music] take this that's all of it [Music] okay no more interruptions now i need to find what mom's looking for i should be able to find it around here hard to believe the time machine's almost finished i shouldn't have to go to the past i think i have what it takes to stop the androids now [Music] not that might be more than i can handle okay this is what mom was looking for time to head to chi-chi's place then home okay they look pretty weak [Music] chi chi ox king i was able to find what i was looking for i also took out those red ribbon army robots good i'm glad to see you're safe and that you got what you needed me too way to go trunks you're becoming quite the capable warrior have i told you you're like vegeta it's because of gohan and his training that i'm as strong as i am now and it's because of him that i'm even alive from well i'm sure gohan would be really happy to hear that if he were here while i am lonely without goku and gohan i've got my dad here to keep me company and bulma's got you doesn't she true at least we all have each other speaking of bulma you said she was working on something then again i guess she's always doing that huh [Music] you got that right actually this time she's working on a time machine that's why she needed what i came here to get did you say time machine wow that's a one heck of a thing to create i'm pretty sure bulma might be a genius or something she's going to have me use the time machine to go to the past that way i can give goku some medication to keep him from dying with goku alive we should be able to find a way to stop the androids well that's the plan at least wait so does that mean goku and gohan will come back to life probably not i don't think changing anything in the past will affect us here it's really unfortunate oh i see i'm really sorry i didn't mean to get your hopes up oh no it's it's okay if you can save goku in the past please do so at least past me won't be so depressed and i'd be a little jealous of her though yeah i'm with chichi on that one i understand i wish there was something i could do near sweet trunks you don't need to worry about us make sure you keep taking care of bulma okay be careful on your way back you're welcome here anytime oh and tell bulma i said hi okay thanks you two i'm off then with that taken care of it's time to head home [Music] ah [Music] i'm back mom this is what you needed right yep that's it oh now i've got what i need to finish the machine thanks so how are chichi and her dad doing they're fine but they still seem like they're struggling with gohan's death if i can find some time i should probably try to visit them occasionally right i'm sure they'd appreciate that it would be great to head to the past and help create a world where gohan and the others are still alive i sure wish i could at least take the androids out now and bring peace to our world sure that would certainly help us here but we don't have what it takes to pull that off right now that's why we need you to go to the past and save goku that'll hopefully change everything we need to help us here i mean better than letting the androids continue to toy with you right even if it is another world there should be a future without the android somewhere come on you gotta give it a shot you're right [Music] trunks i finally did it thanks to your help i was finally able to finish my work on the time machine really i should be able to charge up enough energy for a round trip pretty soon 20 years into the past ought to be possible this thing takes about eight months to charge so i can't really run any tests i think you'll still be good to make it back here safely though i would have been able to create a much more reliable machine if my lab hadn't been destroyed mom i think i'm strong enough to beat the androids now we won't have to risk a trip to the past oh trunks not this again i'm serious i'm confident i have what it takes now we interrupt this program to bring you breaking news on the android threat the androids have been spotted wreaking havoc in the vicinity of west city that's close wait a minute trunks don't you even think about it i'm heading over there i can't let them keep doing this trunks stop do not go fight them [Music] given my training i should be even stronger now than gohan was today's the day i avenge everyone they murdered the androids don't scare me anymore just you wait androids the struggle ends today i can't believe what they've done to the city there's no point traveling to the past if nothing here will change if i take out the androids now i won't have to go to the past okay they look pretty weak there they are finally even this town wasn't safe hey 17. i think we killed everyone here let's head back good call [Music] all right you monsters the killing stops today you're going to pay for what you did to gohan it's the brad again still hasn't learned his lesson huh you don't know when to give up i hate that [Music] it's been three years since you murdered gohan i've spent that time getting better so i can kill you i'm done hiding from you you two are finished better huh i hate to break it to you but it still won't be enough to stop us you're not very bright you really think you can win now not bad not bad i'll admit you are a tiny bit better than before when you said you were better all that talk of duties and this is what you brought to the fight you sound like you're out of breath getting tired huh [Music] is there's nowhere to [Music] is [Music] i know you were trying to settle the score but looks like that it will happen just you wait i'm going to stop you too no not bad this is [Music] [Music] we'll make sure you know just how terrifying we are looks like you're still all talk at this point [Music] there's nowhere what take this [Music] is [Music] is [Music] take this what is it right [Music] yeah but he's still just a cocky little brat you won't be so confident for much longer [Music] is [Music] [Music] idiots man you're stubborn i'm going to keep fighting until i feed [Music] what [Music] yes much longer not much longer until i get my revenge stop acting like you're winning it's [Music] choke on this [Music] it's over [Music] how's that i did it i finally did it what i'll give you a little credit you are actually stronger but your attacks are too predictable you're just gonna tire yourself out little guy [Music] no this can't be happening what where where'd they go why why are you doing this to us well dr gero created us to help him take over the world but honestly we couldn't care less about that we can't stand looking at you people we just hate you it's that simple that's why you're killing us you have to be stopped [Music] i'm an idiot i wasn't strong enough on my own the androids are far too strong gohan's dead and i learned nothing from his death i guess i guess i have to use the time machine to go to the past [Music] though critically wounded trunks managed to survive and in five days time he awakened his fight made him acutely aware of his shortcomings so he decided to take bulma's advice and travel to the past [Music] all set [Music] remember you absolutely have to give goku his heart medication and be careful okay right you too mom i'm counting on you trunks okay wish me luck and so trunks journeyed to the past dispatching frieza and his men with ease and meeting a younger vegeta and bulma as well as their friends shortly thereafter goku arrived on earth trunks informed him of the events set to take place in three years time and gave him the heart medication still hopeful his actions in the past would improve his world trunks made his way back to his mother in the future [Music] i'm back mom welcome home trunks the time machine hold up okay yeah i was able to meet goku and give him the medication oh that's a relief i wasn't able to run any tests on the machine so i was worried it might malfunction then again a genius like me doesn't make mistakes [Laughter] so did you happen to meet anyone else i did i met a younger you and gohan as well as krillin and father too of course oh you met a younger me well what did you think i was a looker wasn't i i mean that hasn't changed of course yeah she trusted me right away i'm guessing it's because she sensed some sort of connection with me huh yeah maybe that's what it was yeah right i didn't have much of a choice so you said you meant vegeta huh he was a real pain i bet he gave you one heck of a hard time yeah i i wouldn't say he was a pain but he was definitely intimidating i could tell he had a strong sense of pride yeah that's him he was pretty standoffish so i didn't get to talk to him much which is good i guess i couldn't let him find out who i am but i was glad i finally got to meet him maybe it's for the best you two didn't talk much who knows you might have ended up regretting meeting him back then he was different so he really was a difficult person then uh kind of but he wasn't always so cold to everyone you know oh yeah i'm sure i would have learned that if i'd had more time with him anyway all that's left to do is wait for the androids to show up there and go provide support i wonder how goku and the others are going to fight the androids i hope they can find a way to beat them okay i'll start getting the time machine in working order again and charge up some energy for another round trip it'll take some time though so make sure you're good and ready for the trip right will do [Music] i'll use the time it takes to charge up the machine to train myself up for the fight ahead it'd be nice if the time machine finished charging sometime soon are you good to go the machine still needs a bit of time to charge so just hold tight okay [Music] the machine's finally got enough energy for another round trip now you can go back and help the others i hope they're all safe i'm sure they are maybe they've already defeated the androids and brought peace back to the world if that's the case it might be nice to bring the others back here with me the time machine only has room for one person but i can totally see the others cramming their way in anyway goku would jump at the chance to take on more powerful opponents you're right based on what i saw of him he would probably be excited to come here but if they haven't defeated the androids you're planning on joining in on the fight aren't you just be careful okay don't get yourself killed i won't and you stay safe too mom i'll make it back in one piece i can't rest until our world is at peace [Music] too [Music] and so trunks made his way back to the past little did he realize that waiting for him there were two completely different androids as well as less ruthless but still dangerous androids 17 and 18. and to make matters worse cell a bioandroid far deadlier than the other androids had appeared and threatened all life on earth but thanks to goku and the others training as well as gohan's transformation into something beyond that of a super saiyan cell was defeated with peace now restored in the past trunks returns to the future more experienced and determined to save his world mom i'm back welcome home trunks wait just a minute look at you they say kids grow up fast but this is ridiculous i trained in a special place called the hyperbolic time chamber it's on kami's lookout one year inside is only a day on the outside not really sure how that works but at any rate i'm just glad you're back and doing okay so did everything work out that look on your face tells me it did it did oh so goku still ended up dying in the end well at least gohan was able to avenge him yeah oh and you were right about father he wasn't just a cold-hearted person after all huh when i first saw him fight i honestly thought he was just a ruthless selfish person you know what i mean if you and baby me were ever in danger he didn't try to save us all he cared about was his opponent oh vegeta can't say i'm all that surprised though [Music] but during the year me and him trained together he was more focused on the moment he was tough on himself and even seemed a little lonely right now that i think about it he could be like that at times he wouldn't spar with me at first but eventually he grew to acknowledge my power we would have serious sparring matches and sometimes even conversations conversations about what um well i say conversations but it was really just me talking to him not with him he would only reply with i see or the conversations never really went anywhere jeez that's vegeta for you but right as our training was coming to an end trunks tells bulma of his time in the past specifically when cell eager to increase his power began draining the population of their energy nearly a year inside the hyperbolic time chamber had passed since vegeta and trunks first entered and began their training to defeat cell [Music] come at me at full power okay father here i go [Music] i shouldn't have to say this but do not hold back i won't [Music] is it's still not enough are you talking about yourself or about me just shut up and fight [Music] i guess you've gotten a little better not compared to you the water you barely leave yourself open that your best you're mocking me aren't you i can keep going damn it how can i let myself get hit by that this is everything i've got [Music] take this very well that should be enough for now but i'm still a far cry where i should be you even more so father [Music] you know it's almost been a year since we started our training we should probably get ready to give the room to goku and gohan no not until i achieve the absolute power i deserve i intend to use every second we've got in here but you've already broken the super saiyan barrier are you trying to push yourself even further if i plan on destroying cell and finally putting kakarot in his place then i need to be stronger i'm not going to get through to him at this point he won't stop training until he's the one who's satisfied [Music] father is surpassing goku more important to you than defeating cell you've got it a bit wrong what i want is simply to be number one kakarot just happens to be an obstacle between me and my rightful place at the top and what's worse is that he's a saiyan like me trunks has a proud say in yourself you should never set limits on the power you can attain you should always strive to be the best but know this as long as i'm around you're going to have fierce competition father this might actually be the first time he's given me fatherly advice if you can call it that this obsession with power goku loves to fight powerful enemies too [Music] maybe it's a pure-blooded saiyan thing in my world all i could think about was defeating the androids restoring peace was more important to me than the pursuit of strength you said that gohan was the only one who trained you right he's just as soft and naive as kakarot no he's not what's even more concerning though is that i was killed by the androids in your time so easily me the prince of the saiyans huh don't be satisfied with simply beating the androids and restoring peace those are short-sighted goals at best i'm going to push myself harder and i won't stop until i am number one if you do the same and you aim for something better i'm sure you'll have no problem with the androids father you're right i'll do what i can i see so that's what he told you why does he have to encourage him in such a roundabout way i actually tried talking to him about other things too but when i asked him when he started to develop feelings for you he got really angry and told me to stop asking dumb questions also in the fight with cell he got really angry when cell killed me what did i tell you i told you he wasn't that bad yeah wow was that really my vegeta i never knew he had that side to him oh what a relief i'm glad to hear things ended well over there i'm relief too looks like going to the past was a good call the past may be at peace now but our world here is still in turmoil because of android 17 and 18. i can't let them get away with this anymore [Music] we interrupt this program to bring you news on the android crisis android 17 and 18 are currently laying waste the androids this ends today i'll be back mom trunks are you sure you can do this i'll be fine this is the whole reason i went back in time and met goku gohan my father and the others [Music] the past has its peace now we deserve our own be careful trunks please don't get yourself killed of course and this is it i can finally avenge gohan and the others [Music] [Music] huh [Music] look at you you're throwing a little temper tantrum because you lost the game shut the hell up i don't want to hear a peep from you 17 18. this is it this is the day you finally pay for what you've done trunks so you're alive huh makes sense i guess you always were a little too dumb to give up 17 i'm in a really bad mood i know you want to mess with him but i'm just going to kill him right now cause he's annoying as hell it won't be as fun without him around but sure okay go for it 18. this has gone on far too long ever since you two first appeared every day has been like hell as we struggled to survive so what's your point the versions of you i met when i traveled to the past were actually kind of nice but here you've done nothing but destroy towns and cities and murder countless people you're gonna pay for it [Music] oh my god would you shut up let's do this what the hell why am i struggling like this i'm not like i was when you fought me before look alive [Music] now you're really asking for it you still haven't suffered nearly as much as we have this is it [Music] suffer suffer for all the pain you caused [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] god what fighting you is child's play i'm gonna make sure you don't survive this time wow 18 you're getting kind of sloppy damn it i've had enough of this little punk i'll take both of you on at the same time what's going on something's different about him let's do this you two are finally going to meet your end you hear me you're crazy if you think that's gonna happen let's kill him seventeen [Music] yes that was all just talk earlier you're still the same brat you've always been well you finally get what it's like to suffer like your victims uh suffer are you serious don't let him get to you 17 there's no way he can beat us [Music] you're gonna die just like the rest what what's with this power this is goku's gohans my father's power what your father's power what the hell are you even talking about [Music] [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] is this is for all the people you've tortured enough about the people you're really pissing me off you're gonna die just like the rest let's see you gotta run away from this get out of here take this [Music] [Music] this is it get out of here okay so you're a bit stronger starting to lose your confidence aren't you not bad now we'll fight you [Music] now it's time to pay you back for everything you've done now for the finish here it's over we're at full power damn it how is he stronger than us you finally get it but it's too late what [Music] [Applause] huh it's over that was for the friends of mine you killed and this this is for gohan [Music] you're finished [Applause] [Music] yes it's over i finally did it everyone wait not yet there's still one thing left just over three years later with 17 and 18 gone people have begun to rebuild cities and towns that were ravaged by the androids trunks was eager to inform those in the past of his success so with the time machine fully charged he prepared for another trip all right mom i'm off have a safe trip trunks tell everyone i said hi sure you need to leave mom head somewhere safe huh oh okay i know you're over there sell what you plan on killing me then traveling to the past to absorb android 17 and 18 and obtain your perfect form how how could you possibly know that your plan's going to fail because i'm going to finish you off once and for all my plan's going to fail is it's well you're awfully cocky [Music] cell your perfect form was insanely strong there's no doubt about that but as you are now i'm more than enough to destroy you oh i get it so you went back to the past i see that's why you know so much such a sneaky guy but i have to say i'm surprised to hear you say you can destroy me trunks i have plenty of data on you thanks to my spy robots [Music] you idiots you don't have enough power to lay a finger on android 17 and 18 let alone me pathetic oh then why aren't 17 and 18 around anymore what impossible so you're the reason the two of them are gone it's because of you we're not fighting here in west city people have worked too hard to rebuild i'm taking this fight somewhere else [Music] cell i'm going to defeat you and put an end to all of this [Music] [Music] [Music] so he hasn't transformed yet this is my chance i can't let him travel to the past okay they look pretty weak there you are you may be a bit stronger than before but if you think you can beat me well you're kidding yourself you're weak i'm going to make sure you don't go to the past [Music] you pathetic child [Music] i am the ultimate angel created by the great doctor gero it's scientifically impossible for anyone to best me we'll see once i kill you i'll head to the past and achieve my perfect not on my watch this world's been through enough hell this ends now you're about to learn the hard way just how much stronger i am i on the other hand know everything about give it up cell you're done what what are you talking about damn you for robbing me of android 17 and 18 i deserve perfection i just gave them a taste of the pain they loved inflicting on us [Music] you're just a pathetic child go ahead and act tough while you still [Music] can't [Music] a human like you is no match for a superior being like me well this human is going to beat you if i had achieved perfection you would be nothing to me nothing sorry but you're never getting your perfect form this world's finally at peace and i intend to keep it that way [Music] lose to a plot like you dammit i'll leave on my eyes of power no i have to stop you to save earth [Music] yes [Music] ultimate i have it's over it's over [Music] what you give me no choice this move should be familiar ah me ha me flat cell you don't belong in this world it's over that's the final loose end thanks everyone trunks are you okay yeah i'm fine now i have even more good news to share with everyone they're gone gohan the androids are finally gone and i promise to make sure the piece you and all the others fought for lasts as long as possible trunks long hard-fought struggle with the menacing androids had finally come to an end no more would humanity live in fear now the people of earth would know true peace and as long as trunks is able to fight this newfound peace will surely last a few years have passed since trunks defeat of cell the survivors of the android onslaught have continued to rebuild their towns and cities and their lives have finally returned to normal now free from the fight for survival trunks also spends his days living a peaceful life with bulma where to next [Music] mom still hold up here [Music] ah [Music] what [Music] all right i'm gonna go on another patrol now i want to see if chichi master roshi and the others are okay you're calling them patrols now huh you know things have gone back to normal you should try to relax more i know nothing major has happened since i defeated the androids but i still feel like we should be on our guard fair enough well good luck on your patrol then be careful okay right be back later let's see where should i start hello there [Music] uh huh uh oh hello well now you certainly do seem to possess a good spirit spirit future freedom fighter trunks the warrior of hope i don't know what it is but there's something something different about this guy just who is he he's floating [Music] there's no need to be surprised after all you can do this too can't you trunks who are you how do you know my name you you're you're not an android are you why you insolent little do you have any idea who this is he occupies a position higher than that of even the kai's he is none other than the supreme kai wait higher than the kai's supreme kai i don't know what any of that means but are you trying to say he's a guardian or something no not exactly it would take a great deal of time to explain but all you need to know at this point is that i stand above the beings who govern this universe right i see this gentleman here is my attendant kabito hello he doesn't seem that friendly we're here to inform you that earth no indeed the entire universe is in grave danger the entire universe hold on what are you talking about what do you mean your reaction comes as no surprise allow me to explain everything as best i can a great evil is on the verge of awakening from a deep slumber a terrible creature that once threatened all of existence he is capable of destroying hundreds of worlds in just a few years time this being is known as [Music] he sounds terrifying the person responsible for majin buu's creation the evil wizard bibbidi planned to attack earth and brought the orb in which buu is sealed with boos sealed away we were able to defeat bibbidi but we left the orb where it was fearing we'd accidentally break it unfortunately bibbidi had a son another evil wizard known as bobody who aims to break boo's seal and unleash him upon the world he'll no doubt revive buu fulfill his father's wish of laying waste to this planet then move on to other worlds [Music] that sounds awful indeed that is precisely why we are here we need your power to stop bobbity your super saiyan ability will be of great use whoa you know a lot about me so this wizard bobbity you mentioned is he really that strong bobbidy himself is frail and poses no real physical threat however his deadliness lies in the strange magic he wields making him a difficult foe he is capable of controlling the minds of the evil and covetous bobbidy uses this sinister technique to afford himself a large number of loyal minions who do his bidding magic i don't think i've ever fought anyone who uses magic in order to prepare you for the fight ahead we'll need you to join us in the land of the kais and learn to wield a sword of legend a sword of legend yes in the sacred land of the kais where we'd like you to follow us i see i'm not sure how much help i can be but if it's to defend peace i'll join you but before i do please give me some time to speak with my mother and take care of a few things is that okay understood once you're prepared to leave please come speak to me again trunks you're back already did you forget something mom something's come up and i don't think i'll be able to come home for a while huh do you think you'll be gone for long i'm not entirely sure but don't worry i promise i'll come back [Music] i understand try not to get yourself into trouble okay right wish me luck [Music] so the universe is in danger it doesn't really feel like it right now but it sounds pretty bad [Music] the city's looking more like its old self it would be unwise to keep the supreme kai waiting right this guy's kind of scary [Music] have you accomplished all that you needed to ready to travel to the land of the kai's yes i'm ready to leave i'm very glad to hear that trunks [Music] so uh how do we get to the land of the kais kabito here will be taking us to the sacred land now then kabito if you would be so kind supreme kai i must admit that i'm uneasy about letting a mortal step foot in such a sacred place but if you command it i'm getting the feeling this guy doesn't like me now stand by my side uh okay okay we're off hi kate [Music] what is this instant transmission indeed it's a special technique of kibidos welcome to the sacred land of the kai's trunks so this is the land of the kais it kind of looks like earth this place is a holy world which not only mortals but even the kais and other gods themselves are not permitted to enter you should feel honored oh i see that mortal outfit of yours does a disservice to this esteemed world huh [Music] wow it suits you trunks you really think so it's kind of hard to move in this [Music] now then allow me to once again explain why we've asked you to come here as i mentioned to you back on earth we will have you learn to wield the legendary sword of this land that is none other than the z sword a legendary weapon that has never been wielded before you mean no one's ever used it before then how am i supposed to learn to use it first let's have you take a look at what we're talking about follow me [Music] this blade thrust into the ground here is the z sword to the best of my knowledge no one has been able to remove the blade from its rocky prison okay so that's what you meant by never been wielded so how will this sword help us once it's out is its blade extremely sharp or something legends say you will be imbued with immense power perhaps even enough to destroy the infamous majin buu for eons this has remained neither i nor countless other supreme kai's could remove this remarkable sword so as a mortal you will most certainly fail well i guess we'll just have to see for ourselves here goes [Music] ah damn it won't budge okay let's try this oh my this is what a super saiyan can do what incredible power you have how could a mere mortal possess this [Music] it's no use several supreme kai's before you have tried and failed to remove it there's no chance you could ever succeed he did it what [Music] i i don't believe this tell us trunks how does it feel to wield the legendary z sword i've been fighting with a sword for a long time but this this sword doesn't really feel all that special is that so perhaps if you spend more time with the blade you can eventually draw out its latent power well he should familiarize himself with the sword in combat indeed wait wait a minute this sword is extremely heavy yeah i don't think i'll be able to fight using this thing could we maybe hold off on the training i need some time to get used to wielding it what such a disrespectful request wait kabito trunks is well within reason to request that much it might be prudent for him to get comfortable with the blade first very well see to it you do not put off your training for long right seems kibito has taken on the role of instructor here wow i am truly at a loss for words i never imagined you'd be able to so freely wield the z sword in such a short amount of time a most impressive feat it took some effort but i think i can wield it like any other sword now supreme kai should we perhaps move on to the training at this juncture i think we can what do you think trunks so what exactly are we going to do for the training am i just going to spar with you kabito hmm that should suffice let's begin wait i think i'd like to gauge trunks ability and his technique with the z sword what do you think what you want to fight me yourself right i'm sorry but you the supreme kai intend to fight it'll be fine in fact i'm quite looking forward to the fight after all we'll get to learn more about trunks and the z sword itself understood if that's how you feel then it would be an honor to fight you now please don't hold anything back [Music] okay time to put the z sword to the test here i come good i want to properly gauge your power feels like forever since i fought with a sword i think you're doing quite well [Music] it [Music] there's still more where that came from just you wait [Music] is [Music] what [Music] what's the matter are you going easy on me well maybe a little since you're a god but i'm going full power now supreme kai how's this this this is unbelievable take this i never imagined you possessed this much power and once i mastered this sword i should be even stronger [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's leave your training here for now shall we i'm afraid i won't be able to keep up much longer [Music] magnificent your power and abilities far exceed anything we could have imagined i'm confident our decision to choose you was the right one trunks uh thank you but i still don't feel much power coming from the sword hmm perhaps you still need more practice hopefully something will change if we give it more time trunks your training is showing results you the wielder of the z sword should have what it takes to draw out the blade's power all right i'll do what i can actually given what i was able to glean from our sparring match it seems we aren't suitable training partners for you we've underestimated you in a good way someone of your caliber deserves stronger opponents that means a lot coming from someone like you you'll no doubt get much more out of your training if you're up against someone much stronger yeah i guess you're right as it stands now there is no one in this land any stronger than we are if fighting with us is not sufficient for your purposes then you will have to train within your own mind there you should be able to conjure any sort of powerful opponent and reflect on their technique however that sort of exercise has its limits okay hmm that's it that's exactly it kibito what what do you mean i'll peer into your mind then take whomever you envision and project them back more clearly into your mind if all goes well it should appear as though that person is actually right in front of you wow that's amazing a wonderful idea supreme kai you've outdone yourself again well shall we get started then just go ahead and imagine someone with whom you'd like to spar [Music] a training partner huh someone really strong would be the most effective for improving as a fighter so have you thought of a good training partner [Music] i can't really think of anyone right now not a problem if someone happens to come so have you thought of a good training partner yes i'm ready the strong person i'd like to fight is him [Music] wow it's gohan it's really him [Music] now then trunks try to remember how this person fought and spar with him sure i'll see what i can do incredible he's just as powerful as he was when i saw him fight back then [Music] take this [Music] all right i'm starting to get the hang of this [Music] so this is gohan's power [Music] time to show gohan how much better i've [Music] gotten i don't think i would have been able to fight like this back then i've gotten a lot better [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign can't let my guard down with gohan [Music] [Music] huh i did it thanks for the help gohan it seems your training session was much more productive than when you fought me kabito and i weren't able to draw out any of the power you just displayed oh no problem you were a big help supreme kai i wouldn't have been able to spar with gohan like that if it wasn't for you this gohan you imagined he appeared to be a child what sort of person was he exactly in this world he was my master but in another world he was the one who saved earth unfortunately the gohan in this world has long since passed away if it weren't for him i wouldn't be here and our world would still be in turmoil i want to be strong like him in fact i need to be even stronger than he was i see while it is certainly a shame that gohan can't be here with us i'm grateful we have you as this world's next savior we know the entire universe are counting on you you're our last hope last hope what a strange coincidence gohan actually said the same thing to me before he died oh it's no coincidence gohan was right to place his faith in you and i will do the same trunks well done trunks it seems you've truly mastered your technique with the z sword thanks to you supreme kai i wouldn't have been able to make this much progress on my own seriously if i'm being honest though i feel like i've really only gotten an arm workout out of this to think that the first to properly wield the z sword would be nothing more than a simple mortal how strange now then trunks let's finish up your training this here is caching said to be the hardest metal in the universe go ahead and try to slice it with the z sword you got it okay throw it when you're ready [Music] supreme kai it's bobbidy it has started he's begun to make a move on earth what the time has finally come let's make our way back to earth trunks as long as you have the z sword you should be able to stop majin buu's revival right uh oh um could you give me my old clothes back before we leave well i think you look quite nice in those but very well kibito if you would as you wish supreme [Music] kai [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you very much i feel more like myself in these clothes now then to earth [Music] cry kite [Music] this energy what is this evil energy this power it's unbelievable is this majin buu's energy no majin buu hasn't been released yet this energy most likely belongs to bobady and his minions but it's only a matter of time before they release majin buu we have to stop them before they can do that i've never felt energy this wicked we have to stop bobbity and his minions okay they look pretty weak those no neither of them are bobbidy company [Music] there is absolutely no way we're letting you get past the two of us be on your guard both of them are under the control of bobbity's mind magic what supreme kai that creature is that the demon beast yakon i can't believe bobbity has that kind of creature on his side demon beast yacon that's right he's an unbelievably powerful creature feared the universe over as i mentioned before bobbity uses his magic to control and assemble strong fighters they're very dangerous okay understood don't worry supreme kai i'll take care of them on my own with the training i've received from you as well as the power of the z sword i should be able to defeat them the trunks wait if i can't manage to take care of these two i can't expect to survive the fight ahead oh and also i'm itching to put all of that training to the test supreme kai i understand we'll place our trust in you trunks [Music] look at this you want to take us on all by your lonesome we're lord bobbidy's he'll eat you know you're in real trouble now [Music] i'll cut you to pieces let's do this [Music] first i'm going to defeat you two and then i'm gonna take out bobbity what an idiot here who thinks he's going to beat us i have to beat these two and fast i don't have time to waste on them you won't stand in our way damn then start fighting harder [Music] how is he faster than me is this it was that just talk before yes it comes enough this isn't bad i would have no problem in the dark a change of scenery wouldn't change the outcome you're going to lose no matter what hey that wasn't half bad just now it'll be a lot less painful if you just surrender you're both going down you're there's no way you can beat me okay detroit's lord bobbidy's going to give us your flesh i did it now on to bobby what what what's so funny [Music] you idiot as we speak lord bobbitt is already reviving martian boo what what what do you mean done for what hmm supreme kai i can sense a wicked energy in another location how did we not notice it before these two they increased their own evil energy to distract us no they intended to stall us and we fell right into their trap be that as it may i don't sense majin buu's energy so we still have time let's get going the wicked energy is coming from over there hurry trunks [Music] this is bad i can't believe they were just a diversion i hope we make it we have to damn that bobbity where is he okay they look pretty weak [Music] take this take this take this [Music] take this [Music] take this [Music] [Music] uh [Music] what a strange energy is it him so you finally found me bobbity wait that small creature is the wizard bobbity then who's the larger guy with him deborah what is the king of the demon realm doing here the worms all seem to have gathered deborah this guy he feels way stronger than perfect cell my apologies trunks i wasn't aware bobbity and snared such a powerful foe we should be okay for now majin buu hasn't been released yet there is still hope left indeed i seem to require just a bit more energy to bring boo into this world no matter though i will be gathering that energy now if i have anything to say about it oh my well i suspected you would try to stop me deborah what should we do about these pests um i can think of no better way to celebrate majin buu's revival than to destroy them gloriously with my demonic power [Music] lovely how about it then and make it extra flashy yes my lord i'll store the energy produced from the damage you take from deborah to help revive majin buu and it's only a matter of time before i have enough to release him at full power this is not good if we take too much damage we'll only further contribute to majin buu's revival then that means we just need to take this guy out fast and prevent bobbity from gathering enough energy i suppose that's true but we have no other choice if we want to stop majin buu from being released i'm worried deborah might be a bit more than you can handle i'll assist you as best i can supreme kai if you will fight then so will i it might be better if you stood by for now yes supreme kai as you command ready for this trunks yes [Laughter] do you honestly think you can win you're nothing but fools i'll eradicate you in an instant slaughter them deborah yes his energy is overwhelming but i can't let it intimidate me i have to do this for earth [Music] i don't care you're the king of some evil world i'm going to stop you allow me to at least commit your spirit divorce far more dangerous watch yourself [Music] who's still sealed in his orb i've been gathering energy for 10 years i won't let that tiger erase i cannot allow lord bobby to wait any longer to realize his plan the time for games may soon have to end are you all right no i'm taking damage i think we're still fine for now but be careful he goes not much longer now before we have enough energy no that's it sephora but your true struggle starts now i'm going to persevere i'm going to beat you [Music] take this he gone take this king's power oh power this is the end you're finished don't give up yet we can still pull this off [Music] wait trunks dropped the sword it's going to turn to stone [Music] no not the z sword the supreme kai and his fools are done for hooray hooray martin who is as good as revived i won't allow that to happen even if it costs me my life supreme guy no you of all people must not die [Music] [Music] trunks [Music] i trunks to do this you're this world's last hope only you can do this you're this world's next savior if anyone's gonna bring peace it's you you're our last hope [Applause] i've had enough of you two [Music] what is happening right now you the peace we finally obtained i won't let you take that away from us you two you two are gonna pay there's something different about him what is this [Music] the supreme kai kibito he didn't deserve this hey is it just me or is he stronger than he was before it seems anger triggers an increase in his power fear not lord brother he still does not have what it takes to best me blood body demands your death i will grant him back is this all still fight the change is only skin deep it seems you're still there's more to a demon kingdom nobody does this to me i am the king of the demon realm you're no match for the mighty king of the demon realm [Music] and this is for the supreme kai where are you getting this power do not fail me martin bruce revive you listen i won't let you stop us impossible this ends now [Music] you pissed what i can't move trunks now's your chance to finish him leave our world to hell alone impossible i was going to rule this world [Applause] you did it the world is safe again supreme kai no supreme guy and so the fight ended though he had lost the supreme kai and kabito trunks could finally breathe a sigh of relief earth was at peace once more no more would androids sell or the fear of majin buu threatened the people of the planet [Music] towns and cities would prosper and people would carry smiles on their faces unaware of the sacrifices made by the warriors who fought to defend their lives [Music] but such knowledge is not their burden to bear trunks will ensure it never will be as he continues to fight for peace supreme kai kibito thank you for everything go on i promise i promise to do everything in my power to protect this world hope's last defender remains ever [Music] vigilant [Music] you
