this is the one start Dragonball [Music] you [Music] [Music] six stars and that makes offset who is kind of hoping to do this without the dragonballs but cells way too strong for that I'm not powerful enough to beat cell on my own this way we'll have a back-up plan if something goes wrong [Music] looks like they're back in working order I'll say thanks so are you ready for the showdown with Sal that's great good luck everyone was focused on the fight ahead and before they knew it the fated day of May 26th had finally arrived all right time to go don't you dare die on me Goku don't worry I won't chichi and find that I'll go on better not fight what well um promise me Goku promise me Gohan won't fight look at the time bye time my little Gohan is going to fight I can feel it [Music] hey there you are it's almost time wait where's Vegeta don't tell me is he in the hyperbolic time chamber again he went on ahead of us gotcha man he's really raring to go yeah well whoa why is everyone so down in the dumps Goku we've got some bad news we can bring back a lot of people at once using just one wish with the Dragon Balls just like before we can't bring back anybody that's died once already I'm sorry I should have told you sooner what that's all relax tenday we just won't die it's as simple as that whoa tied uh you do know that we're up against cell right yeah I know anyway let's get going we're gonna be late are you this calm you're starting to freak me out come on you want to get left behind so are you coming to Curlin uh yeah [Music] Goku do you think we can really beat sell beats me won't know until I fight it [Music] only 20 minutes left until the cell games begin and the fate of the planet is decided cell can be seen standing motionless in the center of the Ring the vile monster cell is threatening to wipe out all of humanity only one man can stand against such evil the world martial arts champion mr. Satan that's right mr. Satan has come to save us from certain doom listen up there self I got you all figured out you use a bunch of light shows trick bombs to destroy the city in the military but let me tell you those toys won't work on me who is this clown Vegeta I'm surprised you've got the guts to come here and show your face well lookie here you are still alive and correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like you've had a little bit of work done they flew to write this little trick that's all [Music] [Music] you're finally here I've been waiting for you Goku the sound games begin that should be everyone welcome they hope they'll just flew didn't they yeah I guess that trips are pretty popular these days 16 looks like you're back in working order I owe you my thanks Krillin and you too go on glad to see you're better now sixteen let's give it our best Goku I was created with the sole purpose of killing you do not forget this man this guy's nothing but gloom and doom it's time let us begin I don't care who's first as World Martial Arts champion naturally that would be me that guy he's dead meat I say we let him go for it if well when he dies we'll just bring him back with the Dragon Balls geez guess we're gonna have to this is it folks the battle to protect the planet is finally underway the Cell Games have begun [Music] mr. Satan mr. Satan has been knocked out of the ring he's lost the match well then let's begin the cell games shall we mr. Satan lost I just lost my footing I'm gonna take a break and then I'm gonna mess him up real good he still doesn't have the slightest clue what he's dealing with world champion my ass so who's first well I guess I'll go first if that's okay well well in the interest of transparency how is hoping to save you for the end [Music] grenades [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you certainly do know [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's no fun if both fighters someone South America [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] wait tougher than I imagined zero room for error here you [Music] [Music] well look at you I must say I'm rather impressed I wasn't expecting to have this much fun do you better eat one of those Senzu beans Goku I'm having way too much fun to start now if we give Goku a sensor beam and all of us team up on cell we can take him down that's enough trunks you don't have any pride as a saying do you and you don't know him at all you would rather die than beat his opponent in such a way but if we just let this go on he can do it I'm certain of it I hate to admit it but no matter what I do I couldn't go beyond Kakarot level he's some sort of genius but even as powerful as he is cell is still one step ahead of him so what are we supposed to do he's got something planned I can tell let's just find out what that is what's wrong are you not feeling well I don't want the fun to stop here [Music] you win I'm dropping out I've got a good idea how strong you are now so I think I'm done now what what or fitting a match what what the hell is he thinking toku you do know what you're saying don't you you do realize that once you've run out of people to fight me every last person on the planet will have breathed that last breath you got the wrong idea you still have plenty of people to go up against can I choose who goes next would that be okay with you are you seriously going to forfeit I got a feeling about this next match it'll probably be the last one if your next opponent can't beat you then it's safe to say that nobody can but just based on what I was able to learn while fighting you myself I'm pretty confident this guy will have no trouble taking you down what get it now that's why I'm fine with dropping out of this thing all right you've piqued my interest just who is this mythical fighter you won't stop going on about the next one up to fight cell is he is the only one who's capable of taking down south all right Gohan you're up what did he just say come on you ready you you want me to fight sell Goku you're being completely ridiculous if you couldn't handle sell then what makes you think Gohan can go hannes hiding way more power than any of us realize it's downright unreal you guys he started tapping into that power while in the hyperbolic time chamber I never could have imagined this here you gotta check this out so you know I've got to ask God did you have any trouble keeping up with my fight with sell earlier well no but that's because you two weren't fighting at full power right I can't speak for sale but me I was fighting at my full power but it seemed like I was holding back to you am i right Gohan is that true yeah good go hon you wanna be a scholar don't you and save the world otherwise you'll never get the chance to become one okay I'll do what I can [Music] so I'm going to fight self [Music] well well if it isn't go hard [Music] that's go on calm and reserved go on how in the hell did that little brat increases power by so much I can't believe it hmm it seems like your father wasn't bluffing about your power after all but I'm afraid you still don't have what it takes to defeat me go on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] stop me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is surprising you're tougher than I thought you would be please please stop I don't want to fight you I don't want to kill anyone even a bad guy like you you kill me that is some kind of joke now I've heard everything I was told ever since I was a little kid I'd released an unbelievable amount of power whenever I got angry that's why my dad thinks I can beat you he's probably begging on me getting angry do you really think that little bedtime story is going to scare me if anything he just makes me want to kill you by whatever means necessary [Music] is it enough to make you cry you don't want to die like this do you go on Goku Gohan needs help I'm going in wait piccolo we just need to wait for him to get angry enough if we want to beat cell we need Gohan at his full power and his anger is the key to everything here that's where you're wrong Goku can't you see Gohan isn't like you he doesn't like fighting do you have any idea what he's thinking right now he isn't angry at all Gohan's over there wondering why his father isn't stepping in to save his life it doesn't matter that he may very well be the most powerful fighter out of all of us he's just a kid Krillin give me a sense of being okay [Music] it's so stubborn it seems her own pain isn't enough to push her over the edge what's it gonna take kid now I wonder what about the pain of your friends and loved ones what are you gonna do I'm ready to do whatever it takes to anger you and draw out that true power of yours my apologies for getting you involved I will self-destruct to take cell with me even you can't recover from a blast at this distance why why did I not explode because he can't 16 well you see when he was repairing you at the capsule corporation doctor brief found a huge bomb inside of your body he he said it was too dangerous to leave in so he removed it too bad Android 16 and now it's your turn wait what are those things go forth my little cell juniors make Goku and his friends suffer in pain yeah watch out guys these things are scary strong be careful [Music] [Music] you mess with the wrong guy [Applause] [Music] what should we do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] boys it's every man for himself [Music] [Music] Goku what should we do [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh the others are in trouble [Music] [Music] [Music] got a gun [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here goes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] got a gun [Music] I didn't think things would end up like this stop it I said stop it playtime's over my little babies time to finish the job kill them kill them all they're all gonna die if I'm really hiding a lot of power and I want to unleash it things aren't looking too good perhaps perhaps we should fall back wait but before you retreat please take me to the child over there I I beg you please do it for the earth are you crazy you see who's right next to the kid don't you fell you you you want to help do you not I know you do you are the World Martial Arts champion after all but mr.
