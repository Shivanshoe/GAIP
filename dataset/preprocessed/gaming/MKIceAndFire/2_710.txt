go back to where you came from why's everyone got it out for me everything sucks hello [ __ ] hell v it's good you're here had no idea you and the aldocaldos had made up they continue to grind my gear something terrible but you know their family exactly what happened spit it out the wraiths took saul the brick brain ventured out with a small patrol and never came back sure was race we've been observing their camp we know they're holding prisoners including someone important we need to free saul i don't know why but i felt i could count on you pan am you and me are tunes thought that was clear careful or i'll start believing that he won't be able to get rid of me i'll survive i'm sure whatever good will you might feel i'm sure you won't turn down one of the best sniper rifles on the west coast a tektronika grodd you saw it in action already that and the gratitude of the caldos sounds fancy once you have it in hand fancy all of a sudden becomes kick-ass let's go mitch will walk you through the details well i'll be pan m and v what's going on there here after what happened to scorpion he shows up here guess probably for saul ignore that hey panda seriously you really aim to do this someone has to you know you have a piston missing right someone has to where's mitch he was supposed to meet me here he'll be here any minute i never mention seeking outside help we can use all the help we can get you recommend any chrome in particular yeah you know cyber and plantations like buying shoes everyone needs something different net runner won't have the same needs as a solo but if you spend a lot of time in the badlands it's worth investing in cloaking gear hollow skin active camo what have you compared to the city surrounding area might look deserted but less folk doesn't mean you'll be safer here's what i recommend move quietly don't draw too much attention else things can get real ugly real quick i want to get myself chipped straight to the point i like it hmm okay how you want to do this quietly an open assault would be suicide mitch is already setting up the recon you'll sneak into the race camp while i cover you going in quiet two's all you need it's not that i don't wanna go to serve some raffins up some justice it's just look around the last attacks left barely half of us standing our supplies are stuck outside goddamn reno and our gear don't get me started we're up [ __ ] creek static and i don't know if we're ever gonna find or fashion a paddle try as we might so we do what saul would want us your leader gets nabbed and you what hope for the best rather than i think about what you do for the ones at the bottom of your food chain you're asking for trouble leave it he has a right not to understand there's mitch i floated a drone over the wraith's camp will you take a look or would you rather keep mouthing off let's see what we got here the raffins can't see it active camo but that practically inhales battery juice so make it quick they found an abandoned cement plant to squat in with a massive heavy gear locus would be a better name for them they fly into a place strip it of all its got then move on but this time do you see the wall they've added some primitive security measures it points to them aiming to stay longer the question is why who knows for sure but i would guess that saul is part of the reason if he's still there we have to find a way inside that guard post is probably connected to the rest of the camp maybe but there are also breeches in the wall lightly guarded sections do you see the tracks tire tracks their vehicles were moving heavy freight it could have been equipment either that or saul's not their only prisoner the tracks lead to the truck can you scan it that's probably the one that kept saul in the main building there saul must be inside quite a spread i feel like looking for a diamond in a hail store if they haven't scrapped and gutted the place for parts you could access the local cabinet you would just need to find the control room the skywalk it connects the garage to the main structure okay got some stuff to work with now is everything clear let's sum things up just be sure sheesh okay the raffins captured saul they're holding him somewhere inside their base we are the cavalry riding to the rescue hoping to make it in time you will strive to slip into the camp while i cover you but we'll let bullets fly only as a last resort there are many we are few so we'll need to look for any chance to gain the upper hand you will pull us all out and the three of us will ride away at top speed all clear now yep let's go get saw perfect mitch is the van primed i did what i could take a tour solid job i mostly improvised actually either way it'll have to do hold on a minute i got one more thing if you find saul hasn't flatlined you'll probably need this spike super jet a rhino dose it should speed up saul's central pump hope so doubt i could carry him out of my back so that should be everything v will you ride with me yeah of course i'm going with you okay you take the wheel one me driving yep i need to fiddle with my scope a bit oh yeah we even have a radio in here take it for a spin if you like i still can't believe he let himself get captured anyone else but saul said yourself he's not at the top of his form yes but moving civilians across the border during a bombardment hijacking a petrochem tanker opening the valves cranking a few figure eights to set the desert ablaze and give the kids a fun show that's that's all i remember all had our idols i know it's just do you see that that is one hell of a storm looking bad oh it's bad and more than its look we have to move quickly okay we need to hide the car park beside that outcrop okay out i'll find a place to roost and keep you in sight just watch yourself down there all right i'm in position i have you in range so that should be their garage it's heavily guarded knowing them they have something important in there you might even gain access to the security system so keep your head that has to be where they're holding saul careful there's a sniper perched in the tower damn it stay out of sight okay main building watch for burp saul is somewhere inside i feel it in my bones remember what i told you find the control room and you'll gain access to the security cams oh you just wasting your time oh get out of here pan am i found saul i think locked in the cellar how is he it's hard to say too dark okay get down there and get him maybe we made it in time get out of here nothing to be shy about what are you fine get out of here what are you fighting get out of here come on oh here dead disemboweled and not just for her chrome i don't think [ __ ] rapids soulless bill there's no line they won't cross none right think i got eyes on him is he breathing think so good grab him and get out of there so you have my goddamn cigarette your cigar i told you sons of [ __ ] a cigar some ice cold and a couple of ladies to keep me company either that or you can kiss my keister easy song i'm here with pan am plan now but she left not forever gonna get you out you i remember you're that merc can you walk [ __ ] something is out of whack you're pretty badly beat probably could use this oh yeah so how is he time to don my dancing shoes seems not bad at all demanded a cigar in some companions that does sound like saul now get yourselves out of there on our way out now i'm firing up the engine i'll be right there you got by the posted guards and if we can be just as sly together might get out without firing a shot exactly there should be a quick exit out of the cellar pressure so that storm is picking up steam good it'll cover our trucks anyway we have good reason not to head straight back to camp there's no need to play it safe we'll just burn time better late and safe than dead do you see those buildings we'll wait it out there i remember this place it should be safe at least for now inside quick i need to catch my breath ah just in time for dinner not hungry i just swallowed a pound of sand looks like we're in for the night a little power might be useful could you help me look v i'll search in here a lot of useful things the angles left in a hurry biotechnica made them a good offense here prime cell you don't know that hey it worked we have lights damn it's getting cold i tried to get us some heat in here but no luck can you check it might have the magic touch actually you know what check the fuse outside it might have come loose if so just whack it back in place and i'll get this junk burning anything else your excellency huh i'll need to think about it though it'll be the end of our friendship if saul freezes to death oh see what i see expiration dates from before the last war so hopefully it hasn't turned to poison today's our lucky day lucky interesting choice of words do i hear a lecture coming on go on get off your feet it could be ours no no lecture but we do need to talk that rate's crap it shouldn't have happened they wanted everything our camp locations routes off loading points if they knew what state we're in one or two more raids and that'd be the end of us and if you had mounted a rate of your own well that would have been it's not the time for this you're both exhausted maybe you're right we can't hope to handle the raffins alone so you would sell us out to biotechnica tell him it's a damn rotten idea gotta agree with pan am sounds like a truly shitty idea thanks what could you possibly know about it you know what i always liked about nomads your taste no you hunger for freedom it's not easy to come by in night city the corpse got their grubby claws and everything and i just can't believe you'd hand them what you hold to be most precious thank you v i could not have said it better we've had our spats a few like any family they're not worth digging up i think so too if you'd like to come back everyone will be waiting arms open wide but there will have to be changes no more jumping to the front of the line and so it begins you know what sweetheart you'll have plenty of time to tear at each other's throats later that is my hope but right now i wouldn't mind catching a few wings need help [ __ ] off huh do you know what they call these storms in north africa hi boobs damn i love that word well what was that about to who moves yeah to her boobs no that packs octane funny woodies i rarely sleep with a roof overhead yet this will be the second time with you when you're on the road day and tonight today

were headed back to the aldi caldos staying with the clan that remains so come on last night when we were talking to saul thanks for standing up for me though one thing the wraiths the raid it's the start of something we need to prepare for saul will get everything set up in camp whereas i whereas you the raffins wanted to know our roots right well it's the aldi caldo's turn some recon is in

badge frequencies was beginning you'd never figure it out nice work on that antenna the tricky part of having a head is knowing how to use it but not for you me mosquito's roots are safe and secure

to kick the tires before we get weak sure start your stallion oh yeah i like that let's count one up front see him luigi after him big turn coming cut it sharp watch our back we're moving the path dare him to thank try you tell me in recent weeks more than a dozen boys good morning night city is it a mirage a hologram no my friends it's clear open skies but don't take it from me get out there and enjoy the sun yes feet a congratulations hell yeah don't stop yet okay move up a bit further what for we need to talk something you should know okay sit down for a spell over there wow quite the view yeah me and dean we like to come here wanted to tell me something i mentioned dean before my husband yeah wheeled to your heat right sweetest man i ever knew we were friends before my gender transition we brought daffodils to the hospital to new beginnings he said were you married long 12 years dean used to laugh that for our 15th said he'd finally talked me into my first implant i was prepping some surprise hey you mind if i ask why you don't sport any chrome i love machine fee i do but i don't ever want to become one that weird a little i guess but it's fine dean only person who could have convinced me to chrome up but guests will never know if he'd managed huh why tell me about dean meaning why now he died during a race last year the final not your standard fatality though are you saying you feel at fault for his death me at fault why would you think that he was flatlined by corporal eagle weasel peter sampson exceptional walking rot your husband how'd he die exactly we just powered into the final straight samson peeling up the tarmac ahead of us was clear we couldn't win so dean let up on the chew and then that snake slammed on the brakes dean also had to he lost control but isn't that how this race works you don't get it rhode was cleared to the finish line he would have won it was premeditated what's the corpose deal doesn't really matter was only ever another adversary to me but to dean dana and sampson had a history going way back and something happened between them they never admitted anything but yeah yeah there was some kind of strife something personal to their rally rivalry when samson came first dean got hot and bothered right so this isn't business as usual for you this isn't about winning that's right [ __ ] winning i want samson dead and this is your best plan for vengeance folks die on the track all the time won't seem unusual at all another day at the races in line with the rules and if samson doesn't show for the race what then he'd never miss a chance to puff out his chest hill race circuit champ last year no way he'll let that go not try to repeat and me guess you want my help to zero him killing samson matters more than taking first we have to make a choice sorry i lied to you v it means a lot to you this so yeah let's bury the bastard thank you this it's important i need it see you for the final that's right till then v you
