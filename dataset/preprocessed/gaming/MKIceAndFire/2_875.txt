what happened back there with that thing no idea it was a real storm what do you think seemed like you wanted to haul my ass off into the woods can't even think about what might have happened to me is the tide beginning to turn in our favor whatever we saw back there or thought we saw we're still in grave danger the only way out of this freaking nightmare is to stop mary stop her lying you had a chance to get mary exposed for what she is a liar and a faker put her in the dark for a change why didn't you take it we don't know for sure that stopping mary will help us out it's just a theory it may only be a theory but right now it's all we've got this is a one-shot deal we get it wrong and there's no replay it's game over so i'm up for doing whatever it takes come on let's take a look no way in like the rest of this town check this out hey they're coming you can't keep running i'll make sure they'll find you that guy's a menace i don't think he gets how bad a mess we're in come on inside well no one's been here for a long time now is my time to speak before the judge i am filled with dread i cannot know how my testimony will be received the devil has blinded so many to what is real and what is not nothing good will come of this his words will seek to twist the truth allow me to judge what is true abraham enjoys if her allies in this deception unless we forget you condemned joseph to death only yesterday or do you now question that decision i've heard nothing today to sway my conviction joseph consorted with the same malicious force as his wife for this the court thanks reverend carver who faced the devil's wrath to present the evidence this is only my duty judge however this court is duty-bound by law to seek out the truth we must therefore examine these claims made by abraham against mary if i may speak briefly judge wyman time is short reverend be indeed brief mary has shown great fortitude to speak out against the evil here many would have lacked her courage yet her reward for exposing this brooding covered in our midst is to be besmirched courage is not in question it is our intent we must be certain of her accuser is the very man entrusted to care for this innocent child plain to say he is not fit for such a task and i would ask the court to have mary placed elsewhere who would you have be a new ward reverend i am prepared to take responsibility for the child if the court agrees first the court must hear what abraham has to say no decision can be made on the child until then abraham what am i to do some would have me speak out against mary but could a child truly be capable of such evil this is tough i get that would be for anyone mary he's just a kid tell the court what you have come here to say speak up boy out with it mary has spoken of evil spirits devil ray and witchcraft things many cannot believe could exist here and i'm not here for history and hearsay get to the point boy mary is tormented the apparition she has seen they have plagued her stolen her innocence some suggest she is in league with these creatures but no one can be certain myself least of all can any of us truly know a child's mind you claim i lack the ability to see the truth i beg forgiveness i would never suggest such a thing my time is not for wasting you and the priest have hurt me enough for one day i have more to say i have already given you enough time furthermore mary is to be placed into the care of reverend carver now stand down tell me everything did you see andrew's double again he told the judge that mary did nothing wrong like she's the victim here oh that's bad very very bad  so what happens now i'm not sure i did the right thing i guess at least we know we can influence the outcome that's gotta be good right what do you think is he right about this it went down just like he said what the we can't stay let's get out of here look at those up this place shut down way way back life as a kid in the 70s everything was ahead of me there's got to be another exit maybe on the ground floor uh get over here you gotta see this this is too weird this is too much way too much first a load of weirdo witch killers from ancient history look just like us now we got the creepy family of the year winners who also look just like us what the actual what does it mean though do you think they died like the other lookalikes no clue who knows what happened to them maybe we're all stuck in the same nightmare you really want a souvenir from this night from this place all i know i'm keeping hold of this what you said about all this being a nightmare you mean that if it's my nightmare why are you guys all in it any of us could say the same thing i don't know what's real here are you the real andrew come on so wait who are those people in the photograph maybe time is up here like that really is us in that photo but they're around the same age as us as far as i can tell okay so what's your theory smart guy we're dead
