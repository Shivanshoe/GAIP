mean I'm right we're both right no video game is safe from an industry that's always chasing the hot new thing sure the simpsons game is great with his unique upgradable character abilities and it's hilarious self referential cutscenes but what about when the xbox 720 comes out or the PlayStation 4 no one will want to play as then damn this godforsaken place video game making nerds are getting rich and all I can do is die and die and die and die it's just more painful than the last but what can we do we're just highly rendered pixels in a universe we can't control even as we speak

mansion of the creator he created all of these worlds maybe he can end this pointless cycle of destruction the Creator a I'm a triple combo punches fat and dirty face God don't have a cow man you still say that right I hope so the only way to get through the gate is to go into each of the new Simpsons games being developed by the Creator once you're inside each game you need to find a keycard only the four key cards will combine to open the gate key cards that is the lamest video game BS I've ever heard why are we doing something cool like collecting multi-coloured shard keys that would be totally different and awesome cowabunga let's get to it video game let's go give this Creator a piece of our minds and save Springfield I feel this done nerds to sit on my heads and hit buttons
