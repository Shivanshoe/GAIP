here i need a favor hi i'm liz liz allen peter's friend sort of it's complicated your dad's company is alan chemicals right yeah i um i track down the person who's been funneling their resources to aim it's it's mark raxton should i know who that is he's my step-brother been working as a junior executive since he graduated college and now well now i guess he's selling out our family to aim can't wait for that conversation over thanksgiving dinner we have to stop him any idea what he might have planned not a clue i'll look into what he's been doing at alchem but let me know if you find anything on your end we're going to fix this don't worry [Music] i will scan the area for aim signatures and update your hud be on your guard there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans hey look new friends [Music] [Music] inhuman down you must keep them safe they were no match for us not on your feet they're safe the team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i send their location to your hud the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow a cluster has regrown you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back uh the clusters have been destroyed i will use this data to attempt to identify their component molecules i've detected another pocket of corrupted vibranium ah way better than having to do it myself ah uh [Music] that's gonna hurt the morning website um humans shall inherit uh my next trick ass kicking neutralize the watchdogs united agent is another watchdog [Music] they have lost another agent another bounty hunter is down [Music] the watchdogs team has been defeated excellently done i've located captive and humans they're being

in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans we've reached the fight scene portion of our program [Music] yes i can't believe that worked cardiac arrest spontaneously mission report miss allen very funny so i looked into my brother's network and i think i got a hit a former mentor spencer smythe four years ago he started working with aim as one of their lead tech engineers so he could have recruited your brother that's what i'm thinking here's the good news i know mark's work if they're collaborating i should be able to reverse engineer something to give you an edge against whatever smite's cooking up sounds good i'll take all the edges we can get thanks so [Music] intel provided by our friends at shield has revealed the location of an elite aim squad we have an opportunity to take them out before aim can deploy the squad against the resistance this is a quick hit and run operation take out the targets and return to us unharmed if possible [Music] an elite aim team is close by and on alert updating your heart hmm every member of the elite team must be defeated [Music] yes one of their agents is down all things considered pretty well [Applause] another agent down well done that squad member has been neutralized armor is here these guys the team are no longer a threat [Music] [Applause] [Music] good job avengers with this victory you've weakened aim and given the resistance a leg up keep it up um [Music] avengers our agents in the field have identified the location of an aim data vault the vault contains research on new combat synthoids and needs to be destroyed get in there take out the server vaults and get out before aim reinforces the facility [Music] aim has a set of turbines powering one of their emergency generators disable them destroy the turbines aim has sent forces to stop you disabled ass kicking excellent turbine destroyed i'm down thanks for the assist [Music] nicely done avengers you wreaked some impressive havoc and now aim is scrambling to recover their lost research more attacks like this and aim won't stay in power long there are many battlefields in the future wastelands with the remains of fallen tree giants i'm positive we'll find something useful [Music] [Music] nearby four minutes have been transmitted you wanna just give up while you're ahead no soon yourself oh yes [Music] analyzing records these fallen giants appear to be labeled as cree centuries interesting i'll gather more data on our way home i have located the green battle records marking the location now oh our area of interest is all nearby who's next [Music] future me that's oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] this creature appears to have been defeated by shield weaponry of conventional methods maybe more likely than expected i'm receiving a pre-signal should be close to your location don't suppose you'd rather settle this over coffee be on your guard avengers know you're maneuvering uh how many more hits i can take [Music] that's not good three three well that's inconvenient [Music] i'm gonna need a minute for six weeks okay quit now show what we're made up [Music] communications be careful avengers uh i'm detecting a large quantity of enemy signatures [Music] to the store oh i'm done being friendly records indicate these giants were constructed over 10 000 years ago this data is extremely valuable great work avengers [Music] we must learn more from the future if we wish to stop decree in our past i'll continue searching for more free battle sites thank you for your continued support [Music] greetings avengers i have located an area rich in cree data you and your shield allies will no doubt find interesting the area is unsafe but i believe you will find the rewards outweigh the risks there are many battlefields in the future wastelands with the remains of fallen tree giants i'm positive we'll find something useful [Music] have been transmitted the location should be just so bad i think we're pretty evenly matched shelter beneath the now [Music] you're just embarrassing yourself wind blow lightning [Music] oh you got a sec you are definitely not supposed to be here does it help if i say i come in peace marginally look i know i'm probably not your favorite person right now but i am here to help smythe i mean he's gone off the deep end by the sudden change of heart last i saw you didn't have a problem making robots specifically designed to kill me i know i know but you have to understand it was the only way i could make sure liz was safe from aim they would have ruined her career or worse and now they know that liz and her friend at the beautiful are helping you guys destroy those chemical caches they're making moves so let me help give you an edge against them it doesn't make up for everything but maybe it's a start okay cards in the table liz trusts you but i'm going against my gut by letting you be here you're on shaky ground raxton i'm keeping my eye on you good that means you're not an idiot so they're in here [Music] has arrived protect those inhumans time to show what we've got sorry did that hurt [Music] portion of our program [Music] you're good now hey okay nice light workout [Music] hey it's those aim people you keep talking about [Music] they're safe a team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i've sent their location to your hud the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow i've detected another pocket of corrupted vibranium the cluster has regrown you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back neutralize the watchdogs unit come on guys you're just embarrassing yourselves oh oh you got a sec a present for me you shouldn't have mark and i reverse engineered some of the circuits really whoa this is amazing while i've got you i talked to peter but did you now he offered to hack into the bugle's website and broadcast incriminating footage from ames internal database worldwide we just need to get him access to aim server from the inside huh sounds like a job for me and mark you can use his login to get administrator access into aim server send the data to pete and we're in business there are inhumans caught in a standoff up ahead backup has arrived protect those inhumans that is so bad let's go say hello [Music] is uh [Music] inhuman down you must keep them safe get it [Music] they're safe the team of watchdogs is in the vicinity i've sent their location to your heart the clusters ahead are interconnected molecules of a volatile metal i cannot identify you'll have to destroy them all or they'll regrow the clusters you must destroy them all or they will keep coming back excuse me while i refer to him as anthony masters for the rest of this mission that skull for brains was on my undercover team when he decided to go mercenary a lot of good people died that day i plan on reminding him he has blood on his hands jarvis we got any bogies in the area small patrol ahead likely a preliminary guard for the clones base let's give them a hello so they don't ruin our surprise let's have some fun sadly there they are [Music] what's bad about this [Music] do i have the after action report i'd be curious to hear what happened between you and mr masters from your point of view we were doing recon on this arms dealer somewhere in nigeria shield heard they might have gotten access to alien weaponry [Music] he was bringing our shield weapons and armor straight to him they're the guards don't let them stand in your way upgrade me yes that's one um oh ah um and three yeah maybe head inside i don't mean to pry agent morales right of course i didn't finish um my team walked into a trap the arms dealer only wanted our weapons and armor not the people holding them so they just started picking us off i don't know how many masters took out himself but it doesn't really matter does it okay you're headed for the base's two main hangars we're trying to cut off masters only means of escape first up the containers he uses to deploy troops and supplies all troops to the east hanger you have got to be kidding me patch me in jarvis i want to talk to him connected hey masters remember me morales still not dead avengers [Music] oh is it over new friends not so fast oh went pretty well surprised [Music] here's an energy boost avengers there's an elevator ahead of you it should take you to taskmaster [Music] agent morale is i'm fine are you certain no but i can finish this i am here to assist you in any way that i can thank you and i am sorry avengers i i didn't expect it to hit me this hard turn calms back on jarvis i want to be able to hear this understood i do love when shield sends the avengers to clean up their messes as if you could love anything you're broken avengers take them down do it yourself [Music] yes [Music] that's gonna hurt the morning you can't see it underneath [Music] disease ah being friendly huh wow uh hmm ah oh [Music] oh these guys isn't this supposed to be the part where i feel better nervous i'm afraid any knowledge of grief i possess is clinical i know they're gone for good but maybe now he is too nice work avengers [Music] mark raxton a junior executive at allen chemicals turned himself in to authorities today claiming that he was solely responsible for the company's involvement with aim scientist dr spencer smythe smythe and advanced idea mechanics are both under investigation after raw footage of advanced synthoid testing was leaked to the daily bugle's website raising questions as to whether aims practices are not just unethical but illegal the bugle's internal investigation into who uploaded the live stream is still underway hey liz are you okay sort of still processing i think mark always had a bit of a protective streak i guess i never expected him to do all this just to save my career i mean working with aim even knowing what they were really doing just and you wouldn't have lost that internship in the first place if it wasn't for peter parker peter peter had the right idea this whole time aim is dangerous we should have exposed them a lot sooner so you don't hate him i mean i did it first nobody likes losing their job but this is bigger than both of us and now i have something to offer the resistance what's that maybe alan chemicals can't officially work with the resistance but they can at least spare one of their top biochemists me parker said you were as tough as you are smart he was right so what about you huh what's next for spider-man well first i'm gonna go back to new york and get a decent slice of pizza after that i guess it's back to the old grind speaking of i have work to do so it's cool if you want to go like have some superhero bonding time or whatever oh that's okay i'm still not used to having people around i've always flown solo or swung i guess so working with the avengers has been kind of terrifying but also nice i don't know it's strange having people want to be around me and wanting to be around them too that's called having friends spidey you should try it sometime i think you'll like it you did good out there yeah and you know if you wanted to stick around on a more permanent basis i don't think anyone would mind uh bruce only requested that you limit your lab time to once a day and during work hours i i'm really flattered but i've still got my own message to clean up back home new york isn't gonna save itself still if you need anything from me give me a call and i'll be there oh yeah you're not gonna go all i work alone on us i guess it's not the worst thing in the world to have a couple of super hero friends on speed dial uh actually if people mind i get a lift back to new york kind of far for a ride share [Music] hey aunt may sorry i'm late i was hanging out with some new friends hey don't sound so surprised you know what i did have a nice time but you know you're always my preferred company sure i'll grab some tamales on the way home yeah i'm glad i had a good day too love you [Music] foreign
