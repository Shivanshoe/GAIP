[Music] please open your eyes i'm sorry i can't stop the poisons advance thank you zephyr the struggles in your hands now oh are you there my son yeah i'm here i'm here dad please just oh i can't see you are you there [Music] i've always dad this can't be no he can't we never i didn't and now he's gone i had a feeling we might have a rat among us but to be medic of all people so what do we do now going law that bastard candy belt will pay you have to know that ganna belt will be expecting us this is all an obvious trap i don't give a damn if it is there's no way i'm letting that bastard get away with this that's right you know cannonballs mess with the wrong people elfin you can't just weren't you the one who said you wanted to take on the lords or would you rather go back to collaglia i won't allow you to put words in my mouth all i'm saying is we shouldn't rush things i don't need any of you coming along the score's mind settle i'm not the only one who wants to avenge zephyr's death he's right besides if we don't take him on right now we may never get another opportunity [Music] if you're going that means you're going to need the blazing sword if we do this we can't afford to make any mistakes are you really sure you can ask us again after we've defeated the lord please allow me to help you as well think of it as an apology for getting you into this whole mess it's the least i can do feel free to use anything in here you might need aren't you worried about getting ambushed impossible i built this hideout with my own two hands menik no gannabelt doesn't know it exists then let's go time to avenge zephyr and free the realms people [Music] i forgot to mention this before but any enemies we go up against with real hard defenses you just leave them to me hard defenses you mean like enemies with shields and things like that shield shells armor whatever when you attack those kinds of enemies from the front your blows mostly get blocked right sure so you're saying you have a counter it's nothing fancy let's just say i have a knack for busting open tough sturdy stuff it's hard to explain but i focus my energy and then hit a specific point with everything i've got if i do it right the defenses come crumbling down really but without astral arts how could you possibly if he says he can do it then he can do it we can trust him thanks alfin although between you and me right now there's nothing i want to bash in more than gannabel's stupid smug face i think you'll get your chance soon enough law [Music] this is great the taste and aroma will blow everyone away [Music] [Music] after all that how can these people carry on like nothing happened didn't zephyr's words reach anyone in that whole crowd the snake eyes could be anywhere people are scared of being reported so they can't do jack and speaking from experience when you spend so much of your life as a slave you stop even thinking of standing up and fighting collagely had a lot of people like that well these people are in no position to demand anything anyway when they've lost the will to fight and need others to protect them these people have had a hard enough time just keeping the fires lit no one wants to sacrifice their life without good cause it is what it is once ganna belt is out of the picture things in cisloti are sure to change yeah i hope so [Music] so [Music] right here goes bring him down [Music] go away in-game [Music] you're quite the gunslinger i have to be in this world don't worry i've got your back [Music] [Music] i'm not seeing very many enemies around what's going on they probably know we're not going to run away you know waiting for us to show up well if it's a fight they want i'll be more than happy to give them one they're probably inside the revel prison tower in the plaza that's where the lord here lives the same building with the spirit vessel that's gathering all the light huh we need to be careful of how we go from here the fact ganabel knew about my healing hearts and had that poison ready tells me he's extremely dangerous he's not dangerous he's just a rat bastard who's getting what's coming to him i'm telling you don't underestimate him we don't know what else he's got in store for us one misstep on our part is all it's going to take to give him what he wants [Music] you're right dad what were you trying to tell me there at the end i guess it'll have to stay unspoken and unheard like all the other things we never got round to telling each other [Music] ow bring him down [Music] drake barely a blip on our radar [Music] hey got it [Music] just let him do his things shut him down [Music] [Music] get toasty [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we can really make weapons with this [Music] danabel must be somewhere inside how about it law any idea which way it is this is a renin castle you think they were in the habit of letting a danon like me inside point taken the astral energy's off the scale almost like it's pressing down on me you can feel it the whole castle must be brimming with it my hunch is it'll get stronger the deeper we go it must be the spirit vessel you can bet anything it's pulsing with stored astral energy can't let ganabel use it against us and we can assume that's his plan a let him try i'll destroy anything he throws at us [Music] hey [Music] [Music] this is got it [Music] oh [Music] this place looks completely different from bolsters every lord has their taste whether this really suits running sensibilities is another matter altogether it's us dannon's who built the structure you know how would we know what remnants like who cares let's hurry up and get to the top floor so we can kick danabel's ass [Music] it'll be a breeze get in get out here [Music] [Music] let's keep our eyes on the prize [Music] go no further um say no more [Music] [Music] there's always room for improvement [Music] bring them down forever [Music] [Music] with this i can become even stronger [Music] hey [Music] hmm [Music] yes [Music] [Music] now say no more [Music] fighting in this state isn't advisable [Music] [Music] now engaging [Music] ready [Music] we managed to pull through [Music] what is this place some kind of armory looks like they're more for decorative purposes than actual combat does it matter we've got a job to do wait this isn't renon it's dannon really and not just this one either all of these it's all dan and gear what's dan and equipment doing on display inside a renin castle ask around later if you're so interested but for now we've got more pressing matters to attend to remember [Music] [Music] did this open the door we still don't know how to activate the elevator i'll just have to see what we can figure out that bastard giving us the run round [Music] [Music] i'm [Music] is [Music] nicely done [Music] [Music] they keep a zoo locked up down here why i've heard rumors that they feed prisoners to one instead of executing them do you think stop it [Music] [Music] it'll be a breeze get in get out can you [Music] well then let's keep moving [Music] what's this doing here [Music] no choice tornado [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion [Music] does this look like an elevator key to you guys only one way to find out let's go [Music] go no further [Music] barely a blip on our radar [Music] do you sense one of your friends noodles [Music] wow hey say no more [Music] our work is done here let's move i'm right behind you shion [Music] are you still thinking about that armory with all the den and equipment yeah especially that black armor i don't think i've ever seen anything from dana that looked so nice i can tell you that it was definitely dannon it was made using techniques found only here that's how i know but ever since the rendons came our civilization's been scrubbed out bit by bit hardly anything's left now which is why most people don't remember but why would the remnants have something like that unless it was the spoils of war it must be a token of the denons who fought and lost in the past or rather that the renins were able to beat them armor that nice must have been worn by a commander of some sort they might have even been a denon hero a hero huh a fallen hero maybe [Music] i hate to see all that stuff fall into ren and hands but it's amazing to see that so much of it has survived you into this kind of stuff then run well uh i mean yeah i guess are we done here we don't want to keep gannabelle waiting any longer [Music] gotta break through engaging [Music] shut them down [Music] nicely done [Music] so [Music] [Music] looks like some solid equipment [Music] let's dispose of the trash nicely done [Music] great now we can keep moving don't overdo it law [Music] go no further is that standard now i've seen everything eat this line freak what can't they just sit still sia can you take care of them done [Music] air these bad guys really don't mess around [Music] an opponent like this should be easy do this [Music] [Music] three [Music] look sharp lightning i felt better that's for sure [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're saying we should check the owl forest [Music] what's this thing [Music] you think the elevator is activated now should be let's check and find out we're coming for you jennifer [Music] fire support you won't make a [Music] full step shut him down look sharp [Music] i'm pretty worn out want to rest up for a bit [Music] hey hold up a sec guys what's up we need to talk about ganoveld this guy can control both light and lightning and i've heard his swordsmanship is unrivaled i'm not surprised he is one of the top lords after all that's not all he also has these weird little gadgets that he likes to use gadgets you mean like some kind of a running weapon probably he's got a bunch of these things that hover all around him they're supposed to protect him from attacks coming in at any angle i take it there aren't any blind spots then nope which is why i plan to bust down his defenses from the front what why isn't that where his defense will be the toughest that's why it's worth attacking once i poke a hole in that bastard's defenses the rest of you can tear it wide open and give him hell all right we go with your plan law now let's get going it's about time we got revenge for zephyr [Music] [Music] jennifer it's about time i was beginning to worry you'd jump ship like the rats you are you're not so fortunate we're here to end you to liberate cislovia to avenge zephyr you talk big but don't you think you're forgetting something of your precious resistance groups whether the silver swords or any others none have ever dealt a blow to remnan domination in each and every realm the story is the same until you you who wields the blazing sword of calaglia are different news of balsa's defeat really took the wind out of your sails that brute a bad case of brawn over brain certainly no loss to me still even the smallest of sparks can grow into an inferno i must give precedence to the task at hand extinguishing you snuffing out your fire before it spreads across the five realms that's no he can't be brinwell nothing i'm fine ah ganna belt valkyris lord of cislodia accept your challenge come and meet your death [Music] you pay for what you did to my father the feisty mouth which is the right behind the beam stuffy i never wanted to serve you i had no you choice the wrong fighters [Music] leave this to me i'll take him down water i'll crush you lightning reflexes claws [Music] now you see what i can do i think enough pay for what you did drink deep the disgusting can't get any closer if this keeps up oh is i'll thrash you [Music] [Music] quick and hit him hard [Music] [Music] oh we're getting started is oh [Music] [Music] this armor won't save you let's put it down the despair he's still going i'll finish him first [Music] let the marksman handle this first strike before the gate define lightning even flashing back [Music] have you learned your lesson no not yet for the sake of lenigus and my fellow brethren huntana i will not stupid [Music] no i refuse to believe this it cannot end this way if i die my subjects will [Music] [Music] [Music] it's over that zephyr's still gone focus on the positive we defeated a lord and under difficult circumstances too on the positive suffers dead shion and the renin's ruled this world unimpeded for three centuries did you think there wouldn't be any sacrifices so zephyr's life just doesn't matter he's dead shiana our friend is dead we're fighting this damn war to keep people alive [Music] yeah you're right this is a war did you just realize that zephyr wasn't the first to die and he sure won't be the last if you can't handle that alfin then you should run back to calaglia and when you do just remember to leave the blazing sword here in safer hands what's that supposed to mean damn it she just thinks she can say whatever she likes bickering among ourselves at a time like this isn't gonna get us anywhere especially at a time like this all right fine do so much for ganna belt good riddance you said it so was the lord of calaglia like annabelle too no bolshev was huge a real tough guy act now that i think of it his crest was different too his was a flaming cross ah i see uh anyway what do you guys plan on doing from here we keep moving three rennenlords remain and we won't rest until their thrones are empty as well [Music] that work for you shion that was my end game from the beginning [Music] hey so if it's not too much trouble could i maybe come along isn't cislodia your home i mean yes but it's just now that everyone knows what i've been hiding well it might be best to get as far away as i can until it all quiets down is that okay i promise i'll pull my own weight sure you're welcome to join us taking off huh yeah thanks for everything it's too bad i wish there was more we could do to pay you back for all you've done i'll see to it personally that zephyr's remains reach calaglia safely what's next for cislodia i honestly couldn't tell you the enemy infiltrated its way right to our core as a people [Music] only time will tell if we can rise above our suspicions and come together zephyr once told me that so long as you don't give up there's no wall that can't be torn down sounds about right and thanks to you the greatest obstacle that was in our way is now gone i suppose the rest of it will be up to us i look forward to seeing how far you'll go oh i almost forgot before you head off there's something i wanted to give you [Music] [Music] wow look at you you scrub up real nice it was a parting gift it's like speaking to one of the old dan and heroes from legend where two next then elda menencia you're really going to travel in that thing why not it's not as heavy as it looks actually there's someone i was hoping we could invite along with us [Music] you can't be serious [Music] got some place to be not really i mean i can't stay here of course then again there's no one waiting for me back in calaglia either plenty of ditches along the road maybe i'll find one to die in how about a fresh start after the kinds of things i've done i don't know where i'd even begin your father said that as long as you face the past there's hope i think it might be a little late for that he also said he'd fought and lost all his life but didn't regret it in the slightest it's only over when you give up keep fighting and even that wall inside you can be brought down don't you want to see what your dad saw on the other side of that wall what he was fighting for do you do you think i'm even worthy to that's for you to decide [Music] [Music] i i'm sick of losing everything i love of running from life maybe all that's left is to just turn around and face it [Music] count me in [Music] finally i thought you'd never finish him we've still got a ways to go [Music] here we go hoodle [Music] this armor was a gift from bregen what if it really did belong to a danon hero once upon a time he challenged an overwhelmingly powerful renin foe and perished for it i wonder how he felt having the hopes of the people riding on him [Music] hey did you make off with that armor while none of us were looking because i've gotta admit you look pretty snazzy in it he didn't steal it if that's what you mean greg and gave it to him as a parting gift ah right although it makes sense i guess it's like a symbol of rebellion in its own way which is why it should have been your father wearing this not me i don't know i don't think he could have pulled it off like you man i wonder what the last wearer of this armor was dreaming of for cislodia when they decided to rise up and fight who knows anyone who could have answered that is long gone truth is always lost with the departed are you saying there's no point in trying to understand why they gave up their lives no only that it's impossible to know for sure look i can tell that you're concerned about cislodea's future but we do have other things to take care of you can't shoulder all of the world's problems elfin if you try to you'll only find yourself buried by the weight of it all yeah i know my path is forward and i'll do what i can here and now [Music] you were born in calaglia right law hmm oh yeah it's scalding hot all the time there so i was shocked when i learned cisloti as the exact opposite not to mention dark not anymore thankfully how did you even manage to cross the border between realms all five realms are supposed to be closed off due to the nature of the crown contest what is this an interrogation now i didn't mean it like that i just figured if a dannon like you was able to slip between realms it could come in handy later ah good thinking i don't think i really did anything all that creative though what don't tell me you climbed over the walls of fire oh hell no not even zoogles could do something that crazy nah i stowed away in what oh you'll like this the realms don't maintain much contact with each other but there are resources each is looking to trade for so there are cargo convoys from each of the lords that go around a few times a year to lend those resources to each other oh yeah i remember hearing about that that was the only time the gates of calaglia would ever open up right obviously they don't let dannon's ride with them so i snuck on board inside some cargo instead so you were carried out of the realm you did great not getting caught way to go uh let's just say i've always had a knack for sneaking around since i was little i was also really desperate to get the hell out of calaglia at the time i had more guts than brains that day if i had a guess i probably wasn't the first one to ever do something like that dan and orr ran it i wonder if that's how medic i mean ganna belt was able to hear about what happened in calaglia so quickly so in other words we should always assume that the enemy is informed about whatever it is that we may be up to wherever we go [Music] you
