know anything about ancients I know I've heard of them at least they come up in planetology books meant to be the original Stewart's of the planet could even commune with talk to it and stuff that must be why the Turks wanted her so badly of ancients this planet is my birthright you have failed again but through something isn't that [Music] cloud hmm that's nothing let's go a pretty crazy uh can you believe this mess you doing alright I am but I can't say the same about my birds for things are scared half to death over there what the hell are they doing here their jobs probably just focus on seeing Marlene again nothing else [Music] did you find what you were looking for thanks to you I did good never let it go again [Music] the street found him we're searching the compound as we speak sir [Music] you guys run into Jesse at the pillar yeah it's - but which wasn't up there with them he got home [Music] come on out don't need to be afraid we're all scared [Music] along I've been thinking y'all we've got to go find the others if we don't look for the movie a cloud gonna need your help with you too right [Music] [Music] my ears are still ringing from it this is sacrified right so where's this place you said Marlene is where I think she is it's a house on the other side of town come on me pick up the pace I'm going as fast as you are cloud I'm glad to see that you're okay in these trying times I hope to develop new material to help us endure [Music] [Music] cloud I have come up with the most fascinating theory perhaps you can lend me your assistance and gathering data to test it I have to tell you that I'm grateful for all of your help thus far I've done it I've developed a new materia [Music] you that's the house Molly Marlene where's Marnie is she here Aaron sorry I'm buried Marlene's my little girl Marlene she's got short hair she's cute as a button who with the heart of an angel she was wearing pink she was wearing dress today oh she's sleeping I want to see her too come on let's go look at on her keep it down don't wake her maybe you should join your friend upstairs Marlene my baby thank God Shinra has my daughter now I'm sorry no I'm the one who asked her to go get Marlene we had only just met but she was so kind and helpful I took advantage of her it's not your fault it was only a matter of time before she ended up back there because she's an ancient that it so she told you about that she must trust you all a great deal yes Aerith is an ancient probably the last one living she's not my daughter not by blood I mean if that's what you were wondering [Music] about 15 years ago my husband had been shipped off to fight on the front lines but then I received a letter saying he'd be home for a bit so when the day came I went to the station to meet him but he didn't come I couldn't help fearing the worst even then but I told myself his Leap must have been postponed that he'd been delayed every day I went to wait and to pray and that's how I met her are on her mother I thought maybe they'd run away from woolmarket or that they were top-siders fallen on hard times I'd seen that sort of thing a lot take Aerith somewhere safe those were her mother's dying words my husband had been away for so long and I was lonely so I convinced myself the safest place for the girl was with me it took no time at all for her to start feeling like family she was a real chatterbox [Music] she told me strange stories like how she and her mother had escaped from some sort of facility and how she wasn't sad because her mother had just returned to their planet their planet huh yeah that sounds about right I didn't understand any of it at the time when I asked if she meant one in the sky she said no this one right here I mean what can you say to that mommy don't be sad that's what she said to me one day out of the blue so I asked her what's wrong a man you really really love just died his heart came a long way to say goodbye but he couldn't stay cuz he had to return to the planet I didn't believe her of course and then a few days later I received a letter saying my husband had been killed in action [Music] things like that she just known it was a lot to deal with but we were happy and then can you knock now go away [Music] era you know you're not just any little girl you're a descendent of the Ancients I had no idea what he meant so I said who are the ancients they were the original stewards of the planet whose boundless knowledge and wisdom shall guide us to the promised land some believe the promised land to be a myth others an allegory of sorts but we take the words of the Scriptures at face value and believe it to be quite real [Music] which is why Xinhua would like very much for Aerith to help wrong I'm not an ancient but Aerith even when you're all alone don't you hear voices whispering secrets hmm but all three of us knew that wasn't true that man knew exactly who Aerith was where she'd come from and what she could do they know where she was but they didn't just take her doesn't sound like the turks i know she had to come willingly otherwise it wouldn't work they said that's why even if they did take her away I'm sure she's still being treated like a guest and that they'll send her straight back home once they get what they need I doubt it you're not planning anything are you don't make things worse than they already are if I lost her too I don't know if I could if I could ever just don't cloud maybe she's right about this maybe they'll let earth go when it's all over maybe we'd be better off waiting a little while let's head back to sector seven I've got things to take care of like checking up on the bar yeah okay [Music] you
