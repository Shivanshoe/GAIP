to get to these days london it's for jackson nice yeah why do you think i called you [ __ ] okay i gotta go um to help you blend in everyone here must wear one now your car fell through the london bombings they challenge everything many things are hard to get now car won't be a problem good but it is also your flat you have somewhere else you can go family it's complicated it is okay still family no you will see i will see [Music] thank you for accepting fixer contract one one three eight four two four two investigate merger between broken tech corporation and red part automated defense systems essay hereafter rem part sa context rempart sa is a french private security firm specializing in robotic forces last april they made overtures to acquire london's broke attack which specializes in advanced ai systems for negotiations thomas report ceo of rem heart sa sabotaged the deal after broken tech spun off its deep labs division into a new corporate entity but even without the deep labs shareholders of both companies stand to make this so why is thomas repart doing this objective reparts delay is illegal under french law infiltrate the deep labs and discover what thomas rempart is willing to risk lawsuits over recover documentation and physical samples to support roe discretion recommended get in get the evidence get out pretty tame as fixer contracts go nobody's home why would they leave the lab unguarded what the hell was that gotta make this quick need to find a security hub might be a way to unlock that door in there fortunately our surveillance team found out that rem part is mostly interested in a piece of technology being developed by our deep labs division something called the broker bridge the whole acquisition is just a ploy to get it so ramparts after something called the broker bridge oh acquisition attempt was just his way to get it i should keep going my door might be unlocked now none of this is legal not that it matters client wants the fruit they don't care if the tree's poison rampart's mark ii robots don't work without this broker bridge and he's already sold a million units so he needs to walk should see if there's a closed circuit box around here if i hack it or take it out it should let me through looks like thomas rampart never had an original idea in his life even stole his billion dollar robot design from some basement inventor yes thank you i understand you're saying that broke a tech will agree to a merger as long as i step down as ceo that's right but right now are they favorable so i'm [ __ ] if i don't step down i don't get the broker bridge and i'm jailed for fraud and if i do they they probably throw me under the bus anyways and then all this is a waste of time i've been trying to tell you we believe our networks have been penetrated they're probably watching right now [ __ ] [ __ ] okay so this other intruder can either cause remote equipment malfunctions but they're invisible so that's thomas rempart man-child with a private army dangerous combination broke a bridge chamber unsealed please ensure your identification is visible at all times broke a bridge chamber sounds like that's where i need to go this must be where they make this broken bridge as well get some photos of this too that'll do it now i just gotta grab this thing and get out of here then i guess i oughta look up

part of a smartphone activated explosive fuse you know where i could get something like that yeah i could uh ask around but uh hmm off the top of my head i've got an acquaintance who helps me import certain uh exotic goods i'd start with air smuggler if anyone knows where to get bombards dead on i'll push a location to your optic but um aiden this one's a favor for jackson in future you'll have to earn your own favors understood you know connie robinson oh you're her american pet supposed to be some kind of famous old tough guy yeah i don't know about that i'm looking for a place where someone can get bomb-making supplies in bulk hmm yeah sure uh i just um i can't think of it like right now see i'm just um i'm in this situation with albion this got me like so stressed out but um if you could help me out of it i'm sure that my mind will clear like right up fair enough what are the details feeling familiar you know don't grease the right palms and now my latest shipment stuck in the local fascist clubhouse got it keep a line open this won't take long ooh love the bravado very american hey good luck jackson look i don't know if you're listening on this channel right now but in case you are i just wanted to say the only reason i took the job that started all this is because it paid well enough so that i could set up you and your mom forever well anyway are you serious aiden i'm a phd student at one of the best stem schools in the world mom's doing great i don't need the money i don't always need a gun either but when i do i'm glad i have one listen to yourself you took the job because you love getting into gunfights with [ __ ] and talking like that that's not true yeah what are you doing right now getting distracted i should go yeah me too i reckon you're close right you're looking for a few little boxes little not a big box of guns you know what they say a little depleted uranium goes a long way depleted what yeah on that note you might want to use a delivery drone or something to move them you know just in case it's not quite as depleted as advertised i actually picked up a gadget earlier and then might do the trick shoot yourself i parked a van nearby with a lead-lined interior you'll probably want to use that to move them time to power down all right let's go [Music] suspect got your stuff but i think someone noticed it's gone my pursuit alerts lighting up i'm sure you can handle it hey here's a drop point take it there once you lose them location confirmed on my way come on man you're running for mercenaries in a van full of five-figure per unit anti-tank rounds and you aren't having let's keep this channel clear for updates i need to focus checkpoint has been breached over your shipment's at the draw point no i think you were gonna tell me where i could find someone who sells bomb-making supplies yeah yeah right i'll just drop you another pin easiest way all right thanks oh and uh i left you a little thank you present with connie more where that came from if you're willing to work i'll keep that in mind all right aidan me mate left you something here if you're looking to gear up guns money disguises whatever me and me spars would be willing to trade for favors noted hey connie tells me you picked up my care package here's the location for that uh shopping center you were looking for appreciate it [Music] aidan hey i just happen to be looking at your optic feed i notice you're getting pretty close to some gangster turf am i going to see this on the newsletter i'm just after some documents not that i care but what kind of documents i'm looking for someone who bought a lot of bomb-making supplies recently and even black marketeers have to keep legitimate books for laundering and insurance so if i can get those books and eliminate the clients against a few international most wanted lists i can narrow it down and you're looking for a bomb maker to stop him that's right okay good just be careful i guess this one wasn't selling bomb supplies strike units you are cleared to begin lethal force authorized operation silk road is green repeat the operation is green [ __ ] ambiance closing in gotta get that data now or they'll back it up looks like this person was selling contraband optics that's a bomb maker's client list if i've ever seen one hold on looks like that truck i destroyed earlier was a massive shipment about to head out to rem park the thing i got it might have been nothing but then he might be on the wrench gotta hurry this up all right one thing at a time let's look at this bomb maker's client list eliminate the usual suspects and that leaves anime sex pillows llc hello wrench let's see what's in your file [Music] what the hell is that jackson sorry thought it was muted he left the video permissions open and i couldn't help myself sucks about the dead end not a total bust i learned the guy i'm after is thorough methodical and smart enough to cover his tracks and he probably does all that goofy stuff so nobody takes him seriously as a threat exactly he wears a mask dyed his face but the performance is the real disguise sounds like someone else i know hey look this feels weird can we talk like in person of course i'll be there right away imperial college of london engineering department phd candidate lmpt mixed martial arts gym membership monthly order of one box buff max protein bar yet if you actually found jackson you would have just said so no i would have showed you so you would believe me is that what it's gonna take for you to turn in your accomplice i told you i don't know him but i can find him but honestly right now i'm thinking about coming to see you instead stupid idea you said it yourself i am very rich and my family is richer even if you kill me you would ruin your nephew's life you're already responsible for the death of his sister could you really hurt him like that again you'll get your gadget i'm hanging up now okay i've had a minute to think and i'm gonna help you no jackson i can't let you get involved i didn't ask for you to come and all my life's on hold until you're gone so why don't you just bring me up to speed you're right so there's this rich scumbag called thomas rampart he needs something called the broker bridge or he's gonna go to jail for a scam he's running on the government rampart robotics guy right does private security that's right and let me guess he hired you to grab this broker thing and then he turned out to be an [ __ ] pretty close the broker bridge was stolen by this old deadset clown goes by wrench and rampart probably thought you two were working together and then he threatened me if you didn't turn over this wrench guy over to him exactly and frankly i'd love to but i have no idea where he is so that's why you're looking into bomb supplies you know i do know my way around london pretty well at this point i might be able to turn up a leader too all right just don't put yourself in any danger yeah yeah yeah jackson i'll be fine remember hey i meant to say this might take me a while so you might want to find something else to do in the meantime right i think your resistance friends might have some work for me good thinking they should be able to help you get outfitted too if any of this goes sideways you're going to want to make sure your equipment's up to snuff so you're the one they called the fox your reputation precedes you and you must be angel should i be flattered or concerned depends on how you handle a little favor for me i need you to track down a friend of mine sonya mayfield amateur boxing champ now runs a local gym she went missing a few days ago so long as your favor doesn't meet free any idea what could have happened to her she have any enemies i'd like to know sonia was a pillar in this community she ran free classes for the local kids so she could keep them off the streets i'm looking to win i'm locked out looks like someone closed the place up there's a ctos camera nearby maybe it picked up something understood angel i got stills from the ctos camera looks like sonia met with clan kelly before she went awol sending to you now glenn kelly oh [ __ ] i recognize this [ __ ] they hit up a kelly club house that runs underground fights so it wasn't a random visit clan kelly targeted her for her boxing history but for what i'm sending you the address now hurry all right i'm here what's your plan to get in are you gonna start shooting that sounds judgmental coming from you sony is probably in there and i don't want her to wind up as collateral damage and i want to know what's going on you won't get information by killing everyone inside yeah i heard you i think i've got an idea for how to blend in i'm gonna enjoy this your idea was to enter the tournament no better way to check out the action than be right in it [Applause] this will be a love not her either how many people are you gonna have to go through [Music] oh my god what absolutely disgusting hey that's sonia you found her now that's entertainment and one massive blow to our fighter oh [ __ ] could that be right there how about this if i don't kill you well that's what happens when your [ __ ] [Applause] [Applause] [ __ ] madonna no thanks to you are you sonya mayfield angel sent me to find you really did he tell it to completely [ __ ] me over too what are you talking about the match the only reason i signed up for this 20 was because the prize money would have kept my gym doors open now i'm gonna lose it the bank will take everything this was about the prize money take it then angel thought something bad had happened to you turns out you were just fighting for clan kelly it's not that simple they wanted a champion for their league so while they may not have literally put a gun to my head they made saying yes my only real option and i am the lucky one they've dragged other people here to fight and cage them up after forks at all them are across them clan kelly are holding people hostage and forcing them to fight i can't let that go on okay i hope you make them appear and thanks that gym means everything to me you can't leave these people here pierce people shouldn't be chained up to fight like dogs [ __ ] dogs shouldn't be chained up either don't worry i wasn't planning on it oh come on um yes [Music] i got us a lead really oh i figured wrench wouldn't be the type to steer clear of the authorities for very long so i went poking around in albion's body cam archives and look what i found look behind him that's brixton and i don't see that drone he rides around on anywhere which probably means he's close to home good eye but not enough to go on yet even if you're right he's too careful and if we spend too long looking around you'll notice and run we have to narrow it down hang on yeah yeah i've got just the thing for that i'm dropping you a pin start moving where am i going here watch this that a masked terrorist has set off a blast at a rampart automated defense systems facility here in the capital terrorism experts have identified the man pictured here as an american deadset operative known as the wrench london's own dead sex cell was dismantled following their cowardly attack on the city less than a month ago so now we must ask has the wrench come to london to finish what they started he might have left something behind at the renpart facility exactly see what you can turn up hey jackson if you had any more questions about anything that happened before if that would help you you can ask them i i think it might help both of us okay well let's try one out oh god well i've had a hard time remembering what things were like before it happened can't even remember what i was like that was pretty young but well mom always used to call me eden by accident i guess we were allowed to like his kids so maybe you were a bit like me when you were my age too hmm yes i wasn't so bad then don't give yourself too much credit i'm still better looking all right looks like i beat the rubberneckers at least probably not for long you'll want to be in and out [Music] what the hell happened here looks like he modified the robot's friend or foe identification they just shot anything that moved reckless look at this place civilians could have been hurt yeah the sooner we find this guy the better i'll hack into their bios dig through their data and see if we can't find where they dump their camera locks copy that all right hack in there let's see if we can find it [ __ ] looks like he wiped their cameras it gets worse you just tripped a script payload that locked you in there what the hell hello thomas looking for this oh [Music] sucks right look man i know all about your little scam involving the mark twos all i gotta do is smash this thing you lose your company and go to would you though i'm not sure you probably got arrested maybe even convicted you lose some money but you still be rich so you do what four months nah no no no i didn't go through all this just to set you back i wanna [ __ ] you the way you [ __ ] me with a sandpaper condom put your thug controlled robot design on the internet for free that way anyone who wants one can steal it looks like wrench left this is a trap for rem part and i stumbled into him i can't do anything from here give me a minute i'll come help no don't i can handle it just give me a minute let's shut things down hey man that guy in the video was like an internet troll crawled out of the internet that's who we're chasing he's a bit more dangerous than that do you see any clues to his location on that video i'm scrubbing it now no windows no takeout containers hang on yes is that yes i got him really how you can start heading to brixton if you want to get moving i'll explain on the way all right tell me what i'm doing in brixton go back and watch the video right in the corner of his workbench you can see an arduino board connected to one of his gadgets arduino so he's controlling his gadgets with radio waves probably through an optic how does that help it doesn't unless you can get into high frequency radio range then all you have to do is ping every nearby object whenever you have a high concentration of objects with a low latency pingback you've got a big collection of arduino boards and a whole arsenal of gadgets and since we already know he's in brixton all you have to do is go there and i can use the arduino pingback to find his hideout great work jackson so i've been thinking when this is done you and me should probably sit down and really talk about things sure and like then but i do have a question now if that's all right about lena no it's that well you don't look good aiden i'm worried about you when are you gonna stop all this thanks i keep trying to retire never takes there's a lot of ways to help people i've helped a lot of people and i've never shot anyone can we talk about this later yeah yeah just think a little bit about an exit strategy okay cause right now every end of this thing i can see looks pretty bleak [Music] all right you're real close now all those gadgets are routed through the local ctos hub find the hub and i can pinpoint the exact location you got it this whole area's wide open that'll be a problem if he gets on that drone of his already on that all the drones in london are on a ctos air traffic control system i just need to hack a local relay and reboot it should ground everything for a few minutes it's not worth exposing yourself for rem part's still looking for you keep your head down i'll be fine also i left 20 minutes ago so it's a moot point do your thing jackson how's that drone controller coming jackson come back where are you that's it i'm aborting coming to you no no no bad idea bud what the hell are you doing on this channel i told you when i found jackson i wanted you to see it so you would believe me say hello to uncle aiden i'm sorry aidan i [ __ ] up oh poor little cabbage he'll be staying with me until you bring me the broker bridge this makes your bargaining position clear right i've already found wrench i'll have it in 30 minutes good kill him and i'll pay you a million dollars on top of giving jackson back i'm serious hey aiden uh in the spirit of uh friendly whatever we are just thought i'd let you know that that's not my real safe house you're outside of right now it's uh nope it's it's a decoy it's uh yeah yeah it's a decoy it's over wrench tell me where you are uh no can do oh and if any security drones show up just know they'll leave you alone as soon as you go away so please go away not going to happen they're gone i think all right so yeah that is my real safe house you got me but of course i had an emergency exit i mean could you imagine if i didn't have another way out of here i'm done what i have to be i mean pretty dumb go and see what they go to [Music] hey hey come on come on we're on the same side here broke a bridge now there really [ __ ] okay hang on hang on just no mask no wrench just reggie look you can't give that thing to rampart whatever deal you have with him he's gonna try to [ __ ] you over believe me i wouldn't know he's not stupid he knows who i am he knew who i was too that's why he was interested in my company he said he read about my rumored dead set connections in a wired article you designed the robots yeah i know robots but he knew business he had this whole speech about space flight and human evolution and and i completely [ __ ] fell for it yeah i heard part of the story so what now you want revenge no well yes but mostly i'm just tired of [ __ ] criminals and con men running the world i don't know what i want exactly i just know he can't win sorry reggie i have no choice [Music] for what it's worth i spent my life fighting people like when part doesn't work so what we're all supposed to just give up no you shouldn't some fights are worth losing rempart it's me i've got your broker bridge put jackson on cool he's right here aiden i'm fine don't let this [ __ ] tell you what to do that's enough for now you are so close to being through this eden don't [ __ ] it up i'm on my way you're being very trusting for all you know i could be planning to kill you and your nephew you said your people looked into me what did they find that there are a lot of stories about the fearsome aiden pierce most people say that all the violence in chicago was just a regular gang war i got blamed on some boogeyman called the fox but having met you i believe the myth after chicago they say you went global for a few years i found a few links between you and the murder of some warlords blood diamond traitors dictators a dozen more rumors of the same and that brings us more or less to the present day but what does any of this have to do with you walking in here and simply trusting me to honor our deal look at it this way if even half of what you said is true is crossing me really worth the risk you know what i agree there's no angle in it bring me the broker bridge and this is all over all right here we go time to get jackson back ah you're here finally i've ordered everyone to stand by your nephew and i will be waiting for you in my office good hand the broker bridge over and leave the premises once i verify it hasn't been damaged i'll release your nephew not gonna happen i'm leaving with jackson stupid i guess this means we're at an impasse aiden not for long let's make things interesting ugh i'm coming in now jackson better be there and he better be unharmed mr pierce do you have it we're going no no no not before i confirm it works it's okay get up hello thomas what i've already said everything i need to say to you so this is actually a message for aiden still there buddy what the hell is this hold on it's a quick one stop go stop them go [ __ ] try the door the building's locked

dirty sometimes kid uncle aiden's a prime example of that uncle aiden also routinely gets shut up and just recently almost died and is now in a coma and your point is got the vital signs monitor end with minimal chaos just like you asked are you proud of me uh if you say so i knew i'd win you over no one can stay mad at this handsome mug the vigilante known as the fox surveyed the clearing through steely eyes looking at all the bad guys he was gonna come are you trying to role plays dude just trying to think what would ayden do and he could steamroll through this whole gang no sweat yeah because that's so cool is sarcasm any way to speak about your elders you and everyone put aiden on a pedestal he's either the coolest vigilante or he's the worst villain it's weird because he's also my uncle that frankly kept putting me in danger and then just stopped showing up oh okay look they even packed it up nicely for me you'd have to search through it quickly clankly doesn't leave product unsupervised for long oh i've got a better idea instead of picking and choosing some drugs i'll just take all the drugs how and please don't say up your nose that sounds fun but i'm working you man i'm gonna call my buddy little droid friend and fly the whole thing out of here great i'm sending you the coordinates to a drop-off point so you can get the supplies to me special delivery for a connie looking for at least a 20 tick well done i'll make sure jackson gets what he needs as for the rest well the resistance will find a use for it cheers wrench jackson your shopping list is on its way that'll help me keep aiden breathing but i don't know what to do about the coma what if i swing by that big hospital i can dig through their database and see if they have any information on treating coma patients that's actually a really good idea you've got to keep it quiet though we were avoiding the hospital because of rampart don't worry your uncle wrench can be so so sneaky oh london's running on a fancy upgrade are you gonna have a problem accessing the hospital database please ctos may have got in the facelift but that does not mean she's better than [Music] me [Music] thank you long-term patient ward [ __ ] are all the doctors on break physician what's thou neglect the poor souls and i care come on doc people are slowly dying over here yes imbue me with all of your knowledge okay i'm done i'm heading back now and i'm sending you the coma protocols leave it to your uncle wrench thanks and you keep trying but i am not calling you uncle wrench oh come on so what's the verdict did that doctor's info hell there's nothing on how to actually revive someone from a coma so i'm just stuck waiting for when or if he wakes up don't worry he's aiding [ __ ] pierce he'll wake up again that's easy for you to say but what if he doesn't what the hell do we do then look you can stay here for as long as you need i'm gonna go blow up the other half of rembar's face are you kidding aidan's in a coma right now and you're thinking about revenge uh yeah or do you not remember the crazy robot man who wants us all dead do you not remember that you're the reason why rampart went after aiden in the first place and why aiden is in a coma right now wow hurtful i need to keep looking for ways to help him with you or not all right all right fine ah [ __ ] satan's phone again all right [ __ ] i've tracked your location this is your final warning blah blah blah bottom line let aidan pierce go or i'm gonna send a bunch of people your way to cut you into tiny little pieces and deliver them to me gift wrap capisce jesus dude listen i'm not holding aidan hostage i'm helping jackson back me up what the [ __ ] you're with jackson i thought you were one of rem parts hired mooks hold on hold on you got a private channel or something i gotta get off this burner one sec all right i'm back and i've got some burning questions so one who the [ __ ] are you and two what happened to aiden well i'm wrench and alien is in a coma a [ __ ] coma how the hell did that happen i kind of uh half blew them up [ __ ] now i've got a problem here ratchet it's wrench i have a fixer contract that needs doing but my best guy is out indefinitely i thought rampart was responsible but now i'm finding out it's you partially responsible please don't chop me into little pieces okay ratchet i need you to wipe some data from rem part facilities can you handle that got it go to nexus tower and steal their prototype combat drone not what i said but uh sure let's see where this goes so once i get my drone what exactly am i wiping from ramparts facilities again every trace of the broken tech deal scorched earth were the exact words the clan used scorched earth i love scorched earth why didn't you lead with that i don't think they meant it literally but yeah that was their mistake donuts impress you most impressive why hello there you hot piece of drone you uh want to get out of here i know a nice little spot where we can park and uh you know talk and stuff don't tell your dad huh weird man uh but who am i to judge let's do this all right let's scorch some earth where am i going jordy marking it for you now so this client wants to wipe out every trace of broca tech from ramparts facilities right uh-huh that's right which means they know about aiden's contract which means they're probably the same client who hired him right oh so there's a brain behind the paintball mask interesting is it sky larson she runs broke attack so that much makes sense look the fixers wouldn't be a very discreet criminal organization if we went around blabbing who hired us to do their illegal [ __ ] i can't tell you so you do know yeah but same answer it's called professionalism ratchet all right that's the first location there i'll take everything you need to take oh sorry tommy was that expensive well why don't you just take it out of what you homie you wouldn't break little scrooge mcduck wow you really hate that brick huh it does seem to have that effect on people oh yeah sorry i forgot this was on it's all good vent away marking the next thing all right that's the second location there taking all the targets light them up with pleasure so if the client's not sky larsen is it albion like maybe they're trying to clear around part out of london so they can take over all this [ __ ] uh getting colder but you know that's actually a good idea i should have tried to work that angle as a side thing next time so all right here we go the mysterious client is thomas rampard himself for uh some reason let me ask you something why do you care you get paid the same whether you know or not honestly i really screwed up here if there was some kind of shadowy puppet master that was really behind this whole game situation i feel a lot better about it okay i shouldn't say this but i like you ratchet i see some of myself and you so there's a tiny little spoiler there's no skiing no old enemy out for a [ __ ] just [ __ ] up people doing [ __ ] up [ __ ] to each other yeah that's what i was afraid of all right just one stop left then it's straight on through to paydaysville marking it now paydaysville do you mean to talk like frank sinatra or does it just sort of come to you it mostly just comes to me hey man sorry the big reveal was kind of a bummer but i think i've got something that's going to cheer you up is it blowing up more ramparts though it's blowing up more rambo marking your targets nice work but quick update there's been a complication what is it the client's making a bigger deal about all the wanton destruction that i thought they would like they're refusing to pay threatening to expose us and obviously we can't have that is this a problem we can fix by blowing up more stuff actually i need you to clone a copy of the rem part hq server under that drone for me to use his leverage but i'd be surprised if you didn't blow up a few things in the process okay i'd say that in my wheelhouse all right i'm cloning the server now you know the client sure found out about our little rampage pretty quickly they did didn't they and if you were still interested in who they are that's what i would call a clue so i realized you didn't answer when i guess the client was rampart hotter or colder hotter actually way harder really how does that work tell you what finish that download these guys are still being a pain in my ass i might find myself in a forthcoming mood one sec they're calling me again there that should remind these idiots not to [ __ ] with the contract after the fact you still want to know who they are well i feel like that's fair game at this point now you're just going to tell me just like that call it an investment in our ongoing business relationship the client is rem parts board of directors specifically the chairman louis edmund rempart thomas rempartz father come on really why would he screw over his own son like that because none of what tommy is up to in london is sanctioned the board hired aiden to find out what he was doing and now they wish they hadn't his shenanigans have put the whole conglomerate in jeopardy so now they just want to wipe the slate and ever so quietly move tommy boyd to the baguette division or wherever somewhere he can't do any damage so if rampart doesn't get the broker bridge and pull off his plan his dad's gonna hang the [ __ ] on his son to protect the company is this joy i'm feeling see you can make money and make the world a better place hit me up if you want to run any more fixer gigs take it easy wrench what am i an open hotline who are you i'm skye larsen founder of brokertech i have a proposal for you we should speak in person no you send an offer to my people and maybe i'll consider i'm the only chance you have at saving aiden pierce i'll send the coordinates to your optic hey jackson what do you know about skye larson i literally have her books on my shelf i have a subscription to her master class webinar series and i won her larsen family scholarship she's brilliant okay didn't expect to unpack a big crush there super sweet but i think there's something sketchy about this if she can help aiden we don't have a choice hey normally i'd be down for an icy british woman telling me what to do but this time i'm a little nervous if i was a multi-millionaire i'd have a nice [ __ ] too wait is she a billionaire greetings reginald blackman yeah jesus skye larson is in the sitting room your [ __ ] house knows my name whoa cool hologram is this about the death star plans i need you to pay attention mr blackman this ranch i know you have the broker bridge okay now you're right i am holding on to it but just for safekeeping scout's honor because of your recent spat thomas rem part has decided that if he can't have the broker bridge he'll go right to the direct source he's taken my deep lives hostage i need you to clear out his forces and give me control of my lab's back okay i'm not even gonna get into how creepy it is that you know all this [ __ ] but you said you could help aiden if you secure my labs i'll help you revive aiden pierce from his coma how do you know what the deep labs are built for why they kept a secret bring the broker bridge to the labs and i'll show you what it can really do okay one don't be mad that the love of your life was flirting with me and two you get the feeling we're jumping into a [ __ ] storm here yeah but this is what we gotta do to help aiden why are you still risking your neck to help him even though he's done bad by you because everybody deserves a chance to set things right even after they [ __ ] up like i'm sure no matter how mad he is at you your buddy in san francisco want you to call him back whoa what hey did you read my diary no dude you play those voicemails from marcus all the time on speaker just calling back trust me oh okay shut up skye said we needed to bring the broker bridge she must not know you blew it up what do we do yeah about that get ready for me to blow your mind next time wait is that the broker bridge the other one was a fake fake broken bridge real bomb i stashed this one where no one could ever find it in the postal service been in limbo circuiting the city this whole time nice all right let's get it to broke attack all right i'm here and they've definitely gone through a rebranding rampart's got his goons all over the place you'll have to get through them to find a way inside don't worry i'm wearing my ass kicking pants today boom bye-bye bad guys we've got a problem the levels to the deep labs have been disabled rem parts lock that whole level down don't worry i know another way in and it's a job for lady smash i'm in rambar left behind some of his buddies here too so you know that calls for a little ambiance won't that give away that you're here hey that just makes it more fun let's party new orders new work orders for all of you i want to see what the best of broca tech is capable of you all would have belonged to me in the merger if skye larson didn't [ __ ] me over so consider this a delayed acquisition [Music] you see my team members posted around your workstations don't you you think those weapons are for decorations what you're submitting to me is unacceptable it's income you dare show your face here trying to take skye's land disk thomas you know you've got a real problem with stealing other people's [ __ ] and passing it off as your own you should have been flattered that your work was worth stealing but just like your ex i've moved on to better and just like his car i'm gonna [ __ ] up your [ __ ] with a sledgehammer oh boo hoo did i break all your toys you're a dead man you just don't know it yet your business venture here's done for tommy your company's toast and you've got nothing i made short of it oh i got exactly what i came here for and your reckoning is coming but for now i can be patient next time i see you i'm gonna peel the skin off your face slowly well ladies and gentlemen and all other fine folk with that mr rem part has left the building excellent aiden pierce is being transported here as we speak you will need to reactivate the command system so i have access the timeline you're requesting is unrealistic it doesn't account for any pre-flight testing or even for a proper build i don't like excuses and that's all i'm hearing if your team doesn't feel motivated enough then one of you will get randomly selected to be a test subject until there's none of you left to complain that's insane you're insane you know i don't like that word either there you should be back in then we can begin come on big guy gentlemen shall we begin you have the broker bridge the system requires two users the pilot who uses the broker bridge and the subject who is connected to the reader this will allow you to interface with aiden's mind it will scan his brain and create a visual projection that you can engage with and that's how i'll be able to revive him well the hope is that you'll be able to communicate with him and perhaps identify or repair any damage how long does this usually take i'm eager to find out wha wait wait wait you mean you've never done this before this is the first human trial the most exciting phase of a project god damn it you [ __ ] lied to us you never cared about taking red butt out of your labs he swan is here to be your [ __ ] guinea pigs semantics jackson this is insane okay there is no guarantee this is going to wake up baby i i i say we grab him we get the [ __ ] out of here and we'll find a better way there isn't a better way i have to do it you could wind up in a coma too or worse everyone deserves a chance oh my god that sounds so incredibly profound what the [ __ ] does that even mean it means i'm going in for aiden whoa where am does this mean i'm inside aiden's mind hey this looks just like my old house actually i think it is my old house where i grew up huh can't go in this way hello is anybody home maybe i can get into the backyard aiden hey aiden honestly i didn't think it would be this easy to find you let's get out of here get out of here yeah exit the simulation or whatever this technically is is that door the way out i can't see anything else like it so i think it's our best bet i'm working on what i need to bury something i lost a couple things in the house my hat and my coat i won't be ready without them ready for what can you get that for me aiden you're hurt and i'm trying to help you wake up you want to be helpful go get my phone at least this door's unlocked it's way too clean in here that kitchen was always a mess we spent all our time in there and i

calling uh mom actually she didn't sound happy yeah i don't blame her are you ready to leave with me now i still need my hat and my code aiden i don't know how else to say this but you got hurt and

is concluded here today gentlemen i suggest you wrap things up and take your lead both definitely both thanks for it you know i know ah what a beautiful reunion gosh i'm tearing up over here you can't

just promise me your firstborn and now i'm off wait where are you going i'm glad you got aiden back now i've got my own thing to sell going after rem part listen man i just went into the mind of a guy who had trouble letting [ __ ] go it wasn't fun maybe you should just walk away from this i really can't okay well then we'll help you whatever you need to do let's do it together we've got you okay all right let's do this wrench we're set up back at your hideout so where do you think rampart might be rembar's burned all his bridges with his business partners in london so i think he'll try to start fresh somewhere else does he have a private jet i can't picture him strolling through heathrow reports got a private barge docked at the thames on the books moves company cargo off the books he smuggles in people contraband you name it jordy used it once or twice um is your friend jordy a sociopath yeah probably he's so scary but also sexy anyway uh so that barge is rumbard's best bet to get out of the city discreetly i need to catch up with him just got clearance to exit the thames he's hit open waters [ __ ] how am i gonna catch up to him now swim i think i know someone who can help you out there was a boat captain that helped me smuggle into the city let him know you're coming oh phew i mean hey i look great in a speedo but i can't actually swim that fast my legs are too skinny just tell me what are you gonna do to him when you catch up to him kill him yeah duh obviously is that what you really want reggie rampart's a scumbag but you've worked with him you have a history with him even if it's justified killing him won't settle things the way you want it to you want to lecture me about that really this is why you're running support pierce senior no backseat revenge you look like a seafaring scallywag are you aiden's ship captain aiden we you say you need a boat yes please i need a boat to get onto a bigger boat and you are his uh family uh well not not exactly but i do kind of look up to aiden like he's my grumpy uncle so you know we're still equals but he's more like my second cousin brother uncle father figure ah still complicated let's go i better find a way to disable this barge before rampart hits international waters find the barge controls in the navigation room don't do anything you'll regret i'll have a look doing a sweep of the [ __ ] locked out of the navigation controls i'm gonna need to shut down the engine itself but i don't know how to get to it you like being hands-on i bet your drone would come in handy for this i am so proud of you right now i'm cheering up i knew you would come i'm glad actually i didn't want to leave london before giving you a parting gift oh well if it's of the appealing face-off variety keep it no you won't think it's funny when i return the favor when the tissue necrotizes in your face it feels like a knife stabbing into you hot cold hot cold but you'll feel it a thousand times worse because i don't believe in an eye for an eye i believe in an eye for the whole [ __ ] face that's not very christian of you tommy that's it the barges lost main power override the final engine and ground this boat for good aye aye captain barge is grounded it's not going anywhere i'm picking up on a remote signal coming from the barge and massive power spikes coming from the cargo hold he's activated something something big get ready for a fight targets has been located [Music] [Applause] oh [ __ ] me care for a demonstration jackson ayden how do i fight this thing nothing you've got will get you through those shields hang in there we'll find a way to get them down [Music] excuse me stop right where you are all right [Music] oh that's it the shields are down finally all right you ugly son of a toaster let's dance [Music] oh my god is so big and angry you need to hit its weak spot that's not enough to take me down i'll crush your spine and make you beg for death i'm not done until i've made you suffer it's almost down just a bit more [ __ ] there you are it's no use i can build another prototype you have no way of stopping me oh i've got one way yeah reggie so sure i was gonna kill you [ __ ] but it's so much easier too you know i didn't start working with you for the money i mean sure i thought you were a spoiled [ __ ] with too much hair wax by the way but you had a dream remember you told me you wanted to see humanity reach the stars we're gonna do that together man i lie to you you naive [ __ ] prick i'll hunt you down and all your little friends back in san francisco sitara josh marcus dick [Music] i won't lie i didn't expect you to turn him over to i'll be in custody well i asked myself what would aiden pierce do and then i asked myself is that who i really wanted to be no offense big guy i think you made the right call even if i wanted to smash him into teeny tiny little pieces and scatter them all over the thames and turn him into seagull [ __ ] well progress is a journey what's next on the dock for you heading home nah i think i might hang around london for a bit grab up a few things but i do think i'll give marcus a call though actually hey yeah i wanna i wanna take a selfie from big ben and send it to him or huh maybe i should go to buckingham palace and steal a roll of some royal tv get him a souvenir great looks like whatever trouble you get into will have to fish you out of it oh that's so sweet what a nice family moment we really do make the dream team don't we jackson and his two uncles two uncles shh it's okay don't worry about it wow looks like the three of you got a lot done together color me impressed truly i am a miracle worker if you're not sticking around for a bit i could use a hand down the road one of my contacts managed to find a dead sick member who survived the london attacks she's been hiding out in the north this whole time we need to set up a communication link with her no problemo connie we got this grace once i've gathered all the details i'll be in touch let's say it all together now gu team hidden come on you gotta say it with me go team you
