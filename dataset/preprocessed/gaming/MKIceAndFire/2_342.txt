[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] normally i don't pick on the weak yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these little ones are hardly worth our time less talking more pummeling let me know if you're struggling [Music] what a rush [Music] i'll take you all on rising library dragon shot here i come you're finished here i come there you're finished could you try to be less patronizing i didn't mean [Music] another notch in the old belt keep them coming you like that taste of freedom kid i think i could get used to it [Music] houses in a place like this people really live all the way out here [Music] the whole area is just little villages this one's mesia224 wait i hear something sounds like people arguing bureau agents the snake eyes must be here we should sneak past them that was my original plan since you all stick out so much why in case one of your people tattles on us it's the renins who are making us do it oh yeah like this renin who you need to save your people's skin oh that's a rich coming from the bright eyes whose people are the reason we're in this mess in the first place but she started it three centuries of resentment is too much to lay at a single person's feet same goes for you shion you can't ignore the past when speaking of the present [Music] now what's going on in that village if i were to guess someone tipped off the snake eyes and they're here to make an arrest you'd better not be about to suggest we get involved i'm here for the lord's head and nothing more that go for you two elfin why did you come why to liberate this realm slaves of course are you still a slave me no then tell me what it means to live unshackled i'll tell you what it means it means living on your own terms being your own master thinking and making decisions for yourself and being prepared to accept the consequences understand [Music] yeah i think so good so prove it to me xi'an don't start with me i'm not going and that's that i understand just wait here with renwell till we get back okay you're going in without the sword looks to be that way this is my choice after all your choice listen to yourself that sword's useless to me without someone to use it you go dying on me out there and you'll put our whole mission in jeopardy but i need us all to make it safely to sislo then too many sacrifices have already been made we came here to put a stop to any more you've you've sacrificed something too huh hide somewhere until it's over you hear me damn those renins i hate seeing dan and suffering under them here too i'm surprised you're so angry about it you're not even from here it doesn't matter where i'm from enough is enough with these people [Music] silence embedded anyone who fails to cooperate will be arrested and tried as a traitor to the realm damn it some rat must have sold us out again you there you want me to haul you up on suspicion of civil disobedience but i didn't what [Music] leave him alone [Music] an embedded dares to find the orders of his lordship know your place slave [Music] we can't use the blazing sword this close to the villagers they could get hurt but there are too many agents zephyr [Music] law is that you what's going on aren't we supposed to be fighting them you're alive what are you doing here the realm of cislodia doesn't tolerate civil dissidents like you law i hereby detain you in the name of his lordship [Music] zephyr what the hell [Music] [Music] you picked the wrong fight i'll take you all off [Music] [Music] here [Music] did you just hear me yes i need you remember are you trying to get caught i'm sure that could be arranged not if i can help it try harder the board oh [Music] [Music] [Music] what's going on zephyr why won't you fight him is that soldier someone you know don't hurt him what are you please it won't work you know you never changed you've always got that damn i got it handled he just he's my son oh so now you remember me the nerve of you i'm gonna wipe that damn look off your face once and for all what in hell enemy reinforcements use the sword i can't the villagers will get caught in the blast we need to fall back oh for crying out loud suffer go leave without me you can't i'm not leaving without him elfin there's no time but what about the resistance everyone's counting on you forgive me [Music] we've waited all night but nobody's shown up no sign of zephyr or an enemy pursuit so what's the plan now you really need to ask we go rescue zephyr if he's under arrest they'll have taken him to sisloden the capital city assuming he's still alive that is i can't believe zephyr never told us he had a son i wonder if the rest of the crimson crows knew about it and to find him in that village of all places some coincidence huh those fireworks you pulled out of your hat back there they were astral arts weren't they shion what the hell are you doing i've never heard of a dannon who can cast astral arts are you a renin like hell i am no of course not renon's eyes light up when they use astral arts and when you used an art your eyes definitely didn't so i guess that means you can't be a so-called bright eyes after all [Music] sorry [Music] you're right those were astro arts i used same as the ones wielded by the renin's a long time ago my family my people were once known as mages a dan and mage up until now i'd only ever heard of them in stories and rumors though now i've seen one with my own eyes i suppose i'll have to believe it we've been in hiding for a long long time even before the renin's first attacked that's why no one knew about us even before the renance yeah my ancestors were persecuted and targeted for their gifts but it was by their fellow dannons they lived hidden away all these centuries keeping their existence secret even from the resistance my mom and dad drilled it into me that i was never under any circumstances supposed to let anyone find out about us if that's the case then why did you use your powers back there i don't know one second i saw zephyr about to be killed and the next i was dannon astral arts if the renins knew such a threat existed there'd be hell to pay hey what you think i'm gonna go to the lords with this information i'm a traitor and an outcast at this point or did you forget what amazes me is how anyone could have that kind of power and yet keep it hidden all this time didn't you ever want to use it to help your people don't talk like you know the first thing about me renin that's enough zephyr wouldn't want this listen all i care about is taking out the lords okay which is no doubt what her people want too using her powers to help do it only makes sense makes sense for who us besides zephyr comes first we can't just abandon him [Music] it's fine huh going to save zephyr right if so you're going to need my powers to do it i don't want anyone else to die are you sure then let's get back to the village we need to find out what happened what's wrong nothing just i'm surprised how dark out it is why wouldn't it be it's still night after all no that's what's weird a lot of times passed since we arrived in ciscodia you'd figure the sun would have come up by now oh right it's not like this back in calaglia is it to be honest i completely forgot uh basically it's always night in this realm huh it's been that way forever it never gets any brighter outside even in the morning so it's always dark all day long but how how is that even possible did the remnants cost this of course they did it's complicated to explain though it'd be easier to just get the syslog in so you can see what's going on for yourself i'll take your word for it but right now finding zephyr comes first [Music] i wonder how zephyr's doing if that law guy is his son they shouldn't be rough with him i want to believe that but those two didn't look like they're exactly on good terms actually now i'm curious can dannon's enlist in the snake eyes too definitely they're useful for surveillance here doesn't win you many friends on either side though so why zephyr's kid working for the renin's then all of creation across the heavens stems from the six essences we lack only darkness while they are without light thus to achieve perfection what are you muttering over there i was practicing a magic incantation an incantation is it anything like the spells that people use today not quite it takes time for me to finish my chance so i'm practicing saying them quickly and accurately you know just in case i've always tried my best never to use magic if i can avoid it up until now you said you and your family used to live in hiding right because you were a mage where did all the other mages go [Music] sorry i didn't realize it was such a sensitive topic [Music] it's okay [Music] hey so uh about my magic you want to keep it a secret right yeah sorry a little late for that after what happened in the village don't you think ah easy shion it's just i didn't want zephyr to die that's why i used it i know and we might have lost him without your help so thank you rinwell sure is that owl okay it's been stiff as a board for a while now you're right i wonder what's up with it come here it's okay i won't hurt you crap huh what happened i hate to say this rinwell but i lost hoodle i didn't mean to scare him but he took off poodle he's right next to you yes all i see is snow dan and owls conceal themselves when they feel threatened i guess he's still not quite used to being around other people yet that would explain it i should have been more careful with him sorry it's fine i'm the only human he's comfortable with come here damn he was that close he's just a little wary of you i think he gets that you're going to be with us for a while though step in the right direction if you call his name he might eventually respond at least got it thanks at least he's not sick or something indeed it's quite a relief [Music] [Music] you make sure to rest too hoodle enemies who can cast astral arts can be pretty difficult not only are they powerful but their range lets them strike us before we even get close actually i can just disrupt astral arts what do you mean when someone is casting an art their focus has to be entirely on the incantation so right when they're completing the casting i just kind of steal it from them really then what do you do with the energy you've stolen i hold on to it and use it whenever i want like i can with my own magic the thing is i can only unleash that art once after i use it it's gone oh also when i steal astral energy the enemy will lose focus which means they can't cast anything else for a while so not only can you steal their energy but doing so incapacitates them too that's amazing rinwell i didn't realize your magic could do so much it's actually something of a secret technique within my clan so i kind of had to learn it well if we come across any tough enemies that use incantations i'm sure that power of yours will come in real handy yeah it's tricky to pull off but you can count on me [Music] so this whole you not feeling pain thing is that for real why would i lie about it and why would you care anyway no it's just you know i can't imagine what it's like that's all as a slave i'd say it has its advantages and disadvantages oh on the upside when ren and soldiers push me around i hardly flinch the downsides that i get injured without even noticing which means i could be knocking on death's door and not even realize it really sure i may be numb to pain but it doesn't make me immortal or anything still i wouldn't have noticed any of this if someone hadn't pointed it out to me if not for my fellow slaves i'd be long dead lying in a ditch somewhere how come you don't have a scar on your hand a scar what do you mean the crimson crows all tore off their own spirit course right but your hand doesn't show any signs of ever having a core like theirs why not i don't know i don't remember anything about myself from before doc found me seriously you have that mask you don't feel any pain and you just happen to know how to fight with a sword no way you must remember something i'm not lying if that's what you think believe me i wish i knew who the hell i am but i don't it's funny how i didn't have any time for soul-searching while digging up rocks in a mine still are you saying you've told us everything about yourself zephyr it's bad manners to pry when you've got plenty to hide yourself you're not gonna ask me about my past two only when i think it's necessary you're a real man of mystery i'll admit that said i'm not one to dig around in someone's business just out of curiosity if you remember something and feel like sharing you're free to do so for now i think that's good enough right thank you i swear you can't walk five steps without tripping on a zoogle this is getting old yeah but wasn't it you rennins who brought the zoogles here from rena in the first place they're not just ordinary animals from rena each of them has been modified to suit a particular purpose in fact some zoogles were originally derived from the animals on dana or so i've heard what you renance couldn't stop at just the people of this planet you had to screw with our nature too you can get angry all you want but we have bigger fish to fry so are you going to work with me or not i will it's in both of our own interests why am i here would it kill you to be a little more friendly i don't see how that's necessary look for the time being at least we're working together you don't have to make this harder than it already is in case you've forgotten the two of us may be working together but the only reason we're even teamed up right now is because our interests happen to overlap otherwise why in the world would i be working with a dan and slave like i am not a slave i'm not a slave anymore not since i chose to fight i've left that life behind and i'm better for it understand i'm sorry for yelling but please don't call me that ever again okay okay [Music] [Music] good this came out just the way i hoped [Music] all right guys ready to go [Music] [Music] [Music] let's dispose of the trash this one's mine rising wipers [Music] oh [Music] looks like we spotted one of poodle's friends hey rinwell do you always have to say an incantation before you cast an art yeah they don't really add any extra power or anything but reciting them is what allows the astral energy to come together and flow through me it takes time to complete but they're what lets me use such strong magic in the first place what happens if someone interrupts you while you're in the middle of chanting then i have to start over from the beginning as soon as my concentration breaks any astral energy i've accumulated disperses got it so once you start reciting that's our cue to make sure that no enemies can get near enough to disrupt you yeah that would be appreciated although i do have one fun trick up my sleeve once i finish chanting a full incantation i can hold on to a single astral art without casting it right away so once the astral energy is in place you can choose to set it off whenever you want that's amazing yeah i don't fully have the hang of it just yet but i'm sure it'll come in handy sooner or later it's eerily quiet no sign of zephyr you think they took him away already what say we quit hiding and go ask some villagers someone's bound to report us no matter what we do so we might as well hey shion what you heard her she's got a point our cover was blown last night where's the sunset sneaking around and what if there are soldiers lurking about they would have followed us to the cabin already relax the coast is clear let's hurry and speak to the villagers is she always like that i don't know how you managed to put up with her what makes you think i'm managing let's try talking to the villagers hey hmm [Music] hmm i guess great huh huh messiah 2-2-4 that's a weird name messiah is basically a code it indicates it's a small village so it's not its actual name then does that mean that two to four is yeah it's merely a serial number assigned to it for administrative purposes so the romans even get to decide what places are called out in this realm i think there's someone in trouble here well let's see what they have to say hmm yeah hmm hey what ah i guess yeah yeah interesting all right oh what good ugh using zoogles to make drinks that takes guts no one would have come up with it before the occupation that's for sure you don't think the snake eyes will hold it against them do you if anything the warmth might help loosen them up woohoo huh hey sure all right yeah how's this yeah hmm huh just great they reacted just like we expected yeah do you think we'd end up like that if we had to treat everyone with suspicion it's like the bitter cold has frozen the hearts of those who live here looks like we've spotted one of coodle's friends what's this thing you're the friends of that man the bureau agents took away please leave us alone we don't want any trouble no answer our questions and we'll leave you in peace where did the agents take our friend sisler then the capital that's what they said i knew it what did we ever do to deserve this we haven't even crossed the street without looking first why are they after us come on we're wasting time you'll need to hurry if you want to get your friend back not a single person who's been taken to sisladin has ever returned hey keep quiet you're trying to get us all killed out of hell with that go on report me see if i care i thought this sisler didn't was a city is it a prison camp it's the realms capital though when you're forbidden to move freely like we are there isn't much difference my parents and siblings were taken by the snake eyes i haven't heard from any of them since for all i know they're long dead by now anyway go and kill as many snake eyes as you can for me while you're there all right it's cislow than it is [Music] there's the zouga we were asked to handle i won't forgive you you picked the wrong fight [Music] these ones can run rings around that looks like the zoogle we were told about [Music] [Music] right here it goes [Music] [Music] is that the zoogle we're looking for [Music] right here he goes [Music] [Music] that should be enough to make the area more safe to travel in hey huh till next time hmm huh i guess oh hahaha of course people are really terrified of the snake eyes they've got them jumping at their own shadows they may be lord danabel's lackeys but for all intents and purposes it's the snake eyes who control the realm one wrong look and your history so zephyr's being moved to sisler den let's cross our fingers we catch up with him on the way i mean the plan was always for me to take you guys to cislowden anyway but a word of advice oh there's a forest we have to pass through on our way there i won't lie to you it'll be dangerous more zoogles wild ones at that they hunt in packs led by the biggest meanest one my friends and i got cornered by one on our way to calaglia that's how we got split up we'll just have to keep our wits about us then the forest we're about to walk through is pretty dangerous let's make sure we're prepared before we go further rinwell if you get injured just let xion know okay i only have one pair of hands you know [Music] all done come and eat could we talk a moment and here i was thinking i could get some rest is something the matter the matter no no nothing like that and if it's all the same to you i'll be going to sleep thanks is chatting with me really that much of a drag i just don't get the point that's all is there some pressing reason why we have to talk right now i don't know i just i think we should all make an effort to get to know one another what if there's an emergency an emergency what if one of us suddenly got sick then i'd cure them with my healing arts and we'd move on that's easy for you to say but for the person doing the asking it may not be so easy to approach you if they can't work up the courage to approach me that's their problem unless you're suggesting i refuse to heal someone for the fun of it i didn't say that so what then quit beating around the bush and just tell me look i'm trying to say is if we're going to be traveling together it makes more sense to do it as companions rather than being at each other's throats the whole time i still don't get it but i do understand that whatever it is it obviously must mean a lot to you i'm not trying to make things more difficult for you just for the sake of it so i'll make more of an effort to talk every now and then even when we don't have to happy uh yeah yeah i am then if you don't mind i'm going to get some sleep have a good night didn't get it huh i think it's time we go to sleep [Music] how long do you plan on just sitting around doing nothing elfin because it looks to me like you're taking your sweet time getting ready i'm not procrastinating if that's what you're implying oh sure looks like it to me you had me worried you'd forgotten our mission again i know i know you don't need to keep reminding me hey alfin i'm already over here right thanks for letting me know i saw you talking with that bright eyes before lights out last night mind telling me what you two discussed nothing in particular i just figured that maybe she would open up a little if i tried talking to her what her she's a renin i know we're working with her but that doesn't mean we have to play nice with her look we're all going to be traveling together for a while it's only going to make things harder if we're at each other's throats if all we do is bark orders at each other instead of working together that's not much different than how it is for the rest of us i think it's important that we all understand each other and work together as equals if it's at all possible do we though because i sure don't get the feeling she means to do the same as soon as zephyr disappears all hell breaks loose we can't get anything done if things stay tense like this but what the hell am i supposed to do well i guess i'll just have to keep hammering away at them and see how it goes come on guys we've got lots to do so this is the forest teaming with zoogles you warned us about no sign of zephyr though which means either they had the skills to make it through safely or were too late and the strays got to them first do you say every thought out loud just the true ones are we moving or what [Music] don't worry hoodle it's okay i can barely see enough to take two steps forward without bumping into something yeah i have to be careful not to miss anything coming from off the path this is nothing when things get real bad around here you can get lost without even realizing it [Music] get lost here [Music] these little ones are hardly worth our time this is barely target practice then why bother fighting them because i certainly won't run away from a battle [Music] so [Music] it's freezing i can barely feel my toes let's find a way back up quickly then [Music] poodle shake off that water [Music] [Applause] [Music] i could easily see us getting lost here while we're trying to find zephyr i get this is supposed to connect the capital to the villages i won't forgive you take this [Music] thank goodness we won [Music] [Music] i'll take you all out [Music] it's over [Music] [Music] no complaints from me [Music] no choice [Music] i'll be saving this one where that came from [Music] [Music] uh onward and upward [Music] ah this one's tough but we have no choice let me know if you need healing not today it's like trying to keep up with a wolf [Music] is [Music] now consider yourself finished see you continue on in that dream ah yes something you wanted to say astral energy say no more [Music] no complaints from me my clothes are frozen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] what's this doing here [Music] [Music] we've got the ingredients let's get them back to messiah thanks shion just doing what i can [Music] what a lovely view [Music] huh [Music] break yourselves this one's tough where are you going you're ready these little ones are hardly worth our time [Music] say no more i can feel my precision improving [Music] [Music] hey what's wrong [Music] huh [Music] i guess [Music] got it [Music] for real [Music] [Applause] [Music] we've got company and not the nice kind either get back and miss all the action who do you take me for [Music] way it's a big target [Music] these little ones are hardly worth our time don't mind if i don't fury [Music] ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] get on in there [Music] try harder here i come i'm not done say no more you're mine horrible there's no telling what it'll do [Music] [Music] air [Music] [Music] i never missed [Music] you'll pay for that [Music] i'm gonna need more of that medicine [Music] here comes a big one i'm quite aware without you reminding me don't mind if i do we've got him on the road kill anyone's fights [Music] [Music] yourself and get behind us i'll be right in rain in no time stay away from my friends [Music] watch out hear me [Music] astral energy [Music] [Music] [Applause] you okay rinwell i'm fine [Music] so what do you notice now it smells like blood this is all these zoogles they're dead what happened here they didn't do this to each other so then how who is that guy no way one person did all of this [Music] who was that guy do you think he could have been the lord we're looking for cannabilt i doubt a lord would deign to roam around a place like this alone besides what business would a renin have with killing zoogles now that i look at it it was a good call staying out of his way i think look at this he took them out with a single slice this guy's no amateur you okay uh oh um yeah we should get going zephyr needs us that night back there sure wasn't messing around if he's not a lord what is he i have no idea i've never seen anybody like him well he definitely doesn't seem to be a friend that's for sure hopefully we don't run into him again [Music] um [Music] there it is sysloden what's with those beams of light they don't strike me as your everyday street lights they're kind of the key to this whole realm you'll see what i mean when we get there what's on your mind first rinwell appears out of nowhere right after we beat bolsef then we bump into zephyr's son who's with the enemy somehow we get away scot-free because the snake eyes don't even bother chasing after us is it really a coincidence do you think it was a trap well what but i would never if not for the whole astral arts episode i'd be worried but no she's not behind this perhaps an unwitting pawn in someone else's plan [Music] what all this to capture zephyr maybe all i know is it all slots together a little too nicely for my liking not that dwelling on it'll get us anywhere trap or otherwise we've got a lord to defeat so how do we get inside what well we can't just march into the viper's nest through the front door surely there's a secret passage near spring on the outskirts of the city we can get in through there i hate camping out [Music] you
