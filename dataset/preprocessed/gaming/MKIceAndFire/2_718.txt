how do i know you won't screw me again i have been honest with you all along you cannot force me for plasti's actions his decisions while i was trapped in the net fine i'll give you access come with me you guys sure seem to love this place but honestly you don't give off a strong religious vibe we left our gods on iit yet we are strong here without them this way so how come placee didn't know about the biochip he didn't recognize it in the scans few of our people know about konpeki tower but placid he is better this way where we going soon you will see the watcher did not notice the biochip in you strange never gave him a chance good it would complicate our work there's an old subway tunnel no part of the transcontinental maglev system when all states were connected like the net it too crumbled after the warehouse we take you into the cyberspace no better place for you to interact with your construct guess all this means you got your own synthetic interface we have our own versions of all we do not use anything from the city how do i know i'll come back do i get some guarantee you'll be inside our data fortress underwatch under your watch if you knew what is out there in this cyberspace you would not be so choosy how's all this any different from plain old netrunning the interface show you the data layers direct from the net readable of course what the basic runners see is only a map they cannot see beneath the surface they attack it is too weak okay hang on i want to know what you need silverhand for first we wish to contact all cunningham we know she and silverhand were close alt the relic which arasaka held close it is our only league alts cunningham heard of her oh where from who from johnny though granted not much johnny all right v guess you better tell her tell her what about us constructs active let's me and johnny shoot the [ __ ] every now and then look at this too what i think i'm hallucinating found myself an imaginary friend little is known of how an engram might exist within a human's neural network i'll tell you one thing it doesn't shake out well for the human what's your plan to contact alt we tried to cut out a unique piece of silver hand's engram from the biochem alt will know it if something of the human is left after years beyond the black wall she will answer well what you said nothing about breaking through the black wall well now you know johnny looks like you're the bait you okay with that yeah whatever just do what she says what exactly do you want from hope all of you all the only one can give a safe passage past the black wall when the change comes we wish to be on the winning side the change when the black wall was built everyone think the ice would be enough keep the wild ais out away but technology advances it cannot be stopped and now catastrophe come again this is sure and soon the corporations they do not see the danger but we we will be ready the black wall what is it exactly i mean i know you know only what the net watch tell you the final bastion against the post-war ais the great victory of humanity over chaos that would be your saturday morning netwatch propaganda but the black wall is an ai itself the boundary condition let nothing pass through either way if the ais thought like people they would call it a traitor oh come on not the tub we must prepare you for the dive into cyberspace you are not accustomed to the neural demand don't try and get out of this feet just do what she says i'm not about to sizzle with you let's do this oh okay what now johnny [Music] [Music] so this is it seriously this is our bbs data fortress bridge to the deep net it's it's all so live so real cyberspace moves breathes at all times the interface will adjust the ebb and flow of data to the capabilities of your brain but you you are an exceptional case seeing something more than i am yes the cyberspace it is always so what now we can begin all is ready we enhance your link to silverhand's neural network for a short time to grab the fragment we must find a data on alt alt alone this should only take [Music] [Applause] what's happening [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] wow [Applause] gonna drag a couple rounds make them kneel down and light them up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] samurai hey [Applause] only one to have a problem with me cause everyone else has had it

who comes close to even trying to scratch its eyes seen it happen not an iota of physical damage nervous system or anywhere else no sound no fury no sketch just all of a sudden brain waves cut out as if someone pulled the plug or ripped the soul from the body in question cool tell me the rest on the way do i hear extreme doubt oldest triedest tale in the world our saga was out to provoke me and it
