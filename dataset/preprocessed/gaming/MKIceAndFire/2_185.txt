we should search the area under the spire there should be a way in oh i'll get this open is there a problem i don't think so okay there might be a problem something and i think we know who has modified the sequencing needed to access the spires plan b are we only at b seems higher [Music] okay plan b those beacons are part of a ring-wide communications network they can adapt to any frequency any purpose it's quite incredible really get me inside and i should be able to use the pulse to reconstruct a pure version of the sequence should i'm making this up as i go along [Music] i see that chief what are they banshees successful oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] uh uh it's not okay it was like i was back there on the infinity hiding trying to keep out of their way what did you do what was your purpose [Applause] it's over now once i heard chief was down i knew we'd lost i had to roam i had to i found this pelican and just went i'm sorry i never looked back and then i was on my own not anymore you don't know how good that feels [Applause] oh is [Applause] everybody [Music] no more hostels detected hit that terminal and fob lima is ours decryption complete another fob is back in the hands of the unsc just up the road from the second spire too from here you can really appreciate the sheer scale of it the technological superiority of the forerunners i know you're used to vistas like this one but i bet it still takes your breath away i'm seeing another fob online standing by to support i can do that stand by for vehicle drop uh right now [Music] kill them [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] shut up [Music] going loud [Music] enemy cavalry ditching their vehicles you let's make it ours ugh you did it chief five november's ready for capture [Music] [Applause] captain lasky we need to get you to a drop ship immediately i was gonna say the same to you sir we've got banished forces inbound advanced group but well armed chief i think we can make it out here in one piece we'll make it fob capture complete chief for most of the war this was about as deep in banished territory as the unsc could reach can you imagine what it was like trying to protect this fob from the banished so many lives sacrificed a new fault huh let me know if you need support razorback in route thanks for the pickup screw it i'll take my chances on foot [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] uh you dare raise a weapon [Music] i'll do whatever now chief should we start hunting down those beacons or did you have something else in mind ah there we go we need to get inside the beacon let's find a way in the thief has my vehicle uh so what's that continue the battle [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] that was easy let's see what's inside something has been found something that should not exist yet does i believe that the flood represented our ultimate test her greatest perhaps i was wrong in my assumptions to my dismay it seems we have a new problem i must investigate more before i bring this to the attention of the council okay let's do this you know this might actually work or maybe not what is it i can't construct the sequence well not all of it i don't have enough data then we get some more [Music] we're with you chief all aboard [Music] hvt and range chief captain arthak a really nasty one according to his rap sheet he took out three odst squads in a single off don't underestimate him cheese uh hvt eliminated now take out the rest of the squad as expected arthak was no match for you well as i expected anyway i bet he was surprised arthak wreaked havoc on unsc colonies for years no doubt about it he got what he deserved hvt and range chief zaratis the scourge maker he sounds unpleasant taking him down would buy the unsc more time on this ring what do you think oh reinforcements [Music] uh terminal that accounts for all of the crew now it's just down to us and the target go get them that's the end of zeratus the scourge maker may his stupid nickname die with him we're thinning out the numbers of banished elite on this ring keep it up chief um we'll need more data to reconstruct the 4runner sequence let's find the remaining i'll kill beacons the banished stranded a lot of our people in enemy territory when they built it and it's held ever since until today we're taking this checkpoint down thought you might say that security consoles in the gatehouse is ahead let's kick in some doors [Music] connection what's up uh uh the first gate is down um [Music] i'm oh [Applause] oh thank you foreign you really can't believe [Music] let me return the favor much better back at it you all right there pal got something this will get the job done [Applause] uh this place continues to confound us brothers one thing is certain we need to only slow the demon down long enough for this [Applause] there will be nothing left to stand in our way [Music] this so come here [Music] the gates are down but if we really want to shut this checkpoint down we need something a little more permanent got it the primary power source is a generator it's in a structure on the cliff side above acknowledged me i can't trust my eyeballs [Music] oh [Applause] [Applause] but today we are offered the chance to achieve what the prophets and all of the government could not humanity's last champion has returned as we speak he marches amongst us the demon hopes to deny us our destiny say to it that his hope is extinguished [Applause] swimming [Applause] [Music] uh the unsc can move freely across this part of the ring for the first time in months the banished just lost some long hill territory and you took it single-handedly chief if escharam wasn't worried before he sure has a good reason to start [Music] still have some beacons left to find before the 4runner sequence is complete which one's next uh should belong to us yes all clear of banished and once we capture it it'll stay that way and just like that this fob is ours banished records suggest this location is surrounded by key 4runner structures until the conservatory was located escharam directed the bulk of his efforts on surveying this region i wonder what did he learn here a new phone huh let me know if you need support so [Applause] report sir it was an ambush the banners swarmed us but you have any estimates on the size of their force okay how many craft do we need to contend with they're dropping occupation units by the 100s didn't just come for us they came for everything another beacon another part of the sequence plan b seems to be working out just fine i'll get him out [Music] oh let's get this open and we're out of the woods how could this have happened how could we not know of this till now salanine a species previously uncataloged a problem they must be solved did my makers know of them how could they have kept this from me i have requested counsel soon i will know how to proceed let's see what we have here [Music] done we're gonna need to get two more samples though sorry i thought it would be easier it's fine are you okay i'm it's nothing i just felt like someone was i don't know watching me [Music] you
