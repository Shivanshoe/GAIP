our guys are here no let's follow find them well that's that knew you that well probably better than i know myself he said when i had enough of the city we would stock up on kibble fill a couple of thermoses with coffee and whiskey and hit the road he said we would get away from it all sounds like a real adventure good morning too all i see were in for one is of a surprise careful me watch out wipe them out me there i admit [Applause] [Music] [ __ ] right they're on their last legs screw you won't get rid of us that easily the rest must have taken helmand with them if they managed to regroup that's all of them better hurry then [Music] [Music] that's one of our one of their rights let's check it don't know if we'll find anything else here enough there's nobody here better check where kang tao took him fast you were right no man's car did die they tried to put her back give us a few minutes maybe but they still got a head start left a few peeps behind at the airstrip rest went with hellman i would have done the same they're looking to call their people the last they wanted to ride through the desert without backup i hope which contacted the aldi caldos they're coming for him don't worry what this is my life right here i step out of one pile of [ __ ] only to trip it to another bigger one and am that's where they're holding help okay i'm on him come on pete drones patrols definitely set up shop here i see they must be buffy see that the pumps look pretty good not what you would find if the place were closed the bastards might have managed to call for transport we'll know soon enough [Music] me open fire i recognize them the clans he's really going for it [Music] fire fire ah okay don't break he has to be so don't shoot i'm unarmed what the hell are you doing here this is my station his name's martin those [ __ ] suits rode up like they own the place took everything put me here and locked the door don't look too concerned ain't my first rodeo once the dust falls the problems disappear one way or another and i i just dust myself off and get back to work brought a man a man i need civilian you must spot it i ain't blind where are they holy old garage room upstairs probably keeping them there thanks i will you i'd stay put for a few exactly my intention [Music] lower the keeping helmet going in okay covering you you didn't get any customers out of here [ __ ] i didn't even drive this way anyone who don't like refueling with cameras watching them not many sure but they're all big tippers you get me in exchange for your terrible memory don't you worry i'll forget you too who said hey easy we gotta talk who are you working for you're an abu arasaka do you wish to take me back home what a shitty rat he's about to either scream or run you haven't found a fan in him either [ __ ] doesn't know who to be scared of more you are our soccer don't take this personally i seem to recall you were gonna tell takamura when you've got helmet just a sec i'll call him just remember you have helmet and that's one hell of a card try to win something with it takamura saved my life remember because it was in his [ __ ] interest to do so still just biz he's no friend of yours takamura good news got hellman alive what did he say alive alive not too talkative now taking him to the sunset motel i will come to you keep him there until i arrive you got it see ya better take them somewhere you can talk in peace true [Music] [Music] looks like your new chimbus are here is that him sure is take him outside toss him on the bike stay right there the cavalry has arrived mitch gathered together a few all the columns the road was clear i don't think we were spotted we would still do better not to hang around too long what are you planning to do with him just gotta ask him a few important questions i sure hope you get some important answers saul everything's done here all clear i heard mitch is alive thanks to you thanks to v and pan am they both saved my ass i just hope it was worth it that's all i tried to race for [Music] maybe i could help out somehow i think you've helped enough i tried to stop him sure just turn around now let it all be damned you're good at that aren't you look song it really wasn't pan am fun careful you and me are not buddy buddy nobody's blamed anyone for anything yet right pan am was just helping me it was my doing my fault that av got hit without me scorpionist people wouldn't have gone out to grab it that's the truth when you're an alde caldo you are always responsible for yourself and your people the circumstances change nothing perhaps pan am should ask herself if she's still an aldecaldo damn it all [Music] hey don't worry about saul you'll get over it i don't give a damn but he gives a damn about you as soon as he heard what had happened he ordered us to follow you he was worried something would happen that was his look maybe you two don't see i die at the moment but your family and saul will do anything for family the thing is am i even part of the family anymore you know you are come back to us [Music] i understand sorry you had to witness that things just get complicated dramatic sometimes but i will manage you and you you look out for yourself all right so what now back to night city yeah i mean i think so i have to sit and think about everything saul mitch they really treat you like family maybe you should give them a chance it is not that simple like any family they're coming you have about a minute to get out of there let's move i'm also headed out take care of scorpion's bike it's yours hmm hey where am i what is this place motel middle of nowhere any specific middle doesn't matter you're not leaving here by yourself anyway why are we here i want to talk about your little invention biochip you made for arisaka fine but let's get one thing straight first yorinubu arisaka didn't send you no this means you must have an offer for me if your boss will pay more than kang tao i believe we can talk nobody sent me i got a problem and you're gonna help me and what does that have to do with the bio tube got silverhand's construct in my head it's literally driving me crazy and i know it's only gonna get worse that is unless i remove it and that none of that's on the billboards i saw not even fine constructed that's impossible where did you get this biochip long story if arasaka finds me i'm dead so are you so we are in no hurry and i'm interested truly klept it off yorinobu arasaka job for a client but the client left me out henry you decided the best place for it was in your own goddamn head actually wasn't a bad idea construct rebooted me when my own goddamn head took a bullet i always knew yorinobu's plan would fail i just never imagined it would turn out like this arasaka's prized tech really is in the very streets of the city you have to remove the biochip from my system it's not that simple look you made the thing didn't you so where's the problem if you're telling the truth you slotted in a new experimental version of the biochip i know you can't just yank it out my ripper you showed that to some [ __ ] street doctor who else knows i needed help or did you think the first thing that came to mind was down in a kang tao av how's the prototype version different it's got a different engram something more aware aggressive the biochip is what's unique not silver hands engram the previous version of the chip was only used to communicate with pre-safety rarest [ __ ] cast a fortune yeah this one's rarer meant to install and activate the engram in a new body when i left arisaka the project was still in the trial phase how do you put a price on immortality who could even afford tech like this nobody this model was meant to remain in-house the prototype was saburo arisaka's personal commission he oversaw the entire project himself so if it weren't for your nobu nobody would have found out and if not for you the project would not have been a success this is a true breakthrough how exactly was this new version supposed to work were you planning to have the engram kick people out of their own bodies is that [ __ ] by design during the tests we assumed that the body would be neurally indifferent during implantation you mean dead yes which makes what happened to you interesting indeed yeah yeah great your tech works now get it out of me well well i would have to see it first whoa we just met haven't built up that sort of trust yet how did you think this was going to go if you want me to help you i must examine you okay hmm unbelievable it looks like can't believe this suit's the one who's going to help us oh [ __ ] what what is it what a pity i won't be able to examine it fully yeah real shame you could have been his guinea pig too tell me how to get rid of it i'm afraid i have bad news your neural network has completely deteriorated it can no longer function independently of the chip the only thing i could it's bargaining time is to give you information on a good clinic in sweden they'll help you through the terminal stages minimize the pain wait you said the project was in the trial phase you don't actually know how to land oh i do i just saw the construct devouring your brain it's programmed to take over its new environment at all costs and your little meat brain is helpless against this no matter what sooner or later the engram wins yes and from what i've heard about silverhand that seems to be exactly his style i see my reputations grown into arasaka legend what exactly is going on in my head you tell me what's it like to have two personalities because it's not like you're hearing voices you are both yourself and silverhand simultaneously i can see him and talk to him you're not talking but yes i understand what you mean have you noticed the construct's influence on your decision making geez give it a rest when it comes to my decisions johnny really is just a voice in my head maybe he has a different opinion but he can't make me do anything 100 you are one [ __ ] stubborn it's not as if one of you wins the debate the scale simply shifts slowly but surely what do you mean you will start doing things that were once unthinkable at least to your old self and you know exactly who he was a fanatic a terrorist a suicide both [ __ ] me who's trying to mess with your head now that is why i believe it would be better for you to consider clinical isolation at this stage at least gianni never [ __ ] himself out like you are you defending him or is that johnny speaking now oh let me guess he already tried to take over your body you know just for a little while no would you though could be fun johnny kidding but watch out suit's getting ready to talk your head off you know what that's enough you're just playing for time because i can't tell are you trying to convince me you're useless cause i mean in that case i can just shoot you in the head and save us both some time finally we'll try to help you if you come with me to kang tao i'll try just isn't gonna cut it actually it's almost like you're trying to buy your way in with the chinese at my expense do you even realize how much data is in your head even if i can't help you the data must be saved well [ __ ] me sideways what a half prank gog he just admitted you're right forget kang tao got any other ideas if you think there's anyone else who can help you i could give you the blueprints complete project documentation kang tao offered quite the sum for it you got it with you he's got gonks [ __ ] useless without him takamura what the hell is he doing here he's got a few questions of his own for you you play nice he might even save your ass i'm almost done the blueprints [Music] [Music] better than nothing long as we find someone fluent in technobabble what do you do with him i haven't decided yet are you serious you know me i can be impulsive he's all yours i'll give you two some space i hope we can come to an understanding that is certainly in your best interest v i will remember this this heat my throat is positively parched hmm we did not give you even a glass of water unacceptable inhumane that is not me you will see the difference i will give you full buckets no uh no need [Music] [ __ ] sit down goddammit no it's you you [ __ ] killing me little by little every damn day little by little is not my style it's the chip it's our soccer [ __ ] that was your tickle sit and rest don't need your flat money while we got a job today blah blah blah [ __ ] our soccer blah blah smash makoshi you really are turning into me can't say i'm excited because you're a manipulator an egotist and a cynic every time you open your mouth you gotta bury someone you know we get along as the need arises maybe it's time you started trusting me more you can be a charming guy just make the effort charisma flows then i remember that nuke you detonated downtown without a second thought and no hint of later remorse it was mikoshi i was after wanted to destroy it gave soccer ample time to clear the building you knew countless people would die don't kid yourself take lives aplenty yourself c scale is a problem whatever i won't argue all i'm saying is you're unpredictable you pot me kettle remember where you used to be then think what you've done lately path clear see where you're going got no idea where i'm going being a living legend that's all i wanted feels like i'm barely surviving test of a person's true value death facing it staring it down you still got a chance to be somebody yeah maybe what was it like when you died what's on top of the world failure not an option not a thought till it happened death feels real now it's only now i know it now had half a century to come to terms makoshi felt i don't know like sleep lacked awareness had no sense of passing time didn't mark it did what they wanted to me i just remember cold black void fear or or was that your death koshi why'd our sake even build it if i could only see inside zeburro's head people can be bought brainwashed but it's only in mikoshi that you could peer inside a soul pick it apart reprogram it they've amassed quite a collection scary talented runners soul killed packed away probably using them now probably controlling him so ruling hearts and minds that's what it's about the usual corpse have always tried to shackle people one way or another saburo's ambition is greater he's out to control humanity well i think i get why you detest the place shouldn't exist of all the destruction and pain corpse reground the world what happens at mikoshi is worst no why because you trapped there forever it's eternal no nothing's eternal and for the psyches and mikoshi no such thing as the passage of time worse things when they switch up your identity and you never even know you've become someone else corpse have already taken the world for their own now they're coming for us realize what you're doing to me is what our sock is doing at mikoshi yeah i know that's why i'm gonna fix it let's move get back to work let's do [Music] v one of my missing vehicles could be near your current position got it uh what kind of stuff you got got some next level tech on offer yeah well i do have the city's best suppliers on my side anyone i've heard of i wonder oh unlikely my suppliers like to keep things on the down low huh welcome welcome oh [Music] crazy or what [Music] v a vehicle of mine went dark near your position fine keep an eye out for unknown reasons the coordinates came through corrupted so i'm unable to determine the precise location hey v come on in pizza's getting cold you made it good grab a seat this is roxanne she's worked at clouds longer than any of us hello yeah respect i feed in itself from what i've seen of the place just been lucky i guess just eat the free pizza and then we're out of here okay were you an evelyn close yeah blew up in her face when she showed up back at clouds she was supposed to be long gone the one who got away but deep in my heart i was glad to see her back i feel like such a gunk now come here cause you want payback for what happened to her that's for sure but i just want to have a normal job too no fears no tears you know you'll never get rid of the stench of the corpse you drop a lot of them don't you what's your secret so change your mind huh quickly too i'm here doubt i need to explain why all right chill not here to squabble with you wouldn't put it past you judy convinced you call me satisfied done saying hello to each other revolution won't plan itself i modified the behavioral chip it can equip any doll with a motor reflex system in other words make the doll move and fight like a prime tier solo fascinating isn't it what one can learn while tuning fake orgasms for the moxes i'm stepping outside can't smoke in here you'll layer it out later fine i'll sit by the window the body will react as if executing a well-trained series of movements already tested it out on time chip's impulses supplant any natural reflexes so it'll make users feel like variancy cyber psychosis but it's basically the same as when we activate ourselves for a client solo skills don't lie in just executing movements the split-second processes that happen logistics decision making result of years of practice without your chips capable of compensating for that you're probably right but i don't see another way alternative's intensive training but we don't have time for that tech that's all pros and no cons i don't buy it side effects spill them combat mode auto initiates when a threat is present and uh there's no way to stop it can't find a workaround and that's it i don't know only way to determine that would be through months of testing on a range of subjects there's an ethical side too you could murder someone and not remember a thing how'd you ever come up with this learned how the behavioral chip works at clouds always seemed like they must be pretty easy to modify i'm surprised i didn't get the idea the moment we walked into michael's office count yourself lucky what with all the cams and mikes and clouds tiger claws would sooner dig those chips out of the dolls with screwdrivers and let an idea like this run its course all right gotta see it to believe it finally someone said it tom pulled that sequence from a kung fu training virtue gotta admit not bad yeah for the market square and kabuki uh before we start talking serious biz gonna need to see serious action you just saw him i saw a bar trick i want to see a fight got an expert in causing bodily harm among us i want to see how tommy handles him just don't mess up my digs okay i like it here it's on now you there can you hear me look at me go you see that whoa guys some cardio outdid yourself if you were to sell that you'd be the richest judy in the nusa please plenty of killing machines in the world i don't want to turn more people into them after this ships are getting micro nukes thee you got something to say just say it who me this is my impressed face last year the city council of night city happy now i'm really happy but that was proof enough more technologies let's get to it then you've got an elite force of three muscle heads and a techie what now guards and tiger claws in and around will overpower take down disarm escort them out clouds will be ours boss says we'll give an ultimatum a cut of the proceeds in exchange for never showing their faces at the club again and having no say in how the club's managed that's what i thought a half-baked insane plan you can't see more than an inch ahead of you taking out the security there won't solve anything claws will just send more hiromi sato is the man you got to get to hiromi sato who's that cloud's real boss he rarely shows but you can't so much as sneeze without him finding out claws trust him respect his opinion he is one of them we can try to convince him but it's doubtful we stand a better chance by injecting him with a dose of fear where do we find this hiromi at his apartment h8 mega tower topmost floor it's a penthouse almost never steps outside its glass walls but i'll figure out a way to get us inside tom and roxanne gonna come with no hull points to strike both places at the same time they'll take care of business at clouds two-pronged assault loving it wouldn't it be better to ambush him in the street like while he's chomping on a scop dog or taking a piss in the back alley why even try breaking into a penthouse he's probably crawling with guards hitomi don't go anywhere without security so one makes no difference two this is only a show of force demonstrating what we are capable of which is a lot more than street thuggery so how about it v tom roxy made up your minds i i need to think about it never wasted anyone before you know i'm with it all the way don't tell me you're seriously considering this sticking our precious necks out for a bunch of [ __ ] 10 casinos rather not have to flatline anyone what he said hope is it won't be necessary overpower hitomi humiliate him should be enough bosses will put him out of the game the crystal palace count me in judy i already said i'd help didn't i thanks v save the gratitude for later please ah i shouldn't meet with you and let you know i need a couple days have fun toodaloo hold up give us a lift only if you don't talk to me i feel a migraine coming on oh [ __ ] i'm scared v speaking of gratitude stuff i'm asking you to do will usually come to the price tag i know you want to help i get that but i'm more than happy to pay your fee in full feels like it's only right judy for real no don't want to hear it not a word oh v everything okay they you don't okay okay i'm better i'm fine what the hell v you like sick it's past forget about it it's late you're tired you can crash on my couch if you want sounds great thanks don't worry about it make yourself at home [Music] you
