[Music] flowers mr yates wants the 1945 grand paladin brought up to the house special occasion what what did aliens land on the front wall have the ghosts of jesus john lennon and ava peron for dinner out here what could possibly be so special above your clearance flowers just fetch it already fine what's the passcode again last year of world war ii if you have to look it up shame on you the meeting in the root cellar and judging from yates's choice of wine some type of celebration likely a gathering of heralds come to congratulate yates on his upcoming promotion diana's presence and calculated risk so so i'm fine santino it's just the 1945 grand paladin it is perfection irreplaceable you don't drink the 1945 grand paladin any more than you would write a shopping list on the mona lisa men like don yates know the price of everything but the value of nothing say what if we exchanged the labels served in a different way ah you are devious santino but no if mr yates wishes to destroy something beautiful i will not stand in his way that is between him and his creator how did he even get his hands on him i hear the last of the one button for six hundred most expensive bottle ever sold ah yes a curious story see that bottle you refer to came from a case of 12 which were recovered from a sunken carlisle shipping container that went down in the south china sea during the final days of world war ii of those twelve only five were raised intact al ghazali bought one under a great media coverage while the others simply disappeared quietly obtained by some clandestine private collector until one of the bottles was donated to mr yates by byron washington ceo of the pax mundus foundation as a reward for winning a court case now byron's twin daughters were treasure hunters so that explains how he managed to get first pick but you see i was here when the bottle arrived and the crate it arrived in for a curious logo something called the ark society intriguing do you know what it means well not a clue and now we will never know don't get attached santino for all fine things in life are transient hmm okay what is that oh [Music] [Music] hey flowers over here come on while we're young sir i present to you the 1945 grand paladin huh somehow i thought it'd be bigger come on flowers guests are waiting go on get yourself patted down we're still on alert from all those big shot ceos getting off looking fine today sir hey stop twitching you're not making my life easy here okay you are good to go so here's the deal flowers the boss is having a pow-wow with some employees and discretion is the name of the game i'm sure you've figured that out already you being a scholar and all don't discuss disclose or hell even contemplate what goes down just set your mind to wool gathering mode you think you can do that for me flowers worry not mr cortazar i'm the very soul of discretion good man they're already at it go on place the line on the table i'll pour it decant pardon me your majesty i have always considered their hair i have always considered the heralds the unspoken heroes of providence the nervous system effectively and reliably transmitting the decrees of the brain to the body and limbs of our great organization and i am delighted that so many of you were able to join me today despite your busy schedules and celebrate my retirement from the world of law and imminent in statement as the third constant of providence make no mistake i have two formidable sets of shoes to fill but i am a thirst to pick up the mantle looking good looking good flowers ah ladies and gentlemen mr flowers our resident sommelier i believe he has brought us something quite special perhaps you will educate us mr flowers this is the 1945 grand paladin one of only five bottles in existence the vintage is legendary the proverbial unicorn wine the year was hot the wines super concentrated and thanks to hail and frost the production was small only 300 bottles were ever produced and when the vineyard was bombed during the closing days of world war ii only a single crate survived it is said to have amazingly complex aromas with long savory layers of fruit and spice flavors and a silky texture enjoy wonderful thank you mr flowers feel free to stick around in case our guests have questions this wine was gifted to me by the ark society an acknowledgment of my firm's legal services it stands as a powerful reminder that providence draws its strength not from force but from partnership we are but a few and yet together we are unstoppable because we stand united my friends loyalty is everything which is why we cannot allow traitors into our ranks oh yes here it comes this woman has wasted bloody war on us more than a dozen heralds and operatives dead your colleagues and clients my friend ken morgan not to mention the partners themselves our founders our benefactors make no mistake this woman's hands are soaked in blood our blood and arthur edwards the new supreme head of providence is handing her the keys to the kingdom now does that seem right to you my friends does that sound like loyalty absolutely absolutely right perhaps edwards simply recognizes talent when he sees it perhaps this is why i am also in the running to become constant and following this childish outburst i dare say i am in the lead dawn you're lying of course which only proves my point you're gonna be trusted miss burnwood this woman will be our downfall that is unless we take matters into our own hands you are heralds sworn to protect providence against all threats including inside ones i have devised a plan together we can make it work but you have to decide now my friends are you with me yes yes yes i agree yes listen to yourselves don yate is not even appointed constant yet and already he conspires to betray his master i don't pretend to understand edward's every move but i do know that this man is an opportunist and unworthy of office then you are a traitor to the heralds the room is against you tamara stand down now or share her fate edwards we'll hear about this i think not i am sorry but you brought this on yourself mr cortezar [Music] i scored miss burnwood to my office i'll join you shortly right move it let's go i'm warning you yates this will not go your way we need to get our stories straight diana burnwood died today by the hand of her rogue agent 47. tamara vidal who saw through the assassin's disguise was alas killed as well this is what you will all attest to yes yes i agree yes a toast then in her honor send her the taste because you never will again tell you where someone else and let me remind you we remember flowers together you never saw one goes down yeah hey lots of people have mixed feelings so geez come on i've heard something weird i'm gonna go check it out what was that oh huh good i was beginning to worry were you no listen up 47 yates will be here shortly he'll have his thug courtesan do his dirty work but he won't pass up on the chance for a good gloat and a monologue so private space kill room decor exactly we won't another shot at this now sit down and blend in when i provide a distraction you just be ready to move corvo pick up your damn phone plan b is a go i rip eat plan b is a go start prepping a crime scene like we discussed remote staged accident oh and corvo make it for two just improvise miss burnwood you rolled out the red carpet just for me don you shouldn't have so confident even in defeat i suppose you're not used to danger always safe behind your screens just tell me one thing before we part ways why me why you why would edwards trust you please it will keep me awake at nights and i'm 65. i get up four times to piss as it is oh it's simple really edwards is proud he considers himself the cleverest man alive and yet we tricked him on isle of scale and it's eating him up he needs to win full unequivocal victory my recruitment was just the feather in his cap by the way you write about one thing yeah i'm all ears holy [ __ ] you got to be kidding me turns out this woman will be your downfall what are you doing you [ __ ] come here yeah weird noises shooter i'll have a look around what the hell man if it's any consolation your instincts were dead on i will be confident now and i will make it my mission to tear down providence brick finish it a good boy well done 47. better get rid of the body won't be long before they come looking when you're done meet me on the dance floor oh and dress appropriately foreign i think so i've been meaning to ask you the name of the artist ktsd 47 it's done now what now we strike at the heart and wins you know how to find him don't you why edwards finds you 47. he is untraceable and he never lets you forget it he is cocky and that will be his downfall what's the plan too many eyes meet me at the olive grove at sunset one last tango 47 how did you know your deal that kind of power always comes with a price what's yours i think you know i am sorry this is a necessary evil what have you done eat the brand's neurotoxin transfers by touch see edwards learns by his mistakes 47 and as you've clearly demonstrated brute force is futile it had to be me it was the only way to get this class my family i know what you did after all these years i finally know i am sorry you didn't have a choice i did providence used you but i'm no better all i saw was a blank slate a weapon to wield i told myself it was what you needed but people aren't meant to be controlled this is a kindness goodbye agent [Music] you
