needed [Music] [Music] [Music] this is old town torch towers to the northeast out of my way yes [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] [Music] why why do we have to guard this broken broken transformer and why aren't we allowed to recharge they say some dumbass bear hacked our system all transformers in the city are now out of order didn't they catch that dumb ass bear if if they stayed that way i i am going to run out of power then shut up that'll save some power transformers what did erso get up to missing map data looks like the tracking function is still offline rating to urso right into urso i need to get to torch tower right away [Music] so so [Music] [Music] oh uh [Music] look [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] uh the number of dog patrols has increased torch tower can't be far away now

ride the wind to get there urso made this radio right let me see ray [Music] tagged i copied this map myself and it's not for sale but i want to thank you for saving my life before i better so got a lot of help from you with the radio's tracking function you've discovered me and erso's little secret our organization's taking over those iron dogs as terminals too right try this terminal [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] don't [Music] [Music] pump here get your pump one bottle keeps you up all night just a sip will send you all the way up torch tower it's just ten fursos and comes with a secret want a bottle ray your rumor mongering is more famous than pump i'm busy [Music] this is the restricted military area no unauthorized access allowed [Music] uh responsible for hacking the terminal why did the boss order us to stand guard here there's a group of them so it's organized crime they nearly stole the transformer drill last time the drill is under heavy guard it'll be suicide for any partisans that try to get inside those scum have no chance of getting to torch tower without the drill i need to get my hands on the transformer drill to climb torch tower better head back and find someone who knows where the drill is i need to get my hands on the transformer drill to climb torch tower better head back and find someone who knows where the drill is officer your pump is just carrot juice and water i'm just a snake oil vendor i wouldn't dare touch weapons hey easy there looking for weapons i've got some [Music] oh that was too close the arms business is too dangerous now wang where can i find the transformer drill [Music] keep it down that's some big league stuff the organization once said master wu to try and grab it from the iron dogs now you're looking for the transformer drill too that's right it's no doubt guarded by a crack team of iron dogs you should go talk to master wu he'll know go through the secret door on the left side of my room that's where master wu's group is hiding out thanks master wu is really spry for his age all thanks to pump want a bottle for a little pick-me-up it's free you saved me after all [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] this yes [Music] [Music] so boss [Music] good uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] food [Music] good [Music] so [Music] [Music] master wu you still got some fighting you it's little ray what do you want with this old man i came for the transformer drill i heard that master wu knows where it is hmm i see they got urso i need the transformer drill to climb torch tower i'll get him out no matter how dangerous it gets so that's why you dug out that fist of yours right the organization tried to get the drill but failed the iron dogs have strengthened their security so rushing in is suicide i don't know how good your skills are after all these years there are several robot puppets inside warm up first and i'll teach you a few tricks [Music] [Music] not bad after all these years you're still an ace pilot your power fist has immense potential my [Music] this is just a minor trick the fist is a machine after all if you want to make it stronger you'll need to exploit the mechanical power of the legion you must find data disks in order to learn more moves data disks yes this is what i heard from the iron dogs their local boss farrell is downtown now and carries a data disk master wu there is no time to waste let me rescue erso before going after the data disk ray no offense but you just don't have the power to infiltrate the legion all by yourself right now you must defeat feral and prove your strength before i can trust you with the drill's location very well i'll find farrell and get the data desk the power punch i taught you just now can not only strike enemies but also punch through the security barriers those iron dogs installed in the city you shouldn't have trouble finding pharaoh right [Music] [Music] find farrell retrieve the data disk and ask master wu about the drills whereabouts [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] with [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] right [Music] [Music] ew [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you weren't around here when i was a kid [Music] oh my word [Music] smarter parts you're pretty good this feral was tough i'm carrying a data disk too better report back to master wu [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm uh uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] right [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] wood uh [Music] [Music] not [Music] i'm back master wu use their strengths against them this data disc and machine will help you master it more quickly this time i think you should learn rising punch [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] recover more data disks and you can unlock more legion powers after our last failed attempt on the transformer drill the iron dog stashed the drill deep inside the power station basic moves won't do much against the mechanical monster guarding it you may stand a chance with your fist and new fighting moves remember own your skills and they'll clear the way for you one day thank you for your lesson master wu i will go now use rising punch on the secret door in the room on the right to open the way to the power station take care [Music] welcome to jingles shop since you came on master wu's recommendation i'll give you 20 off these may not look like much they are all rare treasures that i went through a lot of effort to acquire i stake my reputation on their quality i'm meant to believe a rat mutual trust is needed to grow in business that's why i quit the rat gang a long time ago we went our separate ways as the phrase goes [Music] so [Music] thank you for your business [Music] welcome to jingles shop these may not look like much they are all rare treasures that i went through [Music] yep [Music] whoops uh ah i haven't seen anyone this good in torch city before oh uh oh have you heard pharaoh the downtown boss got dismantled by a rabbit he got totally written off and was dragged off to the scrap maybe that rabbit has something to do with a power outage here ah no need to work ourselves into a panic pharaoh and his pals keep bragging about how big they are but they're just a bunch of whips our boss is a real fighter the boss doesn't care if we live or die they say that the rabbit has a big iron fist on his back he's no walk over either the two of us are screwed if he comes here what do you take the power station for and as the legion's most powerful defenses nothing can get through just shut up and open the valve everyone's waiting for the power to come back on foreign uh oh so well uh oh yes ah what a nerve-wracking sound must have been the mechanical monster that master wu mentioned [Music] uh himself i'll avenge you pharaoh rest in peace now [Music] oh hmm [Music] [Music] so uh um uh [Music] [Music] so warning unauthorized biological organism detected executing termination protocol oh uh uh just got it better head back to torch tower now

most everything in the world is shades of gray i don't want to upset your balance and i have no time for your theories on the color gray i just want to know this what is cicero planning him he's a more complicated case this is no place to chat come to joffrey street and meet me at broadway [Music] you
