heroic display he makes a powerful first impression just the way he likes it welcome to your rickshaw friend well matt faravid i was hoping your y'all would be as welcoming but i suppose i must earn his trust is that why you've come here to earn halfton's trust to find a seat at his table i have my own table what i want is a bond of friendship between the new lords of england among whom you count yourself i suppose it is an ally i seek not a master well there is but one lord of northumbria you heard the yard take the gear and start digging the towering castle by the river hmm troll cursed corruption works here the roman giants outdid themselves with this fortress but where would huffton y'all hold court asked about this land my friend these pics are as sneaky lots masters of guile and ambush havoc here be my eyes my wife grows ill i will attend to her soon i promise but halfton needs me now are you a nun i thought nuns dressed like geese nothing of the sort i am moira of weaker

tool we crush them in spring no sooner that is the plan yet my people suffer day by day your people do you rule a shadow kingdom under my nose our people suffer from these brutal winter raids this war

ragnason my sword arm answers your call thank you for your tribute evil wolf kissed your battles and deeds are well known to me and you are the hero of uric so sing my skulls not just any hero able brought order to the city when king richie could not they say you rooted out a gang of thieves and traitors not alone but i led the charge you gifted my silver to the carlson chairs of jorvik to men and women who needed it most a foolish choice the coin never left king rishi as treasury i try never to regret the decisions i make in a time of war agreed to second guess ourselves would only stall the victory i don't regret sending faraway to lead our strike against the pits in spite of avo winning the day aver and i felt them haftanian so you could sweep in stab a few cold corpses and claim a glorious victory old friend you're just hit like odin spear always on the mark i would not be here without your hammer gregor please accept this your share of the loot we won today a thing of beauty francis i believe what do you think avor a fine piece of work fit for the lips of a king or a man who makes kings there's wisdom in this one faroevent by your leave lord i must return to my forward camp it's a long cold ride two-faced smirking glory hound my lord in your sermons you said not here not now dance sing fill yourself with ale and meet me atop this tower of storm there i will weave a tale of friendship and treachery a tale as old as the world uh foreign my fists have hammered nails and strangled sharks still care to brawl swift and strong you may be it's the one most righteous who wins the fight you fought well warrior but here you'll let your dance bow to no name ah aval we have missed your wit on the orvik council i attend in spirit would you lend us your wisdom now if possible we are at pains to determine how to deal with the northern picts need iron with iron that is the way and this feast is how the danes prepare their blades we fought well and won tomorrow we'll fight again but we must always make time for celebration i defer to your expertise hacking hewing and the like enjoy the feast counselor my luck over spills like the ocean's tied only fate will keep me from winning then come and see what fate do these dice hold for you but can you lift a horn as thor swallowed the oceans i can lift many horns and drain them too a bold claim i'll drink to that you're kissing a flagstone soon head spinning yet oh it's catching me top the tower of stone he said hey dogs don't beg for silver dogs do not yearn to be yards but i am a wolf no a wolf king ah evil come let me show you i wonder all this we conquered this he and i together you've earned great fame won many battles across england but not alone no no beyond ironside fearless uber evil the boneless sacred snake and i great worry is all my brothers gold is good and battle better but glory never dies forever it lives in the hall of heroes high on valesti together we have conquered together with my friends my clan pharaoh above all others one sword is not an army evil even a hero needs loyal friends i have never lost sight of that never have you room for one more among those who call friend what does friendship mean to you ava friendship goes beyond words it is a solemn bond a chain unbroken spoken like the folder it is indeed a kind of magic you wriggle like an eel in a basket afton what else can't you friendship can also spoil like rotten meat after all these years he dares to bite my hand father he seems a good and loyal man seems yes as a bright sky in winter seems warm but rumors fly of little men plotting treason in the dark have you prove of his treachery not yet that is where you enter my saga prove this for me discover if faraway has been disloyal then we shall talk of oaths start me somewhere give me something to go on you see this from a sea unicorn i filter my mead and wine with it i've heard of such beasts they swim below the ice beyond the world's edge and their horns protect against poison you believe faraway wants to poison you i fear he has tried countless times and failed them all you don't believe me but i know the man his gifts are blind his easy smile his envy his plots learn the truth dig up unearth his treason why trust me with such a task jorvik you stopped the ill deeds of aldon and his swarm of rats you can do the same here like a good sword honor has two edges i'll help you farid has left the feast already heading for his camp upriver join his warband and behind his back dick and if i find nothing if he's a good and loyal man even better even better fair enough i'll find what i find then return my friend don't let pharaoh fool you he is hiding something so let's see you old friend that must be fat of its camp ahead cold and dirty you try to throw yourself in your gap you bastard i am not a dog yet here you are barking again because we beg for scraps from haftan's table like dogs follow it ah evil my friend is donecaster hospitality to your liking i would be careful calling this one friend varavid the crow who comes flapping when haftan gives a whistle afton and i spoke and one of it this is our fight our chance for glory fly on home crow lent me a knife side of it this whelp needs gelding loafer piss off small men always talk big so was haftan generous did you get what you came for if i help with your fight against the pigs often will consider me a friend so point the way fan of it the pics raided that monastery plundered it silver and gold the saxons build more churches than bombs and fill them with herds of monks yes monasteries make tempting targets and not just for us we tracked pictish raiders heading north gold is fine the victory is our treasure what's your plan to open their bellies with my knife i'm ready to fight let's put them in the ground halftone didn't send you north to fight the skirmish we could win with half our numbers why are you here even you questioned my word you never gave it then i give you my word falavid i am here to fight two pics dogs let's roast some pigs watch for ambushes should have stayed in thoracastre more meat fewer pics there's no glory in guard duty move out the pigs are just ahead lead the way and we'll watch your back these pics stay with me friends oh max i'm not uh that's enough thankful we made it that was good war work all this cave is a passage the pecks are using it to cross the mountain a gift for us you track them through the cave we'll circle around back and snare any who tried to slip away i'll kill you kill kill good good and godly places i should be home filling my belly ahead this winter with help from an unknown the pics spoke of stenway their camp that's to the north their chief may be there run stop them before they reach then where they spotted us run forward glory for ultra oh hmm south of the wall don't like it that's the last one let us regroup at stenwya we need to plan our next move the pigs don't raid often during winter aah ah they must have a reason something to gain now pagoda chief have a look student so father ah that's it oh [ __ ] i yeah have you come to join your fallen sample let's yeah you're on the wrong side of the giant's wall friend have you come to make war and wins fool he might have talked we got what we came for is that more frankish wine i'll take a few casks and that's silver there opher that's halfton's cher avor just in time to divide the spoils take some meat if you like the picked sad magnus this map spells it out ah the wolf kissed is a reader that's dark sader i'll never mess with worry about the pits later now's the time for treasure and spoils you owned it it should be ours we did the work all of it and nothing for half done warming is [ __ ] in a saxon castle open that cask and we'll have a taste we'll celebrate together sorry friend but that's halfton's take you understand don't make me say it twice drag the wine and drink with me if you insist we'll all drink some stinking wine a little sour but not bad i've always preferred ale myself or spiced meat what i won't drink is one of moira's herbal brews she claims their tonic but there's no telling what she hides in those drinks moira i met her at the feast she's a herbalist from the north always skulking in the shadows of hafton's throne it's a big throne don't you all skulk around it from time to time why all these doubts abor you're a warrior not a rumor monger doubt is too strong a word but there is a feeling of mistrust among you i want this alliance to be ironclad then let me change your mind i've got a plan to win this war for good before the winter sets in magnus is a strong fort but we'd be attacking from the south with speed we'll catch them of god with halfton's blessing i'd fight beside you anywhere name the time and place no hafton is done fighting for the winter he thinks it too great a risk but i say we can win this war before the next snow if we tell him of this plan he'll refuse but if we succeed you and i together you'll sing our praises all the louder there are no secrets in this world or the next the old father seized everything we need not fear odin's eye only halfton's wrath i must return to donna castro for a time but i will join you for this battle deliver this goblet to my yarn he has a fondness for them and tell him his share of the spoils is coming when you're ready find me near your rig at the place called the walls will be waiting for his gift in donecaster do not keep him waiting you
