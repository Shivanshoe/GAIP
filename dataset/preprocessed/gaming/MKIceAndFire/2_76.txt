my journey ends here i'm going to wwe and then straight to the top where i make sure that what are you doing you're an hour and a half early for your orientation i was just out the facility there'll be plenty of time for that later how did you even get in here guy up front let me in oh big guy with the mustache kinda sweaty yup well that's todd's final strike hope he enjoys early retirement oh no need to get anyone in trouble he uh definitely checked my id and even did a pat down really thorough so todd's alright in my book i feel very safe in his big sweaty hands fine whatever anyway you're going to need to fill out your information on this and sign a bunch of waivers before you can begin training today and when you're done with all that there's actually a fun part you get to design your wrestling gear in case you become a wwe superstar you mean when i become a wwe superstar yeah sure wait have you been filming this entire time is that a problem filming's not allowed in here without prior consent which you should have been told by security freaking todd turn it off please okay wait wait wait wait wait [Music] you done with all that yet just finished it takes time to design a look like that huh i've seen worse so now what should i go wait at the front desk with you until it's time to start front desk what do you think i do here i'm corey klein head recruiter and occasional babysitter of people who don't follow instructions and show up way earlier than they're supposed to oh that cory i guess when we were emailing i just saw your name and assumed you know what it's nice to meet you in person finally go get changed then head over to the gym the other trainees who started last week should be showing up soon and to clear up any potential confusion on your end they are men got it thanks hey new guy right i'm hector flores welcome to the pc thanks i'm excited to get going especially since i heard you started last week it started here at least i've been training and wrestling for years before this it's part of growing up in mexico are you from one of those famous wrestling families no where i'm from you were either into wrestling or football sorry soccer i chose wrestling i played soccer when i was a kid but there wasn't enough punching so eventually i got into mma there was a lot more punching so why make the switch from mma to wrestling i love fighting but i got burned out with the long training camps and only getting to fight a couple times a year plus i wanted a new challenge so i started training for this a few months back and wwe took notice that's good but don't expect this to be easy you're going to have to work as hard or harder than you ever have before to make it to wwe i realize that and i respect everything that wwe superstars do inside and outside the ring and i know i can do the same thing if not better that's a high bar to set but good luck me um we so hey who are you it's my first day training here who are you seriously have you not been watching japanese wrestling for the past six years i'm paragon j pierce the biggest free agent wwe science since aj styles bigger actually i haven't had time to watch japanese wrestling i was busy training and finding an mma at the highest level in the world so you're an mma fighter huh man you guys are all the same you come in our sport thinking it's gonna be easy but you're in for a real wake-up call i don't plan on being here very long they actually should have never sent me here to begin with but i'm going to take this opportunity to send you running back to whatever mma promotion you were cut from you remind me of a lot of the guys i fought against all talk luckily for them they don't have to face me anymore unfortunately you do yeah in a wrestling ring which you have very little experience in you're in my arena now rookie and when i'm done with you you're gonna wish you stayed in your lane we'll see i heard you were starting today big fan thanks you a big mma fan no not really i just love that viral video of the fight where you got knocked out in like two seconds hilarious anyway i'm actually crossing over from another sport too i spent some time in minor league baseball really who'd you play for it well i wasn't a player i was actually a mascot named ribby but i was around a ton of good athletes oh okay well that counts for something i guess the best part of the job was they used to have indie wrestling shows at the stadium all the time where i got to rub elbows with legends like jerry the king lawler he found out i was training on the side as a wrestler and actually helped me get a shot here not that i couldn't have made it on my own so that explains it your lawler's charity case it's not like that i deserve to be here you'll see sure if i need a mascot to cheer me on i'll let you know whatever i was gonna ask you to autograph something for me but now i'm not sure i want it probably not worth anything anyway relax i was just giving you a hard time i'll do it you might need to sell it after you get cut here seriously i'm messing with you again see you out there case messing with me again right what do you mean you called me case but my name's chase good one oh yeah totally messing with you that's me full of jokes i'd like to officially welcome our newest recruit to the start of his wwe journey the rest of you've heard this speech already so we'll try to make it quick on our first day he did the whole ladies and gentlemen boys and girls children of all ages thing it was awesome we'll do the talking chase i was just telling him about your cool dx intro you did chase what road dog was getting that is we are going to give you the foundation to succeed in wwe what you do with it is up to you keep in mind you will be judged at all times the big man in the sky is always watching not that big man there's a camera up there with a live feed that goes directly to triple h's office in stamford the coaches and pc staff certainly have input but ultimately he'll decide when the time's right to bring the gm's from nxt raw and smackdown here so you can showcase your talents i'm ready for that now yeah we know you think that but it's not your call big shot okay now that all that's out of the way we're gonna start with some one-on-one matches to see where everyone's at all right new guy since it's your first day we'll let you

hard there's no shame in losing i guess i just don't want to be seen as the weak link in our training class you know like the guy that no one really expects to succeed or the one you want to face whenever you need an easy win you've only been here a week right i don't think anyone thinks that not yet at least hey keep your head up you can do this i'll try thanks buddy oh [Music] me wow big win over the mascot really impressive i bet triple h is talking to all the gm's right now about the new guy at the pc who had the courage to face the weakest opponent here just because i wrestled chase today doesn't mean i'm scared to face hector you or anyone else i'll believe it when i see it and so far you haven't shown me anything yeah well i'm sure we'll have the chance to face each other real soon as long as you don't keep dodging real competition uh so ah oh [Applause] oh ah [Music] yay oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] ah [Applause] one one two ah one ah ah one one two one two one two one

component to his transition from mma to wwe with cardiovascular conditioning mma fights have rounds and most bouts end quickly once the bell rings in wwe the combatants battle until the end of the match so it's a higher level of conditioning let's see how he handles it tonight gentlemen hulk armadia is about to run wild there is only one the immortal and his opponent from venice beach california weighing in at 302 pounds so between wcw and wwe hogan has had double digit world title rates not to mention he's a two-time wwe hall of famer and the biggest name in the business in the 80s and 90s ah wwe universe is going crazy i don't understand why all this hot dogging and grandstanding already the match hasn't even begun yet don't you know corey hogan feeds off the energy from the wwe universe it's gonna power him through this match and by the way what you gonna do when hulkamania was wild on you that's pretty good right no terrible at least she would hogan have the same hairline you can feel it when hogan enters the ring there is no more powerful force in wwe than hulkamania oh the goosebumps are forming all over my skin michael i'll admit the hulkamania is running through my veins you can see the adrenaline fueling hulkster but he'll be facing someone who has been looking for a challenging fight for quite some time now hopefully he'll get it tonight placing them right where they want them into the corner wow no mercy being shown in here the holster now with a daunting task ahead of him oh kick connects well-placed kick well-measured strike both wrists captured devastating kick big these two showing how well scouted they each are setting it up double leg take down step through looking for a submission here legs are locked up uh oh face first he's starting to struggle here this is where endurance becomes so important in the late stage oh gosh cover one two three and that's all she wrote here is your winner sub zero scorpion progress the perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this win this is what you get when you have complete confidence and control of the situation the following contest is a handicap match making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke this guy used to stick to one weight class back in mma but he's made a good adjustment into the world of wwe where his opponents come in all sizes his striking ability is ridiculous he has phenomenal submissions and is learning to use the entire ring listen this is pure electricity [Applause] and their opponents first from miami florida weighing in at 265 pounds oh here's the man who's captured the imagination of the entire sports entertainment industry the brahma bowl one of the very best of all time without question the rock has been a champion at every level hey saxton your roll know it your mouth shut it that wasn't very nice it is just such an incredible moment every time the rock competes desire to be the best ever has been fulfilled the great one possesses amazing agility power and stamina the brahma bull looks set to run over the competition here tonight stone cold steve austin says what he wants does what he wants and he's not afraid of the repercussions and his partner from victoria texas weighing in at 252 pounds [Applause] what a mess the iconic texas rattlesnake a pivotal figure in the monday night wars if it isn't the definition of irony that wcw once fired this man who would go on to become one of the biggest names in the history of this industry stone cold steve austin has done it his way every step of the way [Music] [Applause] [Applause] what can a competitor do to figure out the option to devise a plan for this type of match-up whatever you do stay out of your opponent's corner that's a sure-fire way to feel that number and where you don't want to be if you can't stay out of the corner and away from the numbers game it is only a matter of time before the match is over [Applause] wow [Applause] knee smash the rock hoping to head this attack off of the pass an unfamiliar spot for a great one well scoured by the great one turned that one around yeah he's able to stop that surge dead in its tracks [Applause] evades the attack oh superstar looking for legs are great by now the arms are trapped this won't end well oh big oh gosh for the win is i understand the sentiment but now is not the time to bask in disbelief moves in the nick of time definitely not where you want to be right now just carried like a ragdoll here gets the tag yeah he just punched him in the chest and he's a step ahead of austin the rock tacked in punches he's turning the tables momentum completely in the corner of the rock and the rock's opponent [Applause] i wish someone would put you out the pasture right and left elbows knees all of them lethal looks like he's got a little bit arms and feet oh this match is getting pushed beyond the normal limits and the rock is getting dismantled the millions are hoping the rock can come back here one [Applause] zero scorpion big effort tonight a well-earned victory here tonight with a win like that you have to stand back for a moment and realize all your hard work paid off so the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke [Applause] and his opponent from east london weighing in at 190 pounds danny birch [Applause] foreign [Applause] one two [Applause] god huh [Applause] oh one two three here is your winner sub zero scorpion smoke [Applause] hey big news we got another member of dx coming to help out for a bit at the pc hornswoggle uh no one of the members of the best version of dx x-poc no offense but i actually think the original version of dx was the best wow offense taken it's funny shawn always tells me the same thing you guys were cool but shawn and hunter were the ogs okay what if when xbox is here we had a match to settle this debate you and your og hero shawn michaels vs me and xbox i've got two words for you i'm in leave that to the pros [Music] yay one two oh yeah [Applause] ah [Applause] ah one two three that's spanish for i got a big opportunity for you ignoring your terrible spanish for a second what's the opportunity wwe was contacted to send a pc student to el mago's retirement show in mexico they actually requested hector but for some reason he doesn't want to do it so if you're interested we'll have a triple threat between you paragon and chase to decide who will go to face el mago's son el mago junior at the event which means book my flight i only looked up that one sentence so i'll take your word for it [Music] [Music] ah ah ah ah [Applause] oh [Applause] one ah [Applause] one two three [Music] me me me good luck against el mago junior in mexico i hope you beat him that's the plan i've been meaning to ask why didn't you want to go yeah um just wasn't feeling it it would have been a chance for you to compete in your home country and you're probably a fan of el mago right i was but he wasn't a fan of me that's all i can really say just go get the win over margo jr okay [Applause] oh [Applause] foreign [Applause] uh [Applause] huh [Applause] one two [Applause] ah [Applause] so hey we have some good news you're not going to have to deal with us much longer well maybe if everything works out what do you mean triple h feels like you've seen enough from you and the rest of the class so it's time for an official evaluation is this the pc showcase you mentioned back on my first day exactly all of the gm's will be here to see you guys in action if you impress any of them enough you might receive a contract offer thanks for helping me get to this point i won't let you down you put in the hard work and earn this opportunity now it's time to deliver and reap the benefits i'll be ready we should also mention that each gm is going to be accompanied by a superstar from their brand to help evaluate you guys by evaluate you mean you're gonna face one of the visiting superstars we already know how you do against the other guys here so we wanted to give you a new challenge that all sounds good to me so who will i face well the options are oni lorcan from nxt shinsuke nakamura from smackdown or the toughest challenge out of the three drew mcintyre from raw keep in mind there's no wrong choice but being a tougher opponent would be more impressive to the gm's potentially open more doors but if you lost the risk might not be worth it so now that you've had 10 seconds to consider this life-altering decision what's it gonna be i want to really impress the gm's give me drew mcintyre all right we'll make it happen good luck kid wait we almost forgot the best part there's a little surprise waiting in your locker oh you mean his custom gear we made for him well now the cat's out of the bag remember your first day when you designed your wrestling attire well we figured it might help your chances if the gm's could see how you'd really look in wwe unless you'd rather stick with your plain old boring training gear uh no i think i'm gonna go with my custom look thanks guys just a heads up i wouldn't get all worked up about this pc showcase since the gm's are really only coming to scout me that's not what i've heard who are you gonna face anyway i'm taking on the mascot i'll dominate him and show the gm's what they've been missing out on wait so you're not even facing one of the visiting superstars sounds like someone is scared to lose in front of the gm's it's called being smart and putting myself in the best position to succeed maybe you should try it sometime but good luck getting a contract with whatever half-baked decision you made i am so jacked for this pc showcase i had a dream last night that i beat paragon and was signed by mandy rose to raw man the dream got crazy but we don't need to get into that you beating paragon and getting signed to raw wasn't the crazy part oh no way man i can do this i step up my game when the pressure's on and besides all i need is one shot well i admire your confidence and i hope it works out that way maybe we'll end up on the same show that'd be sweet could even ride together live together work out together eat together i know we could do a lot of things together all right well good luck in your match i'm gonna go buy a new suit to impress the gm's specifically mandy rose if our real-life connection is anything like it was in my dream there's gonna be fireworks when we meet not literally like pyro or anything i mean like the romantic kind yeah i get it chase good luck with all that [Music] ugh oh ah [Music] huh one two three i've heard a lot about you and you didn't disappoint with your win over drew mcintyre today with that being said i'd like to offer you the opportunity to sign with nxt this is a big decision and i need to think it over that's fine but you don't have a lot of time where your options and get back to me i wasn't planning on making any acquisitions today but after what you did against drew mcintyre i'm impressed so i want to offer you the best opportunity you're going to get a chance to sign with raw i've always wanted to compete on monday nights so i accept your offer that's it you're not even gonna ask about your pay i already did my negotiating in the ring fair enough we'll send you the paperwork don't make me regret this you're looking at the blue brand's newest superstar took longer than it should have but finally i'm gonna show the wwe universe what the rest of the world already knows when it comes to wrestling i am the paragon good for you i'm gonna do the same thing on raw but without the lame attitude and nickname wait you got signed to raw yeah uh did you not see me beat one of their top superstars no i did i just thought they would recognize it was a total fluke like i did but i guess every brand needs curtain jerkers i'm really gonna miss you hey i heard you're going to raw congrats thanks i saw you talking to regal he make you an offer yeah and i'm going to take it i think it's a great fit for my style and i'll be able to compete for the cruiserweight championship but maybe we'll cross paths again sometime in the future never say never around here that's right buenas verde heard you got signed congrats thanks what's the matter with you what's the matter you and hector and paragon all got signed but no one wanted me and now i'm stuck here while you guys are all moving on to bigger and better things comparing yourself to us isn't going to help your time will come trust me you just need to take a hard look in the mirror and see what you can change to capitalize on the next opportunity that comes along that's good advice but what if it wasn't anything that i did wrong what if someone in wwe doesn't want me to succeed what if i'm being held down i think you've been spending too much time on social media there are no conspiracy theories in play here all right but that is exactly what you would say if there was one chase keep your head up and continue to work hard i gotta go clean up my locker that's not code is it like you're not trying to tell me there's a conspiracy theory against me that i'm being locked down wink twice if i'm on to something chase congrats on getting signed to raw i think you're gonna do big things there thanks for saying that especially since we haven't always seen eye to eye it's hard for me to see eye to eye with anyone these days that's a joke but nonetheless this is always a proud day for us but just remember don't slip up and embarrass me or the other coaches okay so basically don't do anything you would have done when you were starting out in wwe exactly good luck kid i'll be watching it's the arrival of the newest edition of monday nights gm mandy rose and the wwe universe are lucky to have this superstar on monday night raw i know he's accomplished a lot in other places but let's see how he does here on the red brand then we'll talk [Music] i had a crazy dream i turned on a classic movie after raw ended and when i fell asleep my brain was a whirlwind of wicked witches scarecrows and tin men fighting all my favorite wwe superstars got me thinking about tornado tag team matches any chance you'd click your heels and make all my dreams come true [Applause] they are ready for a fight the following contest is a tornado tag team match and at a combined weight of 489 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke and our truth obviously this guy's in amazing condition and can handle a fight but will the no off-season 52-week fighting schedule of wwe play a factor he can hurt you so many ways but he has large boots to fill given the legacy of mma fighters in wwe [Applause] the entire wwe universe singing in unison what a beautiful chorus i think i'll join in don't stop please the wwe universe excited to see mr rood in action tonight [Applause] and their opponents first representing dirty dogs from toronto ontario canada weighing in at 235 pounds [Applause] guys this dude looks like a million bucks that's an understatement call i think the robe alone is worth that much [Applause] you think about rude guys he lives large in and out of the rank does ever stop bragging about how talented he is [Applause] skull [Applause] [Applause] [Music] ah the dirtiest of dogs the showoff and one of the toughest veterans on the entire wwe roster and representing dirty dogs from hollywood florida weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] ziggler made it his personal mission to eliminate the complacency that plagues the wwe locker room month after month the preaching is the same dolph ziggler truly believes no one can hang on his level [Applause] he's truly a top dog no doubt about that it's going to be hard to keep an eye on all the action as things begin to get hectic in the ring will these teams be able to adapt to the rules style points won't matter here the team coming in looking for a knockdown drag out fight has the right attitude he got whipped into that corner wow [Applause] oh not perfect it was glorious he's got it oh [Applause] tough position to be caught in here elbow drop [Applause] oh that'll break his arm vicious oh my goodness all right yeah that's an attitude behind it this has got to be it oh i thought it was over but again can we please get some control saw that one coming oh oh [Applause] he let it go [Applause] one two [Applause] and it's our truth finishing this one off for the team this team was totally in sync attacking in perfect unison like they were reading each other's minds the following contest is a fatal four-way match making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke so much of his training at the performance center revolved around developing a multi-dimensional offense for any type of situation sean michael's worked extensively to improve his catch's cash can skills oh this is gonna be haters opponents first from huntington beach california weighing in at 282 pounds a man who lives his life wanting to prove to the world that he's the baddest man around yeah joe always promises a beating of the highest order you better be careful saxton if you're not joe might also take your seat at the commentary table that's what i call an upgrade [Applause] half man half amazing but all business he's the founder of the herd business and representing the hurt business from miami florida weighing in at 259 pounds [Applause] who can forget that mvp once held the united states championship for 343 days which at the time was a record after a tough upbringing nine years spent locked up mvp is living proof you don't let past failures define you because now all he does is win [Applause] alberto carrillo is here and from monterrey mexico weighing in at 198 pounds a lot of people have questioned just how far umberto carrillo can go but he assured me that he is as confident as he has ever been he's in perhaps the best physical condition of his life he knows what it takes to reach the top here in wwe [Applause] this fatal four-way match will determine who will challenge tommaso champa for his u.s championship of all four competitors champa must be hoping to get his hands on the superstar that's been pushing his buttons on social media first things first that big talking superstar will have to handle his business against three other superstars who are just as hungry to contend for champions time no he loses decision there michael [Applause] oh targeting the leg there he's looking to completely render this leg useless stomp puller leg snap very up [Applause] really just laying it in [Applause] he's ejected from the ring and he's taking this to the outside now coming back in the ring well scouted by um [Applause] directly to the chest and there's the breakup just in the nick what's going to happen here nice breaker [Applause] the pins broken up i can't believe it this is it and he breaks up the pinfall let's keep fighting [Applause] oh direct impact to the chest nice side headlock apply oh this is ridiculous this is insulting this is entertaining final cut perfectly executed big punch finds its mark the snapmare springboard [Applause] he had scouted [Applause] he's looking completely lost as he finds his footing [Music] down okay he's re-entering the ring what's coming next what a counter from joe oh this is not going to end well drop down able to give him just in time [Applause] here is your winner sub zero scorpion what an incredible we the following contest is an extreme rules match it is for the wwe united states championship one of the signature superstars in nxt history the self-proclaimed greatest sports entertainer in history no matter what you think about him you can't deny champ is as tough as they come yeah we've seen champa recover from not one but two career threatening injuries not only that but he recovered ahead of schedule and came back in the best shape of his life the worst place to be is across the ring from a motivated tommaso champa this is a man who decided a long time ago that there were no lengths he wouldn't go to for success because champa knows his career could end at any time and wants to make his mark and ensure his place in history doesn't wait for his moment he takes it for himself [Applause] introducing the challenger from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke and introducing the champion from milwaukee wisconsin weighing in at 201 pounds he is the wwe united states champion champa this is all for the highly decorated united states championship harley race the inaugural champion truly a tough man's title tommaso champa has overcome more physical setbacks than almost any other superstar in wwe and tonight he'll have to overcome his greatest challenge yet to defend his u.s championship the challenger has been targeting champa's injuries on social media and tonight they'll target them inside the ring and one of wwe's most grueling matches two fearless superstars willing to push their bodies to the limit for a title this is what monday night raw is all about ow geez oh the wwe universe as [Applause] he's begging him to get up so he can put him back down okay already we get it stop looking for adulation for the crowd and get back into the fight re-entering the ring now ddt plants then [Applause] off that move by champa oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet a flurry of brutality [Applause] producing perfectly executed what do two count to do to put this guy away oh my gosh [Applause] punches i can't believe it tommaso champa has been dethroned and now it's time for him to say goodbye to his precious stripey maybe he doesn't want to he doesn't seem too happy about it but apparently champa is ready to accept this loss obviously he wasn't ready to accept this loss oh my god what's he doing those steel steps i think we've seen this before in champa's epic battles with johnny gargano oh no fairy tale ending on the steel stairs the new united states champion could be severely injured yeah he came crashing down face and rib first on those unforgiving steps and would you look at that champa isn't going to part ways with stripey after all he's leaving with the united states championship just all around disgraceful actions that we've witnessed here tonight in any event stay tuned for updates on the new champions condition here's an update not good [Applause] so i just saw your post you're stripping me of the title i just won yeah cause i just saw your x-rays and you're going to be out for over a month which is a month without the us championship being defended on raw i have no other choice you never wanted me to beat champa all you care about is keeping his record-breaking reign going for the brand and ratings that's my job to care about that stuff besides we wouldn't be having this conversation if you weren't soft that's what you called champa right he attacked me after the match you know the match where i beat him look you can go to the performance center rehab your injury then come back at full strength and you'll most likely have a rematch waiting for you most likely a lot can happen in six weeks the alternative is you face champa for the championship next week while gasping for air with a chest full of broken ribs most likely lose and then maybe never get a shot again but either way the title's returning to someone who can defend it immediately at 100 percent so what do you want to do i don't care what you champa or anyone else says about being soft i'm not going to risk my career for one match i'll be back for my u.s title when i'm 100 percent all right i'll let the pc know you're coming oh ah um [Applause] one two three ah uh one two wow one two three so you [Music] [Applause] now [Applause] foreign [Applause] uh [Applause] good wow oh one two three [Applause] the following contest is a ladder match and is for the wwe united states championship [Applause] it's been a long road to this rematch between tommaso champ and his opponent but here we are with the united states championship literally hanging in the balance after weeks of uncertainty stripey is only one ladder match away from finding a proper home injuries have been front and center in this rivalry so far but both of these superstars are finally ready to prove whose full strength is stronger strong oh [Applause] damaged [Applause] getting dismantled here champa has to weather a storm here that's one way to use the ladder he's setting up the ladder now looks like to me he's got it in the right spot michael oh wow big uppercut [Applause] heads out and he has all the time he wants [Applause] quick return to the ring getting that ladder set up nicely right in the center of the ring michael he's hit striking while the iron is hot it is all or nothing at this point this is insane look at this he's taking it to him up there oh this is such a dangerous position he is fixing to take it off here i'd be shocked if this is it michael making the climb here maybe looking yet yeah let's see how long that lasts nobody in this building thinks the match can end here i think so go home firm control we've already seen a few shots delivered up in that region [Applause] and now he's standing it right up in the middle of the ring right where it needs to be look at this snatch of victory here guys i think it's gonna happen looking unhook looking for the win here we go you've never pulled before come on just a few steps he better work quickly here and call a win here would be so incredibly huge they got it new champ what a moment here is your winner and the new wwe united states champion sub zero scorpion smoke [Applause] [Applause] the following contest is a six-man battle royal in his fourth the wwe united states championship introducing the champion from new york weighing in at 269 pounds he is the wwe united states champion sub-zero scorpion smoke remember guys the title is on the line here in this one and i don't remember the last time the champ was in this much jeopardy cold tonight might just be the night the title changes hands as far as title defenses go this is about as big as it gets he needs to be on his game tonight prepare for the arrival of the most vicious most vile most violent competitor introducing the challenger from huntington beach california weighing in at 282 pounds a man who lives his life wanting to prove to the world that he's the baddest man around and joe always promises a beating of the highest order you better be careful saxton if you're not joe might also take your seat at the commentary table byron sacks and this man is a true testament to selfishness [Applause] manny rose wasn't lying when she said this would be a unique [Applause] champion of champions has a nice ring to it doesn't it every one of these superstars wants to walk out of this ring tonight as the best let's find out who can actually pull it up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] fantastic awareness [Applause] he's returning oh chicken wings oh nasty stuff to finish it off hits him with the counter [Applause] knee straight to the back and this might not have a pleasant ending ricochet was a movie ricochet ridiculous standing shooting start wow my goodness did you hear that job [Applause] mvp has been eliminated has been eliminated [Applause] and the electricity of this moment is coursing through his veins so much for that guess that wasn't quite the opportune moment [Applause] flipping the script on him there ricochet got set up here ricocheting eliminated the united states champion persevered through an extremely difficult challenge tonight to walk away victorious yeah after surviving that match you have to wonder if there's any obstacle he can't overcome it's dope ziggler zigzag what the heck what was that all about just when it looked like the united states champion had no more obstacles to clear now he has the show-off standing in his way dolph ziggler is a former united states champion himself this is only speculation but maybe he was upset he was left out of the match tonight that could be but nonetheless the champion now appears to have a significant problem on his hands let's hear what our united states champion has to say before his title defense you all saw what happened last week when dolph ziggler attacked me after the u.s champions battle royal i guess he was a little upset he wasn't included in feeling overlooked in general so i promised dolph that i come out here tonight and recognize some of the amazing moments from his career so let's start at the beginning where dolph proved he was special from day one debuting in wwe as a preppy looking golf caddy how could anyone ever overlook that not wanting to become too big of a star too fast dolph then decided to become a male cheerleader he truly was a show-off of both versatility and spirit after those two scents were so overwhelmingly successful dolph again didn't want to outshine his fellow superstars so he decided to go back to developmental to come up with another amazing persona and give back to future superstars after this hiatus dolph would return and continue to annoy i mean entertain the wwe universe for the past decade and a half even trying his hand at stand-up comedy in front of as many as 20 to 30 people speaking of jokes i think that's about enough of that now i'm gonna tell you the truth about dolph ziggler he's not given the credit he thinks he deserves because he has no identity a caddy a cheerleader a stand-up comedian how can he be recognized if he can't even recognize himself but here's the thing i know who i am and that's the united states champion who will kick anyone's ass who gets in my way so dolph after i'm through with my match tonight she won't be overlooked you'll just be next strong words from the united states champion he'll defend his title coming up next [Applause] this is all for the right to call yourself the united states champion to put yourself in the echelon of john cena ricky steamboat steve austin some of the greats of all time over 40 plus years of history for the united states championship and a new chapter is written tonight he is delivering elbow after elbow and it's reverse pain for that mistake oh foot just stomping down oh check out this power this is ridiculous dominance powers for him here we go you run down dolph ziggler like the u.s champion did and you're gonna pay where is he though or you pay in the form of mind games either way it's effective [Applause] climbing up to the top now uh-oh great awareness for ricochet sequence of reversals there avoiding contact absolutely spiked ddt measured kick to the vertebrae oh solid contact there he avoids the damage hoisted driver the challenger not looking good right now there's been plenty of action in this match and the cost of that is showing now oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet [Applause] someway he is still in this punch by the champ [Music] he's kept ricochet down might keep him down permanently [Applause] the wwe united states champion sub zero scorpion

everything he needs to in wwe and he's right one of wwe's most accomplished superstars a multi-time world champion multi-time intercontinental champion multi-time tag team champion is there anything dolph ziggler can't do dolph ziggler has done it all he has truly proven himself to be one of the best in all of wwe [Applause] introducing the challenger from hollywood florida weighing in at 218

own peril and i'd give the same advice to our united states champion [Applause] oh [Applause] just one step ahead he switches it back around the challenger eating up some damage samoan dropped byron [Applause] connects to the back of the neck [Applause] it's not over yet plenty left to go in this one ziggler now lacking any signs of resistance dolph's having trouble assessing the situation you might break a neck that way and a strong kick out in one right now i just don't know what it's gonna take just like that don't dodges away and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner and

performance center the news got fans of mma and wwe talking now we see what all the talk was about gentlemen we are about to experience something phenomenal here's a man who can do it all and has done it all in short order here in wwe may be the greatest in-ring competitor of this generation and his opponent from gainesville georgia weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] styles entering the ring about to deliver a clinic [Applause] gentlemen you were looking at a man who was sick of the doubters sick of being questioned about his potential and i can't disagree with him i expect tonight to be a night where he can silence the skeptics and prove to be the future of this company it will their nasty intentions that still need to be delivered big kick what a double axe handle strong kick my goodness samoan drop byron i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last and that would force a stop to styles for the moment he had to be prepared to take some damage tonight incredible and stiles is taking a lot of offense now but aj can't let his flourish derailing oh stomping away that'll send a shock down your spine finds it styles a step ahead great job refocusing the reverse back a well-timed dodge reversal on top of reversal that's gotta be it there's two shoulder up after two how in the world did he kick out [Applause] zero me so this superstar looks determined tonight whoa from behind they're gonna settle this right now bell rings and we are off in this no disqualification match the rules are out the window and we're about to see how badly these combatants dislike each other anything and everything is legal this is where all the aggression finally comes out blue thunderbomb this has got to be it first one missed second one didn't effective yeah oh man oh my gosh oh with authority truth gets out of the way big time spine buster good lead to a big-time win he skirts around it uh the reversal by r truth a counter answered

hoisted up boom fees it's no secret that i have a soft spot for the more mean-spirited competitors on the roster it's actually my birthday next week as a special treat wondering if you could take out one of raw's more honorable superstars in a no dq match i swear i won't tell anyone it's for me when it's no disqualification that means the competitor can be attacked and will and it's all about this is when you see just how sadistic a competitor can truly be and that makes for a frightening scene it's anything goes you have to do whatever it takes to survive this situation there's no limit to what someone will do if they are unleashed without restriction he's locked him up powerful [Applause] he's heading back to the ring boom kick gets caught into the face he's rummaging for some sort of equalizer underneath the ring [Applause] just thrown away comes back into the ring fishing for something beneath the ring settling on the kendo stick no good can come from this how's that for a counter great reversal right to the chest he's feeling the effects of that last hit he planned for this it could still rally [Applause] down with authority sharp elbows to the body looking to fight his way out [Applause] boom it's okay they weren't that pretty anyway heads out of the ring what's next oh boy come on not the chair placing them into the corner [Applause] dawkins attack gets reversed implanted by the ddt uh these are dangerous attacks on their own but now the damage is exponentially multiplied so many dangerous attacks one after the other making it difficult to regain any composure dawkins was ready there and dawkins is really being knocked around here yeah dawkins needs to find a way to right the ship here of lethal strikes duck is with the reversal stops the kick he thinks he has it two one match and now he's controlling the pace of this one yeah he is being steadfast in his approach [Music] what a gutsy performance oh that got turned around on dawkins the victory tonight [Applause] that was an impressive match all around and here is our winner this is the product of hard work and in-ring adaptability he's got all the tools and he put them to use tonight um [Music] hey did you get my text i did and the voicemails and the dms i was almost expecting a handwritten letter to show up in the mail if that would help greenlight the wcw reunion show then i'd do it look i heard you already have rey mysterio on board and obviously he can still go but what about the other former wcw guys who aren't really active anymore okay so what if i bring in another former wcw star and have a match against them on raw to prove to you this can work okay fine i'll be watching but if i'm not impressed then then it's off no more texts dms or letters deal i promise you won't be disappointed and here he comes the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke his lightning fast striking ability and his strength are what sets him apart from his competitors those skills are going to be put to the test like never before wwe is its own animal he's a two-time hall of famer ready to make a little noise ladies and gentlemen we've got a two-sweet treat for you one of your favorite wwe superstars faces off against a two-time hall of famer from dx the mwo i couldn't believe it when i heard xbox was back tonight well the man looks like he's in the best shape of his life i wouldn't want to face x-pock back in his wcw days and i sure as hell wouldn't want a piece of him now on x-puck can he take advantage god that's devastating those mounted little punches oh a nasty stop to finish it off kicks to the lower back clutching the wrist [Applause] just absolutely punishing their opponent here [Applause] and finds a counter expected that one sidewalk slam almost drove him through the ring he couldn't make much of that pin attempt oh god [Applause] getting him into the corner and he's able to counter samoan dropped byron [Applause] strike elusiveness that's mounted with touches oh a nasty stop to finish it off down with the samoan drop x puck had it scouted he's stuck in his opponent from the top turnbuckle here we go catches nothing that this is getting intense someone will check on saxton xbox looks powerless to every attack the xbox has to find a way to ride the ship here [Applause] what an emphatic victory guys no contest never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about oh oh this should be very interesting all week long you've heard about a huge announcement i'd be making tonight and now the time has finally come you might be able to guess what it is based on the men who are gathered in this ring and those giant steel letters but let's make it official in the very near future there's going to be a special one night tribute show to the men and women of world championship wrestling and it's going to be called wcw one night nitro that's right raw is now where the big boys play i just want to say it's truly an honor to be a part of helping put all this together and i can't wait to pay tribute to the legends in this ring and many more who influenced my career now with that being said i'd like to huge news of the announcement of wcw one night nitro but apparently aj styles has something to say about it whatever it is it must be urgent sorry to crash the big party but i just wanted to say i'd love to be a part of this reunion show too apparently you forgot i spent a few months in wcw before it went out of business no slide intended i was actually planning on reaching out to you just wanted to make sure we saved room on the car for some of the more well-known wcw stars well known huh i i mean well known in wcw not in general like you said you were only there for a few months but i'm sure we can work this out let's talk more later all right yeah sounds good i'll let you get back to it as you can see this show is so big that everyone wants to be a part of it now stay tuned to the wcw hotline just kidding stay tuned to social media for more information on wcw one night nitro we never thought we'd see this moment wcw will return for one night only [Applause] aj styles with the chair shot he's not waiting to talk about this later aj styles clearly felt disrespected tonight and now he's taking it out on all the wcw legends and down goes booker t kevin nash can't stop aj either mysterio off the top and stiles dumps ray to the outside okay maybe this will be a fair fight guess not aj setting up for the styles clash [Applause] this was supposed to be a moment to celebrate the legends of wcw but aj styles did everything in his power to ruin that just pathetic in my opinion this seems to be about more than just being excluded from the event there's something else going on here [Applause] and one more disgraceful act to close out an all-around shameful night for aj styles [Applause] all week long i've been getting messages on social media why aj why did you take out the wcw legends why'd you ruin one night nitro well here's the answer at first i was slightly offended i wasn't considered for the show after all like i said i was an actual wrestler there unlike the super fan wannabe putting it all together who never stepped foot in a wcw ring more on him in a second but then the more i thought about it i didn't want to be a part of bringing back and honoring the egotistical greedy dinosaurs who slept walked through their matches just to collect a fat paycheck putting the company out of business and nearly killing my career before it ever got started in fact it was so bad down there when they first offered me a contract i turned it down and took a job delivering water because it paid more because all these so-called legends were flying around in private jets with their guaranteed contracts wrestling four times a year and there was no money left to pay guys who actually wanted to be there ultimately i ended up going to wcw for three months and it was way worse than i thought it would be every decision from the top guys was made to hold back the younger more talented wrestlers like me finally it all caught up to them and the company folded i had to go back to the indies and work my butt off to make it to where i am today but i'm the exception most of the younger wcw guys from that era like my old tag team partner they never made it so that's how i remember wcw not as this company that beat wwe for a short time or part of this over glorified golden era of wrestling but a sinking ship that almost took down aj styles with it so that's why i did what i did i shut down the embarrassing tribute show before it ever happened and i do it again 500 times so let's circle back to the guy who started all this you were just a fan when all that with wcw went down you had no idea what really happened but in my eyes that almost makes you worse than the so-called legends you put on a pedestal you're supposedly a wwe superstar now so act like it this isn't your time to play fantasy wcw it's embarrassing so you want to talk about destroying me for what i did remember wcw already tried that and they failed so i'm gonna do a favor for every man and woman in that locker room who has any actual respect for what we do and destroy you challenge accepted [Applause] i've been looking forward to this one the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke this superstar had some success in mma but never reached the top of the mountain he said it was due to politics wwe's the land of opportunity so there'll be no excuses here sink or swim pal the man who attempted to bring you one night nitro gets his chance for a pitch against aj styles who crashed his party last week what a disgraceful display from the phenomenal one but that's what we've come to expect from aj styles see i think aj styles must have learned something from his old job delivering h2o because he poured a bucket of cold water on the wcw reunion show and every legend who thinks they can waltz back into the ring whenever they want there's repercussions for that like this match tonight each competitor showing they've done their homework the damage he's taken is starting to pile off it's nothing he hasn't been through before [Applause] oh that got turned around on styles [Applause] oh hard impact in the corner this is what you call high risk high reward to the sky's right to the gut is he attempting a styles clash it's finn balor what's he doing here it seems balor's attempting to help out his former club partner he certainly got everyone's attention aj styles has a chair and the referee has no idea neither does his opponent it's kevin nash we haven't seen nation styles took out the wcw legends a few weeks back this is his chance for payback kevin nash just turned on his friend i can't believe this is happening and now aj taking advantage he's going to do it he hits this and it's done styles [Applause] to the clash from finn balor and the shocking actions of kevin nash this is unbelievable [Applause] what exactly is the relationship between these three i'm not sure if fowler and stiles even know [Applause] there's your answer it looks like we've just witnessed the birth of some kind of new nwo slash club type alliance this is bad news for wwe oh i agree nothing good can come from this so this the wwe universe on their face the following contest is scheduled for one fall on the way to the ring at a combined weight of 539 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke and goldberg as a trained mixed martial artist he has an immediate striking and leverage advantage here if he's able to utilize it don't forget his expertise and submissions which make him a tough matchup for opponents let's see what tactics he's got in store tonight you are looking at a one-of-a-kind superstar former intercontinental champion united states champion wwe champion plenty of hardware to back up his success and their opponents first accompanied by kevin nash from gainesville georgia weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] always on the hunt for glory [Applause] he is the consummate in-ring competitor aj styles is a great competitor but hardly professional come on byron you can't argue with aj's success the prince has arrived a decorated champion who has truly reinvented himself and his partner from gray county wicklow ireland weighing in at 190 pounds the first ever universal champion a multiple-time intercontinental champion nxt titled what can't the prince do it seems like year after year finn balor just reaches greater heights in his career the wwe universe has been in shock ever since aj styles annihilated an entire roster of wcw legends and things turned even darker when kevin nash joined forces with styles and finn balor they sure did especially for the superstar originally responsible for the ill-fated one-night nitro that superstar will try to get even with styles as he turns up with a wgw icon who's ready to fight back against this emerging alliance of outsiders if they take them down then aj would be on the hook for a one-on-one rematch is getting dominated aj's got to slow this momentum down i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last ride off into the pin only a one count before the kick out his determination there with that kickout he's a projectile now [Applause] is it enough here you have to think this match is starting to take its toll boom nice i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the [Applause] look at the look on his opponent's face cole he can't believe it oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet striking combination lethal styles there's no control here aj's gotta find a window to fight back great response to aj there an incredible combination this could do it tag is made and here we go this is just an overwhelming amount of offense on him he's got to reevaluate his approach at this point watch [Applause] what a gutsy performance getting tossed poking it up here what's next barely kicks out obviously still has some fight left able to get the advantage here styles getting out of the ring the hard way oh [Applause] [Music] stomping down elbow and he keeps his focus on an attack to that area caught the leg a series of reversals oh good night what a stunner oh my god here he [Applause] are your goes sub zero scorpion smoke and goldberg this pairing pain strong dividends with an impressive tag team win for my money these two just might be the best tag team on the roster today oh yeah i am pumped for this guy the following contest is a steel cage match making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke the killer instinct of the mma cage is part of this competitor's dna word is he was actually banned from competing in one mma organization but he's adjusted well to the rules of the wwe rank tonight just became phenomenal a terrific striker a master purveyor of high-flying innovative offense aj styles has competed at this level for decades such a special and his opponent from gainesville georgia weighing in at 218 pounds [Applause] always on the hunt for glory [Applause] sometimes aj styles might be indeed arrogant and also opportunistic when you're as phenomenal as aj styles there's nothing at all wrong with being confident confidence is let him atop the pecking order what started as an attempted tribute to wcw's larger-than-life legend here tonight between two superstars looking to leave their own marks on wwe and they'll have to do it in a steel cage match which means no more invited guests and no more uninvited guests either after what we've seen recently i'm not even sure if steel cage can contain this issue but we're about to find out [Music] suplex i don't know if i want styles taken by surprise he's lost some of his win now connects and here we go he's headed up the cage he's one step ahead there oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet and that one scouted there's return fire on aj he turns this [Applause] i don't think anybody will question the toughness on display here tonight takes a lot of guts to even set foot in the cage but to win is even more impressive i'm not impressed at all by aj styles effort tonight well i mean he tried we with today's technology i can watch wrestling anywhere at home when i'm out on the toilet come on everyone does it shorter matches are best to watch in the bathroom otherwise your legs fall asleep anyway as a favor to me and my circulation think you can wrap up your next match in five minutes or less mvp has been trying to get the crew to follow a dress code of wearing suits says it's good for business for everyone behind the scenes to look as sharp as the superstars but i lug a camera around on my shoulder all day and a suit is not spec resistant can you get him to back off so mvp has been trending what are you expecting from this superstar tonight guys well he did say earlier that he's going to attack his opponent with a renewed hostility that we've never seen before yeah he also said he's going to make the competition beg for mercy but he's facing a man who's excelled in cover here oh come on what is he thinking where you wanted [Applause] bad predicament right here [Applause] look at this neckline suplex in the back of the neck [Applause] mvp brushed up against some resistance there the veteran didn't have an answer taking on some offense but he expected as much great reaction from mvp oh look at their knees just unloading knees to the body and the pressure on mvp continues to mount now mvp has to plot a way to get back into this mvp managing to get some control back now mvp needed that to get himself out of jeopardy wherewithal on the counter mvp all set up we're going ballin you know nothing about b sacks and the cover for the win and a kick out right away still in it what a gutsy performance [Applause] scorpion so oh god [Music] [Music] ah huh [Applause] oh ah [Music] ah [Music] oh [Music] oh ah here we go as montez ford takes on the superstar who earlier today and literally got into it with kane backstage it takes a lot of gold out mayor kane especially when you're in his neck of the woods but that's the kind of confidence this superstar brings to every city he goes confidence more like a death wish michinoku driver producing a trampoline and he saw that coming from montez [Applause] he's struggling a bit here look at him totally fighting with the wwe universe right now he's doing a whole lot of gesturing and it could cost him three [Applause] if this guy's they can't get any more interesting i might have an idea what this is all about yeah after what we heard happened backstage it's kane and not mayor kane it's the big red machine the demon has been awakened he's been put on notice [Applause] here comes the big red [Applause] weighing in at 323 pounds one of the most dominant destructive forces in the history of wwe multiple world and tag team championships and more destruction to come last week raw ventured south to knox county when one superstar traveled further than any other into the flaming inferno known as keynes hell and now the demon is here for revenge the big red machine may have just come alive but kane's choked slam last week may have broken something in his opponent kane prevents the attack from connecting and the wrong way up all time this match grinded him down a little if he can hold the line here he'll be in a good position arcane counters the devil's favorite deep gets him with the counter and down with the suplex the big red machine is now under heavy pressure kane has to turn this around and click got it scouted there's the snapmare and a basement dropkick target of the chest very effective while he knew what was coming i don't like the look in his eye here folks ddt delivered [Applause] what's it gonna take to keep this guy down kane gets out of the way and he's able to fight kane on that was a huge win tonight over kane hold on is this what i think it is it's the undertaker the feed off is here on raw he called take her out on social media now he has to answer him face to face let's see how tough he is now undertaker's not going to wait and there he goes he wants nothing to do with the dead man he just took down kane i think he's had enough of the brothers of destruction for one night they are ready for battle the following contest is a tornado tag team match and at a combined weight of 519 pounds sub-zero scorpion and the viper randy orton this superstar had some success in mma but never reached the top of the mountain he said it was due to politics wwe's the land of opportunity so there'll be no excuses here sink or swim pal and at a combined weight of 622 pounds the undertaker and kane the brothers of destruction gentlemen this has all the makings of an all-time classic match and i fully expected to deliver on that promise [Applause] oh [Applause] you feel the electricity in the air because the undertaker has returned for a tornado tag match that will turn monday night raw upside down what an atmosphere the brothers of destruction together again facing randy orton and his partner who are looking to go legend hunting many have tried most have failed let's see what happens here tonight he can do it take all the wind out of you i think this man still has a ways to go [Applause] can he do it here and it kicked stomping down gets out of the way well-placed kick to the gun no damaging the kick to the spine set them up now oh hooked up oh [__] breaker he was elusive there yeah watch the quickness on this [Applause] and he stops and there you see the undertaker checking on kane wait a minute from behind the chair on undertaker and orton's got one too they are laying ways to gain an undertaker this is too much [Applause] oh this is an extraordinary sight goosebump inducing the aw inspiring entrance of the undertaker darkness has completely engulfed this entire building admit it byron you're scared a little bit we are seeing a legend in the flesh and his opponent from death valley weighing in at 299 pounds the taker the magnificence of the phenom truly a mesmerizing scene the legendary phenom creates an atmosphere unlike anything you will see talk to anyone who's ever been in the ring opposite the undertaker and they will tell you nothing prepares you for this the stoic walk of the dead man you know undertaker is a time-honored warrior of the ring no matter what you do i'm not sure there's anything that prepares you for the undertaker so many superstars have stood across the ring from the dead man paralyzed with fear abandon all hope the dead man has risen with the undertaker taking on a superstar who stared the dead man right in his cold dead eyes and didn't even blink helen a cell has been the undertaker's playground throughout his career but his opponent is hoping to end that story career tonight and gain the recognition that he thinks he deserves well he wants attention he's going to get plenty of it here tonight it might just not be the kind he's looking forward he who has the sledgehammer has the last laugh out of the ring and even closer to the chain lincoln closure fishing for something beneath the ring and he's going with the great equalizer here the steel chair and he was ready for undertaker there are so many iconic names attached to this sort of match shawn michaels stone cold big boss man triple h rakishi the rock i can go on and on and on but that fake tonight between the undertaker mankind can't be stopped undertaker some and you never want to kind of competitor out but there seems to be no signs of defense right now he's getting a little badder now i'll lay this aggression in the corner yeah right in the jaw able to sidestep it man right across the chest undertaker counters what makes him pay with a counter [Applause] zero scorpion an important victory for him in this match the dead man has just been buried undertaker lost and i can't believe it we me we now this should be fun the loser of tonight's match will be forced to wear a mask of the winner's choice for 30 days that's a long time to have to carry the shame it sure is byron we're in for one heck of a face-off [Applause] he's going for it all oh my god sam looking for the backline what a kick stomping ouch great counter impressive ring iq on display there he's reminding his competition that they'll only ever be second best samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian draw oh big kick boom on the jump and landing with the double axe handle oh my devastating impact in the back systematic attack on that springboard he's looking a little off balance no need to panic he's still swinging well on the kick stop after stop for reckless strikes with a kick he's going for the pin this could be it one two three [Applause] zero uh oh here is a great star with a ton of potential a graceful flyer you're right about those things cole but unfortunately potential doesn't pay the bills can carrillo turn it around we find out right now and his opponent from monterrey mexico weighing in at 198 pounds a lot of people have questioned just how far umberto carrillo can go but he assured me that he is as confident as he has ever been [Applause] i've seen some wild matches over the years in wwe but never anything quite like this ladies and gentlemen i present to you chicken korea roberto carrillo and his opponent have said some pretty ugly things to each other but it can't get any uglier than this chicken mask anything's possible with these two in the ring saxton first one second one didn't effective oh what a kick the damage he's taking is starting to pile up stiff kick the adrenaline is pumping and the wwe universe is on his side well scouted by um emphatically delivered and that's all she [Applause] wrote zero look who it is the following contest [Applause] boom and here we go tag team action in store there's a science to being a successful tag team and cole i would know all about that hey what about me i excluded you for good reason byron now back to the action evading offense he went right into that turnbuckle oh he knew what was coming trampolining he's absorbing some tough hits now yeah this is exactly why constant frequent tags are so important in a match like this to keep fresh headed to the top rope fighting back by the counter and finds its mark nice striker tag is registered into the turnbuckle tagged into action [Applause] here he goes [Applause] here are your winners the submission match you have to take signature maneuvers that result in a pinfall out of the equation it's about making your opponent tap out to win the superstars will use that move to weaken their opponent but they must be able to lock in a submission okay you're right saxon it doesn't have to be a submission move the competitors known for the one that's been declared before the match we can very well see some of the deepest tools in the toolbox tonight he knows how to avoid contact nice takedown [Applause] evades their offense ziggler may be in trouble here he looks as good as ever so far though he's been able to avoid any debilitating holds at this point in the match man a little extra luster behind that kick [Applause] gets out of there down on the chest good night what a stunner strikes with a kick could be near got to find a way to defend him can he shut the door on this one quickly [Music] clearly [Applause] this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen so me this highly anticipated confrontation is under submission match rules no pinfalls the only way to win is to tap out or pass out your opponent i've got a feeling we're about to see these superstars bust out submissions that we haven't even seen from them before he switches it back around quick thinking pays off great wherewithal on the counter look at this going counter for counter this match grinded him down a little submission match is all about wear and tear coal he'll do well to remember that moving forward oh stinking kick connects on the kick perfect kick connected on that and eric escapes danger definitely blow to the chest catches the leg quick exchange of counters there that kick will stop you in your tracks ducking out of get him there and he saw that cut oh wow [Applause] this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen guys an absolute statement by the victor here tonight what a steamrolling the boy wonder has arrived i can hardly contain myself and his opponent from new york city weighing in at 235 pounds he is the best [Music] [Applause] mcmahon was born with a silver spoon but there's no doubt will take any risk to win this match-up we never thought we'd see as the former mma competitor takes on shane mcmahon in a raw underground style match which started weeks ago with a tbt post from dolph ziggler ends here tonight with the raw underground ring master fighting under these conditions for the very first time you gotta respect shane oh max courage but he's in way over his head tonight counter after counter oh look at this blue thunderbolt this has got to be it shadow mack felt that coming samoan drop byron now trampling the opposition he gets out of the way might fight shane back samoan drop oh kick connects knew what was coming there he manages to escape it samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian shifts it back onto him i had that well scouted mcmahon manages the counter able he's got the answer for that one mcmahon able to avoid that never ceases to amaze me [Applause] that's [Applause] and that seemed like a pretty easy day at the office right there that's why they call it light work cole barely even broke a sweat the following contest is scheduled looking into the eyes of this competitor tonight you know he understands the significance of this match this is an opportunity to make big headway on the roster and across the ring a is party animal ivar always enjoys throwing himself headlong into combat and feasting with a large hunk of meat certainly does have a zest for right but you're right about his love in combat few superstars look as at home in the ring as i bar you can tell this viking was born for bounty producing a trampoline oh look at this oh kicks turn your lights out ivar did his homework there he's in a little bit of trouble now yeah but you can't count anyone out again this match could still go either way everything working against dybar now yeah avar needs to get moving as soon as possible solid connection oh [Applause] superstars showing great awareness of their opponent's repertoire mistake made by get that instant return ready [Applause] here is your winner it's stressful always being on high alert never know who's going to come after me and my title but this really helps oh yeah that's keep

let me know what you think yeah sure no problem thanks and there you see the 24-7 champion checking out carmella's match looks like he's seen enough weight our truth from behind falls count anywhere we've seen this type of match devolve pretty quickly that's the beauty cole i don't think anyone cares about a win here this is about punishment it's about making a statement to the whole locker room that you're not someone to trifle with nasty kick to the face he's got him scouted boom what a high kick now trampling the opposition oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up ddt ah a flurry of brutality that's mounted with punches and not oh a nasty stop to finish it off that'll hurt ddt right to the back oh kick connects and truth capitalizes there steer clear of that spear looking ended here this could be it one two three and this one is over hello mr mcmahon i'm here for the meeting you requested made me wake up early to come down here and then you're nowhere to

well that is unless they choose to use the title to insult americans as some have many freedom to do so saxton foot just stopping down reversal can he take advantage may scales all the way up top uh-oh [Applause] yeah look at this going counter for connor absolutely and a kick stiff kick will get your attention oh what a kick devastating kick [Applause] here is your winner and still so this

shoulders feast your eyes oh oh man [Applause] oh wow so me this superstar looks determined tonight whoa from behind they're gonna settle this right now watching this no dq match i can't help but think of all the great no disqualification matches we've seen in wwe over the years no doubt michael triple h versus brock lesnar in 2013 the rock versus mankind in 1999 both classics but the all-time best has got to be undertaker versus sean michaels at wrestlemania 26. yeah i hate to disagree with you corey but stone cold steve austin against the rock at wrestlemania 17 was the greatest no disqualification match of all time in fact it might even be the greatest match in wwe history let's just agree that all those matches are great and i'd argue this one could live up to that same hype guys [Music] samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian draw oh really just laying it in and cedric expected that implanted by the ddt oh man he's able to sidestep there cedric has him mitchunoku driver wow and he saw that coming from cedric yeah oh what a kick [Applause] clearly waiting for that up across the feast your shoulders that kick will stop you in your tracks up across the shoulders on the right better get ready after a heated backstage brawl kickstarted their issue cedric alexander and the budding disciples attacked him take their fight to center stage and they'll be joined by murphy and ricochet to make it an official tag team match let's see if murphy's partner can help him win this match and impress the monday night messiah oh what a counter cedric shooting up the turnbuckle uh-oh [Applause] behind that kick he's feeling the effects of that last hit devastating kick great reaction from cedric first he had scouted oh that was the best one i've ever [Applause] finally got seen i can't believe this match is finally over [Applause] here are your winners sub-zero scorpion smoke and murphy two great superstars that go great together and that win is proof that was a great example of what a tag team can do when it's firing on all cylinders hey [Applause] here we go with austin theory mustafa ali and the jewish recruit taking on cedric alexander in one of the most lopsided handicap matches we've seen in some time you have to ask yourself what will seth rollins disciples stoop to next whatever it takes to win saxton if this lands it might be all over [Applause] stomping down [Applause] now he's been put on the defensive great reaction from cedric dropped right on their face and he barely evades follow [Applause] first gets him with the counter oh check out this power this is ridiculous powers for him he must have seen that coming oh god knee meets face counters with their own [Applause] sweet sweet victory here are your winners sub zero scorpion smoke austin theory and mustafa ah lee batman we so me the royal rumble is right around the corner but for some reason you've been unusually silent about it i'm still deciding what i want to do if you're going to be even loosely associated with us then we need full transparency so are you going to attempt to qualify or no i think it would be a mistake if i didn't okay well good news i already spoke to mandy rose and got you in a 10-man royal rumble qualifying match tonight it pays to have friends in high places yes it does the royal rumble is right around the corner which means spots in this year's match are getting harder and harder to come by but tonight 10 wwe superstars will fight for the chance to pursue a career defining women in particular michael who found his way into this match thanks to an assist from the wwe champion must be nice to have seth rollins on your speed dive it sure is saxton but as usual you've missed the forest for the treats there are a lot of hungry competitors in the mix tonight including future hall of famers aj styles and samoa joe and i guarantee you those two don't want to watch the royal rumble from home with the reversal [Applause] get ready he deflects [Applause] one mistake and he could be out of here just as quickly [Applause] big kick pull right kick oh what a kick who's it gonna be fellas [Applause] ah look who we have here

[Applause] wasting absolutely no respect on his opponent you gotta love it huh [Applause] me don't want to ruin your big night but i have some bad news and thought you should hear it from me first what's going on management has started drawing entry numbers for the royal rumble and i found out that you drew number two damn i know i tried talking to mandy but she couldn't change it there's only so much power i have around here but look i was in the same spot in 2014. i can't remember did you win no but i lasted nearly 50 minutes making it to the final five but you can do more you can win i know it and then after that at wrestlemania you defeat the universal champion from smackdown and we control wwe together sounds like a plan you're damn right it does the following contest is the royal rumble match the two superstars that drew number one and number two will start in the ring at the same time other superstars will join in the order that they drew this will continue until all 30 superstars have entered the ring eliminations occur when a superstar is thrown over the top rope with both feet landing on the floor the last superstar in the ring will be declared the royal rumble

update that suit game you know what that's not about introducing the participants first from burlington north carolina weighing in at 220 pounds so you could say cameron grimes is similar to the million dollar man ted dibiase but even classier cameron grimes a stock market savant somehow made money buying coins for dogs that's not exactly how that works sex and i'll explain later but cameron grimes about to make even more money tonight when he captures the winner's purse of this match yeah now we're talking introducing the individual who drew number two from new york weighing in at 269

level has absolutely changed inside this arena well scouted reversal there to punch his ticket to wrestlemania you have to think he's got his sights set on universal champion let's not get ahead of ourselves saxton let's just wait and see let's hear what wwe champion seth rollins has to say after his little misstep on social media his account was hacked part of being the monday night messiah is being honest with your disciples it's that trust that bond that gives us strength and allows us to accomplish great things so i'm here tonight to tell the truth about why i did what i did to show it was all for the greater good and still can be so i'll speak directly to our discontented brother messiah to man first let's get this out of the way my social media account was not hacked we did have intentions of striking you down if you chose to face me at wrestlemania that's the truth but full disclosure there were other transgressions that took place before that i told mandy rose that you didn't want an automatic qualifying spot in the rumble that you really wanted to earn it which got you put in the 10-man qualifying match that's the truth and then when you won that match we needed another plan so i pulled some strings and got you the number two entry spot in the rumble and then of course we all know how that turned out and how we ended up here tonight and all of that is the truth so now i've bared my soul to you and shown you everything we can still work together we can still do great things win the universal championship at wrestlemania and we can take over wwe like we had planned or you can ignore the truth throw everything away and take on the monday night messiah and his disciples and face your destruction at our hands make no mistake if you challenge us we will finish the burial that i started but remember i was just trying to steer you toward the correct choice to help you succeed and that's what i'm doing again now but this is it it's your last chance make the right decision honor the truth and trust me for the greater good [Applause] will the royal rumble winner listen to the monday night messiah and put this all behind them or will he choose to take on seth rollins at wrestlemania we'll find out soon enough the wwe universe heard from seth rollins earlier tonight and we all want to know did his words have any impact on who you will face at wrestlemania you might be wondering why i'm holding this shovel you see seth likes to speak in metaphors and talk about all sorts of things like the greater good and embracing the truth so i figured i'd speak his language seth you and your disciples tried to bury me but you failed and now i'm gonna bury you at wrestlemania that's right i'm not changing my mind but you know what why wait until wrestlemania i'm gonna start the burial tonight by taking out your disciples in a three on one match actually i forgot about the shovel make that three on two as seth rollins followers prepare for this three-on-one match against their former ally you have to imagine their leader the monday night messiah will be watching closely with the odds heavily in their favor seth won't be satisfied with anything other than a convincing win i think that's exactly what we're going to see here tonight from behind with that shovel he's not waiting for the match to start it's no longer three on one that shovels an equalizer he's taking out weeks of built-up frustration after being held back by seth and his group he said he was gonna bury seth's followers but i didn't know he meant it literally i think mustafa ali and austin theory could have serious injuries it doesn't appear that the scheduled match will take place seth's crew is decimated maybe but it looks like murphy still wants to fight poor decision on his part this guy's out for vengeance nonetheless it looks like we're now going to have a singles match [Applause] and here's a superstar that has all the tools to be one of the biggest names this business has ever seen i'm not ready to crown him as the next big thing just yet but his performance in this match could sway me you're not the only person to be looking to convince tonight then there's murphy across the ring a man searching for recognition a superstar is trying to step out of the shadows and make a name for himself murray may be overshadowed at times but make no mistake about it murphy's a wildly talented competitor with a tip on his shoulder and fire in his lungs and landing with the double axe handle stomping away murphy turns that away he unpacks we'll get your attention able to get out of the way [Applause] here is your winner sub zero scorpion smoke no other way to put it guys that was kind of a butt kicking this is what you get when you have complete confidence and control of the situation the following contest is scheduled for one fall and is for the wwe championship [Applause] we are about to see something good here we go gentlemen huge title match coming up and a huge opportunity for the champ to prove to everyone that there truly is none better in all of wwe right now the challenger looking determined he will need the performance of a lifetime to become champion [Applause] all the messiah has arrived it is time to embrace the vision [Applause] now we're talking [Applause] set rollins at the showcase of the immortals michael you of all people have to remember the heist of the century when rollins cashed in his money in the bank at wrestlemania 31. he'd go on to defeat triple h at wrestlemania 33 but the highlights don't stop there byron no rollins won the intercontinental title at wrestlemania 34 won the wwe championship at wrestlemania 35 and rollins is guaranteed to perform another wrestlemania miracle tonight [Applause] introducing the challenger from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke [Applause] and introducing the champion from davenport iowa weighing in at 217 pounds he is the wwe champion that's what it's all about the wwe championship the challenger wanted this opportunity now he's got it well it's always fun to go to the zoo until you fall into the lions then the challenger had better sharpen his teeth the road to wrestlemania has led to this the defending wwe champion seth rollins will take on his former associate a superstar who's still called the gravedigger due to his vicious pledge to bury seth rollins once and for all in tonight's no dq wwe championship match one of wwe's most fearsome alliances has been shattered by the quest for this wwe championship michael you have to wonder how those betrayals will affect the outcome of one of the most personal wrestlemania main events we've seen in years that's right they've all got something on the ride tonight and what should be an absolutely brutal no disqualification listen sometimes the only road to wrestlemania is the railroad seth rollins and his opponent but only one of them will leave wrestlemania as champion rollins struggling rollins in deep deep trouble you up hold on it's seth rollins disciples well last we knew they weren't medically cleared to be here looks like they're going to get revenge for what was done to them on raw with that shovel never underestimate the monday night messiah we should have known he wasn't going into this match without a backup plan i know there's been a lot of turmoil between these men and this is no disqualification but this is wrestlemania it's not supposed to end like this this is gonna get ugly i can't watch what the hell what just happened could this be it he's done it after a shocking tournament where former allies turned enemies became allies again seth rollins has been dethroned and we have a new wwe champion and more than a new champion it looks like we have a new alliance with a new leader i think we just saw the birth of a new monday night messiah and seth rollins can't believe it he thought he had the match in his wwe championship secured but that was not the case the new champion set out to bury him and that is exactly what he just did this is a wrestlemania moment that will be remembered for a very long time i'm in shock wow congrats to the new champion i guess the following contest is the wwe universe just exploded [Applause] we've seen the opposition tonight post on social media about lane and on the line to leave here tonight with that coveted prize and it won't be easy this champ is as dominant as we've ever seen from a title holder i've got a feeling this one will live up to the height the pressure is on for the champion looking to cement himself as one of the best of this era with a big win tonight so [Applause] as he tries to win back his title from the newly minted wwe champion who has proven time and time again he may very well be the most powerful man in all of wwe there's nothing like strength in numbers wwe champion has that in spades with three new disciples in this corner i just don't see where murphy austin theory and mustafa ali don't find a way to get involved tonight lock caves or not yeah yeah everyone in the wwe universe has been talking about the shovel heard round the world at wrestlemania but the reality is the new wwe champion has been the man to beat all by himself and rollins capitalizes and look here he's making his way up the cage fortitude being tested with every step trying to climb out and intercept it unceremoniously sent right back down to the canvas oh that was a devastating what a ddt while it's getting worked on here the new plan oh just turn that around getting set up for something in the corner he's one step ahead there oh and here he is scaling up the cage wall [Music] the sprint up the cage is on now that is why there's a champ getting ever so close to the very peak of the steel cage and now he has finally been able to reach the top of the cage and would you look at that he could be well on his way to escaping the steel cage the longer he's up there the more fear starts to seep into the mind the champion retains here is your winner and still the wwe champion [Applause] perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this win never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about as lopsided as they come so well misery loves company the following contest is scheduled for one fall on the way to the ring at a combined weight of 389 pounds sub zero scorpion smoke and mandy rose two of the very best at doing whatever it takes to win i think we're about to see some brand new ways of cheating iron sharpens iron saxton one half of the street profits stir it up michael stone up and representing the street profits from chicago illinois weighing in at 232 pounds you know montez ford likes to have fun but yeah true honor to be a a part of his matches spent four years protecting our country as part of the marine corps also worked for the navy but now he makes his living and wwe we all want the smoke you can't handle the smoke yes i can she calls herself the e-s-t and from knoxville tennessee fiancee [Applause] bianca has been exceptional her entire life she earned all sec and all-american honors in track and field at the university of tennessee and if you just ask her she'll tell you why she's better than everybody else you got eyes byron you understand a freak in the weight room a beast in the ring bianca bel-air can do it all and she's got a lethal hair whip raw's general manager mandy rose and the wwe champion are teaming up to take on bianca bellaire and montez ford after mandy's had some issues with bianca as of late i'm not sure why mandy chose the wwe champion is there something developing between these two it's simple mandy chose her partner because he's the wwe champion as far as i know there's nothing else going on here let's keep it professional saxton place to the corner how about this nicely done solid connection now tracking the opposition oh check out this power this is ridiculous [Applause] step up benzene return fire from montez ford into the corner he really thought that was it [Applause] yeah this is exactly why constant frequent tags are so important in a match here oh come on rap get some control shut up byron pair of chops and another here they come over and over and there's more put into the corner now oh look at this incredible together [Applause] sub-zero scorpion smoke and mandy rose and this mixed tag team proves to be a very effective one tonight two men with one common goal can be a dangerous thing they're putting the entire locker room on notice so [Music] the following contest is scheduled for one fall oh yeah i like this guy ah the scottish warrior is ready for battle brandishing the king's blade this is a man who fought his way all the way to the top of wwe completely different mindset than his first time around in wwe for years people always talked about the potential of drew mcintyre what he could accomplish well it seems finally drew mcintyre is embracing those expectations well the chosen one has now become the one introducing the chat there's been a lot of whining from drew mcintyre coming into tonight's match about possible collusion between the wwe champion and mandy rose am i the only one who thinks it's possible that drew mcintyre is just a little bit jealous oh come on corey i don't think it's considered whining if it's justified only one thing is for sure the deck is stacked against drew mcintyre will be able to climb the mountain and recapture the wwe championship let's find out stomping crouch mcintyre gets away from that follow a moonsault wow mcintyre reverses and looks to capitalize some serious damage to the arm being inflicted here and he's able to reverse oh perfect [Applause] strikes with a kick another one bites the dust to the chain sharp kick who catches it with the cut the champ will stay champ still in this the title hangs in the balance the champion's shock is palpable the champ will have to dig deeper now that was the home run shot that got robbed at the fence that dodge can buy drew time paying it right back with a mcintyre gets met with a response [Applause] out of the way and the champion finally ready to put this one away one two three here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub-zero scorpion smoke that came out of nowhere and an unexpectedly quick end to this match an absolute statement by the victor here tonight what a steamrolling oh one of the best superstars around there's certainly been no shortage of drama leading up to tonight's extreme rules match between braun strowman and the beleaguered wwe champion especially after the champions very public falling out with ross gm mandy rose extreme circumstances for this extreme rules match michael it's the monster among men first the monster among taking flight oh a huge miss there oh wow he just rarely dodges [Applause] dodges he saw that one coming suplex brings him down [Applause] and he retaliates on strobin back and forth from these competitors looking to catch him off guard and he breaks the pin right away he wasn't even close on that pin attempt he reverses it [Applause] he's pushed to the break [Applause] zero scorpion progressive perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this one here we go in this highly anticipated wwe championship match hold on it looks like raw gm mandy rose is here i wonder who she's going to side with certainly not the wwe champion after everything he's done the wwe champion has already overcome lauren braun strowman's size beat down tonight but can he handle back-to-back no man should endure that much pain in one night but that's exactly what the rainy wwe champion will have to do to defend his title against the former champion drew mcintyre i'd wish the champ good luck but he's gonna need a lot more than that to survive this match but hey embarrass mandy rose and this is what you get off the turnbuckles what's he gonna do stirring back to his feet but he might not know where he is that's a bad landing that is what happens when you throw your body around you eventually meet the pavement i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the longer way down last ride oh look at this [Applause] way up there he finds a counter to mcintyre there oh foot just stomping down well piercing strike that kick will stop you in your tracks oh what a kick makes him pay with a counter so much damage inflicted answering back oh that's gonna sting salt laid he's back into the ring and he has free reign to the outside with no count-outs to worry about drew good contact i think the paradigm has shifted oh a nasty stop to finish it off he turns it around knee right to the midsection and this match will head back to the right are you serious how much more can the wwe champion endure tonight we're about to find out the title is going nowhere kiss your dreams [Applause] here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke that came out of nowhere and an unexpectedly quick end to this match there's the consequences of getting caught unprepared just goes to show you you've got to be on your toes at all times yeah now we're talking to hold one of the biggest titles in wwe means you're one of the best in the industry it's been a wild ride on raw these past few weeks for the wwe champion the gm mandy rose are bound to put their drama behind them and focus on this triple threat match for the wwe title it's about time michael the wwe champion will defend his title against braun strowman and a hungry drew mcintyre who's had his eye on this title ever since he won a number one contenders match to what feels like a lifetime ago good things come in threes love triangles triple threats bounce teams if you don't count saxton and right now we've got three superstars that absolutely loathe each other facing off for the wwe championship what more could you ask for [Applause] just like that braun gets passed on [Applause] he is truly feeling it right now as well strikes mcintyre must be getting phased by this attack drew's power currently being suppressed look oh shatter your chest drop kick his competition that they'll only ever be second best he's definitely being the aggressor here yeah he is showing us a lot out here can't quite get him there look at him pride these two are ready for each other the challenger not looking good right now this should come as no surprise brown is shockingly being dismantled debilitating attack on the leg he foiled that attempt looks like the chair is going to retain [Applause] stays the champ here is your winner and still me so and here we go introducing the chip wwe championship title match is now officially underway history could be made regardless of which one of these men you're a fan of or you support you cannot argue these are two men with championship pedigree you can't be in this position if that weren't true second one didn't effective now trampling the opposition terminating knee smash able to avoid there the challenger eating up some damage no need to panic he's still swinging [Applause] reflexes stands tall once again [Applause] here is your winner and stick me we with today's technology i can watch wrestling anywhere gentlemen you were looking at a man who was sick of the doubters sick of being questioned about his potential and i can't disagree with him i expect tonight to be a night where he can silence the skeptics and prove to be the future of this company but the confidence he possesses could take him very far and then with ricochet you know he's willing to step up to any challenge that is presented to it but ricochet steps up but he also steps up when it's not the wisest of decisions at times he's got more heart than brains [Applause] ooh this is kicking the spine really just laying it in great counter by ricochet series of reversals big knee to the midsection solid contact there ricochet being grounded for the time being ricochets knight is not going according to plan but ricochet has to push now while there's an opening i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last ride goes into the pin gets the shoulder up wow what's it going to take just kicking out at one takes a lot in a match like this he's looking a little weird there's some shock in the arena after that kickout emphatic victory here is your winner me well hearing that otis wanted a late night snack and devoured everything catering had prepped hope you're in the mood for peanut butter sandwiches and nothing else hey just don't take it out on otis okay i heard he was hungry could have happened to anyone here he comes looking into the eyes of this competitor tonight you know he understands the significance of this match this is an opportunity to make big headway on the roster well unfortunately for him he's facing otis tonight i'm not going to lie i'm kind of missing that's because you're a simple man saxton this otis is an upgrade in every conceivable way he's lost the goofiness leaned into his natural ability and now he's leveled up into one of the most intimidating superstars on the roster both wrists captured right to the face so much for leveling up botus got it taken to him there it's nothing he hasn't been through before uh-oh this is not gonna end well and the attack from otis avoided stomping away and otis was ready there oh [Applause] incredible on the top double handle connects and he barely evades up top [Applause] and that's all she wrote here is your winner me me any truth to the rumors that dolph ziggler is messing with everyone's stuff backstage hearing is doing a bit in his comedy routine about the weird things he's found in superstar's luggage shouldn't a locker room leader step up and get him to knock it off and you can sense the anger emanating from the competitor tonight this is a man you don't want to be in front of right now the man possessed is what he is as for dolph coming into this one i think you need to strip away all the talk on social media all the interviews they're all just smoke screens trust me dolph's coming in with sinister thoughts [Applause] yeah always using out of the ring tactics to distract his opponents from the vicious in-ring wrestling threat that he is talking about dismantling your opponent [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whoa this is surprising byron yeah i think he was just looking to soften him up a little here and there's dolph being out wrestled he planned for this and can still rally the stop in every single part of his body oh no no no no no [Applause] that holds back ziggler's attack samoan drop byron [Applause] he knows how to avoid contact knew what was coming there reciprocating the initial reversal stomping down ziggler looking evasive catching a dropkick [Music] [Applause] zero scorpion me [Music] thank you [Music] what did you want to talk to me about i realize this is kind of a big ask but i want to defend my wwe championship against john cena beating him would solidify my title reign and put me up there with some of the top champions of all time so any chance you can make that happen you know maybe give him one of those mandates to show up and face me yeah i wish it was that easy i mean don't you think i've already tried to get cena to appear on raw before he would bring instant star power along with a guaranteed ratings boost but the reality is he's busy with various tv and film projects and isn't interested in a return right now so it's pretty much a lost cause if i were you i'd focus on something else i wouldn't be where i am today if i just quit anytime i was up against some adversity i'm gonna get john cena to come back to wwe and face me and how are you going to do that i'm going to take a little trip down memory lane and revisit some of cena's career highlights maybe that will get his attention the red brands rolling out the red carpet tonight as the current wwe champion has invited none other than the miz to monday night raw to square off one on one it's a heck of a gambit michael using the miz to provoke one of wwe's greatest champions of all time john cena and it's a gamut that could easily blow up in the wwe champion's face saw that one coming finds the advantage after a string of counters simon drop byron [Applause] stomping ouch he turns it around he saw it coming following wow the miz looking a little bit shaken oh man turn your lights out you can see the dismay on the face of the miz not an a-list performance here from miz turns the tables yeah miz able to stop that surge dead in its tracks [Applause] and he rolls out to create some separation he should have created separation by never coming out here impressive ring iq on display there great job refocusing to reverse that one [Applause] wow miz with awesome good defense oh check out this power this is ridiculous dominance powers for him this match is brutality starting to show on him there's been plenty of action in this match and the cost of that is really showing now [Applause] and that seemed like a pretty easy [Music] so this whole cena thing hate to say i told you so but you know what i don't hate it at all i told you so i know how it looks from your perspective but i promise it's gonna work i just need more time and besides i never said this would be easy fine but if you don't get at least some kind of acknowledgement soon from cena then i'm pulling the plug what's your next move spotlighting a major loss didn't seem to work so i'm gonna go in the other direction oh yeah i actually got wind of your idea for this already trying to replicate cena's first wwe championship win by beating jbl don't think it's going to matter but i'll make it happen the following contest is scheduled for one fall making his way to the ring from new york weighing in at 269 pounds the wwe champion zero scorpion this guy used to stick to one weight class backing in fresh off a big way against them is the wwe champion will try to get john cena's attention one more time tonight against one of cena's former wrestlemania foes jbl jbl is a hall of famer that can still go in the ring and has a hall of fame voice to boot give that butt kiss and a rest saxton just dating fat story foot just stopping down just like that bradshaw finds a counter ah what a smash that is just insulting [Applause] a counter answer by another baffling decision here oh well measured strike [Applause] he is going to take this match as long and as far as he needs to oh well he's looking a little weary now not a bad place to be in but the longer this goes the more trouble a superstar exposes himself to he catches jbl with a counter trying to find his bearings but it looks like his end is near looking for the victory two three kick down how was that not three does bradshaw have any fight left [Applause] jbl isn't being given any room to recover jbl has to gather the energy to turn the tables and that was a well-targeted attack [Applause] that should do it right there he's able to beat a two-cap not quite enough to put him away work here is your winner [Music] ah there was a potential opening with cena and you blew it i don't think it's over are you crazy he turned you down and then you insulted him we can forget about a match he probably won't even come back for a simple appearance now so thanks for that i'm telling you i think i struck a nerve with him and a man like that is too proud to just let that go let me do one more thing to get his attention and if this doesn't work then i'll move on you've already tried one more thing two or three times he's gonna respect the fact that i won't give up and then you'll get your star power and your ratings boost that you want so bad what do you want to do i want the undertaker what let me explain cena was in the exact same position i'm in with the undertaker a few years ago at wrestlemania he was so desperate for a match he bought a ticket and sat in the audience waiting when undertaker eventually did appear cena lost in five minutes i remember all that what's your point i want to send cena a final message by doing what he couldn't do at wrestlemania i want to defeat the undertaker that's really pushing it but i think i can make it happen and if cena sticks to his word and never answers your challenge then at least i'll get the ratings boost i was looking for with the undertaker and if cena does change his mind then even better all right looks like you got yourself a match against the phenom the wwe champion has been on a roll but tonight the champ will have to take his game to an entirely new level as he takes on the incomparable wwe legend the undertaker it's the wwe champion first the dead man on raw this is huge i have a feeling that even john cena is going to be taking a break from his busy hollywood schedule to watch this one that's certainly the champion's plan let's see if it works up and down what a slam [Applause] connects return fire from the undertaker undertaker looking moral undertaker facing some trouble you can bet the dead man won't rest here and now there's an opening great reversal you can see the angle scrolling on his face yeah it's to pull up some form of offense here a monumental victory tonight for the wwe champion over the phenom himself the undertaker you never want to overlook an accomplishment like that but i think the champion still has other things on his mind john cena over the past few weeks i've done everything i can to prove to you that i'm worthy of a match that i'm worthy of your time i mean i just beat the undertaker which is something you couldn't do so you know what maybe maybe i've been looking at this the wrong way maybe it's not about proving that i'm worthy of your time maybe you're not worth mine i have to agree with the wwe champion here it's time to move on from this whole john cena thing wait a second it's john cena the face of wwe has come home i can't believe it after weeks of unanswered challenges and then cena himself saying it wasn't going to happen the wwe champion has gotten john cena to return to monday night wrong and there you have it cena is back for one thing the wwe championship hey this is the matchup that no one thought we'd ever see and now it looks like it's happening this is gonna be one for the ages the following contest is scheduled for one fall it is for the wwe championship oh cory what do you think of the champs chances here tonight i love them i'm not like everybody else cole it seems like everybody's ready to write the champs demise but not me many have written him off as champion but he is determined to prove his doubters wrong [Applause] in my estimation the greatest of all time the 16-time world champion john cena there aren't too many people who would argue with you michael cole time to do it one time again let's go to work john cena is certainly no stranger to high pressure situations to big stages that is exactly why cena has earned the nickname big match john 16 time world champion in my estimation the greatest competitor ever stepped foot in the ring in wwe his sustained excellence for a decade and a half is unparalleled at this level it's moments like this that john cena lives for the pressure the spotlight and the ability to deliver what it matters most hall of famers living legends triple h hbk the rock the list goes on and introducing the challenger from west newcastle [Applause] the audience can be at times they know true greatness when they see introducing the champions wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke the states could not be any higher it is time for our wwe championship match wakes the grueling battles of all led the wwe champion at this moment a chance to etch his name into the wwe history books against the one and only john cena talk about box office two of the biggest draws in sports entertainment are fighting for the right to call themselves the true face of wwe you want to talk faces the wwe champion finally got his wish a chance to carve his mug right up there onto wwe's mount rushmore look at him totally fighting with the wwe universe right now [Music] he catches cena with a counter a trampoline and a kick samoan dropped byron challenger challenger's a little worse for wear now he deflects it right back by the counter cena dodges out of that oh he retaliates hit the mark with that one sharp kick finds it well placed kick [Applause] retains here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen guys never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about as lopsided as they come the following content introducing the challenger welcome to what should be one of the most brutal championship matches we've ever seen between the defending wwe champion and one of the most decorated superstars in wwe history john cena as they face off in a last man standing match that means that one of these two extraordinary athletes will need to keep the other down for a full ten count to walk out of here tonight with the title it's hard enough keeping cena down for a three count let alone 10. let's see if the wwe champion has what it takes watch out producing a trampoline an agile escape oh my gosh i fall away moonsault slam wow picture perfect moonsault that kick will stop you in your tracks big knee to the midsection the challenger's looking shaken and cena's starting to falter here cena has to find a way to reassert himself and then cut cena right off slam i think the champs himself but he's also giving his opponent a chance to recover staggering to his feet but he won't like what's coming next oh this is an incessant attack being brought to him he's got to wake up and get in the fight able to get out of the way [Applause] a championship level move two three oh man the referee just counted to seven eight [Applause] cena needs to find some energy fast just like that cena gets intercepted he's piling up the damage now this is sadistic i saw that one coming took advantage stick to the midsection [Applause] outside of the ring now gets inside the ring kinda off the count here maybe with a little something extra in mind coming in hot and he'll leave the ring for this next strong stretch look at this now draping his opponent over the announced desk these two showing how well scott they each are and the hits to the core keep coming attack a defensive cena here check your face after that one an uninterrupted surge against cena here cena's just trying to weather the storm he has got something destructive in [Applause] to the carnage sacks then feel free to leave this is what real ferocity looks like [Applause] that's it the champ stays the chance here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero and if you want to reach the pinnacle of sports entertainment there's an argument to be made that you must win the wwe title absolutely right there have been legends and hall of famers who never won the title for putting this on your resume moves you into a different class of compelling bicycle knee strike on the jump sent into the corner counters that he manages to escape it good timing with that reversal oh right to the kidneys [Applause] oh man right to the devastating kick champion avoids damage i don't believe it how did the challengers survive that by the skin of their teeth and don't expect the champ to start going easy on them now what's the tally and how many times we thought this match is coming to an end i can't count anymore looking for the victory and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner we i've been watching a lot of old andre the giant matches recently nothing like a big man doing big man things i mean can you imagine what it would have been like to face him in his prime and here we have a superstar with a big chip on his shoulder he has certainly felt overworked recently well he has a chance to change that perception in this matchup but across the ring you have a man who's the odds-on favorite in any match andre the giant a competitor who's not only bigger and stronger than almost anyone in the history of wwe but who has traveled the world proving he's the most extraordinary athlete of all time you don't get to be the eighth wonder of the world without conquering the globe and andre's done just that oh look at this oh kicks turn your lights out he saw that one coming each competitor showing they've done the before stopping down andre might never have experienced a blow like that one oh what a kick an elusive giant there both superstars showing great awareness of their opponent's repertoire he takes control stops the kick and responds with a counter of their own able to give him the slip [Applause] able to get the advantage here got to find a way to get out of this launch first go into aggression just pure brutality easy the giants in real danger [Applause] here is your winner sub zero i had the viking raiders on the podcast and we did a segment about the current raw roster who's the biggest prankster the messiest that sort of thing guess who they gave the ugliest scowl and least likely to get a date award i've got your trophy back at the office if you want it this guy is ready handicap match here and by design these matches put a superstar at a very heavy disadvantage yeah you know you're coming in with an instant disadvantage but if you can pull it off you'll have one serious respect that's a pretty big if saxton when the numbers game is against you like this is he switches it back around he avoids the damage series of some of his reversals now looks like the heightened action of this handicap matches caught up with him a little bit base first with a waistlock takedown setting up [Applause] oh oh my gosh damage pinpointing the leg whatever's playing here can't be good delivering a series of sharp elbows into the corner now he's in off the tag arms opponent trapped into the powerball wow [Music] gets out of there oh my god he's still in the match he got the shoulder up right at the last moment is it enough to secure the victory heading up he's thinking maybe he's found a new source of aggression to battle back with reversal on top of reversal hits him with the counter oh man look at this it's like he's got eight arms and feet a flurry of brutality everything here he goes for the wind he's got the victory here is your winner sub zero me me there's really no telling what this match might have in store for us just about the only thing you can count on is total yeah chaos is the name of the game here these superstars are going to be living out their most unhinged and dangerous dreams in this one another reversal he steers just sending a message there and ford had it scouted crafty way to get out of harm there stutter montage is in a very vulnerable position here [Applause] here is your winner sub zero look who it is smackdown's newest superstar smackdown is lucky to have this addition to its roster we'll see how he fares here but i think he has the chance to do big things hey i've been meaning to talk to you i know you've had some success here on smackdown but i have some constructive criticism if you're mature enough to handle it i'd like to think i am what is it i found some holes in your game several in fact and if you don't repair those holes they'll get bigger and bigger and you'll never make it to the next level really yes really you can ignore what i'm saying and accept mediocrity or you can take my advice train hard and better yourself i don't know what do you get out of all this other than the satisfaction of helping someone become the best version of themselves potentially a tag team partner but only if you accept my help and address your weaknesses i can make a slideshow if it'll help make this any clearer i don't think that will be necessary okay so what's your answer do you want my help or no i want to be the best i can be so let's do this great i'm going to run you through an intense program of challenges that will pinpoint and correct each of your weaknesses first up your toughness from what i've seen it's lacking agree to disagree no agree to agree to fix this deficiency i want you to go start a fight with riddle and win got it all right this superstar looks determined tonight from behind they're gonna settle this right now the bell is wrong and anything goes in this no disqualification match this is just going to be a brawl that can turn real ugly real quick no rules to obey means no limit on how nasty this one can get and i love it [Music] ah that hurt and he's able to reverse each competitor showing they've done their homework oh bam able to parry that one can't quite get him there turned that one around oh ouch oh man oh man oh oh a flurry of brutality [Music] run right through with the spear he's lining him up oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up up across the shoulders feast your eyes [Music] oh riddle left him high and dry [Music] riddle gets reversed well measured a well aimed strike an agile escape blasted the final cut perfectly executed [Music] and he said you're not getting me with that oh riddle with the kick and he's not done there the pro mission trying to find a way out several right hands and he's out he deflects it right back up across the shoulders boom feast your eyes oh sharp kick oh great awareness from riddle paying it back with their own counter oh low drop kick right on the patella riddle out of the way he's got him in his grasp check their face after that one oh man that's it calling it by knockout i saw what you did against riddle could have been worse i took down one of the toughest guys on the roster and that's all you can say it was a step in the right direction but you have more leaks in your boat to repair if you want to be the best version of yourself okay so what leak are we fixing next i see holes in your submission game prove me wrong in a submission match and i'll be out there watching in person so no shortcuts because shortcuts are bad no we've been over this if you take shortcuts you get cut short now come on start paying attention and don't let me down they are ready for a fight bit of an odd parent here as this submission match gets underway what do you mean drew gulag has a proven track record of helping superstars be the best version of themselves and i heard this is his latest project apparently coach boulack has tasked his student with working on his submission game tonight let's see how it goes devastating kick hits it with the counter series of reversals [Applause] a submission match is all about wear and tear coal he'll do well to remember that moving forward just one step ahead [Applause] he must have seen that coming away wow a ferocious attack against cesaro here cesaro is going to have to endure this punishment ah cesaro able to reverse that saw that one coming these two showing how well scouted they each are yeah and that's all she wrote nice win in the submission match last week but when i was out there i noticed you rely on reversals way too much that's a hole in your game i didn't even know existed you're turning out to be a bigger project than i thought you're not giving up on me are you no never it's just going to take more work than anticipated first let's nip this reversal issue in the bud in your next match you're not allowed to use any reversals got it yep and no shortcuts because if you take shortcuts you get cut short there just might be hope for you after all and here we have a superstar with a big chip on his shoulder he has certainly felt overlooked recently well he has a chance to change that perception in this match-up and taking him on is a luchador that throws caution to the win the high risk high reward but don't look at let's say it's one dimensional he's really developed a multi-tool offense yeah dorado continues to mature inside the ring and out of it i just heard he learned how to use the litter box solid connection all over their opponent oh what a kick oh what a [Applause] things are only going to get harder from here that's gonna be it there's two oh how did he get the shoulder up what an incredible match we are witnessing setting dorado up serious jeopardy for lindsay and that'll about do it folks here is your winner sub zero scorpio you're progressing nicely with your training but we still have more to fix okay what's next coach we've talked a lot about shortcuts and one of the ultimate shortcuts in sports entertainment is top rope maneuvers you might remember my presentations on the risks these moves involve and my support of the no-fly zone of course how could i forget the nfz abbreviations are verbal shortcuts oh right sorry so your next match will be contested under no fly zone rules for both you and your opponent let's see if your ground game this is gonna be unique match-up here tonight being contested under no-fly zone rules trust the process cole drew gulak is making his pupil into a streamlined fighting we've seen glue like out here for several weeks now with his so-called student but is his coaching really making a difference the jury's still out he goes for the quick pin gets his shoulder up right before two optimistic thinking on that pin attempt able to reverse that one and down with the suplex [Applause] just sending a message there apollo crews a little out of his element here cruz escapes the attack big boot mistake made by cruz [Applause] each superstar trying to stay a step ahead feeling like it's over for apollo [Applause] that around reciprocating the initial reversal second one didn't effective uh here is your winner i have some bad news you failed the drew gulak training program what do you mean i did everything you told me to do i passed all your tests sorry you just don't have what it takes there were too many holes to fix and not enough time i'll need to look elsewhere for a partner no i will not accept this i'm light years better than i was when we started training together and you know it okay okay you passed your final test good job huh your last weakness was perseverance but you just refused to accept failure you're now truly ready to be my partner congratulations i'm proud of you thanks all right now that the easy part is over let's get to work we have our first match teaming together next week if you apply everything you learned we'll be holding tag team gold in no time go celebrate for a few minutes then we'll start breaking down film on our opponents this is going to be fun they're here apparently we're looking at the newest graduate of the true gulac training program as the student and teacher team up for the first time here tonight gulax molded his partner in his image and the two now seem poised to go after tag team gold tough first match here tonight though as they take on two opponents who are out for revenge in little and apollo crews reversal on top of reversal he's got the answer for that one riddle up high oh [Applause] tag out just to have the fresher teammate in right now not that he can't fend for himself right now oh [Applause] his lights are off [Applause] did he do that he's bearing elbows in the midsection he just keeps dealing out punishment with every move escape just in time [Music] and that was a well-targeted attack excellent opportunity for riddle to shift the momentum if raymond was looking for an opportunity to pull a 180 that could be it oh my goodness nasty line and riddle in a bit of danger i think this riddle is almost soft will that prove to be enough this time and there's the breakup just in the nick of time he's ejected from the ring crushing knee strike miss timing with that springboard set right out of the ring great job anticipating riddle and he'll come back from under the apron [Applause] i was curious to see how they'd work together and they didn't disappoint apparently that's the first and last time we'll see these two team up unbelievable you trained with your partner for weeks and finally teamed together tonight for the first time but then for some reason you attacked him after the match can you explain why i'd be happy to you see when we were training together everything was so easy for him okay no matter what test or challenge i threw at him he passed with flying colors and the whole time he had this attitude about it almost like he was doing me the favor instead of the other way around and then when we finally teamed together he just had to get the win right it was his way of trying to one-up me because he thinks he's so great well i've got news for him he's not and i'll prove it because he thought he passed all the tests well he didn't i'm the final test and this time he's going to fail so you're challenging him to a match yes but not just any match i want to see if he actually learned anything so i'm proposing a match with no shortcuts allowed which means no running no escaping the ring and no top rope moves now we'll find out who's got holes in their game and who doesn't drew gulak's partnership abruptly came to an end last week when he turned on his former student now they face each other in a match-up with some unusual stipulations that's right michael gulag said there'd be no shortcuts allowed which means no running no escape and no top rope moves kind of stacking the deck in his favor if you ask me those are all legitimate rules and now let's find out if his former student actually learned anything we know gulak failed to fix his poor attitude [Applause] great wherewithal on the counter a long way up slit behind right to the left knee [Applause] he manages to escape it with a suplex he's getting a little fatter now roulax saves himself german suplex but that's not all able to elude it [Applause] with the irish whip on his former student wait was that legal in this match he tripped over the ropes and with the referee down gulag is showing you exactly the kind of man he is breaking the rules that he proposed yeah he's showing you that he's intelligent and an opportunist the no-fly zone has been temporarily lifted leaving the ring another rule violation and if we're gonna steal steps drew gulak is completely taking advantage of this situation he has no integrity this is ridiculous and of course just as the referee recovers gulak initiates a side headlock what's wrong with that it's perfectly legal yeah after he broke three other rules you guys are nerds this match is brutality starting to show on him they've definitely taken their lumps at this point their opponent is not messing around armstrong endless knee strikes and the momentum is clearly against gulag now gulag has to start trusting his instincts at this point stop it and that might be the start of the momentum's reign needed yeah to stop that search [Applause] zero me i know you and i have mostly been doing our own thing on smackdown but i think it's time for that to change why is that because we have a special bond from training together at the pc even though we weren't always on the same page that bond is still there it means something just tell me what you want what i want is the intercontinental championship and i want you to help me get it i already have my old buddy nakamura here and there's power in numbers if you'll join us okay i'm willing to give this a shot what's your plan i've already had a couple matches but he's always found a way to escape with his championship so with our help you're going to beat him then give me a title match deal so how about tonight i get his attention he has a match schedule but i'll make sure he never makes it to the ring i like it see i have a feeling this is gonna work out just fine what's happening here he's ambushing big e that's what's happening he's not even scheduled to face big e tonight somebody needs to get out here and put an end to this [Applause] [Applause] talking about a bombshell biggie's mystery partner's been revealed to me none other than wwe legend sean michaels big promise the big surprise is his tag team partner here tonight and he's certainly delivered wow aragon jay pierce and his cronies were expecting an advantage tonight but they can kiss that goodbye oh now that looked devastating producing a trampoline carefully placed stomp to the arm oh sharp kick he's taking some good hits looks like the heightened action of his handicap [Applause] has lost any momentum here yeah big game needs to find that spark solid connection emphatically delivered oh and this has got to be i can't believe it down to the wire who's going to give in first big ease completely [Applause] how big michael's with the awareness [Applause] it's finally over with the win here are your winners oh yeah i like this gun after an explosive handicap match last week intercontinental champion piggy defends his title against the hungry superstar looking for his first ic championship biggie's opponent is stepping into the spotlight but you have to wonder how much of an impact paragon jay pierce and shinsuke nakamura right now on this match whether they get involved or not i think the odds are against biggie walking away with this championship as expected shinsuke nakamura is here to help the challenger take down big e how much more one-sided can this match get oh no i think we're going to see the electric chair rolling elbow right on the mark both wrists captured the champ now absorbing a little damage he planned for this and can still rally just like that biggie finds a counter each superstar trying to stay a step ahead really just laying it in the reversal he manages to escape it he's been placed in the corner now good timing with that reversal that's gonna be it two and he fights it off i am in shock what's it going to take to keep this guy down here it comes to a new champ with the help of his running mates paragon jay pearson shinsuke nakamura we have a new intercontinental champion i think biggie might have gotten in over his head taking on this new group he was able to fend off paragon for a while but this was just too much tonight i'd like to see how big he does in a fair one-on-one match with no outside involvement then we'll talk the following con yeah now we're talking you can call the new intercontinental champion all kinds of names but you can't say he's not a man of his word after granting paragon j pierce a shot at his title tonight what a heartwarming display of friendship and decency especially after the champions totally honorable win against big e i'm detecting a hint of sarcasm byron justin liftoff record [Applause] to stop in every single part of his body ducking out of trouble [Applause] hit the ropes [Applause] it's the former intercontinental champion big e big e said this wasn't over and i guess he meant it he's in the ring turn around paragon the champion into the cover kick out at one for the challenger showing his determination there with that kickout great counter impressive ring iq on display there oh connects oh man a bad place to be for the challenger yeah cool but at this point the match you still haven't lost the edge evades the attack sequence of reversals there both wrists captured [Applause] oh somehow managed to keep this match going how does anyone kick out at this point a championship level move that's it the champ stays the chance here is your winner and still so the wwe yep the intercontinental championship one of the most prestigious titles in all of sports entertainment here we go is the intercontinental champion defense's controversial title and a fatal forward against paragon jay pierce schinsky nakamura feels more like a three-on-one handicap match to me you can't bump the champ for taking our gm up on his offer can you that's just being smart saxton looking up oh [Applause] like this uh [Applause] there i understand the sentiment but now is not the time to bask in disbelief reciprocating the initial reversal trying it back with their own counter chair release box suplex ouch biggie on the receiving end [Music] [Applause] from them oh man the challenger is not in a great place [Applause] he breaks up the count oh man the rep needs to get out of the way a kick drops them to their knees and now kick after kick after kick brown ass kicks keep coming oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because and there's the breakup just in the nick of time the byron champion the sense in this decision i don't have an answer michael if you could put him away you should put him away he gets back into the ring but that's not all the challenger is he breaks the pin [Applause] the title [Applause] and you can debate whether or not that would have been the end interesting decision there being carrying around with ease that could have been it for the win two here is your winner we me the road to the king of the ring crown begins tonight with dominic mysterio facing off against a hungry smackdown superstar looking to make a serious run at the throne dominic has been called one of wwe's most promising young princes but his opponent will be looking to make sure that's as royal as rey's son gets fails to connect on the springboard with that one he's returning fire climbing up top he's got big plans up high slam down stomping down oh stinking kick both wrists captured kick right to the back of the leg he got whipped into that corner he catches dominic with a counter cover and that's all she wrote here is your winner this guy is the real deal the king of the ring tournament kicks off with two remarkable superstars looking to officially begin the long climb to the wwe throne it might only be a first round match but both of these superstars know just how much a king of the ring crown could change their careers forever and one loss could derail that entire quest no pressure oh harsh kick he's been taken hold of facebuster [Applause] oh [Applause] that gets reversed on apollo [Applause] victory here is your winner sub zero here he comes welcome to the semifinals of one of the most iconic tournaments in all of sports entertainment the king of the ring we have real taking on a superstar who's starting to pick up some real momentum that's right michael and momentum's the name of the game in a tournament like this especially when the semi-finals and finals are scheduled to happen it's anyone's crowd at this point and that one misses the mark what a roundhouse kick right to the face kick [Applause] nice evasion by riddle down on the neck with reckless abandon check this out just dead whipped it up into a powerbomb and the exclamation point he was elusive there hits the drop kick and riddle in a state of low and riddle needs to fight back that's gotta be it two three and this one's over here is your winner sub zero [Applause] [Music] i know you just won your match so i'm not sure if you've heard the latest on biggie and paragon what's going on well after big e beat paragon they got into a fight backstage and he was injured he can't compete tonight or anytime soon okay so just make me king that's not an option i do have another plan though but you're not gonna like it are you giving the spot to paragon no that wouldn't be fair i have someone else in mind someone who's a future hall of famer but has never been king of the ring the viper randy orton what i've been competing in this tournament since the beginning and already wrestled tonight and orton gets to just step in fresh and face me and you wanna talk about fair hey i said you weren't gonna like it but my job is to make sure this tournament ends in the ring if i were you i'd go get all the rest you can and here comes one of my favorites the apex predator has arrived one of the all-time greats has seen and done everything there is to do in this business and his opponent representing rk grow from saint louis missouri weighing in at 250 pounds the viper [Applause] think of all the legendary factions that randy orton has been a part of all steps in his career greatness oh he learned from the best but at a very early age randy proved he can go it alone yeah we learned very quickly that randy orton was the student who was able to surpass the masters and in the process randy orton has become a master in his own right one of the most vindictive one of the most vengeful and one of the most dangerous superstars you will ever see that's why i love everything about this guy saxton [Applause] randy orton's methodical pursuit of self-serving goals is synonymous with his personality a superstar who always gets what he wants my sources tell me that randy orton wants you to go home saxton now randy's ready to consume more prey here tonight you might want to take corey's advice saks man what a dramatic turn of events of fresh randy orton is in the king of the ring finals facing the superstar coming off a brutal semifinal match earlier tied against i think it's fair to say nobody saw this coming i'll tell you who definitely didn't see it coming randy orton's opponent now he can't like it either orton's one of the most decorated superstars in wwe history but he's never been king of the ring i think that changes tonight stopping down the viper shows his instinct back and forth from these competitors if this lands it might be all over able to avoid there whoa not quite yet ddt plants then good night what a stunner just sending a message there he's done it despite having to compete twice in one night and then face a completely rested randy orton he overcame the odds and is now the new king of the ring [Music] [Applause] yeah randy orton thought this was his golden opportunity to capture the one accolade that's invaded him throughout his career but it just wasn't his night without a doubt this is a career defining moment for this superstar all hail the new king [Applause] [Music] hey did you hear about jimmy uso's injury yeah i did you feel bad for the guy now his wife naomi needs a new partner in the mix match challenge tournament as a reminder the winners get to be co-gm's of smackdown for one night so are you interested in taking his place gm for the night yeah i'm in all right i'll make it official and you should probably go talk to your new partner when you get a chance what's up new partner so you heard huh yep i was pretty bummed when jimmy went down but we can still make the best out of a bad situation where are we at in the standings i haven't been following the mix match challenge too closely seriously come on man there's no time to play catch up the playoffs are about to start and we gotta face miz and maurice okay okay i got it you better not screw this up for me i have big plans for when i'm gm for the night i want to be gm too so don't worry i'll hold up my end of the deal now this welcome to the playoff round of the mix match challenge is naomi and her replacement partner take on the head couple difficult task to step in and team together for the first time at this stage against the parents who know each other so well uh yeah ms and maurice are married saxton so i'd say they know each other very well it's going to be an uphill battle to defeat them in advance putting it all on the line uh-oh oh my god is looking a little startled right now what makes a great tag partner call is knowing when to tag we'll find out soon enough if he's even a good tag partner hanging back with their own count hooked up he's stalking his opponent from the top turnbuckle from the top news gets out of the way tags out so now the women are going to go one on one gosh slap naomi out of bomb's way she tags out so now it's the men one on one with an attack ah targeting the arm this has got to hurt hits him with the counter style shoulders up before two wow i thought this was over tossed into the corner oh it's coming the miz just got destroyed obviously still has some fight left backbreaker she just turned it around she's unsteady legs in the corner needs to recover [Applause] finally got him i can't believe here are your winners i hope she's taken yes as this semi-final match gets underway i'm still somewhat surprised to see naomi and a replacement partner wouldn't have advanced this far they've won one match cole i think their luck ends tonight against josie jane and paragon j pierce well i know jimmy uso is home pulling for the underdogs and hey so am i a cinderella run like this is what makes tournaments so great targeting the arm to great effect headed to the top now [Applause] suplex he's absorbed some damage already right now he's thinking one of two things cole i need to get out of here or i'm gonna answer this call and pay him back and the expiration point saw that coming oh up if this lands it might be all over [Applause] driver it pierces down a demoralizing spot can pierce recover from this adversity into the corner now one [Applause] making that shoulder a priority here showcasing his strength piece is determined right now [Music] can you believe this i love it oh my goodness impressive reversal there places are right in the corner oh look at this incredible together double team style is it he gets the kick out after the one look at the look on his opponent's face cole he can't believe it and you know what's next guys [Applause] this is going to come down to who wants it more [Applause] oh man forget the couchman oh man nice job getting to the ropes and when you're in that position you have no other choice short shot to the guts oh what a counter placed into the corner oh look at this incredible together nicely done and that's some late match offense from pierce [Applause] the final match of the mix match challenge is a ride where naomi and her partner face a formidable challenge against oscar and shinsuke nakamura they've been underdogs the entire playoffs and managed to advance this fall they wouldn't count them out here tonight either i will no disrespect to the teams they beat to get to the finals but oscar and nakamura on a whole different level the empress and now there's an opening oh look at the impact here boom boom pummeling the chest to their opponent this is brutal oh my goodness oh boy he's stalking him watching for an opening he's trying to intimidate his opponent one more time but he's got to strike soon [Applause] scouting pays off against nakamura that was the best one i've ever seen into the corner ah in tandem in stereo oh look at this so accurate oscar turns it around she tagged out but if you ask me i think her opponent wanted a break too drop kick beautiful treating the torso to yet another attack [Applause] look at that kick right to the midsection a series of kicks in the corner oh look at this [Applause] they were a patchwork team after jimmy uso was injured but gelled enough to cruise through the playoffs and take tonight's final let's not forget what's really important here the winners of the mix match challenge get to beat gm's at smackdown for one night that's quite the reward assuming it's put to good use i have no doubt they'll do just that congrats again to the winning pair we did it well technically i did it seriously relax i'm kidding we did this as a team yeah we may have been a last minute thrown together pairing but it worked out okay so as gm of smackdown i know i'm gonna give myself a universal title match against roman reigns but what are you gonna do have a glow-in-the-dark match or something funny no i'm gonna get my smackdown women's title back it's been too long since i've held gold so thanks for helping me make it possible and good luck against roman he's family but i won't be mad if you're able to beat him so this is it then huh nah i'll be seeing you around thanks again i'm gonna go call jimmy one of the best superstars the head of the table the tribal chief protecting his samoan family legacy on top of the food chain a main eventer since day one but now the tribal chief is tougher than ever here we go with this universal championship match as the champion roman reigns defends against the smackdown gm for the night making this match was a given for the victim of the mix match challenge but winning it will be a whole different situation yeah i'm sure the head of the table wasn't too thrilled to have to defend his championship under these circumstances of frustration he's likely to take out on the challenger back and forth from these competitors yeah he's not breathing heavy yet great job refocusing to reverse that and now the challenger looks to take control of roman reigns in this universal championship match yeah a match he made himself really earned it wait a second that's jimmy uso he's been out for weeks with an injury i'm guessing he's not here to congratulate his wife's replacement partner on winning the mixed match challenge if things had gone differently this could have been uso's championship opportunity tonight look out roman reigns superman punch [Applause] it's all over roman reigns has managed to hold on to his universal championship yeah with a major assist from his cousin smackdown's gm for the night had everything lined up perfectly but it all changed in an instant due to the returning jimmy uso no matter what kind of temporary authority he has it wasn't enough to survive a distraction and a superman punch i'm sure both of these men are gonna have a lot to discuss with each other and naomi and here comes one this match is underway as jimmy uso looks to get even with his wife naomi's partner from the next match challenge believes he did all the work they'll get to the playoffs and his opponents didn't reap the rewards uso is out hurt what was his wife naomi supposed to do just drop out of the tournament she and her replacement partner made the best out of a bad situation nonetheless jimmy didn't see it that way and cost his opponent a universal championship match now they look to settle their differences here tonight strikes with a kick now trampling the opposition perfect kick off the turnbuckles [Applause] yeah jimmy keeps getting cut down at every move reversal on top of reversal on the road [Applause] here is your winner me oh welcome to the road to money in the bank baron corbin will be looking to take out his anger management problems on a superstar that's come a long way in wwe but still has a lot to prove if he wants to stand tall over the rest of the roster it's my favorite time of year cole briefcase season is a battle-tested superstar that knows how to win when it counts so his opponent's gonna have his work cut out for him if he wants to qualify tonight [Applause] and corbin can't find a way off the blocks corbin needs to better assess the situation to turn this around he turns it around on corbin prime opportunity now for him to get some separation and gather himself victory here is your winner and if you want to see who can play well with others put them in a tag match it's true teamwork needs to be on point to win one of these you know i always think of us as a three-man team oh shut up saxton i'd switch sides just to pin you [Applause] that will get your attention getting set up for something in the corner oh man he's in a little bit of trouble now yeah those impact reversal on lastly looks absolutely out of it [Applause] here are your winners [Applause] we are about to [Applause] get [Applause] and what a remarkable group of superstars we have in the match this year so many different skill sets and so many different alliances inside the ring tonight especially after that six-man tag team masterpiece on smackdown for once saxton you're right because i have absolutely no clue as to who's helping who everybody's a legitimate threat to grab the briefcase he's outside the ring now [Applause] this could get wild russian leg sweep uh-oh carefully measured he's lost some of his win now reach reach [Applause] and he has free reign to the outside with no count outs to worry about ah and took too long setting up for that maneuver aggressive work on that shoulder he's oh taking advantage biggie on the move suplex getting the ladder set up right in the center of the ring being carried around with ease okay look at this that ladder is positioned perfectly for the victory he's got it in his grass okay he's re-entering the rank oh my god [Applause] hey watch this letting him free incredible pressure but he's still gonna climb the ladder that's the only one that that ladder is lined up [Applause] at this juncture that shoulder targeted there wrapping the arm cross face submission pierce is just about to finish this and he may have felt his grip slippy so he released his opponents victory left is how bad do you want it great reversal oh man he's heading back to the ring here's the stumbling into the line of fire he's ejected from the rings [Music] briefcase winner walking away with that briefcase is never an easy task especially considering some of the men he had to outlast tonight to get it now the real questions start how and when will he decide to cash it in i'm sure our universal champion roman reigns will be eager to find out if that match does occur i can't wait to see it it's only been a couple of hours since i won this briefcase and i've already gotten a lot of questions when are you going to cash it in what championship are you going to go for will it be a surprise so i'm going to cut to the chase and give you all the answers since day one i wanted a shot at roman reigns in his universal championship and now that i have this i can make that a reality so roman i'm not gonna hold on to this for a long time or try to cash in when you're not expecting it i'm challenging you to face me in the ring on smackdown for your universal championship i'll be waiting for your answer [Applause] it simply doesn't get any bigger than in the bank this is being cashed in right here right now and the universal championship is hanging in the balance it is a dream match up michael norman reigns is defending his title against an extremely confident challenger that's hitting his stride at exactly the right time i absolutely love this superstar's moxie right now no tricks no surprises just a man that's ready to step up and rip the universal title from the biggest name in the game roman reigns [Applause] [Music] [Applause] counter [Applause] my goodness did you hear that job jumping knee strike i like that some hard offense landing on the champ yeah but at this point in the match you still haven't lost the edge yeah roman was able to momentarily stop the bleeding but can he take control of this match reigns is getting dismantled here romans being picked apart he's turning the tables oh my inflicting pain at will we can have a new universal champion is that kevin owens music we haven't seen him in months he's got his money in the bank briefcase from last year's event owens nails the current briefcase holder with this briefcase what the heck is happening i think he's cashing in we're gonna have a triple threat match but two money in the bank briefcases how is this legal [Applause] stunner kevin owens has shot the wwe universe and stolen the universal championship he didn't steal anything he just outsmarted everyone in the arena well it certainly looks like roman reigns feels like his championship was stolen yeah the challenger probably feels the same way he had hit his finisher on reigns and was moments away from becoming champion himself none of that matters now what's important is we have a new universal champion and that man's name is kevin owens [Music] you wanna explain what the hell you're gonna do about all this look i get you're upset but unfortunately what ko did was technically legal i thought you only had a year to cash in i had the new briefcase clearly it was over a year i know and normally that is true but ko was injured for a while and was able to use that time to extend his cash in window past the one year mark we're gonna tie up that loophole for the future but it's too late to change what ko did so you're not gonna do anything to fix this my universal title shot is just gone not necessarily to make this up to you i'm putting you in a rematch against roman reigns whoever wins will face kevin owens for the universal championship that work sounds like i don't have a choice so i guess it will have to here he come buckle up because we're about to witness one of the most controversial rematches in wwe history a showdown we'll find out who will face kevin owens for his universal championship between former universal champion roman reigns and the man that came within inches of roman's title uh neither man is happy about this outcome ko should be ashamed of himself for his disgraceful cash in with last year's briefcase oh sparrow saxton ko is well look out [Applause] took a gamble once took a gamble again and hit the jackpot twice just putting their body in danger time and time again what a counter [Applause] a little early [Applause] that's how you dominate your opponent [Applause] folks here is your winner gentlemen i think this superstar is coming in with a lot of enthusiasm and energy right now but what's going to happen when the excitement wears off and he comes to realize he's in the fight against someone looking to take his head off all i can say is we've seen adrenaline take this superstar very far in the past here we go ko is apparently going to do some advanced scouting of his opponent where is he is owen just playing mind games [Applause] looking wobbly [Applause] oh my god unbelievable kick out at one unbelievable more like inhuman listen that should have ended things and look at his face at this point you have to believe he's losing some faith in himself this is what you call high-risk hot sami zayn retaliates and misses on the springboard counters [Applause] was ready for that sammy's not ready for this [Applause] [Music] good night what a stunner sammy isn't going to like what's about to come in his way that's smart taking the one to catch your breath all over their opponent oh zane anticipated that hasn't wrangled [Applause] [Music] zane looking helpless to every attack yeah a tough night so far for sanding good contact oh here is your winner sub zero the universal title challenger is taking it to kevin owens i know ko interrupted his match earlier but this is ridiculous owens was out here to face paragon not get ambushed [Applause] wwe universe the wait is over kevin owens is about to defend his controversial universal championship against a gritty challenger that's been climbing toward this moment since the money in the bank ladder match no more briefcases no more mind games just two toughest sales superstars who are willing to do anything to be the top dog in wwe yeah the wonder does owens have any more tricks up his sleeve and if he does does his opponent finally have an answer a flurry of brutality both wrists captured clearly waiting for that hold on it's roman reigns of course we can't get through this match without controversy it's par for the course with these three wade the travel chief is in the ring it's nothing he hasn't been through before [Applause] stopping down driver oh stinging kick great escape by always just a step ahead of owens just sending a message there [Music] last ride to become the new universal champion it was a difficult path to get here but certainly worth the reward let's not overlook the fact that roman reigns played a role in all this and was still never pinned for that title i have a feeling this is far from settled and this tag team match is sure to be filled with exciting action these teams want the win bad tonight and they'll fight hard to get it yeah these superstars look like they're all business not a weak link among them this is surprising byron yeah i think he was just looking to soften him up a little here oh just turn that around reversal after reversal these two are ready for each other looks like he has other plans here producing a trampoline get a kick he may be in a bad way here and yeah it's about time to heavily consider tagging in that partner and there's the tag roman reigns into the ring looking for a little bit of high risk here it seems and sammy dodges that one oh man oh god that looked devastating there's a tag reigns on that scouted he deflects it right back kick to the gun [Applause] from the middle there he's been placed in the corner now [Applause] i can't wait to see them finally settle their issues over the universal championship alongside ko in that huge triple threat match looks like they might get started earlier right now and the tribal chief just brushed aside the universal champion we'll see if that lack of respect serves to motivate the champ oh yeah i liked it this is always a match with enormous implications for the landscape of the entire wwe this capacity crowd is waiting with faded breath the after months of shocking twists and turns the universal championship will finally be decided once and for all and a triple threat championship match that will have reverberations throughout the wwe universe the defending universal champion comes into this match fueled by what he saw as an act of disrespect by the tribal chief roman reigns roman was trying to get into the champs head before one of the biggest matches of his career and it clearly worked will it be enough to have an impact on who walks away champion we're about to find out able to evade [Applause] let him have this moment he's earned it [Applause] ripcord the challenger eating up some damage double the opponents means double the danger he better have a plan getting tossed oh look at that torch of their opponent oh this isn't going to be good oh man [Applause] oh kick man kick samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian oh jump kick finds the spot wow stop and away both wrists captured the attack to the back at the mercy of his opponent owens just can't find any breathing oh my god what a shocker able to somehow power out it too the title is going nowhere kiss your dreams good night and look at the disbelief on the face of the champ they both know what's at stake neither competitor is gonna [Applause] lucky him left by the turnbuckles [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] gotta find a way to get out of this [Applause] and back in the ring we go with the torture [Applause] look at him totally fighting with the wwe universe right now the champ for the championship broken up and the match continues that's teamwork with a championship on the line [Applause] now a pen for the championship [Applause] our universal champion has successfully defended his title against ko and roman reigns in this triple threat match there were a lot of questions about our champion but he just answered every one of them i know i was one of those who had doubts but this performance was truly impressive [Music] saw your little back and forth with edge on social media and it gave me an idea i think the two of you would have an amazing match so if you can defeat sheamus tonight then your next universal championship defense will be against edge so your buddy just posts that he wants a universal title match and boom he gets one i know you helped train edge for his comeback and in return he got you the gm job but i didn't realize that meant you had to do whatever he wanted whenever he asked funny i had it all wrong i guess he's your daddy look as far as edge goes it's no secret that we've helped each other out but this has nothing to do with that he's earned this opportunity and like i said i think it'd be a great match okay keep telling yourself all that to justify what you're doing if i were you i'd focus on taking care of sheamus first or none of this will even matter don't worry i'll handle my business with sheamus and you'll get your little dream match then i'll beat your bff too introducing the universal champion has his hands full tonight with a title defense against the hungry sheamus who's looking to prove himself against wwe's top dog it's a heck of a match-up between two superstars at the peak of their game but it feels like there's been more talk about our gm's meddling than the actual match too much talk if you ask me and i think the celtic warrior would agree that's why it's time for everyone to strap on their big boy boots and settle this thing in the ring the challenger's looking shaken taking on some offense do you expect it as much headed to the top rope oh getting sucked trapped [Applause] the champion into the cover [Applause] a championship level move taps out got it and the champ adds to their legacy here is your winner i took care of sheamus like i said i would and now your boy has his title match happy actually i am like i said i think it's gonna be a great match and something the smackdown audience will really enjoy yeah definitely this has nothing to do with the fact that you wouldn't have your job if it wasn't for edge i mean what else would you do if he asked you might as well just cut out the middleman and make edge gm he's already calling all the shots i'll say it one more time this is about giving the wwe universe the best available match nothing else don't push me on this okay if that's what it's all about then why make the wwe universe wait to see me face edge we should just give it to them tonight right because that would be yet another totally fair and unbiased decision for you to make you know what finally i agree with you go get some rest because you're going to defend your universal title again tonight against edge are you serious i was just trying to make a point and i just made mine i told you not to push me on this but you didn't listen now go get ready for your match the following contest is scheduled this guy is ready well that escalated quickly it's time for our second universal championship match of the night the universal champion will defend his title again against edge wrecking ball drop kick through the ropes just a devil may care attitude on full display going for broke the champ looking worn out the hits have come fast and hard tonight you can tell some real damage has been done already can he take advantage now that'll do some serious damage oh foot just stopping down edge gets out of the way just one step ahead the universal champion and edge are going back and forth here in this huge title match the referee goes down and now edge is taking out two the universal champions known for bending the rules will he take advantage [Applause] there's your answer he's competed twice tonight he's just evening up the odds and it's our gm adam pierce of course he's out here to help his friend edge that's the only reason edge got this opportunity in the first place he's just trying to restore some order to the match wait a second spear edge nails the champion with the spear the referee is still down adam pierce is going to cut the pin he did it overcoming adversity yet again edge is the new universal champion unbelievable let's not gloss over the real story here the general manager of smackdown just abused his power to help his friends steal the universal championship i'm not so sure about that but i will admit this victory did occur with some level of controversy if i know our now former champion like i think i do he's not gonna sit back and accept this without putting up a fight [Applause] look i could just approach this like some kind of farewell tour a chance to show my girls what their dad looks like with a championship around his waist a chance to stroke my own ego one more time and a chance to remind all of you of a different era when this sort of thing was typical almost expected but i'm here to say that's exactly not what i'm gonna do i've heard all the critics like the former champion himself that i was handed this universal championship that somehow because of my friendship with the gm that i got special treatment and this was basically gifted to me so with that in mind i'm gonna do everything in my power even if it ends up costing me this very title to prove the critics wrong i'm gonna be a fighting champion and earn everything i get i'm gonna do that by issuing an open challenge to anyone in that locker room to face me for this championship and the open challenge begins right now so who's ready to come out and face me come on let's see what this locker room is made of what's going on here that's what's going on the former universal champion appears to have cut to the front of the line [Applause] not what you were expecting huh edge well i wasn't expecting to lose my universal championship after your bff here conspired to have me compete twice in one night interfered in the match and then pretended to be a referee and illegally counted the pin basically handing you the title himself but special treatment is the only kind of treatment you've received since you came back to wwe isn't it i don't know what you're doing but leave adam out of this no you don't get to talk now this is my time like i was saying the special treatment started when you just waltzed into the royal rumble after being gone for eight years no qualifying match needed then there were the wrestlemania matches the wwe network specials all the tv time you took from superstars like myself but worst of all you were so insecure that you couldn't hang with today's generation that you had adam pierce hired as gm to give you the easiest possible path to success and it worked what do you want i want to put an end to all of this and i want my title back so give me a rematch on my terms or i'll take out your buddy here well worse than i already have fine i'll take you on whenever and however you want just let him go smart decision now run back to your bff at least it looks like this is over with for now this is crossing the line here comes edge that just showed you exactly the type of person the former universal champion is as soon as edge was going to confront him face to face he ran away as fast as he could that might be true but the damage was done he got what he wanted here tonight up the following contest is an extreme rules match and is for the wwe universal championship gentlemen i think a fight buckle up folks because you are about to witness universal champion edge face off against a man that will stop at nothing to get his title back the challenger made it clear that he wants to send edge back into retirement if i were him i focus on just winning the match otherwise he'll be gone from smackdown if the challenger can win and hang on to his roster spot he'll deliver a powerful message to our general manager and the entire wwe universe titles are one not gifted and he's able to reverse and it's reverse pain for that mistake i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the longer way last ride oh my god pendulum back breaker [Applause] the champ looking out of sorts part of the territory when you're in an extreme rules match [Applause] driving the cold down and edge is coming under duress edge's defenses are being mowed down [Applause] that's gotta be it two oh got the shoulder up just at the last minute at two and a half he kicked out the champion [Applause] his victory also means he's not going anywhere in fact i have a feeling he'll be dominating smackdown for a very long time as scary as that sounds i think you're right cory the smackdown roster has officially been put on notice so this guy is the real deal the following count and here we have a superstar with a big chip on his shoulder he has certainly felt overlooked recently well he has a chance to change that perception in this matchup and he's facing off against ray mysterio a competitor who is known for the fight with a lot of heart you find out real quick that ray is tough to keep down mysterio shows no fear has a larger shadow than his statue would determine but there are a lot of people in the locker room who wanted to be the one to say i brought down the biggest little man in wwe uncorks a thunderous chop [Applause] mysterio with great evasion [Applause] i think we know what's coming next two three [Applause] holy moly how all measured up on a drop kick to the spy oh you can tell he's feeling it now this fight is pumping him up samoan drop byron oh no it's the hawaiian oh that's gotta be it two count and this one is over here is your winner oh wait a second you got to be kidding me is this what i think it is we saw him invoke eddie guerrero's name on social media and ray mysterio was not pleased but this is way worse yeah this must be what he meant when he said he was going to visit the wwe archives what a disgrace him coming out here and eddie's low rider wasn't enough now he's copying his mannerisms this is pathetic i know we're supposed to be impartial but i hope rey mysterio or anyone for that matter makes him pay for this well he's certainly going to get under the skin of mysterio even further than he already has we'll have to see how that plays out this could motivate ray and completely backfire on him hey i'm with byron i hope that's exactly what happens i can't watch any more of this [Applause] gentlemen you were looking at a man who was sick of the doubters sick of being questioned about his potential and i can't disagree with him i expect tonight to be a night where he can silence the skeptics and prove to be the future of this company it will be a tall order but the confidence he possesses will take him very far let's not overlook his competition chad gable this is a former olympic athlete we're talking about gable devastates his opponents with his unmatched athletic ability in his cunning in-ring tactics in fact i've heard rumors that the guy can dribble a bowling ball he's that talented i have to respect what gable can do in the ring those tactics you mentioned and the former olympian gable took a big hit there he planned for this it could still rally he steers clear of contact flipped upside down there now able to counter look at this going counter for counter both superstars showing great awareness of their opponent's repertoire did you hear that impact on the second row out of the corner oh good night what a stunner [Applause] zero scorpion wrestle perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this win an absolute statement by the victor here tonight what a steamrolling this man has done some vile things but stealing eddie guerrero's low rider to taunt rey mysterio might just be he's not going to let him disrespect eddie any further this is a no disqualification match anything someone can dream up to do to their opponent is legal take the rules and throw them out the window well this allows a superstar to pursue victory by any means necessary and some experience a state of twisted ecstasy while punishing their adversary we are witnessing an environment where competitors can embrace their anger and aggressive instincts because it's all legal i'm glad you're done believing in fairy tales saxton the hero doesn't always win sometimes you have to embrace the darkness oh my gosh what impact oh man saw it coming and got out of there and he had ray's number there ray saw that coming well-executed suplex oh oh sunset flip oh whoa nice mysterio with the sunset flip powerbomb go right to the kidneys golly he knows how to avoid contact dropkick each superstar trying to stay a step ahead and landing with the double axe handle mysterio ducks hit right into the lowrider that'll hurt ray's setting up for something big bulldog off eddie's car he just hit hard on the pavement we might need some help [Music] it's eddie guerrero latino heat gonna make him pay for everything he's done what's going on here it looks like we have a communication breakdown backstage and oh my god there they go good contact oh no it's the hawaiian drop oh dal trampling the opposition oh look at this oh kicks oh man good grief turn your lights out and agile escape oh not to the belly he eludes the contact oh what a knee lift somebody better check his nose turning the tables saw that one coming down down by the ddt oh sharp kick able to give him the slip yeah yes he didn't come here to watch him boast in taunt i don't know how much more he could take guys what's eddie doing he's on top of the ambulance guerrero with the frog splash [Music] there was no way ray was going to let this level of disrespect fly hopefully that's the last time we see eddie or his lone rider dragged into this here we go guys rey mysterio's coming into this best two out of three falls match tonight as fired up as i've ever seen him byron of course he is ray's opponent has been trying to low ride eddie guerrero's memory into the ground and there is no way ray would stand for that meanwhile ray's challenger looks like he's having trouble standing at all must have been that tough dose of reality he got from mysterio last week well we better get it together fast before it's too late good defense this match may be nearing its limit yeah this is not good you don't save saxton he reverses it really just laying it in kick lanes the next one's at the kick kick connects oh stinky kick there's two he kicks out at two getting that shoulder up now is huge [Applause] mysterio defends us here and i think he's done and there he goes he's tapping [Music] late in the match he scores a fall great athleticism [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here is your winner so [Applause] look out from behind sheamus just blindsided king corbin's scheduled opponent this is broken out into a battle of kings and only one king is going to bend the knee [Applause] it this match is underway as king booker and smackdown's reigning king of the ring take on king quarterback sheamus in a battle to determine smackdowns one true king it's a full house of kings here on smackdown the full house is actually when you know what never mind saxon you want to play poker after the show hey that sounds great thanks corey solid contact there strong pick my goodness he's got the answer for that one baron corbin gets the tag [Applause] gets the tag good golly what a knee able to reverse now he's been put on the defensive yeah even though he's still got a lot of fight in him he might want to make a tag now and not risk first taking off from the ropes attempting high risk move after high risk move at a breakneck pace famous anticipated that one punch connects you're stomping down kicks out he still has life somehow someday he is still in this [Applause] impact in the corner a torturous knee [Applause] is a here he goes for the win kick out of two what a match and landing with the double axe handle is [Music] victory here are you so no disqualification no count outs we're guaranteed to see a train loading carnage before this one is through yeah this is the type of match where grudges get even uglier you never know who or what will come out of the woodwork in a battle like this that's when some outside interference becomes a factor we all know that wwe superstars never forget a grudge and bypasses the pinfall we'll need to get a little more to put this one away if this lands it might be all [Applause] the over he's taken is starting to pile up it's nothing he hasn't been through before big kick devastating kick big knee to the midsection boom and you know momentum has been taken from corbin corbin might just be waiting for an opportune time pearson strike really just laying it in strikes with a kick sliding elbow looking for the victory [Applause] here is your winner me this match is underway as the intercontinental champion defends his title against an always confident superstar in riddle confident on social media sure but let's see if he can back it up in the ring tonight well believe it or not [Applause] [Music] he still has a long way to grow in wwe solid he takes control of reversals wow springboard attack stomping down getting sucked up riddle reverses throw to sleep and now riddle with a german suplex wait is that goldberg spear spin what the hell is happening i have no idea jackhammer i'm trying to process what happened here riddle looked to be on his way to potentially winning the intercontinental championship and then goldberg came out of nowhere leading to a no contest i'm with you byron this was completely unexpected it doesn't look like it was a surprise to the champion goldberg and riddle do have some history with each other maybe that led to the champion giving goldberg the opportunity to finally get some payback here tonight we'll have to wait to find out how and why this all transpired but in the meantime the intercontinental champion will be leaving here tonight with his gold intact so so plenty of battles waged over the intercontinental championship over the years between legends and absolute titans of this business this match could easily be history in the making [Applause] making that shoulder vulnerable he saw that the challenger looking shaken and triple threat the damage comes twice as fast he knew that coming in that kick will stop you in your tracks he's staring his opponent down getting into that zone nice takedown oh look at this oh kicks [Applause] out the springboard attack fails boom it's okay they weren't that pretty anyway [Applause] he steps foot in the ring again painful attack focused on the chest the celtic warriors chances are waning yeah this is getting beaten down catching a drop kick challenger there's the bad tunnel on the line [Applause] to shift the momentum if riddle was looking for an opportunity to pull the 180 that could be it step up benzene blow to the chest looks like the champ is going to here is your winner and still the wwe intercontinental champion sub-zero scorpion smoke what a tremendous separate from all three superstars involved in this hard-hitting triple threat we knew these three was put on a show but i do not think anyone predicted just how intense this match would be i think one man did and it's the one currently celebrating his win oh there's been a lot of outside noise surrounding the bitter rivalry between riddle and the intercontinental champion but that all ends tonight in an empty arena steel cage match for the championship no more sheamus no more orton no more goldberg just the two superstars who started this mess riddle versus the champ and no more social media sacks then it's time to settle this in the ring that was good corey can't quite get him there first one second one didn't effective launching himself from the ropes well measured able to avoid any harm there these two showing how well scouted they each are riddle is waning a bit now i think this riddle's almost solved nice evasion by riddle back and forth from these competitors double axe handle hit the mark with that one tick yeah he manages to escape it step kick riddle looking vulnerable the stf the stf is locked in but champions need to finish the job and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner get ready for the world premiere of elias's brand new song [Applause] [Music] hello i am elias and i am the man who where did he come from i don't know but thank you these two had an issue on social media about this song that must be what this is all about you want to write stupid songs about me huh this is what happens no one's ever going to hear it now i'm shutting you up for good you're never going to sing again it's one thing to take issue with a song lyric but that crossed the line i agree michael maybe you're right but hey at least we didn't have to hear elias sing yeah we might not again for quite some time [Applause] the voice of smackdown may have been temporarily silenced but elias won't go down quietly as he takes on the superstar responsible for the ruthless attack oh the voice of smackdown i thought that was you michael very observant myron is anybody actually upset that elias can't sing right now elias's opponent should be considered a hero [Applause] boom and elias is on the downside of things right now needs to figure things out quick he must have had that scouted hits the drop kick and elias reverses it good timing with that reversal and another counter go right to the kidneys stops the kick knee right in the face [Applause] here is your winner ever since elias was first attacked on smackdown the war of words with [Applause] [Music] [Applause] will be turned up all the way as both superstars look to have their last work if you ask me eliza's opponent will be the one singing the blues after this encounter he turns it around ouch that's a chop that'll wake you up [Music] springboard roundhouse good night [Applause] he's absorbed some damage already he planned for this it could still rally [Applause] with reckless abandon stomping ouch elias [Music] [Applause] answering back gets him with the counter [Applause] here is your winner the wwe tag team division is more competitive than ever as these two teams get into it i can almost guarantee this match will be one to remember the standards for tag team action just keep getting higher and higher around here for the middle rope what a roundhouse kick oh goodness what a moonsault the foot just stopping down he's able to sidestep there okay the [Applause] oh my god jimmy's looking helpless to every attack yeah jimmy keeps getting cut down at every move he's praising for it i can't prepare your face for that was the best one i've ever seen he may get the three count right here [Applause] here [Music] me i don't think i've had the chance to tell you this but i actually see a lot of potential in you in fact you kind of remind me of myself highly athletic super likable intercontinental champion former in my case you just need that extra push to get you to the next level thanks no problem and in fact since we're so compatible i think i could actually help you make that leap so what do you say i wasn't really looking for help but i guess i'm willing to give it a shot great from now on i'll be at ringside for all your matches to assist you as needed okay but i really just want you out there in a coach type role nothing hands on if you know what i mean of course say no more totally understand i really feel like this is the start of something special see you out there tonight the wwe universe gets its first glimpse of what could be a powerful new alliance on smackdown between the intercontinental champion and his new mentor of sorts sami zayn with sammy watching at ringside the intercontinental champion defends his title against the always dangerous chad gamer the intercontinental champ clearly has his eyes set on the future but he'll be in serious trouble if he overlooks gable here tonight now trampling the opposition he knew that was coming yeah great job refocusing to reverse that able to get out of the way oh man [Applause] oh my said flying [Applause] able to get the advantage here slips out of the way down on the chest oh nails the midsection uh oh ankle pick beautiful takedown knee crusher that's gonna hurt blasto [Applause] just punched him right in the mouth relentless enough already [Applause] never saw it [Applause] finds a counter for gable [Applause] here is your winner that was amazing i mean i thought you were talented before but seeing you up close made me realize just how special you really are yeah that was a nice win but what was up with you breaking up that pin i thought we had an agreement that you were just out there to observe nothing hands on that was blatant cheating whoa whoa no need to throw around the seaward like that look i only did what i did as a last resort you were going to lose your intercontinental championship and besides you would have done the exact same thing we're pretty much the same person remember i'm starting to have my doubts about that and what you did wasn't necessary i was gonna kick out we can go back and watch a tape i'm not so sure you had things under control yeah well i'm not so sure i can trust you where is this coming from you won the match and you're still champion we have a good thing going don't ruin it and i promise i have nothing but the best intentions for you i don't know look i have an idea how we can erase our doubts and help strengthen our bond a bit next week we're going to team up together okay sound good yeah sounds good taking it old school tonight with a little two on two tag team action doesn't get any more classic than this you truly get the best of both worlds and sometimes parents you really didn't see coming hey kind of like you and me cory i would very much like to be excluded from this narrative sexton able to interrupt the attack and misses on the springboard great wherewithal [Applause] taking a chance one more time and landing with incredible impact is that what it takes to beat gable sweet sweet victory here are yours another huge win see what did i tell you from the beginning when we're working together no one can stop us that was definitely a nice win but there was one thing that bothered me here we go again now what well it just seemed like you're insisting on getting the win out there it just made me think like maybe this isn't so much about helping me as it is about advancing your own career maybe i got caught up in the moment but it's a tag team match emphasis on team it doesn't matter who wins as long as we win right yeah no you're right i guess anyway enough about that i've got something super cool lined up for you next week part of you reaching the next level is being able to beat opponents you're not familiar with so that's why i got this mass guy el ordinario coming in to face you he can really go from what i've heard so make sure you bring your a game okay sounds interesting oh and there's one other thing i i can't believe i almost forgot to tell you this i'm actually getting my wisdom teeth out next week so i won't be out there in your corner you'll have to face ordinario on your own but don't worry you'll be fine sure right this isn't weird at all weird it's a totally normal sequence of events you got this oh oh hot off two wins with his new mentor sami zayn by his side the intercontinental champion will go it alone tonight against a fresh face on smackdown or at least a fresh mask michael because there are rumors buzzing throughout the wwe universe that the face under the mask might not be so fresh at all it does seem like an odd time for sammy to get his wisdom teeth out but who are we to question the wisdom of a veteran superstar like sami zayn [Applause] evading offense the challenger eating up some damage taking on some offense but he expected as much producing a trampoline and he said he could not get me with that this time oh that'll turn your skin red [Applause] body he turns it around oh look at this wait a minute is that sami zayn well now i'm very confused who's under the mask it's el ordinario i told you not to question sami zayn's honesty saxton [Applause] for the win to retain the championship [Applause] reciprocate [Applause] driver wow he reverses it and that one's scouted [Applause] to their legacy here is your winner and hey big win over el ordinario you really stepped up and answered the challenge thanks but i thought you weren't going to be here this week what happened with your wisdom teeth oh i actually recovered much quicker than i thought i would and decided last minute to come support you i barely made it in time which is why i came out in the middle of the match i know you haven't approved of all my methods so i hope that was okay no it was and if we're being honest i actually have something to tell you i kind of thought maybe this whole thing with the unknown opponent in your wisdom teeth seemed a little shady and this is crazy but i thought you were going to be under the mask oh really it just got me thinking that this was all some big scheme to try to take my intercontinental title and now i feel terrible i never really gave you a fair chance no no it's okay and don't feel bad i've definitely done some shady things before so i can see why you'd think all that sorry stop it's okay let's just get past this all right i'll be back in your corner next week and we'll pretend like nothing ever happened you've got enough to worry about with defending your title and you don't need any other distractions okay thanks you're right sounds good the intercontinental championship held by over a dozen wwe hall of famers the likes of stone cold steve austin shawn michaels bret hart well that title symbolizes the workhorse of wwe well certainly has a history of being the largest snippy stone any individual can climb known to put superstars on the map all facts that these men know very well saw that one coming looking worse for where in the corner really just laying it in he's able to fend off the attack oh man right across the chest shifts it back onto him becca's trapped suplex the challenger is a little worse for wear now if you can hold the line here he'll be in a good position that was beautiful elias is being carefully measured now i think the champs got it [Applause] yet another successful title defense for the intercontinental champion you have to give credit to sami zayn it's no coincidence the ic champ has been on a roll since he aligned with sammy [Applause] what was that all about i have no idea [Applause] why should i be a good person and try to help you if you won't even give me a chance huh answer me there's no point to any of this from now on i'll just be what you and everyone else thinks i am a shady liar a chief and the man who is going to take your title wow in a matter of seconds everything just changed for the intercontinental champion did i say the champion was on a roll with sammy yeah i meant collision course how quickly the tables have turned here on smackdown is the intercontinental champion defends his title against his former mentor sami zayn i hate to say i told you so but sami zayn has proven time and time again that he's only looking out for one superstar and that's sami zayn the ic champ should have just trusted his mentor am i the only one who thinks sammy's right here yes corey the challenger's looking shaky he had to be prepared to take some damage tonight good contact retains the title here is your winner intercontinental champion may be a week older but he doesn't appear to be a week wiser after giving sami zayn yet another opportunity to compete for his ic title wisdom has certainly become a part of his story after sami zayn claimed his slow healing wisdom teeth last week his loss all i'll say is this it's nice to see both of these superstars finally at full strength and ready to compete for the intercontinental championship on an even playing field consecutive high risk maneuvers and the pace of this match has certainly picked them up stomping down a perfect kick oh wow that kick will stop me in your tracks strikes with a kick he must have seen that coming placing them right where they want them into the corner counters this could be an opportunity is it enough there's two breaks to cut it too he's still in the fight but for how much longer zayn held close [Applause] i think the champs got it and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner me i have an interesting offer for you if you'll just hear me out okay i'm intrigued as you know bobby lashley and i are wwe's top power couple and after careful consideration we've decided to expand our influence by becoming a power trio a power trio huh and you're considering me yes and don't get any ideas about the two of us your role would be strictly business my relationship with bobby outside the ring is rock solid it's simply a way for the three of us to team up and use our combined talents to get ahead in wwe and you want to answer right now yes there's no room for indecisiveness in this situation we want someone on our side who knows what they want you know what i've been looking for a change of pace so what the hell why not all right our power trio is complete okay the plan is to ease into things by working on our chemistry together so you're going to team up with bobby with me in your corner and we'll see how that goes sure let's do this here we get our first look at a new alliance looking to make waves on smackdown it's bobby lavishly dana brooke and the newest member of their so-called power trio or in action you know why consider us a power trio in absolutely no way yeah i'm going to pass on that too anyway let's find out how the new group fares against lindsay dorado and grandma delete he's getting a little badder now if he's smarter like attack soon a break on the apron could help him mitigate this damage [Applause] oh oh kick connects great counter slam with authority tombstone and route wow right now i just don't know what it's going to take that's a pretty big win here are your [Music] tag team action underway truly one of the hallmarks of sports entertainment that's right as a former tag team champion myself i have to say these matches hold a special place in my that was disastrous launching himself in the ropes treading all over their opponent he saw it coming taking advantage a big splash what are we gonna see here oh impressive counter great invasion from kobe here he comes off the tag big knee to the midsection in the corner he goes a perfectly placed target using the ropes kick great reaction from colby a series of reversals he's heading up top thinking big this is no time to hesitate you can feel the end coming escapes the predicament [Applause] zero so you need tonight the object of dana brooks affections has decided to go his own way in a singles match perhaps to let things cool off with an out forward allied bobby lashley funny story accidentally posted what was supposed to be a dm once too no one cares saxton let's go to the match tied up between the ropes it's about to get worse look at these knee strikes [Applause] it's bobby lashley lashley said his now former ally was going to pay for breaking up their power trio and he's delivering on his promise oh [Applause] oh that got turned around on metal league really just laying it in strong goodness solid connection he's starting to struggle here and hanging tough but beginning to show some wear and tear this match is getting pushed beyond the normal limits able to avoid impact the wrong way up i understand the sentiment but now is not the time to bask in disbelief [Applause] really had less than a second to stay alive there kick to the midsection and this match will head back to the right spring [Applause] but i thought that was game over [Applause] he's doing a whole lot of gesturing and it could cost him he's certainly lining him up but he's wasting too much time gets drawn in [Applause] he takes control boom vicious that got turned around on metal bullseye with the drop kick for the win here is your winner what started as strictly business has turned into anything but as bobby lashley will take on a smackdown superstar that's being accused of breaking dana brooks heart whether he broke dana brook's heart or broke his power trio contract it's clear that this relationship is broken beyond repair and with this much strength in the ring tonight those might not be the only things that end up getting broken tonight big kick dana brooke is here but whose side is she on considering one of these superstars pretty much just dumped her on social media i think it's safe to say she's siding with lashley [Applause] trying to catch him off guard with that attempt and out of the ring he goes taking a trip outside but he's got to be mindful of the count oh and that buys some time catches the kick and now he's giving you all another chance to simply take it all in great reversal that'll rearrange the spine [Applause] on that [Applause] on the [Music] devastating kick his opponent is just overwhelming him here at this point he's down and out there's two three and it'll about do it folks here is your winner [Music] don't know if you heard but there's a superstar shakeup coming up how do you think that's going to turn out for me that's up to you since you're a main eventer here on smackdown you have the option to be protected from switching brands or you could choose to be eligible anything else i should know there's a stipulation saying that any champions who go to another brand will be forced to vacate their titles that pretty much covers it i think a potential change of scenery sounds good put me in the shake up all right all superstars participating in the shake up must compete this week so the other gm's can see them in action so what do you have lined up for me william regal from nxt has mentioned he'd like to see you in a singles match while mandy rose said she'd like to see how you work as part of a team so basically which gm do you want to cater to i'd rather impress mandy rose to better my chances of going to raw so put me in the tag match done and if this is it well it's been quite the ride is sure what a night here on smackdown you can almost feel the balance of power shifting with the superstar shake up right around the corner that's right this could be the final match on smackdown for some very high profile superstars and nobody knows that better than all of our general managers who are watching the action very closely curious decision there michael oh foot just stomping down oh withstand this attack orton needs to return to his instincts oh bruising attack to the body and that one misses yeah he's got to dig deep and find another win if he wants to stay in this randy orton is slipping but he still might have it up somehow orton is down he picks up the win here [Music] you
