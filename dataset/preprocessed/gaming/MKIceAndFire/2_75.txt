so this is it day one of training at the wwe performance center as you can see it looks like everyone heard i was coming and decided they'd be better off staying home this is cool but there's no way my journey ends here i'm going to wwe and then straight to the top where i make sure that what are you doing you're an hour and a half early for your orientation i was just out the facility there'll be plenty of time for that later how did you even get in here guy up front let me in oh big guy with the mustache kinda sweaty yup well that's todd's final strike hope he enjoys early retirement oh no need to get anyone in trouble he uh definitely checked my id and even did a pat down really thorough so todd's alright in my book i feel very safe in his big sweaty hands fine whatever anyway you're going to need to fill out your information on this and sign a bunch of waivers before you can begin training today and when you're done with all that there's actually a fun part you get to design your wrestling gear in case you become a wwe superstar you mean when i become a wwe superstar yeah sure wait have you been filming this entire time is that a problem filming's not allowed in here without prior consent which you should have been told by security freaking todd turn it off please you done with all that yet just finished it takes time to design a look like that huh i've seen worse so now what should i go wait at the front desk with you until it's time to start front desk what do you think i do here i'm corey klein head recruiter and occasional babysitter of people who don't follow instructions and show up way earlier than they're supposed to oh that cory i guess when we were emailing i just saw your name and assumed you know what it's nice to meet you in person finally go get changed then head over to the gym the other trainees who started last week should be showing up soon and to clear up any potential confusion on your end they are men got it thanks hey new guy right i'm hector flores welcome to the pc thanks i'm excited to get going especially since i heard you started last week it started here at least i've been training and wrestling for years before this it's part of growing up in mexico are you from one of those famous wrestling families no where i'm from you were either into wrestling or football sorry soccer i chose wrestling i played soccer when i was a kid but there wasn't enough punching so eventually i got into mma there was a lot more punching so why make the switch from mma to wrestling i love fighting but i got burned out with the long training camps and only getting to fight a couple times a year plus i wanted a new challenge so i started training for this a few months back and wwe took notice that's good but don't expect this to be easy you're going to have to work as hard or harder than you ever have before to make it to wwe i realize that and i respect everything that wwe superstars do inside and outside the ring and i know i can do the same thing if not better that's a high bar to set but good luck hey who are you it's my first day training here who are you seriously have you not been watching japanese wrestling for the past six years i'm paragon j pierce the biggest free agent wwe science since aj styles bigger actually i haven't had time to watch japanese wrestling i was busy training and finding an mma at the highest level in the world so you're an mma fighter huh man you guys are all the same you come in our sport thinking it's gonna be easy but you're for a real wake-up call i don't plan on being here very long they actually should have never sent me here to begin with but i'm gonna take this opportunity to send you running back to whatever mma promotion you were cut from you remind me of a lot of the guys i fought against all talk luckily for them they don't have to face me anymore unfortunately you do yeah in a wrestling ring which you have very little experience in you're in my arena now rookie and when i'm done with you you're gonna wish you stayed in your lane we'll see i heard you were starting today big fan thanks you a big mma fan no not really i just love that viral video of the fight where you got knocked out in like two seconds hilarious anyway i'm actually crossing over from another sport too i spent some time in minor league baseball really who would you play for it well i wasn't a player i was actually a mascot named ribby but i was around a ton of good athletes oh okay well that counts for something i guess the best part of the job was they used to have indie wrestling shows at the stadium all the time where i got to rub elbows with legends like jerry the king lawler he found out i was training on the side as a wrestler and actually helped me get a shot here not that i couldn't have made it on my own so that explains it your lawler's charity case it's not like that i deserve to be here you'll see sure if i need a mascot to cheer me on i'll let you know whatever i was gonna ask you to autograph something for me but now i'm not sure i want it probably not worth anything anyway relax i was just giving you a hard time i'll do it you might need to sell it after you get cut here seriously i'm messing with you again see you out there case messing with me again right what do you mean you called me case but my name's chase good one oh yeah totally messing with you that's me full of jokes i'd like to officially welcome our newest recruit to the start of his wwe journey the rest of you've heard this speech already so we'll try to make it quick on our first day he did the whole ladies and gentlemen boys and girls children of all ages thing it was awesome we'll do the talking chase i was just telling him about your cool dx intro you did chase what road dog was getting at is we are going to give you the foundation to succeed in wwe what you do with it is up to you keep in mind you will be judged at all times the big man in the sky is always watching not that big man there's a camera up there with a live feed that goes directly to triple h's office in stamford the coaches and pc staff certainly have input but ultimately he'll decide when the time's right to bring the gm's from nxt raw and smackdown here so you can showcase your talents i'm ready for that now yeah we know you think that but it's not your call big shot okay now that all that's out of the way we're gonna start with some one-on-one matches to see where everyone's at all right new guy since it's your first day we'll let you choose who you want to face [Music] okay let's get started hey good match out there i think i almost had you you fought hard there's no shame in losing i guess i just don't want to be seen as the weak link in our training class you know like the guy that no one really expects to succeed or the one you want to face whenever you need an easy win you've only been here a week right i don't think anyone thinks that not yet at least hey keep your head up you can do this i'll try thanks buddy wow big win over the mascot really impressive i bet triple h is talking to all the gm's right now about the new guy at the pc who had the courage to face the weakest opponent here just because i wrestled chase today doesn't mean i'm scared to face hector you or anyone else i'll believe it when i see it and so far you haven't shown me anything yeah well i'm sure we'll have the chance to face each other real soon as long as you don't keep dodging real competition hey big news we got another member of dx coming to help out for a bit at the pc horn swaggle uh no one of the members of the best version of dx x-poc no offense but i actually think the original version of dx was the best wow offense taken it's funny sean always tells me the same thing you guys were cool but sean and hunter were the ogs okay what if when xbox is here we had a match to settle this debate you and your og hero shawn michaels versus me and xbox i've got two words for you i'm in leave that to the pros tango una gran opportunidad peratti that's spanish for i got a big opportunity for you ignoring your terrible spanish for a second what's the opportunity wwe was contacted to send a pc student to el mago's retirement show in mexico they actually requested hector but for some reason he doesn't want to do it so if you're interested we'll have a triple threat between you paragon and chase to decide who will go to face el mago's son el mago junior at the event reservation which means book my flight i only looked up that one sentence so i'll take your word for it good luck against el mago junior in mexico i hope you beat him that's the plan i've been meaning to ask why didn't you want to go yeah um just wasn't feeling it it would have been a chance for you to compete in your home country and you're probably a fan of el mago right i was but he wasn't a fan of me that's all i can really say just go get the win over margo jr okay hey we have some good news you're not going to have to deal with us much longer well maybe if everything works out what do you mean triple h feels like you've seen enough from you and the rest of the class so it's time for an official evaluation is this the pc showcase you mentioned back on my first day exactly all of the gm's will be here to see you guys in action if you impress any of them enough you might receive a contract offer thanks for helping me get to this point i won't let you down you put in the hard work and earn this opportunity now it's time to deliver and reap the benefits i'll be ready we should also mention that each gm is going to be accompanied by a superstar from their brand to help evaluate you guys by evaluate you mean you're going to face one of the visiting superstars we already know how you do against the other guys here so we wanted to give you a new challenge that all sounds good to me so who will i face well the options are oni lorcan from nxt shinsuke nakamura from smackdown or the toughest challenge out of the three drew mcintyre from raw keep in mind there's no wrong choice but being a tougher opponent would be more impressive to the gm's potentially open more doors if you lost the risk might not be worth it so now that you've had 10 seconds to consider this life-altering decision what's it going to be i want to really impress the gm's give me drew mcintyre all right we'll make it happen good luck kid wait we almost forgot the best part there's a little surprise waiting in your locker oh you mean his custom gear we made for him well now the cat's out of the bag remember your first day when you designed your wrestling attire well we figured it might help your chances if the gm's could see how you'd really look in wwe unless you'd rather stick with your plain old boring training gear uh no i think i'm gonna go with my custom look thanks guys just a heads up i wouldn't get all worked up about this pc showcase since the gm's are really only coming to scout me that's not what i've heard who are you going to face anyway i'm taking on the mascot i'll dominate him and show the gm's what they've been missing out on wait so you're not even facing one of the visiting superstars sounds like someone is scared to lose in front of the gm's it's called being smart and putting myself in the best position to succeed maybe you should try it sometime but good luck getting a contract with whatever half-baked decision you made i am so jacked for this pc showcase i had a dream last night that i beat paragon and was signed by mandy rose to raw man the dream got crazy but we don't need to get into that you beating paragon and getting signed to raw wasn't the crazy part oh no way man i can do this i step up my game when the pressure's on and besides all i need is one shot well i admire your confidence and i hope it works out that way maybe we'll end up on the same show that'd be sweet could even ride together live together work out together eat together i know we could do a lot of things together all right well good luck in your match i'm gonna go buy a new suit to impress the gm's specifically mandy rose if our real-life connection is anything like it was in my dream there's gonna be fireworks when we meet not literally like pyro or anything i mean like the romantic kind yeah i get it chase good luck with all that i've heard a lot about you and you didn't disappoint with your win over drew mcintyre today with that being said i'd like to offer you the opportunity to sign with nxt this is a big decision and i need to think it over that's fine but you don't have a lot of time where your options and get back to me i wasn't planning on making any acquisitions today but after what you did against drew mcintyre i'm impressed so i want to offer you the best opportunity you're going to get a chance to sign with raw i've always wanted to compete on monday nights so i accept your offer that's it you're not even gonna ask about your pay i already did my negotiating in the ring fair enough we'll send you the paperwork don't make me regret this you're looking at the blue brand's newest superstar took longer than it should have but finally i'm gonna show the wwe universe what the rest of the world already knows when it comes to wrestling i am the paragon good for you i'm gonna do the same thing on raw but without the lame attitude and nickname wait you got signed to raw yeah uh did you not see me beat one of their top superstars no i did i just thought they would recognize it was a total fluke like i did but i guess every brand needs curtain jerkers i'm really gonna miss you hey i heard you're going to raw congrats thanks i saw you talking to regal he make you an offer yeah and i'm going to take it i think it's a great fit for my style and i'll be able to compete for the cruiserweight championship but maybe we'll cross paths again sometime in the future never say never around here that's right heard you got signed congrats thanks what's the matter with you what's the matter you and hector and paragon all got signed but no one wanted me and now i'm stuck here while you guys are all moving on to bigger and better things comparing yourself to us isn't going to help your time will come trust me you just need to take a hard look in the mirror and see what you can change to capitalize on the next opportunity that comes along that's good advice but what if it wasn't anything that i did wrong what if someone in wwe doesn't want me to succeed what if i'm being held down bro i think you've been spending too much time on social media there are no conspiracy theories in play here all right but that is exactly what you would say if there was one chase keep your head up and continue to work hard i gotta go clean up my locker that's not code is it like you're not trying to tell me there's a conspiracy theory against me that i'm being locked down wink twice if i'm on to something chase congrats on getting signed to raw i think you're gonna do big things here thanks for saying that especially since we haven't always seen eye to eye it's hard for me to see eye to eye with anyone these days that's a joke but nonetheless this is always a proud day for us but just remember don't slip up and embarrass me or the other coaches okay so basically don't do anything you would have done when you were starting out in wwe exactly good luck kid i'll be watching it's the arrival of the newest edition of monday nights gm mandy rose and the wwe universe are lucky to have this superstar on monday night raw i know he's accomplished a lot in other places but let's see how he does here on the red brand then we'll talk i can't believe it tommaso champa has been dethroned and now it's time for him to say goodbye to his precious stripey maybe he doesn't want to he doesn't seem too happy about it but apparently champa is ready to accept this loss whoa what the heck obviously he wasn't ready to accept this loss oh my god what's he doing with those steel steps i think we've seen this before in champa's epic battles with johnny gargano oh no fairy tale ending on the steel stairs the new united states champion could be severely injured yeah he came crashing down face and rib first on those unforgiving steps and would you look at that champa isn't going to part ways with stripey after all he's leaving with the united states championship just all around disgraceful actions that we've witnessed here tonight in any event stay tuned for updates on the new champions condition here's an update not good [Applause] i just saw your post you're stripping me of the title i just won yeah cause i just saw your x-rays and you're going to be out for over a month which is a month without the us championship being defended on raw i have no other choice you never wanted me to beat jampa all you care about is keeping his record-breaking reign going for the brand and ratings that's my job to care about that stuff besides we wouldn't be having this conversation if you weren't soft that's what you called champa right he attacked me after the match you know the match where i beat him look you can go to the performance center rehab your injury then come back at full strength and you'll most likely have a rematch waiting for you most likely a lot can happen in six weeks the alternative is you face champa for the championship next week while gasping for air with a chest full of broken ribs most likely lose and then maybe never get a shot again but either way the title's returning to someone who can defend it immediately at 100 percent so what do you want to do i don't care what you champa or anyone else says about being soft i'm not going to risk my career for one match i'll be back for my u.s title when i'm 100 all right i'll let the pc know you're coming here is your winner and the new wwe united states champion [Applause] the united states champion persevered through an extremely difficult challenge tonight to walk away victorious yeah after surviving that match you have to wonder if there's any obstacle he can't overcome it's dope ziggler zigzag what the heck what was that all about just when it looked like the united states champion had no more obstacles to clear now he has the show-off standing in his way dolph ziggler is a former united states champion himself this is only speculation but maybe he was upset he was left out of the match tonight that could be but nonetheless the champion now appears to have a significant problem on his hands let's hear what our united states champion has to say before his title defense you all saw what happened last week when dolph ziggler attacked me after the u.s champions battle royal i guess he was a little upset he wasn't included in feeling overlooked in general so i promised dolph that i come out here tonight and recognize some of the amazing moments from his career so let's start at the beginning where dolph proved he was special from day one debuting in wwe as a preppy looking golf caddy how could anyone ever overlook that not wanting to become too big of a star too fast dolph then decided to become a male cheerleader he truly was a show-off of both versatility and spirit those two synths were so overwhelmingly successful dolph again didn't want to outshine his fellow superstars so he decided to go back to developmental to come up with another amazing persona and give back to future superstars after this hiatus dolph would return and continue to annoy i mean entertain the wwe universe for the past decade and a half even trying his hand at stand up comedy in front of as many as 20 to 30 people speaking of jokes i think that's about enough of that now i'm going to tell you the truth about dolph ziggler he's not given the credit he thinks he deserves because he has no identity a caddy a cheerleader a stand-up comedian how can he be recognized if he can't even recognize himself but here's the thing i know who i am and that's the united states champion who will kick anyone's ass who gets in my way so dolph after i'm through with my match tonight she won't be overlooked you'll just be next strong words from the united states champion he'll defend his title coming up next [Applause] here is your winner and still the wwe did you get my texts i did and the voicemails and the dms i was almost expecting a handwritten letter to show up in the mail if that would help greenlight the wcw reunion show then i'd do it look i heard you already have rey mysterio on board and obviously he can still go but what about the other former wcw guys who aren't really active anymore okay so what if i bring in another former wcw star and have a match against them on raw to prove to you this can work okay fine i'll be watching but if i'm not impressed then then it's off no more texts dms or letters deal i promise you won't be disappointed this should be very interesting all week long you've heard about a huge announcement i'd be making tonight and now the time has finally come you might be able to guess what it is based on the men who are gathered in this ring and those giant steel letters but let's make it official in the very near future there's going to be a special one night tribute show to the men and women of world championship wrestling and it's going to be called wcw one night nitro that's right raw is now where the big boys play i just want to say it's truly an honor to be a part of helping put all this together and i can't wait to pay tribute to the legends in this ring and many more who influenced my career now with that being said i'd like to huge news of the announcement of wcw one night nitro but apparently aj styles has something to say about it whatever it is it must be urgent sorry to crash the big party but i just wanted to say i'd love to be a part of this reunion show too apparently you forgot i spent a few months in wcw before it went out of business no sled intended i was actually planning on reaching out to you just wanted to make sure we saved room on the car for some of the more well-known wcw stars well-known huh i i mean well-known in wcw not in general like you said you were only there for a few months but i'm sure we can work this out let's talk more later all right yeah sounds good i'll let you get back to it as you can see this show is so big that everyone wants to be a part of it now stay tuned to the wcw hotline just kidding stay tuned to social media for more information on wcw one night nitro we never thought we'd see this moment wcw will return for one night only hold up aj styles with the chair shot he's not waiting to talk about this later aj styles clearly felt disrespected tonight and now he's taking it out on all the wcw legends and down goes booker t kevin nash can't stop aj either mysterio off the top and stiles dumps ray to the outside okay maybe this will be a fair fight guess not aj setting up for the styles clash down onto the steel chair this was supposed to be a moment to celebrate the legends of wcw but aj styles did everything in his power to ruin that just pathetic in my opinion this seems to be about more than just being excluded from the event there's something else going on here and one more disgraceful act to close out an all-around shameful night for aj styles [Applause] all week long i've been getting messages on social media why aj why did you take out the wcw legends why'd you ruin one night nitro well here's the answer at first i was slightly offended i wasn't considered for the show after all like i said i was an actual wrestler there unlike the super fan wannabe putting it all together who never stepped foot a wcw ring more on him in a second but then the more i thought about it i didn't want to be a part of bringing back and honoring the egotistical greedy dinosaurs who slept walked through their matches just to collect a fat paycheck putting the company out of business and nearly killing my career before it ever got started in fact it was so bad down there when they first offered me a contract i turned it down and took a job delivering water because it paid more because all these so-called legends were flying around in private jets with their guaranteed contracts wrestling four times a year and there was no money left to pay guys who actually wanted to be there ultimately i ended up going to wcw for three months and it was way worse than i thought it would be every decision from the top guys was made to hold back the younger more talented wrestlers like me finally it all caught up to them and the company folded i had to go back to the indies and work my butt off to make it to where i am today but i'm the exception most of the younger wcw guys from that era like my old tag team partner they never made it so that's how i remember wcw not as this company that beat wwe for a short time or part of this over glorified golden era of wrestling but a sinking ship that almost took down aj styles with it so that's why i did what i did i shut down the embarrassing tribute show before it ever happened and i'd do it again 500 times so let's circle back to the guy who started all this you were just a fan when all that with wcw went down you had no idea what really happened but in my eyes that almost makes you worse than the so-called legends you put on a pedestal you're supposedly a wwe superstar now so act like it this isn't your time to play fantasy wcw it's embarrassing so you want to talk about destroying me for what i did remember wcw already tried that and they failed so i'm gonna do a favor for every man and woman in that locker room who has any actual respect for what we do and destroy you challenge accepted [Applause] is he attempting a styles clash it's finn balor what's he doing here it seems balor's attempting to help out his former club partner he's certainly got everyone's attention aj styles has a chair and the referee has no idea neither does his opponent it's kevin nash we haven't seen nation styles took out the wcw legends a few weeks back this is his chance for payback kevin nash just turned on his friend i can't believe this is happening and now aj taking advantage he's gonna do it he hits this and it's done styles clash [Applause] it is all over thanks to the interference from finn balor and the shocking actions of kevin nash this is unbelievable [Applause] what exactly is the relationship between these three i'm not sure if fowler and stiles even know there's your answer it looks like we've just witnessed the birth of some kind of new nwo slash club type alliance this is bad news for wwe oh i agree nothing good can come from this [Applause] this could put a stop to aj [Applause] i don't think anybody will question the toughness on display here tonight takes a lot of guts to even set foot in the cage but to win is even more impressive i'm not impressed at all by aj styles effort tonight well i mean he tried huge victory tonight hold up if this guy's day can't get any more interesting i might have an idea what this is all about yeah after what we heard happened backstage it's kane and not mayor kane it's the big red machine the demon has been awakened he's been put on notice [Applause] is here on raw he called take her out on social media now he has to answer him face to face let's see how tough he is now undertaker's not going to wait and there he goes he wants nothing to do with the dead man he just took down kane i think he's had enough of the brothers of destruction for one night and there you see the undertaker checking on kane wait a minute from behind by the chair on undertaker and orton's got one too they are laying waste to kane and undertaker a career-changing win [Applause] an important victory for him in this match the dead man has just been buried undertaker lost and i can't believe it it's stressful always being on high alert never know who's going to come after me and my title but this really helps oh yeah that's keep going right there damn i guess the reviews were right you do have strong hands okay easy now time to flip over onto your back now hey what the hell come on rap our truth can never get a moment to relax not as long as he has the 24-7 championship yes new champ seriously i didn't even get one minute to celebrate enjoy your 24 7 championship reign while you can all right get back here big win over our truth champ thanks you're not mad i beat your friend if i got mad every time he lost a 24 7 championship i'd be a very angry person good point i actually wanted to ask a favor i'm always looking to improve my in-ring skills and since you seem to be on a roll would you watch my next match and let me know what you think yeah sure no problem thanks and there you see the 24-7 champion checking out carmella's match looks like he's seen enough weight our truth from behind two three and this one is over hello mr mcmahon i'm here for the meeting you requested made me wake up early to come down here and then you're nowhere to be found nice hello mr mcmahon anyone ha ha hey there pal just getting a last-second workout in over here come on over and join me let's see what you're made of one one two three the royal rumble is right around the corner but for some reason you've been unusually silent about it i'm still deciding what i want to do if you're going to be even loosely associated with us then we need full transparency so are you going to attempt to qualify or no i think it would be a mistake if i didn't okay well good news i already spoke to mandy rose and got you in a 10-man royal rumble qualifying match tonight it pays to have friends in high places yes it does don't want to ruin your big night but i have some bad news and thought you should hear it from me first what's going on management has started drawing entry numbers for the royal rumble and i found out that you drew number two damn i know i tried talking to mandy but she couldn't change it there's only so much power i have around here but look i was in the same spot in 2014. i can't remember did you win no but i lasted nearly 50 minutes making it to the final five but you can do more you can win i know it and then after that at wrestlemania you defeat the universal champion from smackdown and we control wwe together sounds like a plan you're damn right it does after starting number two in the royal rumble other superstars to punch his ticket to wrestlemania you have to think he's got his sights set on smackdown's universal champion let's not get ahead of ourselves saxton let's just wait and see let's hear what wwe champion seth rollins has to say after his little misstep on social media his account was hacked part of being the monday night messiah is being honest with your disciples it's that trust that bond that gives us strength and allows us to accomplish great things so i'm here tonight to tell the truth about why i did what i did to show it was all for the greater good and still can be so i'll speak directly to our discontented brother messiah to man first let's get this out of the way my social media account was not hacked we did have intentions of striking you down if you chose to face me at wrestlemania that's the truth but full disclosure there were other transgressions that took place before that i told mandy rose that you didn't want an automatic qualifying spot in the rumble that you really wanted to earn it which got you put in the 10-man qualifying match that's the truth and then when you won that match we needed another plan so i pulled some strings and got you the number two entry spot in the rumble and then of course we all know how that turned out and how we ended up here tonight and all of that is the truth so now i bared my soul to you and showing you everything we can still work together we can still do great things win the universal championship at wrestlemania and we can take over wwe like we had planned or you can ignore the truth throw everything away and take on the monday night messiah and his disciples and face your destruction at our hands make no mistake if you challenge us we will finish the burial that i started but remember i was just trying to steer you toward the correct choice to help you succeed and that's what i'm doing again now but this is it it's your last chance make the right decision honor the truth and trust me for the greater good [Applause] will the royal rumble winner listen to the money night messiah and put this all behind them or will he choose to take on seth rollins at wrestlemania we'll find out soon enough the wwe universe heard from seth rollins earlier tonight and we all want to know did his words have any impact on who you will face at wrestlemania you might be wondering why i'm holding this shovel you see seth likes to speak in metaphors and talk about all sorts of things like the greater good and embracing the truth so i figured i'd speak his language seth you and your disciples tried to bury me but you failed and now i'm gonna bury you at wrestlemania that's right i'm not changing my mind but you know what why wait until wrestlemania i'm gonna start the burial tonight by taking out your disciples in a three on one match actually i forgot about the shovel make that three on two as seth rollins followers prepare for this three-on-one match against their former ally you have to imagine their leader the monday night messiah will be watching closely with the odds heavily in their favor seth won't be satisfied with anything other than a convincing win i think that's exactly what we're going to see here tonight from behind with that shovel he's not waiting for the match to start it's no longer three on one that shovels an equalizer he's taking out weeks of built-up frustration after being held back by seth and his group he said he was going to bury seth's followers but i didn't know he meant it literally i think mustafa ali and austin theory could have serious injuries it doesn't appear that the schedule match will take place seth's crew is decimated maybe but it looks like murphy still wants to fight poor decision on his part this guy's out for vengeance nonetheless it looks like we're now going to have a singles match [Applause] no other way to put it guys that was kind of a butt kicking this is what you get when you have complete confidence and control of the situation hold on it's seth rollins disciples well last we knew they weren't medically cleared to be here looks like they're gonna get revenge for what was done to them on raw with that shovel never underestimate the monday night messiah we should have known he wasn't going into this match without a backup plan i know there's been a lot of turmoil between these men and this is no disqualification but this is wrestlemania it's not supposed to end like this this is gonna get ugly i can't watch what the hell what just happened could this be it he's done it after a shocking turn of minutes where former allies turned enemies became allies again seth rollins has been dethroned and we have a new wwe champion and more than a new champion it looks like we have a new alliance with a new leader i think we just saw the birth of a new monday night messiah and seth rollins can't believe it he thought he had the match in his wwe championship secured but that was not the case the new champion set out to bury him and that is exactly what he just did this is a wrestlemania moment that will be remembered for a very long time i'm in shock wow congrats to the new champion i guess so me uh oh here we go in this highly anticipated wwe championship match hold on it looks like raw gm mandy rose is here i wonder who she's gonna side with certainly not the wwe champion after everything he's done [Applause] here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke that came out of nowhere and an unexpectedly quick end to this match there's the consequences of getting caught unprepared just goes to show you you've got to be on your toes at all times that's it the champ stays the champ here is your winner and still what did you want to talk to me about i realized this is kind of a big ask but i want to defend my wwe championship against john cena beating him would solidify my title reign and put me up there with some of the top champions of all time so any chance you can make that happen you know maybe give him one of those mandates to show up and face me yeah i wish it was that easy i mean don't you think i've already tried to get cena to appear on raw before he would bring instant star power along with a guaranteed ratings boost but the reality is he's busy with various tv and film projects and isn't interested in a return right now so it's pretty much a lost cause if i were you i'd focus on something else i wouldn't be where i am today if i just quit anytime i was up against some adversity i'm going to get john cena to come back to wwe and face me and how are you going to do that i'm going to take a little trip down memory lane and revisit some of cena's career highlights maybe that will get his attention so this whole cena thing hate to say i told you so but you know what i don't hate it at all i told you so i know how it looks from your perspective but i promise it's gonna work i just need more time and besides i never said this would be easy fine but if you don't get at least some kind of acknowledgement soon from cena then i'm pulling the plug what's your next move spotlighting a major loss didn't seem to work so i'm gonna go in the other direction oh yeah i actually got wind of your idea for this already trying to replicate cena's first wwe championship win by beating jbl don't think it's going to matter but i'll make it happen oh there was a potential opening with cena and you blew it i don't think it's over are you crazy he turned you down and then you insulted him we can forget about a match he probably won't even come back for a simple appearance now so thanks for that i'm telling you i think i struck a nerve with him and a man like that is too proud to just let that go let me do one more thing to get his attention and if this doesn't work then i'll move on you've already tried one more thing two or three times he's gonna respect the fact that i won't give up and then you'll get your star power and your ratings boost that you want so bad what do you want to do i want the undertaker what let me explain cena was in the exact same position i'm in with the undertaker a few years ago at wrestlemania he was so desperate for a match he bought a ticket and sat in the audience waiting when undertaker eventually did appear cena lost in five minutes i remember all that what's your point i want to send cena a final message by doing what he couldn't do at wrestlemania i want to defeat the undertaker that's really pushing it but i think i can make it happen and if cena sticks to his word and never answers your challenge then at least i'll get the ratings boost i was looking for with the undertaker and if cena does change his mind then even better all right looks like you got yourself a match against the phenom that's what it takes to put the dead man down a monumental victory tonight for the wwe champion over the phenom himself the undertaker you never want to overlook an accomplishment like that but i think the champion still has other things on his mind john cena over the past few weeks i've done everything i can to prove to you that i'm worthy of a match that i'm worthy of your time i mean i just beat the undertaker which is something you couldn't do so you know what maybe maybe i've been looking at this the wrong way maybe it's not about proving that i'm worthy of your time maybe you're not worth mine i have to agree with the wwe champion here it's time to move on from this whole john cena thing wait a second it's john cena the face of wwe has come home i can't believe it after weeks of unanswered challenges and then cena himself saying it wasn't going to happen the wwe champion has gotten john cena to return to monday night wrong and there you have it cena is back for one thing the wwe championship hey this is the match-up that no one thought we'd ever see and now it looks like it's happening this is going to be one for the ages [Applause] retains here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke this was as dominant a win as i've ever seen guys never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about as lopsided as they come [Applause] and still the wwe champion sub zero who it is smackdown's newest superstar smackdown is lucky to have this addition to its roster we'll see how he fares here but i think he has the chance to do big things hey i've been meaning to talk to you i know you've had some success here on smackdown but i have some constructive criticism if you're mature enough to handle it i'd like to think i am what is it i found some holes in your game several in fact and if you don't repair those holes they'll get bigger and bigger and you'll never make it to the next level really yes really you can ignore what i'm saying and accept mediocrity or you can take my advice train hard and better yourself i don't know what do you get out of all this other than the satisfaction of helping someone become the best version of themselves potentially a tag team partner but only if you accept my help and address your weaknesses i can make a slideshow if it'll help make this any clearer i don't think that will be necessary okay so what's your answer do you want my help or no i want to be the best i can be so let's do this great i'm going to run you through an intense program of challenges that will pinpoint and correct each of your weaknesses first up your toughness from what i've seen it's lacking agree to disagree no agree to agree to fix this deficiency i want you to go start a fight with riddle and win got it all right i saw what you did against riddle could have been worse i took down one of the toughest guys on the roster and that's all you can say it was a step in the right direction but you have more leaks in your boat to repair if you want to be the best version of yourself okay so what leak are we fixing next i see holes in your submission game prove me wrong in a submission match and i'll be out there watching in person so no shortcuts because shortcuts are bad no we've been over this if you take shortcuts you get cut short now come on start paying attention and don't let me down nice win in the submission match last week but when i was out there i noticed you rely on reversals way too much that's a hole in your game i didn't even know existed you're turning out to be a bigger project than i thought you're not giving up on me are you no never it's just going to take more work than anticipated first let's nip this reversal issue in the bud in your next match you're not allowed to use any reversals got it yep and no shortcuts because if you take shortcuts you get cut short there just might be hope for you after all you're progressing nicely with your training but we still have more to fix okay what's next coach we've talked a lot about shortcuts and one of the ultimate shortcuts in sports entertainment is top rope maneuvers you might remember my presentations on the risks these moves involve and my support of the no-fly zone of course how could i forget the nfz abbreviations are verbal shortcuts oh right sorry so your next match will be contested under no fly zone rules for both you and your opponent let's see if your ground game i have some bad news you failed the drew gulak training program what do you mean i did everything you told me to do i passed all your tests sorry you just don't have what it takes there are too many holes to fix and not enough time i'll need to look elsewhere for a partner no i will not accept this i'm light years better than i was when we started training together and you know it okay okay you passed your final test good job huh your last weakness was perseverance but you just refused to accept failure you're now truly ready to be my partner congratulations i'm proud of you thanks all right now that the easy part is over let's get to work we have our first match teaming together next week if you apply everything you learned we'll be holding tag team gold in no time go celebrate for a few minutes then we'll start breaking down film on our opponents this is going to be fun here tonight i was curious to see how they'd work together and they didn't disappoint drew gulak just turn on his partner apparently that's the first and last time we'll see these two team up unbelievable drew you trained with your partner for weeks and finally teamed together tonight for the first time but then for some reason you attacked him after the match can you explain why i'd be happy to you see when we were training together everything was so easy for him okay no matter what test or challenge i threw at him he passed with flying colors and the whole time he had this attitude about it almost like he was doing me the favor instead of the other way around and then when we finally teamed together he just had to get the win right it was his way of trying to one-up me because he thinks he's so great well i've got news for him he's not and i'll prove it because he thought he passed all the tests well he didn't i'm the final test and this time he's going to fail so you're challenging him to a match yes but not just any match i want to see if he actually learned anything so i'm proposing a match with no shortcuts allowed which means no running no escaping the ring and no top rope moves now we'll find out who's got holes in their game and who doesn't drew gulak with the irish whip on his former student wait was that legal in this match he tripped over the ropes and with the referee down gulag is showing you exactly the kind of man he is breaking the rules that he proposed yeah he's showing you that he's intelligent and an opportunist the no-fly zone has been temporarily lifted leaving the ring another rule violation and everything steps drew gulak is completely taking advantage of this situation he has no integrity this is ridiculous and of course just as the referee recovers gulak initiates a side headlock what's wrong with that it's perfectly legal yeah after he broke three other rules you guys are nerds [Applause] i know you and i have mostly been doing our own thing on smackdown but i think it's time for that to change why is that because we have a special bond from training together at the pc even though we weren't always on the same page that bond is still there it means something just tell me what you want what i want is the intercontinental championship and i want you to help me get it i already have my old buddy nakamura here and there's power in numbers if you'll join us okay i'm willing to give this a shot what's your plan i've already had a couple matches but he's always found a way to escape with his championship so with our help you're going to beat him then give me a title match deal so how about tonight i get his attention he has a match schedule but i'll make sure he never makes it to the ring i like it see i have a feeling this is gonna work out just fine what's happening here he's ambushing big e that's what's happening he's not even scheduled to face big e tonight somebody needs to get out here and put an end to this with the help of his running mates paragon jay pearson nakamura we have a new intercontinental champion i think biggie might have gotten in over his head taking on this new group he was able to fend off paragon for a while but this was just too much tonight i'd like to see how big he does in a fair one-on-one match with no outside involvement then we'll talk i know you just won your match so i'm not sure if you've heard the latest on biggie and paragon what's going on well after big e beat paragon they got into a fight backstage and he was injured he can't compete tonight or anytime soon okay so just make me king that's not an option i do have another plan though but you're not gonna like it are you giving the spot to paragon no that wouldn't be fair i have someone else in mind someone who's a future hall of famer but has never been king of the ring the viper randy orton what i've been competing in this tournament since the beginning and already wrestled tonight and orton gets to just step in fresh and face me and you wanna talk about fair hey i said you weren't gonna like it but my job is to make sure this tournament ends in the ring if i were you i'd go get all the rest you can [Applause] despite having to compete twice in one night and then face a completely rested randy orton he overcame the odds and is now the new king of the ring [Applause] yeah randy orton thought this was his golden opportunity to capture the one accolade that's invaded him throughout his career but it just wasn't his night without a doubt this is a career defining moment for this superstar all hail the new king [Applause] hey did you hear about jimmy uso's injury yeah i did you feel bad for the guy now his wife naomi needs a new partner in the mix match challenge tournament as a reminder the winners get to be kojims of smackdown for one night so are you interested in taking his place gm for the night yeah i'm in all right i'll make it official and you should probably go talk to your new partner when you get a chance what's up new partner so you heard huh yep i was pretty bummed when jimmy went down but we can still make the best out of a bad situation where are we at in the standings i haven't been following the mix match challenge too closely seriously come on man there's no time to play catch-up the playoffs are about to start and we gotta face miz and maurice okay okay i got it you better not screw this up for me i have big plans for when i'm gm for the night i want to be gm too so don't worry i'll hold up my end of the deal oh you're looking at the winners of the mix match challenge tournament well they were a patchwork team after jimmy uso was injured but gelled enough to cruise through the playoffs and take tonight's final let's not forget what's really important here the winners of the mix match challenge get to beat gm's at smackdown for one night that's quite the reward assuming it's put to good use i have no doubt they'll do just that congrats again to the winning pair we did it well technically i did it seriously relax i'm kidding we did this as a team yeah we may have been a last-minute thrown together pairing but it worked out okay so as gm of smackdown i know i'm gonna give myself a universal title match against roman reigns but what are you gonna do have a glow-in-the-dark match or something funny no i'm gonna get my smackdown women's title back it's been too long since i've held gold so thanks for helping me make it possible and good luck against roman he's family but i won't be mad if you're able to beat him so this is it then huh nah i'll be seeing you around thanks again i'm gonna go call jimmy and now the challenger looks to take control of roman reigns in this universal championship match yeah a match he made himself really earned it wait a second that's jimmy uso he's been out for weeks with an injury i'm guessing he's not here to congratulate his wife's replacement partner on winning the mixed match challenge if things had gone differently this could have been uso's championship opportunity tonight look out roman reigns superman punch it's all over roman reigns has managed to hold on to his universal championship yeah with a major assist from his cousin smackdown's gm for the night had everything lined up perfectly but it all changed in an instant due to the returning jimmy uso no matter what kind of temporary authority he has it wasn't enough to survive a distraction and a superman punch i'm sure both of these men are going to have a lot to discuss with each other and naomi in the bank briefcase winner walking away with that briefcase is never an easy task especially considering some of the men he had to outlast tonight to get it now the real questions start how and when will he decide to cash it in i'm sure our universal champion roman reigns will be eager to find out if that match does occur i can't wait to see it it's only been a couple of hours since i won this briefcase and i've already gotten a lot of questions when are you going to cash it in what championship are you going to go for will it be a surprise so i'm going to cut to the chase and give you all the answers since day one i wanted a shot of roman reigns in his universal championship and now that i have this i can make that a reality so roman i'm not going to hold on to this for a long time or try to cash in when you're not expecting it i'm challenging you to face me in the ring on smackdown for your universal championship i'll be waiting for your answer [Applause] is that kevin owens music we haven't seen him in months he's got his money in the bank briefcase from last year's event owens nails the current briefcase holder with this briefcase what the heck is happening i think he's cashing in we're gonna have a triple threat match but two money in the bank briefcases how is this legal kevin owens has shot the wwe universe and stolen the universal championship he didn't steal anything he just outsmarted everyone in the arena well it certainly looks like roman reigns feels like his championship was stolen yeah and the challenger probably feels the same way he had hit his finisher on reigns and was moments away from becoming champion himself none of that matters now what's important is we have a new universal champion and that man's name is kevin owens you wanna explain what the hell you're gonna do about all this look i get you're upset but unfortunately what ko did was technically legal i thought you only had a year to cash in i had the new briefcase clearly it was over a year i know and normally that is true but ko was injured for a while and was able to use that time to extend his cash in window past the one year mark we're gonna tie up that loophole for the future but it's too late to change what ko did so you're not gonna do anything to fix this my universal title shot is just gone not necessarily to make this up to you i'm putting you in a rematch against roman reigns whoever wins will face kevin owens for the universal championship that work sounds like i don't have a choice so i guess it will have to the universal title challenger is taking it to kevin owens i know ko interrupted his match earlier but this is ridiculous owens was out here to face paragon not get ambushed [Applause] it was a difficult path to get here but certainly worth the reward let's not overlook the fact that roman reigns played a role in all this and was still never pinned for that title i have a feeling this is far from settled [Applause] gets the win over kevin owens and sami zayn i can't wait to see them finally settle their issues over the universal championship alongside ko in that huge triple threat match looks like they might get started earlier right now and the tribal chief just brushed aside the universal champion we'll see if that lack of respect serves to motivate the champ oh looking for the victory there's our two champion has successfully defended his title against ko and roman reigns in this triple threat match there were a lot of questions about our champion but he just answered every one of them i know i was one of those who had doubts but this performance was truly impressive saw your little back and forth with edge on social media and it gave me an idea i think the two of you would have an amazing match so if you can defeat sheamus tonight then your next universal championship defense will be against edge so your buddy just posts that he wants a universal title match and boom he gets one i know you helped train edge for his comeback and in return he got you the gm job but i didn't realize that meant you had to do whatever he wanted whenever he asked funny i had it all wrong i guess he's your daddy look as far as edge goes it's no secret that we've helped each other out but this has nothing to do with that he's earned this opportunity and like i said i think it'd be a great match okay keep telling yourself all that to justify what you're doing if i were you i'd focus on taking care of sheamus first or none of this will even matter don't worry i'll handle my business with sheamus and you'll get your little dream match then i'll beat your bff too i took care of sheamus like i said i would and now your boy has his title match happy actually i am like i said i think it's going to be a great match and something the smackdown audience will really enjoy yeah definitely this has nothing to do with the fact that you wouldn't have your job if it wasn't for edge i mean what else would you do if he asked you might as well just cut out the middleman and make edge gm he's already calling all the shots i'll say it one more time this is about giving the wwe universe the best available match nothing else don't push me on this okay if that's what it's all about then why make the wwe universe wait to see me face edge we should just give it to them tonight right because that would be yet another totally fair and unbiased decision for you to make you know what finally i agree with you go get some rest because you're going to defend your universal title again tonight against edge are you serious i was just trying to make a point and i just made mine i told you not to push me on this but you didn't listen now go get ready for your match the universal champion and edge are going back and forth here in this huge title match the referee goes down and now edge is taking out two the universal champions known for bending the rules will he take advantage [Applause] there's your answer he's competed twice tonight he's just evening up the odds and it's our gm adam pierce of course he's out here to help his friend edge that's the only reason edge got this opportunity in the first place he's just trying to restore some order to the match wait a second spear edge nails the champion with the spear the referee is still down adam pierce is going to cut the pin he did it overcoming adversity yet again edge is the new universal champion unbelievable let's not gloss over the real story here the general manager of smackdown just abused his power to help his friends steal the universal championship i'm not so sure about that but i will admit this victory did occur with some level of controversy if i know our now former champion like i think i do he's not gonna sit back and accept this without putting up a fight [Applause] look i could just approach this like some kind of farewell tour a chance to show my girls what their dad looks like with the championship around his waist a chance to stroke my own ego one more time and a chance to remind all of you of a different era when this sort of thing was typical almost expected but i'm here to say that's exactly not what i'm gonna do i've heard all the critics like the former champion himself that i was handed this universal championship that somehow because of my friendship with the gm that i got special treatment and this was basically gifted to me so with that in mind i'm gonna do everything in my power even if it ends up costing me this very title to prove the critics wrong i'm gonna be a fighting champion and earn everything i get i'm gonna do that by issuing an open challenge to anyone in that locker room to face me for this championship and the open challenge begins right now so who's ready to come out and face me come on let's see what this locker room is made of what's going on here that's what's going on the former universal champion appears to have cut to the front of the line [Applause] not what you were expecting huh edge well i wasn't expecting to lose my universal championship after your bff here conspired to have me compete twice in one night interfered in the match and then pretended to be a referee and illegally counted the pin basically handing you the title himself but special treatment is the only kind of treatment you've received since you came back to wwe isn't it i don't know what you're doing but leave adam out of this no you don't get to talk now this is my time like i was saying the special treatment started when you just waltzed into the royal rumble after being gone for eight years no qualifying match needed then there were the wrestlemania matches the wwe network specials all the tv time you took from superstars like myself but worst of all you were so insecure that you couldn't hang with today's generation that you had adam pierce hired as gm to give you the easiest possible path to success and it worked what do you want i want to put an end to all of this and i want my title back so give me a rematch on my terms or i'll take out your buddy here well worse than i already have fine i'll take you on whenever and however you want just let him go smart decision now run back to your bff at least it looks like this is over with for now [Applause] this is crossing the line here comes edge that just showed you exactly the type of person the former universal champion is as soon as edge was going to confront him face to face he ran away as fast as he could that might be true but the damage was done he got what he wanted here tonight the champion he has defeated edge and regain the universal title his victory also means he's not going anywhere in fact i have a feeling he'll be dominating smackdown for a very long time as scary as that sounds i think you're right corey the smackdown roster has officially been put on notice [Applause] wait a second you got to be kidding me is this what i think it is we saw him invoke eddie guerrero's name on social media and ray mysterio was not pleased but this is way worse yeah this must be what he meant when he said he was going to visit the wwe archives what a disgrace him coming out here and eddie's low rider wasn't enough now he's copying his mannerisms this is pathetic i know we're supposed to be impartial but i hope rey mysterio or anyone for that matter makes him pay for this well he's certainly going to get under the skin of mysterio even further than he already has we'll have to see how that plays out this could motivate ray and completely backfire on him hey i'm with byron i hope that's exactly what happens i can't watch any more of this this man has done some vile things but stealing eddie guerrero's low rider to taunt ray mysterio might just be the worst mysterio from behind he's not going to let him disrespect eddie any further mysterio ducks hit right into the low rider that'll hurt ray's setting up for something big bulldog off eddie's car he just hit hard on the pavement we might need some help [Music] it's eddie guerrero latino heat gonna make him pay for everything he's done i don't know how much more he could take guys what's eddie doing he's on top of the ambulance guerrero with the frog splash what a convincing statement made here tonight [Music] there was no way ray was gonna let this level of disrespect fly hopefully that's the last time we see eddie or his load rider dragged into this [Applause] look out from behind sheamus just blindsided king corbin's scheduled opponent this is broken out into a battle of kings and only one king is going to bend the knee [Applause] riddle reverses throw to sleep and now riddle with a german suplex wait is that goldberg spear spear what the hell is happening i have no idea i'm trying to process what happened here riddle look to be on his way to potentially winning the intercontinental championship and then goldberg came out of nowhere leading to a no contest i'm with you byron this was completely unexpected it doesn't look like it was a surprise to the champion goldberg and riddle do have some history with each other maybe that led to the champion giving goldberg the opportunity to finally get some payback here tonight we'll have to wait to find out how and why this all transpired but in the meantime the intercontinental champion will be leaving here tonight with his gold intact [Applause] get ready for the world premiere of elias's brand new song [Music] hello i am elias and i am the man who where did he come from i don't know but thank you these two had an issue on social media about this song that must be what this is all about you're one of my stupid songs about me huh this is what happens no one's ever gonna hear it now i'm shutting you up for good you're never going to sing again it's one thing to take issue with a song lyric but that crossed the line i agree michael maybe you're right but hey at least we didn't have to hear elias sing yeah we might not again for quite some time [Applause] i don't think i've had the chance to tell you this but i actually see a lot of potential in you in fact you kind of remind me of myself highly athletic super likable intercontinental champion or former in my case you just need that extra push to get you to the next level thanks no problem and in fact since we're so compatible i think i could actually help you make that leap so what do you say i wasn't really looking for help but i guess i'm willing to give it a shot great from now on i'll be at ringside for all your matches to assist you as needed okay but i really just want you out there in a coach type role nothing hands-on if you know what i mean of course say no more totally understand i really feel like this is the start of something special see you out there [Applause] and the official never saw it that was amazing i mean i thought you were talented before but seeing you up close made me realize just how special you really are yeah that was a nice win but what was up with you breaking up that pin i thought we had an agreement that you were just out there to observe nothing hands on that was blatant cheating whoa whoa no need to throw around the seaward like that look i only did what i did as a last resort you were gonna lose your intercontinental championship and besides you would have done the exact same thing we're pretty much the same person remember i'm starting to have my doubts about that and what you did wasn't necessary i was going to kick out we can go back and watch a tape i'm not so sure you have things under control yeah well i'm not so sure i can trust you where is this coming from you won the match and you're still champion we have a good thing going don't ruin it and i promise i have nothing but the best intentions for you i don't know look i have an idea how we can erase your doubts and help strengthen our bond a bit next week we're gonna team up together okay sound good yeah sounds good another huge win see what did i tell you from the beginning when we're working together no one can stop us that was definitely a nice win but there was one thing that bothered me here we go again now what well it just seemed like you're insisting on getting the win out there it just made me think like maybe this isn't so much about helping me as it is about advancing your own career maybe i got caught up in the moment but it's a tag team match emphasis on team it doesn't matter who wins as long as we win right yeah no you're right i guess anyway enough about that i've got something super cool lined up for you next week part of you reaching the next level is being able to beat opponents you're not familiar with so that's why i got this mass guy el ordinario coming in to face you he can really go from what i've heard so make sure you bring your a game okay sounds interesting oh and there's one other thing i i can't believe i almost forgot to tell you this i'm actually getting my wisdom teeth out next week so i won't be out there in your corner you'll have to face ordinario on your own but don't worry you'll be fine sure right this isn't weird at all weird it's a totally normal sequence of events you got this oh oh wait a minute is that sami zayn well now i'm very confused who's under the mask it's el ordinario i told you not to question sami zayn's honesty saxton [Applause] hey big win over el ordinario you really stepped up and answered the challenge thanks but i thought you weren't going to be here this week what happened with your wisdom teeth oh i actually recovered much quicker than i thought i would and decided last minute to come support you i barely made it in time which is why i came out in the middle of the match i know you haven't approved of all my methods so i hope that was okay no it was and if we're being honest i actually have something to tell you i kind of thought maybe this whole thing with the unknown opponent and your wisdom teeth seemed a little shady and this is crazy but i thought you were going to be under the mask oh really it just got me thinking that this was all some big scheme to try to take my intercontinental title and now i feel terrible i never really gave you a fair chance no no it's okay and don't feel bad i've definitely done some shady things before so i can see why you'd think all that sorry stop it's okay let's just get past this all right i'll be back in your corner next week and we'll pretend like nothing ever happened you've got enough to worry about with defending your title and you don't need any other distractions okay thanks you're right sounds good [Applause] yet another successful title defense for the intercontinental champion you have to give credit to sami zayn it's no coincidence the ic champ has been on a roll since he aligned with sammy what the heck what was that all about i have no idea [Applause] why should i be a good person and try to help you if you won't even give me a chance huh answer me there's no point to any of this from now on i'll just be what you and everyone else thinks i am a shady liar a chief and the man who is going to take your title wow in a matter of seconds everything just changed for the intercontinental champion did i say the champion was on a roll with sammy yeah i meant collision course [Applause] champs got it and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner i have an interesting offer for you if you'll just hear me out okay i'm intrigued as you know bobby lashley and i are wwe's top power couple and after careful consideration we've decided to expand our influence by becoming a power trio a power trio huh and you're considering me yes and don't get any ideas about the two of us your role would be strictly business my relationship with bobby outside the ring is rock solid it's simply a way for the three of us to team up and use our combined talents to get ahead in wwe and you want to answer right now yes there's no room for indecisiveness in this situation we want someone on our side who knows what they want you know what i've been looking for a change of pace so what the hell why not all right our power trio is complete okay the plan is to ease into things by working on our chemistry together so you're going to team up with bobby with me in your corner and we'll see how that goes sure let's do this oh [Applause] folks here is your winner so and there you see the newest addition to nxt's roster making their way into the arena if you ask me i think he's going to do big things here oh nobody asked you but i have to agree this guy is the definition of superstar hold on cam and grimes isn't waiting for the match to start grime's opponent insulted him on social media what do you expect this is an overreaction to say the least you need [Applause] cameron grimes with the cabin that's on the referee he needs to be more aware when grimes is about to send his opponent to the moon well now it looks like cameron grimes is going to send his opponent a message with a baseball bat it's jeff hardy the charismatic enigma is here in nxt but why it appears he's trying to encourage his former student to take the high road here what the heck what was that all about now that's more like it [Applause] and cameron grimes picks up the win thanks to the shocking actions from his so-called mentor jeff hardy hey you may not like how it went down but at the end of the day jeff hardy and cameron grimes are like family and that means hardy's gonna help grimes get ahead in wwe no matter what that entails that's fine but be upfront about it hardy was chastising cameron grimes on social media for using tactics like this and then he turns around and does the same thing hopefully we'll get some kind of explanation from the charismatic edinburgh before long [Applause] oh oh [Applause] you've seen the bit off lately what's going on it's just some family stuff i don't really want to get into it dealing with that is sometimes way harder than anything you face in the ring i hear you hey actually i need a partner for attack match would you be willing to team up with me might be a good way to get my mind off of everything i guess i could do it hi gracias um any kind of strategy you want to discuss before we team up all i care about is trying to get you the win maybe that will help break you out of your funk that's not necessary but i appreciate it anything for you partner i know we got the win out there tonight but i apologize i was definitely not on top of my game i could tell i know you said you didn't want to talk about your family stuff but what the heck is going on all right you have to promise not to tell anyone else about it deal yeah i promise so my father has been in touch with me lately i thought you were on speaking terms we weren't but since i made it to nxt he's been contacting me all the time so why is that a bad thing because i haven't been honest with you or anyone else about my background or who my dad is the truth is i do come from a famous mexican wrestling family my father is el margo singer wait i'm confused what about that wrestler elmargo jr is he your brother and why hide all this in the first place let me explain when i first decided to get into wrestling i wanted to carry on my father's name and become elmargo jr but my dad didn't think i had what it took to make it and decided to sell the name to the guy who's now el margo junior really hurt that he put his faith in some stranger instead of his own son ever since then i've been determined to make it on my own without my father's help or namesake wow well i guess that explains why you wanted nothing to do with his retirement show a while back exactly and that was fine just doing my own thing but now that i've had some success and made it to nxt my father suddenly wants me to be illago jr interesting timing yeah and worse he's even convinced nxt management is a good idea this is the last thing i ever wanted my father should have no part of my success when he never once believed in me before this okay i think i know how you can get rid of this problem like casting get rid of my father i don't think i could do that what no we just have to take away the prestige of the el mago name by exposing el mago junior and in turn your dad as frauds then this will all go away how do we do that just follow my lead in the meantime we should continue competing on nxt like nothing's up i [Applause] before we get to the unmasking we have something else to reveal elmargo jr isn't who you've been told he is he is not almago's son and we can prove it now [Applause] doesn't look like he's from around here huh [Applause] that's because el senior hired him to play the role it was all a scheme to capitalize on his own notoriety to lie to you and steal your hard earned money [Applause] let him go he's already brought enough shame upon himself no need to unmask him and pile on but if these fine people here want to let him know he's a fraud i'd be okay with that friday friday [Applause] [Music] what are you doing here did you get signed to nxt no not yet but i hope that changes after tonight i have a non-televised match to show management what they're missing out on and i was hoping i could face you okay i'll do it great so how do we want to approach this i'm not gonna let you win or anything like that but i'll do my best to help you look good by having an entertaining match that work for you yeah definitely for sure but what if you let me hit my finisher you know really show the bosses what i'm all about chase fine forget i said it but what about a signature move would that be all right chase [Applause] if you haven't already heard the nxt breakout tournament is right around the corner this year it's open to nxt and nxt uk superstars who've never received an nxt title opportunity which means you're eligible what does the winner get confident one are we the winner will earn a championship match of their choice at nxt takeover so are you interested in participating this is the opportunity i've been waiting for i'm in all right good luck so i guess we stand in each other's way of making it to the finals yeah looks that way we would have thought after all our battles at the pc we'd be facing each other again with so much on the line i saw how talented you were at the pc so i'm not surprised but i want you to know that even though we respect each other i'm not gonna take it easy on you i want this title opportunity more than anything i feel the same way so may the best man win these two men are giving it their all with so much at stake in this nxt breakout tournament iris swim and the referee got caught asleep and now we're really going to find out who wants to advance wait a second we've got company it's joaquin wilde yeah and he brought a guest of his own in the form of a kendo stick wilds taking out his frustration after losing in the tournament last week hector flores has no idea what just happened and now hector's going up top to capitalize [Applause] this could do it and down with the frog splash and flora secures the victory advancing to the finals of the nxt breakout tournament after what wilde did tonight i think their issue is far from over yeah joaquin wilde just cost him a potential championship opportunity an nxt takeover that's not going to sit well with anybody i think hector just realized what occurred and he's not too happy about it too bad take the win and move on this superstar looks determined tonight whoa from behind they're gonna settle this right now up across the shoulders savage i'm not sure if you've heard but finn balor is now the longest reigning nxt champion of all time yeah i know and it's not hard to be a record-breaking champion when your contract says all your title defenses must have a five-minute time limit but remind me again who allowed that to happen i regret letting that slip through the cracks but i'm trying to fix it which is why i wanted to talk to you are you giving me an nxt title opportunity i wouldn't say giving because of finn's unique time limit stipulation i'll only choose his next challenger if they can first prove that they can beat another top opponent in under five minutes sort of like a tryout match huh something like that so what do you think do you want to give this a shot or no something splendid i'll line up your opponent for the five minute trial run let's see what you can do you need in under five minutes to become the new nxt champion now i thought with finn's time limit stipulation that no one would ever dethrone him but clearly i was wrong you are looking at the new prince of nxt let's hear what our brand new nxt champion has to say [Applause] i stand here before you tonight as proof that a lot can happen in five minutes that's all the time it took for my life and the course of nxt history to be changed forever and whether you like me or not i can promise you one thing you're gonna get a whole lot more than five minutes of me hold on we know what this means we thought we were about to see demon finn balor but what is this it appears to be some kind of demon spawn for lack of a better term whatever it is it can't be good for the nxt champion and these demon minions are swarming the champion they're tearing him to pieces this was clearly a message from finn balor that their issue is far from [Applause] and there over is the demon himself finn balor here to survey the damage that his minions delivered and those minions just scattered like even they were afraid of the demon i've never seen anything like this [Music] our nxt champion thought he conquered finn balor thought that he had dethroned the prince but now he's dealing with an entirely different beast that's right corey and from what we just witnessed i think we might be looking at a very short nxt championship reign i apologize but i'm about to tell you about your first nxt title defense before i've even had the chance to formally congratulate you on becoming champion it's not ideal let me guess i'm facing demon finn balor yes if his coordinated attack on you wasn't clear enough he's demanding a no disqualification rematch against you at nxt takeover and before you say anything he did indeed have a rematch clause where he got to pick the stipulation and i'm fully aware of the missteps we made with his contract well as long as you know it i can offer some advice if you'll take it if you want your title reign to last longer than one match i suggest you go and speak to the only man who ever defeated the demon samoa joe thanks for agreeing to meet with me you came to my show wasn't that big of a deal well either way i'm not going to waste your time with small talk i'm here because i want to know how to defeat demon finn balor and you're the only man who's ever done it i figured that's what this was all about you know not a day goes by where i don't think about how i nailed that painted up freak with a muscle buster and then pinned him in the ring one two three sounds like it really made an impact on you no not really it just seemed like you were hoping for that kind of vibe but i really haven't thought about it too much since it happened okay so then do you at least have any advice on how i could take him down i have an idea but first i want a favor from you in return i've been battling braun strowman for a while it could gain a bit of an edge if you help me out and how would i do that braun's got a match tonight jump him on his entrance if it was me doing it he'd be ready but he'll never expect it coming from you i'll do it whatever risk i take going after brawn is worth any advantage i can gain against finn all right i'll be watching [Applause] what the heck what's he doing here more importantly what's he doing attacking braun strowman is he insane we have an nxt superstar attacking the monster among men on raw all hell is broken loose [Applause] i can't believe you actually did it that took some major guts which you'll also need to take down demon finn so what can i do that will help secure the wind is there something about the muscle buster that targeted some unknown weakness or do i need to find my inner demon to counter his no none of that you took out brawn so i'll return the favor and take out finn in your title match that's it that's it i guess i was expecting something deeper or a little more unexpected do you want my help or no i'll do whatever it takes to beat the demon and hold on to my championship so yeah i'll take your help all right when it's go time and you see me coming just stay out of the way and i'll take care of the rest understood the demon reverses sling blade the nxt champion's reign could be coming to an end after only one match setting up for the coup de grace it's samoa joe what's he doing here joe's setting up for a muscle buster the only move that's ever defeated the demon and he nails it we're going to see history repeat itself what the hell it's braun strowman this is payback for what the nxt champion did to brawn on raw running power slam it looked like the nxt champion was going to escape with his title thanks to samoa joe but now all hell has broken loose yeah now it seems that neither joe or braun will play a role in the outcome of this match if the champion's going to defeat the demon he's going to have to do it on his own looking for the victory the demon has been vanquished for just the second time ever talking about rising to the occasion here at takeover our nxt champion truly solidified himself as the leader of the black and yellow brand he faced long odds tonight but our champion did everything it took to survive another day we've been waiting all week to hear this major announcement from the nxt champion so let's find out what he has to say [Applause] there's been a lot of rumors and innuendo going around social media the past few weeks so i'm here tonight to set the record straight my big announcement is that everything you read is true i was in fact romantically involved with candace larae before she married johnny gargano that's right she was mine before she was his it all started in 2015 when johnny gargano had just signed with nxt he put every ounce of his time and energy into making it here and becoming the johnny wrestling that you know today but to achieve all that he ended up spending more time with his tag partner tommaso champa then his romantic partner candace lorraine candace was lonely and things got worse when her boyfriend didn't have the guts to ask nxt management to consider signing her too she started to think that maybe he was intentionally holding her back scared that if she got a chance in nxt she would outshine him nonetheless she needed a shoulder to cry on and that shoulder was mine we dated for a bit and it was okay but then i got bored and broke things off and that's when she went crawling back to john they ended up getting engaged and the rest is history so that's right johnny everything you've seen and heard is true your wife is a fake if you or anyone else doesn't believe any of this that's okay because i have proof of every conversation every late night text every dm ever [Applause] it to the nxt champion can you blame him after everything that the champion said well we don't know what's true or not but one thing's apparent johnny gargano is extremely upset we know these are lies and so does gargano that's why he's so angry the nxt champion clearly wants no part of this happy to stir the pot and then run away he's not running away he was attacked you expect him to stand there and take that i don't know what to expect but hopefully we get to the bottom of all this sooner rather than later [Applause] and now the nxt champion looks to be in complete control this match despite all the outside noise he's locked in tonight it's johnny gargano and he's all over the champion gargano's lost it wouldn't you after everything the champion has said about candace larae speaking of candace it looks like she's here too and she didn't come empty-handed candice larae is going to get some revenge on the champion for all the lies and disparaging remarks how do you know their lies wait what is dakota kai doing here apparently she sided with the champion in all this dakota nails candace with a chair [Applause] i can't believe these two are working together [Applause] ddt under the chair we've seen dakota kai chime in on the champions claims on social media but now she just took her support to a whole new level i don't know about anyone else but i'd really like some answers right now whether there's any truth to all this or it's simply just mind games from the champion it's certainly taking a toll on nxt's first couple and the nxt champion takes control irish whipping gargano into his corner hold on it looks like dakota kai is trying to remove the opposite turnbuckle pad and maybe she's fixing it luckily the referee sarn will put an end to this cheating immediately speaking of cheating candace lorraine now getting involved [Applause] with the jawbreaker and gargano now the super kick we have a new nxt champion johnny gargano has done it again what a moment after all he's been through but it didn't happen without some level of controversy gargano's wife candace lorraine now handing him the nxt championship and that's exactly what she did when she got involved in the match dakota kai would have done the exact same thing or worse it doesn't take anything away from gargano's win the former champion from behind and candace gets sent flying off the apron she hit pretty hard and suddenly for johnny gargano jubilation turns to concern for his wife we all just hope she's okay maybe we do but the now former champion looks content to have gotten some form of payback on the first couple of nxt intentional or not i have a feeling this is far from over between these three [Music] [Applause] nice new champion i can't believe it last week you earned the opportunity to face damien priest for his north american championship however after the match priest announced a 50 000 bounty for anyone who could successfully take you out how have you been dealing with this situation look it's clear that damian priest knows he can't beat me so this was the only solution he could come up with to hold on to his championship but it's not going to work so far no one's even attempted to cash in on the bounty and that tells me that just like priest the rest of the nxt locker room wants no part of me so it's been business as usual if anyone does want to try to cash in i'll consider it a warm up for priest and if not i'm ready either way wait a second santos escobar from behind basketball looking to cash in on damion priests bounty this guy can't catch a break [Applause] victory [Applause] oh i think the crowd knows what we're about to see the title might change hands yes we have a new champion he looks to be out for revenge after oni lorcan borrowed his phone hey we still don't know if it was lorcan who posted all that stuff we know [Applause] [Music] you think you're real funny huh well good luck trying to post anything now i guess we won't be hearing from odkin on social media for a bit good i hope he had insurance so wait a second what the heck this is supposed to be hulk hogan's chance to say goodbye to the japanese fans this is crossing the line i agree but maybe next time don't say who are you to one of the top superstars in nxt not saying this is okay but that's what caused this [Applause] [Applause] an exhausting match but a victory he'll save her forever [Applause] an impressive win here tonight but don't forget he now has to face keith lee [Applause] before i get to my next match against keith lee i have a few things i'd like to discuss hang on a second just let me gather my thoughts real quick gather your thoughts or stall before you have to face a rested and motivated keith lee okay where was i like any top superstar would i did my homework on keith lee in preparation for tonight's match and i i learned some very interesting things see this this man is full of hashtags and motivational catchphrases but it's all a bunch of lies he's never lived up to a single one of them like did you know that keith lee stole his parents car when he was first leaving home to become a wrestler i guess grand theft auto is the true definition of limitless speaking of keith's parents turns out they didn't even want him to get into wrestling they wanted him to continue playing football but instead he quit turning his back on his team and a free education that millions would die for i doubt any of his coaches or teammates felt like basking in his glory after that but after reading more and more about keith lee's backstory [Applause] one thing became clear this this is a pattern he's always taken the easy way out finding people who buy into his phony persona and enable him to receive countless opportunities after failing over and over again like for instance how he failed to make the cut at the performance center three times before he was bailed out by william regal who to this day continues to give him chance after chance when all he does is squander them but this pattern really first started with keith lee's grandmother who introduced him to wrestling as a young boy in texas while i can't go back and fix the giant mistake she made i can put an end to it now so keith lee come on out here so i can expose you for what you really are a fake a liar a failure and soon to be wait a second former wwe superstar talk about a man's family and grandmother and this is what you get keith lee's on a rampage he snapped someone needs to stop him if anyone can talk some sense into keith lee it's nxt general manager william regal and finally it looks like cooler heads are prevailing he may have taken a beating but i think this is what he wanted he got inside keith lee's head and now he has an important mental edge going into whatever their next encounter is keith lee is as tough mentally as he is physically i'm not sure that strategy is going to work did you not just see what happened i think it's already proven extremely effective goes into the pin two count and this one is over that was a statement win for our nxt north american champion i agree corey what a victory what the heck's going on there's some kind of commotion in the ring but i can't figure out what's happening there's your answer the toll man has delivered a strong and clear message doomsday has officially arrived the nxt north american champion told carrion cross to get in line and apparently he didn't want to wait tick-tock [Applause] and the champ stands tall once again hang on the nxt champion is company we saw him invite walter to come to nxt on social media and apparently he made the trip over and it looks like walter didn't make the trip alone it's imperium the nxt champion is in big trouble here i'd say so he's outnumbered 4-1 wait a second it's british strong style and they're taking the fight to imperium this is now an even four on four fights the nxt champion is going head-to-head with walter was this a coordinated effort between the champion and british strong style no idea but it's working into the steel steps you have to imagine this is only the beginning of the war between these two sides this is nxt's version of the british invasion and our champion is caught directly in the middle of it unfortunately we're out of time but stay tuned to wwe social media for updates on this developing situation here's your update they're gonna keep fighting until next week i think the champs got it there's two three that's it the champ stays the chance here is your winner and still an xt champion sub zero scorpion smoke what an emphatic victory guys no contest that's why they call it light work cole barely even broke a sweat not sure if you've heard but there's a superstar shake-up approaching how do you think that's going to turn out for me since you're a main event here on nxt i'll leave that up to you you can be protected from switching brands or you can be eligible it's your call anything else i should know there's a stipulation saying that any champions who go to another brand will be forced to vacate their titles that pretty much covers it i think a potential change of scenery sounds good put me in the shake up all right all superstars participating in the shake up must compete this week so the other gm's can see them in action i have heard adam pierce likes to scout singles matches while mandy rose prefers to evaluate tag team competition so basically which gm do you want to cater to i'd rather impress mandy to better my chances of going to raw so put me in a tag match done and if this is it well it's been interesting it sure has [Applause] huge win here tonight here it's the arrival of the newest edition of monday nights gm mandy rose and the wwe universe are lucky to have this superstar on monday night raw i know he's accomplished a lot in other places but let's see how he does here on the red brand then we'll talk [Music] you
