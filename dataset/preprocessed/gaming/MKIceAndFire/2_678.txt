they're falling back we gotta get out of here now yesterday afternoon kpa authorities raided the town of montrose colorado their goal in the words of the enemy was to neutralize high-value citizen targets but this was not a measured response to american insurgency this was innocent blood running red on main street your families and friends shot down like animals one of the montrose resistant cells reportedly escaped after a brutal firefight in a nearby neighborhood we can only hope that these freedom fighters made it to one of their safe zones somewhere in a sea of abandoned suburbs but whatever their fate we will fight on don't believe the lives of the korean controlled media we are the channel of truth and this is the voice of freedom good morning mantras you're listening to kpar 88.3 fm our top story this hour 24 american civilians are dead in the wake of a shooting spree by a local insurgent group kpa authorities are searching for connor morgan believed to be responsible

patrol game come on welcome to your new home it's our little piece of america we all came together to create this place i have some sense of community not quite the future we had in mind but at least we're free from the outside it's just more boarded up suburban failure but inside we've built ourselves a safe fences tree cover and that camo scrim keeps us hidden from the kpa still we've got to be careful especially now got it get rihanna on the radio she's prepping the playground talk to connor about ammo everything we eat we grow water collections over there in between solar panels and windmills just enough power to get by follow me hey sally oh hey boom back from the dead huh this means we're set to go right i'm damn tired of sitting here we got a short window to grab those

safe dinner's at seven we're having leftovers hope you'll join us we have to time our movements between korean patrols so got some time you might introduce yourself around i'll meet you on the other side of the yard this receiver should let us listen in on korean radio chatter i'm not sure how well it's going to work but any warnings better than none right the kpa figures were out here somewhere but we're well hidden nothing like being surrounded by an ocean of abandoned suburbs too much energy consumed getting people and supplies back and forth to the suburbs most had to move to the cities it's either that of the labor camps it's not much but we call it home you're the pilot everyone's talking about huh heard you took a big risk back there we don't have the luxury of taking chances

weapon and all the ammo you can carry follow me this is dug these tunnels during the early days of the occupation it's close to three miles of passengers onto my truck we dug them everywhere except under the wall they built to keep us in of course that [ __ ] runs all the way down to the bedrock when we liberate this country we'll dismount those walls [ __ ] that i'm gonna blow it up when we leave hey jacobs great work back there thanks for your help with goliath hang on to the targeter looks like you got the hang of it rihanna confirmed gunnison cell delivered the van and mortar but there's a sentry tower between us and the playground why haven't we taken it out well in here last time we can find a way around it no we can't leave any of them standing be careful these sentries have a 20 millimeter autocannon like ku band radar the fire controllers shut up jacobs just throw a grenade at the back of the thing we've got to make our way up the street and wait for the spotlight

atrocities like this were happening but the proof is so horrifying it's almost surreal but we should be thankful for this evidence it reveals an enemy that wants to dehumanize us but pushing american corpses into an unmarked ditch can't bury our defiance dirt and gravel fill silent mounds we'll speak for them and tell their stories to the world the dead have names as long as we fight in their memory the slam will be our land again even now the resistance is planning attacks that can lead to victory in one of our greatest cities this is the voice of freedom signing off you need to let that

called a success the courage and sacrifice of these men and women won't be forgotten but our enemies have also marked this day throughout the occupations on the kpa has increased security and pressured civilians to identify resistance members citizens have disappeared in alarming numbers with reports of torture and execution some question the risks of rebellion they fear reprisals the boot

casualties what about reinforcements i wouldn't count on it the kpa's been burning civilian settlements killing everyone in sight the view that did survive grabbed all the c4 that we had stashed the

on the other side we're going straight through jacob the only way we'll catch those tankers the resistance is attempting to contact cells beyond the montrose area it's hard to determine what's happening outside the wall but our kpa sources report that several patrols have gone missing the ones that survived have nothing but horror stories after the enp went off an electronic grid that sustained us broke apart our nation fell into a kind of a madness i remember that first winter desperation sweeping the country people turned on each other and worse as food grew scarce many be on the wall have no allegiance to any cause other than their own survival she must deal with them be advised they can be unpredictable and a fair number outright insane let's be careful out there this is the
