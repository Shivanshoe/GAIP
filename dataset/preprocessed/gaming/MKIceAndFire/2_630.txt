surface world governance history and current structure ah for the treaty negotiations with the high councillor yes the treaty discussions i'm afraid our resources are limited superman has been less than willing to reveal his regime's inner workings tell me what you know recount the events of his ascension a thorough review might illuminate new strategies for negotiation i am humbled sire five years ago the criminal joker deceived superman into killing his wife and unborn son and destroying metropolis consumed by grief superman killed the joker yes we all remember where we were that day afterward he showed no restraint judge jury and executioner he and other like-minded metahumans quickly reigned in the criminal element which made him quite popular the surface world was desperate for strong leadership superman consolidated his power he created the one earth government democratic institutions were swept away sire the high councilors envoys await you in the throne room [Music] [Music] flash shazam welcome your highness it's an honor to meet you and to be the first surface people to visit atlantis yes we have important matters to discuss the treaty the final draft superman

sorry diplomats there he is sire well then parallel dimension it is who do you work for you surfer manta ocean master i'm the king of atlantis i answer to no one unlike you mind your tongue you would give away your kingdom like a pair of worn boots to a surface dweller the treaty requires superman to maintain earth's oceans and recognize our autonomy you put your army at his beck and call a necessary compromise more like appeasement i grew tired of this take him [Music] huh i had planned to offer you help i've changed my mind what would you have me do yeah it's what you do [Music] now let's discuss a revised foreign policy kill him what now they do tend to fight first don't they though i may have stoked the fires a bit aries why are you here i feed on conflict until today i've been starving i sensed the return of aggression and sought its cause you did more than that you brought us here no but i can guess who did you my fire doesn't need stoking ares tell me who you presume to command me i do and you will obey [Applause] almighty neptune a fish out of one you're out of your league know when you're weak aries superman's reign has merely eliminated conflict left me virtually powerless so if you didn't bring us here who did those who would end superman's rule the insurgents heroes only one all other heroes who challenged superman have been eliminated he killed them and the only ones left are those who joined him along with a small cadre of former villains whose loyalty was bought or coerced i need to join my colleagues there with the insurgents as we speak send me to them how'd you get here ares not our aries we know meat not our batman i was wondering how to retrieve you from atlantis headache uh trying to prevent one it's a durability enhancer 5u93r how can a

only one left not the only one what is this how are you even alive he's with me unlike your luther i've never indulged in law breaking superman doesn't suspect his best friend is funding the insurgency luthor's involvement is a secret people critical of superman disappear government officials activists reporters well now that we're all here explain why you chose us and why you didn't ask

to do beautiful isn't it the moon or its light shining off your bald head i'm pleased you wanted to meet you're finally ready to join our little club business is bad being haunted is worse after so many refusals why now they made it personal [Music] must have been some party superman did this exposed my identity and froze all wayne tech assets made bruce wayne a non-person i still can't believe he lost it this bad even with what joker did in superman's mind he destroyed metropolis i'm not following somehow joker altered superman's mind so he believed he was fighting doomsday but it was lois no joker linked the nukes triggered to lois's heartbeat when she and the baby died metropolis died with them superman was vulnerable probably for the first time in his life his fear won out green arrow died trying to explain that to him all right moving on what's with all the security i mean he already trashed the place would you take any chances with me i need to crank up the batcave's backup generator you're with me you three secure the bat cave entrance it's in the study that's a great plan spooky but uh isn't this your show splitting up saves time and you're best suited to take out the automated sentry guns all right then operation thunder eagle lightning whatever is underway over there cold oh [ __ ] killer frost grundy playtime oh [ __ ] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] grundy [Music] squash man hurt arrow man [Music] [Music] ready huh looks like the indestructible pill works lantern grand slam you kids have fun stay out of the street stupid amazon wasn't very nice snowflake

let's go it won't be long before superman knows we're here so you need some sort of scanner to help identify these duplicates exactly this is data from the duplicate batman i'm holding at strikers that's helpful it's still going to take a few weeks you'll figure it out you always do glad to be of service no dinner this evening stefan has a new shipment of that kansas beef next time these duplicates do you think there's a lois where they come from there was only one lois i've never seen the bat cave our bat cave anyway should be interesting how did you hide anything in here from superman looks like he was pretty thorough the cave walls are injected with lead polymer there's no way he could find what we're here for sounds environmentally safe sure went to a lot of trouble between this and the dna neutralizing superman was not a call i could make alone so i put the weapon in a vault that only opens by simultaneously sampling dna from superman's closest allies our counterparts with my green arrow dead and the others backing superman's insanity i needed you your matching dna it's behind there lantern that one a rock you're gonna throw a rock at superman [Music] hands on the scanners yellow computer begin recognition scan that's it let's move you let your guard down at your peril our green arrow was just as arrogant and probably just as handsome [Music] doesn't it and another thing our wonder woman is better looking [Music] arthur [Music] that's enough adam you're done you presume too much should have seen that coming only one of you remains yeah but i'm the one to beat [Music] oh doesn't it and sparky makes four damn can it be fixed the kryptonite's intact but the optical resonator is beyond repair even with luthor we don't have the resources to build a new one quickly looks like we're gonna need some help ready to test it ready as we'll ever be systems online i'm linked up flash you ready i'm on it all right let's crank it up the platform should lock onto their signatures and pull them back got it i'm vibrating at the right frequency [Music] how we do it containment fields up but the levels are spiking cyborg shut it down it's okay i've got it [Music] wonderful don't know whether to pat myself on the back kick myself in the air the joker plan is undisciplined the chaos they create is useful we need more than pawns if we're going to take down superman that's all i needed to hear you said this place was secure just keep him busy with pleasure oh yeah thinking too much junior god you figured out aah pleasure's all mine slade wish the other titans could see this what do you think cyborg like yours only better it's the man not the machine [Music] luther [Music] questions this will enlighten you gonna bust you up uh [Music]

your transporter fix the laser in our dimension and come back with reinforcements i'm sure i can get there's no time five years ago a tragic event cost the lives of millions overwhelmed by guilt for the part he played in the destruction he was driven mad he became an agent of chaos an enemy of peace and security but no longer the leader of the insurgency will pay for his crimes oh i don't like this at 6 p.m local time batman will be executed at striker's island may rao have mercy on his soul getting help we'll have to wait rescuing batman just became our priority it's a trap of course it is then we'll have to be sneaky about it sneaky how watchtowers teleport strikers is equipped with teleportation dampeners but they only cover the building you just have to get batman outside straight through a brick wall i'm in you'll need a diversion to keep superman occupied leave that to me i'll take the teleporter i'm the most qualified to work it and i can infiltrate their ranks i'm with you you and me working together not a chance the only way to access the watchtower from earth is the hall of justice and if your cover's blown you'll need someone shadowing you i'm not asking permission but you will follow my lead communication should be over there reroute them like we talked about and i'll get the teleporter access codes after you're done make sure this isn't my first drop kid i know the plan then stick to it but whatever history we have in our counterparts you and i have none i downloaded your history you've tried to kill this world's titans only a couple times then don't

that's it got control of the watchtower teleporter it can't be that easy when your cyborg tried to hack my neural network he exposed his security protocols you stole his password i'm actually beginning to like you where you going the plan was i won't be long i don't know if he said it was okay it was good enough for me yeah i asked myself what if what happened to lois happened to iris it made sense at first bad people got what they deserved but now superman's not actually gonna kill batman he's just bait to catch the real batman and then what remember what he did to green arrow something's not right teleporters offline somewhere you need to go how did oh ah oh wow still just a kid ah deathstroke stop what you're doing it's not what i'm doing it's what i've done ugh all right
