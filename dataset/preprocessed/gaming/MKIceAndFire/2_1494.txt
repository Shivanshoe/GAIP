you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you the bad weather crossing Montana is amassing all the characteristics of an atypical storm the bad turn is proving worse than expected with above-average winds and snowfall especially forecast for Helena National Forest natural reserve the National Weather Service warns residents to follow all instructions given by local authorities and to avoid all unnecessary travel some concern meteorologists are comparing it to the storm that hit Billings in 1955 with 42 inches of snow falling over a single night are we heading into the mother of all winners in Lewis and Clark County [Music] no that's all I remember from the night we departed 10 years ago the attorneys had to check the office first it should be just beyond the mountain museum at the end of the stairs to the main floor if I remember right nine-one-one emergency how can I help you what's your emergency hello getting here me what's your emergency [Applause] mr McGrath hi it's Paulie from century telephone company I'm sorry to bother you but as I told you last time the company requires cutting off the telephone service to delinquent customers I I'm really sorry binder but my hands are tied we have to go ahead I'm sorry goodbye oh yeah Nicole its Jenkins the attorney the hotel chain that wants to take over your hotel has just dumped a mammoth Holy Bible of documents on my desk that I need to check through I have to personally go to the county land registry office before we meet listen I know you didn't want to go to your father's funeral but now the hotel is entirely your property the law requires you to assess its condition before putting it on the market it's very noble of your mother to want to repay that poor girl's family Rachel not everyone would deprive themselves of such a sum anyway it's up to you now get to it I'll bring you a burger you Portland folks and only dream on oh I left you some notes and a master key on the dining room table of your family's old apartment start your rounds from there give me a couple of hours don't run off alright we should have hired a decent attorney from Portland mom not this potato head come on let's do this [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] everything's here exactly the same as when me and mom left 10 years ago it's so doesn't matter quick tour nothing more Nicole this is the managers key my mom wouldn't give me when I was little for the guestroom instructions refrain from going outside unless [Applause] what is this a joke hello can you hear me is this miss McGrath Wilson McGrath was my father's this is Helena Federal Emergency Management Agency my name is Irving Crawford mr. Jenkins told me you'd be arriving mr. Jenkins is a very enterprising man oh I guess so I wouldn't know I'm kidding oh right any reason for your call Irving from federal what you would call it I'm calling to assist you during your stay at the hotel what the timber line is old but sturdy you'll enjoy your stay and be safe no problem the furnace wiring it's all under control okay enough what I don't know what Jenkins told you but I have zero intention of staying here longer than let's say 20 minutes oh but but storm yeah it doesn't matter I'm leaving straightaway maybe you're not aware thanks for everything Irving right Irving yeah I you bye [Music] this place is a real mess never thought to find anything like that [Music] hello hey you still there Irving huh oh yeah I'm still here miss McGrath I mean miss Wilson when you said this Shack was sturdy that's what I was trying to tell you before around these parts the weather how much time do I have to move the snow piles up pretty quick and some parts over 3,000 feet are already icing over I got a risk it you're not thinking of taking the car yeah Nicole listen if your car breaks down we can't come get you not even with tanks whatever happened to miss Wilson oh sorry about that I just Nicole is fine that said thanks for everything again thanks seriously if you ended up out there with your car gone dead with 12 inches of snow and 20 degrees below zero your lungs would collapse in a few minutes I remember how things work in the mountains luck doesn't exist as a FEMA agent I have to insist you know you're not the first man to do what to try and stop me hey wait bye what can go wrong I have a 1986 Dodge I won't stay here a minute more no way the attorney he'll take care of everything [ __ ] all this [Music] tell me you changed your mind you're there right yeah it's a direct line I can't find my car keys my [ __ ] car keys I left them on the seats you sure think so maybe someone no listen this office is about 12 miles from the hotel as the crow flies it's 40 miles by Road there's nothing or no one in between and that's not a good thing right now damn it I knew it maybe the keys are in your pocket wow that didn't even cross my mind only trying to help yeah that was kind of [ __ ] no problem the keys will turn up the good news is that we have these new cell phones that's what they call them radio doesn't reach out there i bypassed the signal to create a direct line through a shortwave sequencer it's like a two-way radio station that's always open this place I've vowed to never come back listen I might only be a voice but remember I'm here for you if you need me just call seriously Oh fine talk to me I can't open the garage door it's a conspiracy tenant and this stuff freezes up with the gold I have to get out of here I'm not sure you get it look I left this place 10 years ago I had no idea I would have to come back here let alone stay a night Nicole I know your story everyone in the valley knows it your father Rachel I didn't want to be out of line don't mention the past okay [Music] Hey found anything useful no no keys no garage door I can't get out of here without freezing Christ it's probably only for a night the conditions might get better tomorrow they might look I'll be on duty all day call me when you want even just to talk okay oh thanks Irving just doing my job Nicole yeah if I may what I'd like to give you some advice if it comes with job you're safe up there just relax it'll be fine okay later I can't believe it I'm stuck [ __ ] you hello you still there is that a joke yeah well you're improving what's up oh nothing I mean it just wanted to say you got everything you need to have a smooth night but you should take a look at the main power system you know no one's been up there since Leonard's death five days might not seem like much but the Timberline has an age I don't know when I lived here I was only a kid I can barely find the bathroom well that's a good start like at least I won't wet myself um no I didn't mean don't blush kid I was just kidding oh I'll call if I need you [Music] Irving it's me again obviously I could really use a shower sure you'll just need to turn on the furnace for the hot water oh my mom never wanted me to go down there but I loved that place full of little spiders a real country bumpkin huh no I was a pest now I think I even forgot how to get there I forgot almost everything about this hotel funny right people forget what hurts I think never enough Irving never enough yeah well furnaces are always in the basement you won't have trouble finding it is there something else I should know like to survive well don't expect a five-star menu oh really you could survive for months with what's in the pantry let me guess canned beans right bean soup baked beans potatoes and beans bean broth starving suddenly seems like an acceptable option Irving are you at the furnace he's waiting for me he's down there what who Oh farting ghost wait what did you say old farting I used to hide down there with hotel guests kids and wait for old farting goes to come and get us party the furnace yeah when Leonard found out he almost choked laughing your father laughed about stuff like that yeah well that's long gone how's it going it looks real complicated furnaces are all the same can you see the control panel I guess what does the pressure gauge read huh the thing that looks like a clock looks like 220 oh I don't like the sound of oh it should be more like to 10 psi pressures building you saying I have a choice between freezing or blowing up no push the green button it's the starter old farting ghost you rank spirits wake up huh nothing just talking to an old friend [Music] and here he is in tip-top shape I'd say you were right the furnace is haunted now you've got hot water you have no idea how grateful I am just doing my job give me some good news just letting you know that the rooms will heat up before the hallways I just want to go to bed did you find a room you feel comfortable in yeah my old room it's exactly like I left it Leonard cleaned it but he didn't touch the thing same as you left it exactly how does that make you feel they teach psych classes at FEMA well just being nice it's endearing but I'm not 16 anymore there's lots of other rooms in the hotel no I think I'll sleep just fine okay Irving Crawford FEMA hey hey listen I just wanted to say if I came across as obnoxious no problem oh I get it almost feels like I'm getting used to being here again whatever forget it I'm beat and I'm rambling no from the rumors that went around the valley about when you left the hotel and all that rush well right I forgot the Wilsonian mythology sorta now I'm just gonna chill in my room with the posters of my favorite bands playing my old bass totally unplugged you play the bass I suck I wanted to thank you knowing that I'm not alone here is a huge deal yeah well uh thank you for listening and not freezing to death in your car so I owe you my life then Wow it's just your job I know night-night you morning good morning Nicole hmm get any sleep I was wide awake for hours then suddenly darkness so any news what Irving Nicole stranded up here you snoozing after a night of incomplete crossword puzzles I wish I was wait you didn't sleep like at all I thought you might need something and that's I you didn't go home because of me I'm a workaholic so uh meteorologists are predicting a peak real soon probably tonight you can't move not just yet in theory what do you want to do I'm hungry I'm gonna eat first then I'll think about it it's time for you to take a tour of the pantry deal I could eat a horse right now the baked beans will be scrumptious they call perving uh how long has it been since someone's inspected the pantry inspected you mean stocked I just like to know if I should choose between malnutrition and food poisoning there'll be tons of things to eat hmm oh definitely no my sir roaches pretty sure about that I was thinking more like mold bacteria and such you'll see there's nothing to worry about for a while I had an ant farm in the closet I think Leonard suggested it one morning my bed was swarming with ants you must have freaked out my mother did the ant farm ended up straight in the trash your career as an entomologist nipped in the bud didn't think I still remembered all these little things there's some food but it looks moldy weird I didn't expect that there's a freezer take a look there okay hey you're kidding oh I almost forgot there might be a problem with the fridge door just make sure it are you [ __ ] with me no wait what did I say it would have been more useful to know that before I got locked in a holy [ __ ] I'm a freakin space cadet yeah I could have died in there [Music] uh-huh sorry to interrupt your continental breakfast I got ahold of mr. Jenkins the attorney about time when's he getting here he tried to make it his car ended up in a ditch between York Road and Valley oh come on he called 911 Isle I'm just gonna hole up in my room and cry if that's okay with you I can't imagine that he asked me to give you a message here it is he says - hmm this is a swear word and you don't need to hear it yeah Nicole at this point start assessing the general conditions of the hotel in your own jot down what you want to keep I recommend you start with the second floor it's surely the most damaged please only call me if you've got good news [Applause] [Music] there's some serious water stains on the second floor that floor is pretty rundown there's some windows missing and water damage too yeah Here I am what's up the hallway on the second floor is cut off the door to the West Wing is locked your father started renovations but he didn't get the bank loan and had to stop Leonard's attic is at the end of the hallway his mancave does that mean something to you I tried so hard to forget about that room for years anyway the West Wing is pretty rundown after all this time with no windows hello either you always have an answer to everything what do you mean tell me something what are you hiding from me I don't understand Nicole you know how to turn on the furnace you know where to find food and that the fridge door is busted you know my family's story and the hotels it's up to FEMA to deliver the supplies to isolated places like the Timberline I've been up there with the truck every month since I've been on duty it's something wrong how should I have known that huh I don't know I don't know what you know and what you don't know but what difference does it make none I I'm sorry if I upset you no one can upset me I better keep doing the inspection yeah hello who is this who the hell are you is this a joke who is this you're gonna pay for this lame-ass joke I have a phone a cell phone I'm talking with FEMA and I'm gonna get them to call the sheriff [Applause] you pissed at me I don't have time to rehash my past with you I've got a different problem someone just called the hotel what who who gets their kicks out of crank calling me well your word gets around pretty fast what did they say they said rachel is alive don't sell the hotel idiot there's something else that doesn't make sense the phone lines are down Leonard stop paying the bill months ago I'll ask someone to run a check I didn't know FEMA had FBI authority around these parts time passes in a different way some stories seem like they've been forgotten but actually they just sink down sink down like tea leaves in a cup what do you mean sounds creepy that girl's death Rachel it was the result of painful events and now it's someone's obsession you're talking about anyone in particular well her death ruined two families that everyone looked up to yours and Rachel's your father McGrath genius astrophysicist and Rachel's father the upstanding Reverend foster known all over the county not something easy to forget around here you know what I think they can go get [ __ ] every one of them I know what we went through no one else [ __ ] them you you hey cutie-pie daddy Nicole its Irving oh sorry I must have fallen asleep I haven't slept like that since I was a kid you had a tough day yesterday I think I had a dream about Leonard maybe okay I need you to pay attention though should I worry the storm brought down some power lines there blackouts all over actually the lights are acting a little weird ah now is afraid of that I don't like the idea of you up there on your own in the dark that we got to do something my electrical know-how is slightly limited it's okay I can guide you to the emergency generator if we activate it you'll be self-sufficient too easy where's the hitch there are two ways of getting to the circuit breaker straight through the garages side door or from the floor your honor but the garage side doors stuck you'll have to pass through the crawl space along the entire building and climb down from your floor if the power goes out you'll be completely in the dark all right what do I have to do check the closet in your father's apartment and see if you left anything you can use for lighting Oh on my way oh look at that I thought I lost you that time the Thompson girl came to play Leonard must have found you someplace oh the keys missing well maybe better that way News I'm not surprised the academic world distanced itself from Leonard why did you say that magic in the star's life beyond life the physics of the impossible you heard of them no but stars are stars when you die you're dead and if it's physically proven then it can't be impossible don't get offended but I didn't understand a thing I understand that things can be proven that's how I was raised by Leonard I mean he was a man of science and science has a method oh maybe he was searching for a new point of view yeah sure tell that to the treatment of quantum conscience that he never finished writing I catch your drift any news I found a Polaroid family photo anything important no I mean a camera it looks like it works you want to take a photo of the generator no he [ __ ] I was thinking of using the flash for lighting Oh smart you can try I had one just like this when I was 16 Leonard gave it to me maybe it's the same one no way I broke mine hiking on Hogback Mountain I cried all day with Leonard insisting it was only an instrument used to capture images he said you keep the really important ones inside can't say he was wrong oh yeah anyway the Polaroids better than nothing the light from the flash could come in handy Hey okay almost there I think the lights are getting worse you need to move fast on the same floor of your apartment in the staff area there's a small storeroom your father asked us several times to fix the lock fingers crossed it's still broken that's where the access to the crawlspace is what a professional tone yeah I use it when I want to make a good impression you're the only human being I can interact with while I'm hostage here whatever you say will impress me what happens when I get to the closet you'll have to go down to the breaker box and switch it on all right doesn't sound like rocket science AB hurry up please you suck at reassuring people [Applause] I found the crawlspace and also a dynamo flashlight know how to use it I think I just have to push the lever continuously is everything okay when I was a kid I used to crawl through tunnels like a mouse but the crawl space seems so narrow now maybe you gained weight it's called growing up idiot [Music] [ __ ] what's wrong your prophecy came true the power went out it's completely dark pitch black okay stay calm can you see the bundle of cables above your head anyway there should be some cables along that yeah I know what a bundle is okay okay easy does it all you need to do is follow them and you'll get to the generator room don't go any other way otherwise who knows where you'll end up perfect I got the flashlight sorta I got my breadcrumb trail more like my cable trail whatever I can do it alright yep easy does it [Music] what's up uh hi I want to ask you something okay go ahead how long is the hotel been closed about four years yeah from 89 I mean did anyone think about doing a thorough clean of the basement don't know probably pretty rushed why I found something another Polaroid a lipstick uh-huh it's a lipstick doing here it's a lipstick you don't get it it looks really old I remember this brand that the girls at school used it weird what it didn't dry out I could even use it now it's perfect I'm afraid I don't get it Irving this brand doesn't exist anymore it's been I don't know 9 or 10 years strange someone should wait 10 years to open a lipstick just to use it don't you think why are you telling me this Nicole you want to get pretty there with the generator are you crazy Nicole it's just another one of those things customers forget i well yeah you're probably right [Applause] you hmm reporting is ordered sir you awake sorta you forget your coffee for once I don't need it I gotta talk to you about something um okay Here I am you didn't tell me you knew Leonard I thought we'd been through that let me finish I spent the night going through his stuff and I want to know what you think about what you obviously know more about this place than I do about what went on here since I left at least what do you mean you went through his stuff what are you looking for someone calls me and says Rachael is alive then a lipstick appears out of nowhere it feels like something weirds going on Rachael is dead that's what everyone says but maybe the story deserves a second pass there are too many gray areas look the storm is dying down you'll be able to leave soon and go back to your life and you can forget about the whole thing like you did 10 years ago what do you care about this old business it's not worth losing sleep over just to play detective look at it this way I've always had a secret passion for Sherlock Holmes okay let me hear what you're thinking if there's one thing Leonard taught me it's that you got to listen to what's buzzing in your head first it might just be a confusing noise but if you connect the dots then it starts making sense and right now I've got a beehive in my head all right let's go hunt some bees then I [Music] found a copy of the local paper dated December 29th 1981 the day that the body was discovered according to the forensics report Rachel had been dead for days she was nine weeks pregnant oh yeah that was the official version in this article from a couple years back there's a statement by some girl who affirms she saw Rachel in a hallway at the Timberline who's this girl a classmate Glenda Ferguson I tore out the page I think the magazine was empty woman Nicole that's a gossip magazine they would sell their mother even their cousins and nephews just for a bunch of new readers [Music] but she was a classmate she couldn't have been wrong Rachel fell 90 feet into a void she can't be alive they thought I was the skeptical one here so listen to this graph ologists doubt the authenticity of the suicide note left by the girl who said that an investigative journalist the article came out a year after her death you think it's a setup perhaps okay Bob I'll hear you out [Music] [Music] you know I can't stop thinking about Rachel's father Reverend foster he was a very strict man harsh even for pastor standards he and Leonard spent hours debating the nature of reality the universe and God well opposites often attract do you ever see him rarely he gives a service once in a while priests always made me nervous them in their invisible boss his daughter's death destroyed his ego his faith made him even more cynical and lonely than he already was I can remember him demanding demanding demanding total perfection from Rachel that was insane you don't think he could have harmed his daughter hey no no but even Reverend Foster is a player we shouldn't underestimate in this story I'm just saying right [Music] remember the lipstick I found downstairs yep you made a big deal about it it doesn't smell after they've been open for a while lipstick smell really bad maybe there's been other women I mean yeah sure Leonard ruined his life over a 16 year old became a recluse lost everything and in the meantime he supposedly had another lover maybe even two could the cold have preserved possibly anything else hey I found a book and Leonard's things it's a collection of poetry but it's got notes written in it did your father write them what do they say dates notes thoughts listen to this today I saw Rachel or Rachel is sad or Rachel says she feels alone he kept a diary about her but the book was printed eight years after Rachel's death do you mean it's like he was talking with Rachel after she died as if he saw her well I mean there must be an explanation of course there's an explanation for everything and we've got to find it okay I'd say that's enough yeah that's enough for tonight today or what the hell time is it you think there's a lot to dig up in this old story maybe maybe not until I know exactly what happened any objections you don't need my approval good job you're getting the hang of it but sometimes it's better to leave the skeletons in the closet yeah once they come out you never know what they'll have to say it's a risk I already considered I can handle it hard-headed like your father just me at least on this one thing go to bed you need it agent Crawford this bit of advice I'll follow it to the tee you [Music] hey cutie-pie how are you daddy daddy is that you where are you I can't see you you can back in the end it's like the inescapability of a celestial bodies revolution we can't help but follow certain stars brightness even if those stars have died millions of years ago see you for real are you real their light is alive and it reaches us and those stars are live and dead at the same time what are you trying to say I don't understand I can't see you daddy listen sweet beans my sweetheart listen to my voice it's important I can't see you where are you where are you you know how much I love you I know daddy I've always known it I love you too say it again please Rachel Rachel Rachel Rachel Rachel Rachel you morning am i interrupting I was eating steak and potatoes cheesecake strawberry shake and a frothy cappuccino Italian style so the usual frozen beans sharp as a tack as always agents I did find something some tapes that were found in the main office in truth I shouldn't even have taken them oh so what'd you find Billy the Kid well I don't think it's anything useful uh wait wait where did I put them what the pliers so I can pry the words out of your mouth oh sure okay okay it's um it's VHS of behind-the-scenes of a TV broadcast but it's it's all [ __ ] just to attract an audience trust me Jesus you can be really long-winded yeah you're right sorry their tapes about haunted hotels weird and mysterious stories stuff kids like with these guys who call themselves ghost hunters ghost hunters did they hear about the old farting ghosts I'm not sure but they went on a tour of old buildings in the county and they stopped by the Timberline to whatever let me hear it okay but I'm warning you it's kind of well listen for yourself okay okay the lights look good how about the headphones don't know there's like a buzzing noise listen [Music] you're not true well the German ones are better hmm we are about to enter a nightmare Hotel a place full of deceit and secrecy we're terrible lies were played out I didn't like that again later oh the room with the fireplace isn't bad okay spare me the kitchen I didn't know what the hell is a fireplace okay kitchens no Stan where'd you leave all the gear room one huh I stuck a piece of tape on the door I didn't get that what room I got a buzz in the headset their microphones one one seven Danny what's that stuff in camera it's giving off a glare and burns out the thing I told you no tricks what tricks I didn't use anything stop [ __ ] around Danny I told you I didn't rig anything I saw it too it's a mirror isn't it huh it looked like the reflection on a mirror what you smoke this morning what the [ __ ] are you two up to cut the crap you're freaking me boys it there it is there it is where I saw it it's just up there it's like a light like a door that opens I swear it stop touching me oh you'll give me a heart attack what are you talking about I'm like over here look I felt someone touch me are you kidding that's it if the tapes damaged too damp well I'd say [ __ ] typical how ladylike what happened in the end with the TV show never aired some say they ran off ditching everything there yeah but they mentioned a room on the tape I'd like to take a look it's 1 1 7 I think 1 1 7 yeah same floor as my apartment [Music] hey I found the room but someone barricaded it with an L bracket do what they do in movies bust through the door with your shoulder real funny I need a screwdriver I think I've saw one around somewhere but I don't remember we're probably in the basement seems to me I've seen one in the garage or was it the generator room I'll let you know [Applause] Hey found the screwdriver no I keep thinking about those guys the the ghost hunters you sure it was intact it sounded so natural awesome actors I'll give him that I can't stand the idea that my family problems might end up on cable or some tourist guide fortunately it seems that won't happen they hightailed it out of there god only knows why don't tell me you believe in ghosts or some [ __ ] like that well I'm not superstitious but if someone believes that a black cat is bad luck then you also have to believe that something else is good luck huh what are you talking about prayer for example you're saying prayer brings good luck a doubt Reverend foster would agree a screwdriver I'm out of here I got a proposition go for a street warrior challenge when I get out of here I get K CLE yoo-hoo everyone oh you're the first female I meet that no street warrior this female one against all those snot-nosed brats wearing knee highs in the hotel high kick okay I've cut the end just tricks never skip a leg day Irving to be honest I don't think I'll live up to the confrontation whoa whoa whoa you're the first guy I meet that doesn't know street warrior playing video games wasn't considered an edifying pursuit in my house what a drag but you can teach me hmm okay deal but we got to start with Lord bull he's got the easier combos sure whatever you say silence my young apprentice wax on wax off oh my god [Music] I can still hear that guide telling me Rachel's alive if he calls back go into special protocol mode which is trying to sell him a vacuum cleaner I even ask [Laughter] how much do you know about those TV shows the ones about haunted houses I know they're popular a lot of tourism revolves around them did the whole Rachel's story really bring them here everyone in town knew about her suicide had a bit of gossip no so sad to see the place you grew up in go downhill I know I'm so sorry believe me I don't know he's locked up in the interference voices [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Hey [ __ ] sake Irving Oh what did I do he gave me a heart attack sorry I warned you with a carrier pigeon next time uh what I'm just curious to know what you found in that room oh you should be you're never gonna believe it you [Music] Here I am you still there well should I be home I wouldn't miss Nicole's amazing adventures in the remote mountains for anything Irving don't tell me you're staying on just for me go I promise not to get into any trouble for the rest of the night I already told you I'm sticking around till you get closure Thanks you always do that do what worry about every desperate stranger that knocks on your door you're no stranger but I I don't get it you've been a part of this place since you were born you belong here well I thought I left all this behind maybe I still have a ways to go to be free you're making progress two days ago you would have skinned me alive if I'd called you a country bumpkin what tells you I'm not sharpening my knives this very minute it's good we're just talking on the phone then listen is this contraption really a phone it feels like a walkie-talkie slash defibrillator it's a real phone and trust me in a few years everybody will have one you think it's easier for me to believe in ghosts than to imagine people being hounded by a phone when they're out and about I'm I'm grateful for it I wouldn't have met you without it Irving are you hitting on me by any chance uh no what are you I mean it's just I relax I was kidding I can never tell when you're kidding yeah it's one of my fascinating bird shoes same oh hold on a sec don't go anywhere okay huh oh okay you have a good night too miss flattery Merry Christmas good night hon Here I am to be honest I never thought I'd spend Christmas like this sorry I was going off on another flashback about the life of Nicole Wilson Christmas Eve is the right time to reminisce yeah yeah I get it - yeah that's what there was in the end there was like a strange kind of warmth and then it all ended Christmas of 80 me and my mom were at my aunt's house and Billings Leonard was here on his own while I was pretending that I liked my aunt's sweater he and she were Nicole they Hey and a year later she killed herself and what she was carrying - don't be like that there you have it these are my memories and hey did you hear that no what are you talking about like a clinking uh no I didn't hear anything sorry I want to check okay yeah I was thinking about earlier when I said I was happy to have met you huh I just I was trying to figure out how to tell you I feel real close to you Nicky god I hear myself talk I sound like an idiot Irving III don't know what you're trying to say but right now I'm dealing with something else I want to be there to help you I'm just a useless voice on the mic believe me right now I would also like a little bit more presence you know people get close in lots of ways please Shh SEC I'm trying to listen to this noise all right I get that I might be overdoing it sorry I'm a klutz and and sometimes it's Irving please shut up Thanks listen we'll get back to this but let me figure this out Oh where is this sound coming from I don't hear anything anyway later Bertha you hear me [ __ ] sake hey sorry I didn't answer I was busy oh no problem it's fine what'd you want to tell me it's this microphone sometimes it captures sounds what sounds whispers could be a draft in the crawl spaces hotels full of them yeah sure I didn't mean to worry you heads up and if he sends trouble just let me know found anything I can't hear that sound anymore it's easy to freak out when you're on your own up there maybe it's not me it's this hotel I I didn't hear you you know for a second it was nice to imagine that the past could come back like that we always had a party on December 23rd maybe heard about it it's pretty well known in the county he sounds amazing you should have seen the ballroom back then I can almost picture the last time Rachel's family was there Reverend foster wasn't a sullen as usual and your parents my mother had eyes only for Leonard and he I saw he wouldn't stop staring at that girl Rachel she talked and moved with the Grace and confidence of an adult she wore dress with a bow on her back she was so beautiful perfect it was the beginning of the end and we were breaking out the champagne Nicky I sorry I'm coming of freakin nostalgic up here well I can't hear that sound anymore it's gone I'm gonna look around again and then I'm going to bed be careful [Music] you Irving Merry Christmas Niki oh it's a little late for holiday greetings but I expected that what well I I thought you're calling - hey is everything okay yes I mean I don't think so no what happened I think I sleep walked like in the old Laurel and Hardy movies I'm serious I woke up in church standing in front of the lectern Wow does that happen a lot no one doesn't just become a sleepwalker from one day to the next it used to happen when I lived here one time in February I ended up outside but no parent leaves the door's unlocked if their kids sleepwalks I never told anyone sleepwalking episodes are common in children that's not the point I forgot all about it then I come back here and it happens again if I ended up in that church maybe there's a reason sometimes following your instinct is the best thing I don't want to go back there now but I'll think about it Oh Irving yeah Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Nicki [Applause] hi I was thinking there really could be a repressed reason as to why you ended up there so you've come to the conclusion that I'm not crazy never thought that well at least on this case [ __ ] hey language sister Nicole alright alright so if I think about the church I think about my mother she often helped Reverend foster she decorated for holidays did fundraising and put up booths to involve the whole community in parish activities you know that kind of stuff I know what you mean I think she found gratification in doing that something she didn't get elsewhere including the hotel when we moved to Portland she quit fundraising God I gather you didn't exactly have a high opinion of your mother when you were a kid well she was really busy with the hotel I was always running after Leonard he was much more fun than she was no doubt about it he was a philosopher capable of calculating the motion of celestial bodies while taking apart and refitting a motorcycle in less than half an hour what about her in the same half-hour she could have audited a business balance sheet there you go a businesswoman hmm know what I understood later living in such proximity to her is that mom loved feeling needed a religious community like ours makes you feel needed without a doubt I suppose nici when there was a party my mother always got out the usual streamers and decorations and stuff she raced in and out of the church but I never discovered where she kept all those things never asked Oh a million times she didn't want to answer she said they were in a safe place a real mystery what kind of decorations could they have possibly been nothing explosive it's just that I had the bad habit of sneaking all over the place and forgetting what time it was there was that huge lady the assistant cook mrs. Brice she used to get so mad a judicious girl they promised to reveal the secret storeroom when I got older but I must have forgotten a mystery if the secret storeroom who sounds good the riddle what are you talking about Leonard was never good at keeping secrets but he taught me a riddle to get there can you remember it incredible yes Oh something like down the stairs watch your step don't fall apart or it's your end round a corner turn around there's your way in front of you all that's close can be open to if you see beyond its looks but how can I remember it how it's I I Wow a total mystery want to play I yes I need to think about it I have no idea what it means I'll call you if anything comes to mind [Music] you want to play the organ in a church in the middle of the night really hey what are you doing there no no I think you stayed on the line didn't notice you think it's too horror the church the organ the notes reverberating in the dark it's been years since anyone played it my mother's heart would break to see it like this she adored it you should take it with you to play it in Portland you're better off listening to a cat in heat than my scales well you can always pick it up again even if I don't think it's crucial I mean playing the organ yeah right tell that to my mom essential part of a woman's education I must admit nah poor mom she had a daughter that would rather dig for gold at Hunter's gudge till the cows came home I can totally picture you uh-huh then there was Rachel who reminded me how useless I was in music look how good rachel is look how she puts her mind to it she doesn't know how to read but she's got a real ear for it while I was considered the illiterate artist in the house if h 'l had been around she would have improvised Beethoven's ninth was she's so perfect yes I'm only just now realizing how jealous I was keep looking someone broke into the church some [ __ ] screwed up camper Oh your father left it open for mountain Wanderers damn sons of o I'll have to clean up this mess before Jenkins shows up keep an eye out normally no one's around in this weather but you never know oh okay okay you practicing for the church choir now I know this tune the souls that come out of their graves it's from the book of Revelation can I ask you about your mysterious father who you only sort of mention my father was nothing like Leonard well I don't know what happened between you but if you want to talk about it I I I will but not now it's um it's complicated yeah I get that believe me I do thanks [Music] which find the paintings of the saints I was convinced Leonard had gotten rid of them why he likes saying that it was more likely to find God in a supernova than in a church I don't see what he had in common with the Reverend Solomon Foster they mostly talked for long stretches in between chess moves up in the attic United by pawns and bishops but divided by the Saints divided by everything else I'd say oh [ __ ] [Music] oh [ __ ] dope found me mystery decorations no no no decorations is everything okay I found something what I it's like someone built some kind of bedroom Irving you there of course yeah what bedroom tell me what you see okay I there's some windows drawn on the walls books sheet music a pink bed it's like a kid's room no way this place doesn't make sense no one would live down here Nicole Nicky I think you should get out of there now wait wait wait there's got to be an explanation okay that's it now I'm calling the head office in Billings I'm telling you it's a red emergency so they'll have - Jesus Christ Irving what this is all Rachel stuff understand it's her room a replica but you don't know that you can't know what a room look like everything here reminds me of her let me look around I'm sure I'll find an explanation but my other hands on the red phone keep it there but don't make the call I need to figure out what's going on here Hey can you hear me yes we have to call someone you have to get out of there right now no I found a key it's from my old music box the one in Leonard's room I'm having a hard time following if everything in here is Rachel's then why is my music boxes key here I don't know and I don't want to know tell you what I think someone could have been in your room it doesn't matter how can you be so calm if someone was in there he's not here now I need to grab the chance to figure out what the hell is going on or went on here [Music] yes Nicole listen I already know what you're gonna say but please trust me get out of there please you're not helping you to realize you found the replica of a dead girl's bedroom sick this is the more cigs get freaky bizarre and painful the more I need to figure out why why all of this we'll figure it out with the sheriff once you're out of there into a safe hotel room in town please just listen a bunch of strange things happen since I got here think about it phone calls on a deadline old lipsticks that don't go bad Leonard's notes where he says he saw a girl that supposedly been dead for 10 years and now this oh good reasons to get out of there we both agreed that saving your skin is top priority right I've looked over every inch of this place and there's no one if it's true you realize what that means what what are you trying to tell me your father spent years in there in total solitude with the weight of his family Rachel and his conscience he wasn't the kind of guy to just let the past slide with a shrug you know that too you're joking right you think he did this think about it that could be an act of love distorted even more but his eyes how dare you my my father might have had a lot of weaknesses but surely what you're saying leave out that he cheated on my mom leave out that he fell in love with a 16 year old but [ __ ] hell don't you dare even think that I he would never have built [ __ ] underground shrine for a dead person your father had changed in the end you didn't spend time with him but I met him and I'm telling you no I don't give a [ __ ] about what you have to say I just want you to know that if you don't want to help discover the truth don't call me [ __ ] how dare you you don't know [ __ ] you don't know [ __ ] finally a bit of peace and quiet he'll help me clear my head without those incessant phone calls I'm not a [ __ ] switchboard for [ __ ] sake okay let me piece things together I just found out there's a room dedicated to Rachel Foster in my father's hotel maybe with items from her real room holy jesus that's freaky some people think she didn't commit suicide and some even think she's still alive I have to think it through what concrete clues did I find first thing the phone call they said Rachel isn't dead then the lipstick from 10 years ago turns up still good and then my father's various notes where he says he still sees her if that were true it might explain the sighting by her friend here in the timber line and now I find her retainer box but no retainer that room might not be a reconstruction if Rachel didn't kill herself Rachel could have lived here but if she's still alive why doesn't she tell her parents unless they're all in cahoots no suicide note Timberline money no no no I'm just being paranoid and then there'd be no reason for her to live in a [ __ ] underground replica of her room Mikey in the middle of Rachel's stuff is it a message where do I fit in are you trying to tell me something dad my music box with the hockey player I don't think I have the guts to hear that tune again but I must the 27th of December 1983 the hockey finals at masuleh us against cold springs hi we won by sudden death after a three-hour game and I got the medal for the most number of face offs won according to the papers that was the night Rachel killed herself coming home mom barely had the time to pull into the garage that I was already racing up to you waving the medal in your face daddy I'm so happy but you had other things on your mind right and you and Mom started fighting voices getting louder at long silence when she comes down the stairs with suitcases and mrs. Bryce tries to stop her mom's car stays here and we leave with my Uncle John's I never found out what started that fight mom never wanted to talk about it are you trying to daddy you Irving finally I'm okay I was dying on this chair you're right that room freaked me out so I looked around the entire hotel and if there's still a chance of getting to the bottom of this story then it's got to be behind the locked door on the last floor in the Attic that wing has been condemned for years I know I'll be careful okay there are too many things that I took for granted it's as if someone was putting pieces of my past in front of me to show them to me under another light who are you talking about Niki maybe it's my father in my music box I found the medal I won the night Rachel died dad could have put it there and if he did there must be a reason it it all sounds insane the night Rachel died maybe I have to start from there I played in that really long hockey game but what was going on in the meantime you remember that night Irving I think I was at church with my family church that night we had a mass for the poor here we held one every year as usual mom volunteered to take me to the game but she was so busy with a soup kitchen that I was afraid she was going to be late I remember while she ran around she said she ordered me to close the mezzanine you mean the intermediate floor above the reception what's in there a storeroom have you been up there no I'd forgotten all about it I'd better take a look before moving on [Music] Irving hello can you hear me I'm on the mezzanine and it's a nightmare there are medicines everywhere they're set up like in a scene that there's one with a hockey stick that's my stick if you're listening to me whoever set up this representation I think they want to tell me that Rachel was killed but why my hockey stick hello hello why isn't he answering Irving I swear I'm not kidding this is a huge deal if you can hear me it's time to make that phone call [Music] [Applause] where are you Nicole it's about time did you hear my messages how many doors have you opened Nicole how many are still missing what are you are you drunk keep going hello hello Irving [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello I imagine you found my room what does all this mean that's a question I've asked myself many times what does all this mean Irving how far do you want to push yourself how much can you take what's every memory painstaking gathered every reconstructed piece every little element retrieved from the dark a photo a hairband a lipstick it means remembering Rachel that's what all this means I didn't choose this better I had to do it what did you do Irving these won't most booze with memories the memories get into the walls under the floorboards they creep into crawl spaces you're not with FEMA you Jenkins you you never talk to him you've lost the phone call all those weird events you were behind all of them someone had to bring the last piece of the memory puzzle a year the most important one heal me I I your father wanted to keep him out of it I convinced him that only you could resolve the equation as he called it I don't understand how could you over the last few days you got a little taste of what it means to dig around in the past hunting for memories that scratch away behind every wall in the night I we did it for years day after day after day lies I have nothing against lies I grew up around lies but now it's time for the truth to come out finally who are you really I wanted to be you a story there was an invisible boy like everyone he just wanted to run on the grass ride a bike swim in the lake in summer his father though his father had other plans Bissell in his dark world made of stylin s-- and player the shun only one star his wonderful sister a heavenly creature that spent hours telling him fairy tales in secret she who told him what they free and strong man he would become one day Rachel she was like that free and strong at the time I didn't understand her dyslexia or what [ __ ] meant that's what they called her at school but I could hear her cry at night now I wanted to protect her but I couldn't one day that beautiful luminous creature met someone the human being that saw her for real my dad yes and I was the invisible witness what happened love simply a love nothing more nothing less but I'd love it's too much and it would be punished who paid for this to love Nicole Rachel Rachel was your sister now I remember you you were too caught up with your hatred for Rachel to notice the innocent little kid that sometimes tagged along I didn't hate your sister I was just jealous doesn't matter those days are over how could I have forgotten you I was raised to be forgotten what do you want from me the day my sister paid their life for her love we all died we make up the history of the timber line it was a tragedy you we all got frozen there in that very moment in that confined horizon of events as you'll understand it as you've already begun to understand for the first time in years I depended on someone and this is the result you have to keep going to get to where I wasn't able to go you will be new witness you owe it to us and you owe it to her [Music] a few years of pass and set last used this old tape recorder I think you were in elementary school I imagine a testament should start in a poised manner My dear Nicole my favorite daughter etc etc poised wadies serious irrevocable I prefer asking you how you are how are you Nicky you're probably tired I can imagine at this point of your journey the marks and voices of this old hotel will have already whispered all their secrets you've always been good at solving puzzles and this you surely resemble more your mother than me Irving has always been convinced that you only you could surmount the fear and suffering that exude it from these hallways we tried we waited we were terrified we studied we listened we listened to her but all the love in the world wasn't enough to decipher those muted vowels those wide-open eyes those tears of light in your time and space and the here and now I will no longer be with you but it doesn't matter trust me it doesn't I have a new theory Nikki love is and remains it isn't the would you stand on in the walls that keep up this hotel who are you looking at only breathe and sometimes it hates it hates those who didn't allow it those who cast that aside with indifference and those who can't recognize it stars to eliminate their light even after collapsing right there is a lot of light here there's light in death I want to free myself all this darkness I can no longer see the stars I'm tired of surviving in this limbo so how are you Nikki I'm good I will be good figured out what Rachel was saying Nikki she's here [Music] hello Leonard was a very special man his soul was big enough to love both you and Rachel I knew my father's soul better than anyone do you were just a jealous kid don't you dare try to make me feel guilty you don't I just want you to get to the truth so why didn't you tell me about the truth tell who the Nichole who thought eating beans was the worst tragedy and couldn't wait to finish this business and run away forgetting everything all over again you don't know anything about what my mother and I went through but you're different too when you got here now you can discover the truth a truth that otherwise would have destroyed you I didn't lie to you I protected you listen I'm sorry about Rachel I hated her and I hated my father but I never wanted it to end like that I understand your pain maybe better than anyone betrayal shame death my family was destroyed just like yours how much longer does this pain have to last it'll be over soon what else is there to know you want the truth well I can't give it to you I've already given you everything I could now you have to tie the pieces together what does that mean the father always said we are the sum of the people we take with us and you abandoned these people here in this place enough riddles Irving I'm tired me - you're the only one who can give a finale to this story it's time you open the last door [Music] Oh God how could I forgotten I I saw everything I was there all the pieces were in front of my eyes my kids eyes it was the same night as the hockey game in Missoula Reverend foster was so busy with the preparations of the meals for the giving to the poor at the Timberline Church and my mother Claire said that we would get back from the game and time for the distribution she convinced my father to help the Reverend and he'd come with his whole family you and Rachel yeah I remember it like it was yesterday I couldn't find my stick I panicked and I went down to the garage Claire was there red in the face her look her look it was just a fleeting feeling that's why I erased it from my memory I had to erase it understand what was in her look it just wasn't her it was like a frightful creature a a disturbed dangerous animal I've never seen her like that before or after not even on her deathbed and then she put her hands on her hips exhausted she smiled and there she was again my mom but it must have just been the impression of a moment I had the final against cone springs high awaiting me I climbed in the car throwing my bag into the backseat my hockey stick was there Claire said she cleaned it she cleaned it go on I I don't go on we we got there on time and I played best game of my life and the last Claire was on the bleachers encouraging me and cheering and then I lost sight of her for two whole periods I think and later when I asked she said she'd moved because Mario Donegal's father was getting on her nerves but it wasn't true just enough time to go back to the car don't see it Irving don't say it don't say thing I I don't I traveled all the way with Rachel's body and the baby she carried inside of her in the trunk we rolled in the blanket she killed Rachel Thank You Nikki you've had your revenge I hope all this gives you the B's you were looking for I wanted you to help me uncover the truth you're saying you didn't know the Claire I was home like a kid plus she never wanted me to get to the bottom of it Rachel this is here you know I I think she's still protecting me I'm growing up now now we can all be reunited at last what wait where are you going listen we can work things out what happened is terrible but all the main players in this story are dead get it dead we are still alive we are alive me you we didn't do anything that's exactly what we did wrong Nicole we didn't do anything it's beautiful here Rachel told me about it so many times but I never thought it was so [Music] you're the only one left don't leave me here alone unscared swipe as far as the eye can see beyond the mountains you you left the hotel but it's too cold you'll you'll die out there Irving please I've lived in the dark for years you freed me and now I can finally rest in the light I can and go back [Applause] [Music] don't go you can don't leave me - we have our drink it's not a goodbye Mike huff
