miles east of meet us here if you follow the canyon that way you'll pass through sorrow valley soon after you will arrive at that station okay from there you follow the tracks east to the old trellis we'll meet you there okay but first when you add fat stations you gotta hijack a tree what i get a wood a tree a train oh my gonna hijack a train we gotta run in we'll see you there and don't forget if this note is found that i have failed but i have faith that whoever reads this has also escaped cares for our cause and will finish what i could not this tape i hold must get to the monaka known as abe he who freed the slaves of rupture farms and has started the rebellion he must know how the evil controls us all the evil that has murdered me and so many others who have escaped i beg of you a must see this day [Music] let's go let's go come on he's getting away again sorry boss it's a miracle is he but crap delivery death trap has made it even this far you know it's just all you had left the next stop oh uh well that would be uh sling barracks boss and maybe while we're there we can pick up some reinforcements you know i mean we we did kind of lose a lot of good guys back there watching idiots couldn't stop one stinking slave little hearts that baby know you've been working your whole life to retire on one of those mega luxury air yachts and all and i noticed abe guy burned that dream to smithereens but maybe maybe we clean this all up and you can still afford one of them economy models you know you might have used off of e-crappy good stuff barracks do it of course i'm trying i'm trying to die and we're gonna bring this puppy home we are gonna bring this puppy home [Music] uh [Music] i barely know how to use this thing so [Music] hi let's go let's get out of here [Applause] [Music] i don't want to be in here anymore i just don't [Music] hey but i don't know how you did it but unbelievable they tell you he knows how to drive a train he swiped the manuals out of shipping years ago he's been reading them ever since oh i was given this problem he died looking for us that's terrible what's that a map i guess it is and this came with it wow creepy right yeah creepy with his last breath he said they're all dying who's dying our followers they're all dying what do you mean our followers i think he means since we've led the farm rumors have been spreading throughout the factories the documents have started escaping and now they're trying to find us i told you that would happen anything else well they found some sick mudukus they escaped from other factories but they were dying all of them would die with their health i discovered an antidote they made some medicine and it fixed them but i still don't know why they got sick nothing else he said we needed to find the keeper um what's it doing oh look at that look where it's shining even though the train is bouncing around the light stays right on necromm nobody wants to go i also found another guy he left a note for me said we gotta know what's on this table is that an old play the tape not too well they're still using that communication output okay looky here slate barracks is the next stop on this line each lab of communication outposts shouldn't it yep if we don't take out that com tower then every factory ahead of us including necromine they're gonna know we're coming but first i gotta play this tape yep [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] me so greetings wise investors of esteemed cartel what i propose to you today is the ultimate employee performance and job retainment solution for years it has been my quest to find the upper limits of modokin labor capabilities as well as the potential addiction dependencies so that tomorrow your conglomerates of factories may profit from maximized labor performance chemically induced loyalty and the end to labor escape whistleblowers and those costly pr nightmare blowbacks only soulstorm brute takes performance chemical dependency and profitability to entirely new levels and sustains them our solution is simple two brews a day keeps job performance at peak operability but if that laborer ever makes a run for it within 48 hours of not having access to our beloved brew their withdrawals will have kicked in and become so severe that in only a few hours the little wannabe whistleblowing ingredients will be dead dying they will not be running to cities because they will die before they ever get there they will not be meeting with union representatives because they will never reach one they will not be causing you pr nightmares because they will be dead oh no the followers they're all dying from the peru right [Music] you see all those pipes out there those are the brew pipelines they started frostburn broody where all that brew starts getting pumped out to all those factories across windows it gets worse much much worse i played it now i know why the others are dying it's the brew it's killing them that's ridiculous brew never killed nobody we've been drinking it all our lives that's just it it's when we don't have bruce that's when we get set because the brew it's designed to kill us if we ever escape but we're okay and we escaped but only because you stashed bruised for us when we split the farm then the train we stole had bruised on it then we got lots more but when we run out we're screwed but you said you crafted a cure but only in little doses not enough for a whole continent full of factories full of slaves and a lot more rumors will be spreading after what we've done today with lots more escapes and lots more dying i need to find the keeper [Music] we gotta get the necromancer it's the next topic how can this weak pathetic uneducated schmuck of a slave still manage to be alive i don't know boss but that creepy dude is some kind of supernatural i tell you i wouldn't have believed it had i not seen it with my own eyes when my best friends got taken over by some kind of mind control and suddenly they start blowing each other away it was so disturbing i don't know boss but maybe the brew ain't working on that one true was our insurance our guarantee that would prevent anything like this from ever happening but it is happening and we're past that creeps expiration date unless they had brew with them how do you explain it maybe the brewmaster's solution is failing us welcome back to news failure blues following up on our top story how molok mcluckin deceived his own investors after burning down his own farm for the insurance mula in a truly diabolical act now we expect clucks to be greedy heck we even bank on it but this clock doesn't just take the cake he steals the whole cake delivery blimp then makes a run for it here at the site of the once-stop performing meat farm on mudos now just a smoldering disaster area that had suffered massive casualties a charge some called the mass murder of a loyal labor force betrayed by the glock state hello mr marker security cheaper have you been able to reach the brewmaster yet how often does that happen only once that i know of and that was a hurricane one other thing though there's this uh conspiracy theory floating around about a uprising at ruptured farms claims some ptsd slag survivors they've been rambling on about a supernatural slave took out mullick's place and escaped with the rest of the slaves says they didn't die there thought you should know mullick really burn his own farm down or is the brew failing us um mr morgan i know we're in a creepy business digging up bones and stuff but sir that's the most terrifying thing i have ever heard you say keep trying to get a hold of the brewmaster alert me when you get him oh you can count on me [Music] the key [Music] uh [Music] so huh ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] hey they've always known you would come do you know why you have uh are you the keeper we're all keepers here since the beginning we keep the oldest things in dangerous things each other the secrets the secrets secrets of crimes hidden throughout time long since buried in lies lies you know as history a false history written in our blood these walls hold the memory of what happened what really happened for the keepers remember everything their memories are most dangerous things things that would threaten even the most powerful bloodlines that rule the industries of odd world they would destroy this place if ever it were discovered this is why our keepers their memories must remain hidden must stay secret but only for so long as it takes you to unleash what's coming what's coming what do they do they know what you need to know here but you're unable to see it just yet just yeah when you return with the stone of the fragon's eye only then can you see return return from where the depth down there down there where you can return with the eye and receive the branding so you can see the branding and it will go right there you can return with the eye abe as long as you remember they don't like the light [Applause] [Music] uh uh [Music] [Applause] wow [Music] so oh hello [Music] keeper [Music] hello hello [Music] go to the center of the lake game find yourself at the center find yourself and see it's the only way you will know [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] forgive us abe it was the only way [Music] hey to behold such terrible truth so much for a heart to bear why who would they oh good day i'm so sorry but you needed to know who we really are what happened to us and what's at stake if you don't succeed you must taint the brew wave for the brew is what keeps the rest enslaved break its spell with your remedy or our kind will never be free break the spell for what good is a poison that's tainted with its cure hey daddy's worried we're getting low on bruce whoa check that out guys it's worse than we thought was that well we've been taught our whole lives and the factories everything we thought we knew it's all lies the truth we're not just the schmucks we always thought we were we're something much much more yeah but but right now we gotta survive and what the keeper said we need to found the keeper i did and she told us what to do but what she meant i can't figure out she was she hot little she was the oldest thing i've ever seen well what's she saying she said we needed to take the proof because it keeps us all enslaved but we do that she said for what good is the poison if it's tainted with its cure but what does that mean [Music] just doing that creepy stuff again [Music] those are ingredients i wrote them down when i was figuring out how to craft medicine for the sick guys [Music] the ingredients it's like they're all swirling into the brewery is it honest to mix them into the brewery what good is a poison if it's tainted with its cure wait the brewery pumps brew out to all the factories and noodles maybe it's telling us to mix your medicine into the brew before it gets pumped out to all those factories but i only crafted the medicine in small doses how would we ever find enough to mix it for all those factories and all those slaves but she already got the recipe and it's only five ingredients but how will we get enough to match dos foodos biggest brewery how about pico depot it's close by on the z line and its switch track is coming up but fico's a freight yard not a deep dark abandoned mine shaft like where i felt the stuff abe anything manufactured on operon passes through places like pico depot every day and all those ingredients you wrote down i'm pretty sure they're all used by food drug and makeup companies aren't they i guess they are toby if we can get abe into fico depot then maybe we can get some favors from some old buddies still slaving away there and they could like these red containers and abe could help them load them onto this train then run this trade right up that maybe that's it if we don't do this now we gotta try let's do it looks like that guy tore up the place what's the next facility them tracks is headed to i see that's uh depot we gotta hurry go faster if we don't stop that ape guy i'll get blamed for this disaster down there too you got it bud [Music] um [Music] [Music] what you know this is my nap hour uh sorry to bother you mr asslick but uh there's these rumors been spread around about uprisings and train hijackings and you woke me for rumors for silly conspiracy theories there is no uprising molok burned down his own damn farm we know this because never in history has a modakin beaten gluckin ever oh uh of course you're right mr asslick i mean i didn't mean that don't believe anything [Music] [Music] [Music] what is it now excuse there's these rumors circulating hijackings uprisings instantaneous combustion creepy stuff troops are getting worried so me and the boys were thinking that maybe we should doubt excuse me don't think it makes you say stupid things for decades my brew has ensured against such possibilities you dare suggest my brew isn't working but don't i pay you to suppress rumors well then do it this makes no sense my brew has always worked there must be some other malik malik this is his doing his plot has failed and to save himself he's trying to blame my brew that traitor [Music] guys [Music] how dare anyone question my recipe it has never failed us never it must be mullick who else would be spreading these fake rumors these conspiracy theories what oh sorry about it again what is it there's a two gluckins that have a robot airship they're waiting on your helipad two what plugin sir they're kind of freaking out pissed off and all they're demanding you meet with them demanding you tell them they can wait malik i know he's behind this faster out we gotta go i faster as fast as i can kobe fast as i can hmm wow [Music] hey hey what's happening holy crap screw this it's that aim guy right there [Music] get get me now oh secret ingredients now being added to recipe congratulations a brand new recipe is now amazing for pipeline distribution the new and improved brew will be automatically distributed to partner factories [Music] um to ever have believed in his brew or in him that brings the two of you here brewmaster your recipe is a disaster we have lost our factories and we demand to know how you intend to compensate us you dare accuse me it's your brew that has failed us my recipe is flowers do you inbreds not see that my brew is under attack as were our operations we barely escaped our own premises alive and only one day after malik's farm disaster isn't that curious and now you're suffering uprising as well you pathetic pawns don't you see we've been betrayed this is malik's doing his slaves didn't die in the farm he's using them as an army to take us all down he's attracts and right now he's attacking my throne blaming it all on the imaginary ape guy even more than i expected turns out those two idiots been sniffing their own security slings out of ot and bonuses now they hate these clowns as much as you do boss good very good do you know what to do [Music] what kind of assurances well for one i needs to know that my bonus is secure and these guys want to fly to the aemons and hang out with us until all this flow's over nothing else they want to be made whole on all the bonuses they got scammed out of they do this they want to know you're going to make it up to them [Music] and now you can see my security is getting hammered out there you both brought security slings how many can you contribute i've have a dozen fierce and loyal sliggies all awaiting my command that's what he thinks i've got as many awaiting my command [Music] oh my god well then if we execute our forces with precision we'll thwart mullick's plan cross his fake rebellion and expose the fraudulent fiend for all of our financiers to see ah and there's my lieutenant and his team now and there's my sergeant at arms with his shock team just in time but now that you're all here come forth and get your orders [Music] well what are you waiting for hey guys if you want to get possessed by that supernatural freak wreaking havoc out there or are we flying to the aemons and shipping frosty paladins on a human [Music] beach i don't kill well we could hardly believe we really did what we really did today maybe they can't either so what else did you learn down there with that keeper so much but we've got a mother all critters got mothers no i mean we all have the same mother all of us from rupture that even forms it has to be because why was she i don't know why she left us but i do know where she is alive but we were all told our mothers were dead they lied to us about everything and she's not dead but she's she's just she's sweating [Music] i don't even know no one who's ever even been to nollie feb a city sold we gotta find her because we need to know why she left us in that horrible place and why she gave me these [Music] [Music] you
