agent thorne may not have named the precise location of project starhawk but the intel has pointed us in the right direction then we will proceed as planned oh hello captain is this the new pilot yes a valuable addition to the squadron wouldn't you say indeed marvelous works curing agent thorne you've exceeded your previous statistics by oh forgive me i'm so familiar with your profile that i forgot we haven't actually met i'm lt 514 imperial intelligence i'm eager to analyze your performance in the upcoming mission captain carol shall we proceed with the briefing agent thorne's intel has paid off we've learned that a convoy of new republic engineers is traveling from hosnian prime to project starhawk's secret base their chartered path leads them straight through the contested territory of de severo according to our new information the convoy will attempt to conceal its presence in a local debris field follow the convoy through the wreckage and allow them to jump to hyperspace we will calculate all possible destinations along their trajectory to find project starhawk you must not be detected we cannot risk losing this convoy local imperial forces have been advised not to interfere once the convoy is clear of the debris it will leave the system pointing us toward their hidden headquarters once we have their jump vector return to the overseer and prepare for immediate redeployment i've already contacted the imperial authorities at decevero they're aware of the situation you're certain he won't interfere my records indicate that captain amos is trigger-happy to say the least his fleet is already in ruins after initiating several battles that were frankly quite unnecessary captain amos is enthusiastic i'm hoping he's not a fool the empire can't afford to lose assets at this stage in the war i agree wholeheartedly captain after your impressive work at hosnian prime this should be an effortless mission for you pilot yes my faith in you was not misplaced make sure it stays that way that will be all maintenance a simple in-and-out mission should be painless for us but stay on your toes you never know what cheap tricks the rebels will pull de sevro hmm long way from civilization i haven't seen the outer rim since the insurrection at krigo well let's get to it then get to your tie the captain has a personal stake in project starhawk a vendetta with lyndon james take it from me nothing motivates like betrayal i've seen too many good pilots friends turned freighter i put them out of their misery but there's always more out there hayden versier erica quell lyndon javes they're not just traitors they're loose ends problems to solve once the war is done the tie reaper is a specialist model made for utility and squadron support if the enemy sees one they know they're in trouble with this loadout it's built to disable enemy fighters with ion lasers i've also equipped jamming tech to keep you off enemy radars and tactical shields to protect allied ties all this wreckage what happened here captain amos is bloodthirsty he's baited the rebels into pointless fleet battles over decevero and lost several destroyers by the look of it at least his recklessness allows us to stay hidden stay together and keep your distance a convoy can't know we're drinking them yes sir radar jabber will make it harder for the enemy to track you use it wisely let's use those debris clusters as cover and close in on the convoy but don't boost your engines it puts the entire mission at risk easy don't overdo it on the approach that's quite the convoy just to protect rebel engineers why not destroy them and stop those gearheads from reaching their destination patience von reg we'll have plenty of new targets once we locate project starhawk yes sir you're right it's smarter to hit them at the source than slow them down easy don't overdo it on the approach over here we're in position patience remember what we learned at the battle of bashar how could i forget you we strike when the moment is right not simply because we can stop don't get caught attention the star destroyer tormentor is emerging from hyperspace near the debris field oh no he can't be serious captain amos what is the meaning of this you're letting our enemy escape captain carol i will not show the same mercy fire the missiles we can't lose this convoy titan shoot down the tormentor's missiles captain amos you are compromising a delicate mission delicate this is war snuffing out this new republic is the only mission take out the missiles that colossal idiot convoys alerted to our presence no way we'll track their jump now good shot i see tie fighters out there shattered broken yours i assume every victory has its price we'll take them down fire on my target fire on my that was target that's the last of the missiles amos knows he's wasting his time good work titan rebel transports are headed toward the overseer they'll jump to hyperspace before our iron cannons can engage you must stop them titan titan x-wings on radar titan 3 disable the convoy ships with your ion lasers we'll cover you i [Music] don't stop now i've jammed the radar ships [Music] they're trying see that you do thanks to captain amos physically retrieving the nav data is our last chance at finding project starhawks regroup with the shuttles deploy tactical shields to protect our shuttles good work tactical shield activated titan engages that target imperial might will always prevail i implore you to retreat because you shot down my missiles covered good job fine i washed my hands of this just like that take out the rest of the rebel fighters joining your position attack that target enemy destroyed titan engaged are gone overseer ready to receive shuffle team titan iii keep them safe excellent defense titan the rebels have scrambled another fighter squadron they're truly desperate now we'll finish off their fighters defend the shuttles couldn't have done it without you [Music] fire on my target no trouble here i am fire on my target attack that target deploy shields on the shuttles they can't come this close to the overseer they're jammed lucky i was here [Music] return to the torment to recover its retreat yes ma'am call off your squadron i don't need your help then you're prepared to retreat never you will not survive this assault captain amos watch me captain carol that frigate is coming apart the tormentor is too close amos evasive maneuvers now what are you talking about the frigate is about to explode but what i won he's dead what a waste at least we have what we came for we've recovered the sector coordinates for the starhawk dockyards but the rest of the data banks are empty engineers must have wiped the rest when captain amos blew our cover they were so close deserves to go down with this ship knowing the sector at least narrows our search lyndon can't hide forever titan eliminate the convoy let lyndon know we're coming for him [Music] [Music] hey pal over here hey there you are was looking for you back at the dark yards instead i had to hang out with a bunch of engineers they told me a whole convoy of new engineers got intercepted by the empire no survivors sounds like they had someone on the inside at hosnian prime give them all the details as you can imagine everyone at the dockyard is pretty spooked i got a bizarre game plan for them later to help boost morale gotta do our part right say between us something's up something bigger than missing engineers ain't talking and the boss has been shut up in the briefing room all day i feel like he'd tell us if it was just about the lost engineers this is something else my money's on some kind of unfinished business like a dark secret he left behind when he skipped out on the empire there are not what would i know huh whatever it is it's got to be something he can't fix with a giant battleship why don't you head up to the briefing room the boss might open up to you squadron you're right lyndon my contacts verified your suspicions it's her i knew it could only be teresa carroll her mark is all over these attacks we know her style you do realize there's only one reason she would attack hosni in prime in the engineering convoy she's searching for project starhawk that's why i've already taken steps to stop her before she can find the nadiri dockyards before anyone else gets hurt lyndon what have you done relax otto all i did was center us a message one she can't ignore [Applause] is leading the empire's search for project starhawk she won't stop until it's destroyed so i've initiated a plan i sent a message that we know was intercepted by an imperial listening post hidden near esselus what was the message bait for teresa and now that the imperial post has served its purpose we're ready for part two if we destroy that listening post teresa will think we have something to hide and follow that message to the letter vanguard i want you to take y wings with heavy ordnance to that post in esselus and bomb it to oblivion a corvette will join you to draw imperial fire gunny will support and resupply our bombers these are your targets we've identified the receivers along the hall as weaker areas destroy them all additionally destroy the thermal regulation systems along the exterior trench and any dishes atop the listening post if you pull this off we'll rob the empire of a valuable asset and then teresa will fall right into our trap teresa carroll was my second in command at foster haven she was my protege she's gone from a coruscant street orphan to captaining her own star destroyer the empire gave her everything and she'll do anything to defend it that's why i'm keeping certain details quiet with teresa in the game any leak is a risk just trust me a little longer head to the hangar zorelda should have your ship almost ready i have to say the commander's plan is quite clever all this secrecy and subterfuge it's almost imperial i know the new republic strives to be better than the empire but you must admit their tactics are effective not that we should adopt them of course but this is war sometimes you have to think like your enemy in order to defeat them we're lucky the commander is using his tactical brilliance for our side let's focus on the mission when james talks about carol you can feel it right he must have cared about her greatly to feel such pain i don't think it's a coincidence that the empire sent teresa after james this feels personal they must both be hurting and hurt can so easily turn to hate hate that cannot be healed has no place in the galaxy if fighting it has become the only option so be it are you ready y wings are built to carry bombs and other heavy explosives it makes them slower but they pack a punch against large targets and capital ships you're gonna like that you know how to pick them uh so uh with the empire he's dropping on new republic coms do you think teresa carol overheard everything she only cares about finding her star hawk frisk oh sure sure still better bomb this listing post into oblivion right for the safety of our new battleship and for no other reason vanguard squadron we're closing in on the listening post now excellent upon arrival you should be able to overhear some imperial chatter you can thank arter and his spy network later let's warm up with our corvette it'll run interference during the strike this listening post in the middle of nowhere how'd the boss find this place again he sent a message specifically hoping the empire would intercept it and reveal the outpost they took the bait talk about a long shot no way he could have known that would work les the message he sent seemed so enticing the empire had no choice but to intercept what could be that enticing that's the thing jays won't tell us but it's a seed that will sprout into a trap let's focus on this mission and worry about the details of the trap later you think the empire built this listening post just to help you find the star hawk this one perhaps but it is the last listening post eavesdropping on the galaxy well they do seem hell bent on finding us i bet the empire cannot stand that we're building a new ship out of their old ones there's our listening post i'll jam imperial sensors on approach i love it they'll never see us coming let's make a regret eavesdropping on the new republic huh and just like that we're hidden from imperial sensors follow me five we'll leave the bombing run grace and i will take care of station defenses and starfighter patrols here we go five give them everything you got good you're almost there on my mark it's bombs away on top of the station empire can't call reinforcements without i love it right here and ready to go receiver left let's finish them off blast that part is the broadcast system working oh shoot [Music] those imperials are on their own joining formation nice work pips won't be calling any reinforcements today dropping a resupply now grab these when you need them 105 you really let them have it receivers are done for let's regroup on gunny's position sounds good on our way to you vanguard leader blast that target they're breaking through all right warm up at the edge of the station it's time to take out the thermal systems shoot that watch out behind you they got a the lock systems are located in the trench circling the edge of the station fly into the trench give them hell hit the trench again find your back blow that up i'm taking fire supplies drop it some they're after the thermal system reloading let me reload you're good now is taking heavy fire get in there and help him out five the thermal systems must be overloading get in there and fly carefully time to put your courage to the test vanguard five when you get to the core start dropping bombs and do not stop you won't have much time to get out once the core explodes so be ready to fly fast nice one five go go regroup and prepare for hyperspace jump [Music] our trap is set come on home it's time for the next step all i'm saying is instead of blowing up that listening post we should have commandeered it imagine the kind of fun we could have had messing with the imperials or the credits we could make uh as your squad leader i'm gonna pretend i didn't just hear that come on gunny you telling me the new republic couldn't use more intel and you know war ain't cheap actually that's a good point i guess once you steal a star destroyer everything imperial starts to look tempting you know we used to be rebels we turn into a legit republic and suddenly we all got to stay on the straight and narrow the commander's lining up a trap for teresa carroll that's not enough of a con for you in the old days i tricked her for everything but a pair of boots to stand in but i guess this'll do when he's right he's right now how about we get some actual work done first congratulations because you captured the star destroyer victorium our starhawk prototype has been completed ahead of schedule but the empire does not know that they believe it's still under construction theresa carroll will keep hunting project starhawk until it's destroyed and we've been assigned to stop her so using that decoy message i sent we're going to set up an ambush the false intel stated that you're protecting a shipment of magnetic crystals essential to completing the starhawk with this bait we'll draw teresa and the overseer deep into the xavian abyss a highly volatile area of space here is where we set our trap don't worry about the convoy it's empty and droid piloted however that does mean you'll need to clear any obstructions from its path vanguard i want you to defend that convoy with everything you've got we need to make this look good your destination is this bottleneck there the starhawk will be waiting to disable the overseer and hopefully capture teresa now it might sound simple but nothing is simple in the xavian abyss brace ourselves and starhawks crew more than ready i selected the crew personally based on their expertise and experience they've been training for months that's good i appreciate your support on this general it's a good plan lyndon just be careful i know you have a past with the overseers captain don't let it cloud your judgment one moment general sorry i can't talk right now your squadron is waiting if lyndon's right this plan could knock teresa carroll off our tail sooner the better if you ask me lyndon's convinced himself that he's put us in yeah they can't make him focus on the bigger picture while tarissa's still in it the commander is a smart man but everyone has someone who can push their buttons i wonder if we can push hers too we'll give teresa a harmless convoy to follow play this out and see just how far we can lead her it's all about playing the long game when the empire occupied moncala i learned how to string imperials along if you seem harmless people underestimate you i spent a lot of time around imperials playing the dumb alien a bartender a sweeper someone safe next day the rebellion would know everything i'd overheard it wasn't easy but i learned to stay patient and wait for opportunities remember the xavian abyss is no place for the faint-hearted and teresa knows a few tricks of her own keep your eyes and ears open all right here so the boss wants to pull the old bait and switch on teresa i must be rubbing off on him of course the key to a good con is selling it and going into the xavian abyss well either you're too naive to know better or you think it's worth the risk like say stopping a star hawk from being finished teresa carroll's risking the abyss just for the chance to destroy some magnite crystals ain't she in for a surprise i'm kind of excited to see our starhawk tackle tarisa's flagship all those engineers worked their tails off to get it finished that's one good thing about this new republic we're finally punching at the same weight as the empire one way or another of the xavian abyss they say it swallowed entire fleets without a trace sending our brand new starhawk in there is quite the gamble commander james must have complete faith in its builders and on us of course we'll be the ones making this ruse work after all i took the liberty of studying the starhawks blueprints it's not just another capital ship it's a defense against imperial fleets every spare inch is packed with lasers and munitions but what really caught my eye was the tractor beam if i understood the blueprints the starhawks tractor beam is ten times more powerful than that of a star destroyer it's incredible the magnite crystals they use in the starhawks tractor beam are quite rare i think they salvaged a few from the star destroyer we captured my family spent an exorbitant amount of credit sourcing magnite crystals it's so gratifying to see them go to a good cause let's put our new starhawk through its paces shall we you got your choice of fighters for this mission an x-wing y-wing or a-wing they've all got pros and cons check the schematics and let me know what'll suit you come on as you can see i wasn't exaggerating about the dangers of the xavian abyss yeah look at that lightning and we got word that teresa carroll has taken the bait her flagship overseer is closing in good luck protect that convoy and see you on the other side oh you can feel it right chaos on every side we don't belong here i'd hate to see what does hey what happens once the starhawk disables the overseer the same as the victorium i expect board it lock its systems and take the crew prisoner i don't know grace i can't imagine teresa carroll coming along quietly i hate these clouds who knows what's out there we know what's out there a star destroyer with a captain who wants us dead real helpful thanks kenny the convoy's droid autopilot ain't smart enough to steer through these asteroids then let's blast them a path wait look a star oh what's destroyer of one i'd say it's been here a long while you'd think this would discourage teresa carroll to someone like her that wreckaging a warning it's one more insult [Music] look lively vanguard imperial ships are on radar scouts perfect the boss's plan is working make sure they buy it what now blow that up i caught those ties scanning the convoy do you think they know there's no magnet they're on my tail good looking out blast that target they got a lock good looking out shoot that blow that up excellent shot stay on course apart get them you see that shot we got ties closing on the convoy he must have stopped the ties before they could transmit signal's breaking up let's push on the ambush point is this way ready let's go [Music] there it is the overseer finally we've drawn it in nobody panic this is the plan defend the convoy and keep luring the overseer to the ambush point how could you challenge an imperial star destroyer the overseer is closing in clear those asteroids before we lose the convoy guess terence decided to build this convoy herself [Music] my neck with nowhere to go large fighters more imperial fighters check behind gotta take out those bombers that no empire shoot them [Music] if we can make it to the bottleneck in time we will we just have to push forward shoot that all integrity blast that target the overseer distract is while we charge the tractor bean and stay alive that's the bottleneck the boss mentioned lyndon james to vanguard we have you on radar keep going you're almost in range of fighters one by one should be very distracting this is a futile gesture you have nowhere to go and i have no interest in prisoners the new republic still in the fight do that [Music] ready to trap [Music] to a safe position you brought this on yourself teresa now now the computer had the sector and system we've been looking for we've got them right where we want them oh return to the immediate hyperspace jump we can't jump that fast we could end up in the middle of a star or worse stay and we die for sure move [Music] well we know this star hawk works it tossed the overseer around like a loath rat good lousy imperials deserve payback with interest shall we just build a death star and get it over with oh come on grace we're still the good guys anyhow we won right wherever they jumped no ships coming back from that let's hope so [Music] get a distress call to the nearest imperial station there's an old munitions depot in this system captain run by a colonel grom must be our lucky day make the call this isn't over thank god so you jump to my territory uninvited then demand my supplies colonel growl the starhawk project is within our grasp all i need is repairs and proper munitions no the emperor signed me to this depot i decide how its resources are used as of this moment that includes your star destroyer consider yourself reassigned the overseer was sent on this mission by admiral sloan herself admiral sloan isn't here captain i have rebel gorillas to deal with and now so do you grom out he wants us to fight rebels all right we'll protect his depot and if his munitions get lost in the crossfire well lucky for us regulations specifically forbid this i will not be beaten by vanguard grandstanding imbeciles or anyone else please no judgment he's just fine call in titan squadron [Music] now you
