people on our side danny what's up on the ron there are some things you need to know about yelena she's mad smart computer science major programmer people think she's just a power nerd but when the

people honey big jorge nana's gangs are probably on the ship you're yelena danny right where's my medicine you mean the berthasmets i gave them to the legends no you handed it to some retirees [ __ ] their diapers on top of a mountain what could you possibly want from them we need more than bullets and gerias to take down castillo like it or not yaranos love the legends clara garcia loves her politics good luck getting those abuelos off their asses we could use la morales help you know why clara never told you about us because to her we're just a bunch of kids playing with guns she loves to talk about the future what is her future not ours clara's just a castillo who lost his dick so you have a better plan for yara well it's first politics later you said you needed volunteers had made albanites got to jump on us a couple of hours ago she's holding my people hostage on a cargo ship i'll go alone i don't get it consider us even for the meds save my people and i'll think about it if you want a ride to the ship there's a farmer at carbonell farm he can take you with his chopper just say you're with la morale someone upstairs can tell you how to get there better hurry i don't know how much time we have ah you saving our people right that's the plan i know a farmer with a helicopter who can fly you out to the ship follow me take audi rasool be nice to him don't worry i'm a friend easy you're with libertad i am i think it would be great if we joined forces yeah we've been fighting and we've been winning but admiral benitez will always have more than we do we kill one sword today tomorrow they get replaced with three more and when la morale people die there's no one replacing them on top of that these farmers and the people just trying to survive don't want to fight we need fresh blood real fighters what about getting the legends to join we tried none of those abuelos want to fight i heard a lot of them even support castile you heard wrong well i don't see any abuelos fighting now i'm working on it so how do these farmers get a helicopter they built it from the parts of ones we show down finga these farmers are ones i wasn't done these farmers are 100 on our side the other farmers are not some are some are with castillo you think we can get them on our side we're gonna need them only when we're going to liberate a list maybe when they hear libertad is fighting with us they'll join your good propaganda danny are you going to save those people yelena called do you want to live through that boat let's do this get in i'm the only one who can get this bird off the ground i need to keep this bird in one piece okay okay [Music] my name's donny i'm going to be careful and stay low i'll get you as close as i can where did you learn how to fly i did my basic service as a pilot a couple of years ago i got kicked out for calling the captain i was kicked out of the ground turns out drill sergeants don't like getting punched in the throat good to know i never seen you before when did you join la morale wait i was told you were with la morale i'm doing this rescue as a favor and with libertad what can you tell me about la morale you know that village they call it maltito is that the real name yeah some spaniard named it back in 1490 whatever a couple months ago admiral benitez decided to make it illegal to go to the water and fish the people protested benitez executed half the town so what does la morale do they tracked and killed every last goldado who did the executing and i'm not talking about gary ambush jungle [ __ ] i'm talking about following them to their homes and sneaking their throats while their family is asleep assassin [ __ ] these kids are smart coordinated and cold-blooded sounds like it that shock pass we keep tabs on military convoys passing through them and report them to la morale seems like they run a tight operation these kids are on the ball jelena is more organized than the military somewhere else got out back when admiral panitas started getting rough with our families la who dare to step foot on our lands pretty soon they stopped coming the ship i can't get you any closer this is great amigo good luck saving those people [Music] thank you [Music] you look like a joker they have our people tied up near the front of the boat now okay people in here [Music] is everybody out there moving [Music] yelena i'm on the ship i freed as many as i could hang tight i am i have you right where i want you at this very minute military forces are heading to your position i recommend laying down your weapons and taking one last look at a nation that does not want you instead of peacefully serving yara as outcasts you will die right here right now [Music] hmm [Music] hey where are those elena they're waiting for you to clear the air can somebody tell those planes to hold still [Music] oh reinforcements are on their way or dad bono i should have called earlier oh reinforcements reinforcements [Music] yes [Music] [Music] huh [Music] it's done your people are safe i heard we even for the supplies [ __ ] yeah need me for anything else [ __ ] is getting real we need to rally our people and talk next steps daley gonna grab a ride i'm at a cliff with a road going through it gotta be a good story there enlightenment to go through it random it didn't last long the locals executed him on top of the rock in 1870 they kept the name as a warning to all foreigners lara i've met la morale why didn't you send me to them first last i heard they were a small group always on the age of founding a birth they're doing more fighting than the legends okay but what's your step la hey nice work with that rescue i heard you kicked benitez's ass danny i wish i could have been there but my battlefield is right here watching this goddamn dog i think i want out of this [ __ ] i heard it was someone from libertad to rescue our people really someone from libertad i thought they hated us i heard elena is working with them now i remember when she said she would never team up with libertad what can i say [ __ ] changes hell of a rooster danny what's happening meeting on the mound some of our friends want to quit early okay listen up this isn't worth killing for sure as hell isn't worth dying for we're young we should be out there drinking and [ __ ] and skipping school our parents and grandparents already stole our future why should we give a [ __ ] that's what i used to think and then one day admiral benitez walked into my classroom with a gun she called on your name you came to the front one by one the admiral read their crimes protesting handing out pamphlets liking a clara garcia post fernandez jimenez pena i learned a lesson on my last day at school you can either be on the right side of history or the wrong side of castillo's guns wise words taking new members depends what is there an age limit i will plead for la morale if you take me welcome to the world viejo [Applause] so how do we take out the admiral push-ups ready first step to victory the grand hotel danny that's the key i got a convoy i like to make friends with no we need carlito push-ups never lie you just cut your hand open you sure doing push-ups was such a good idea what can i say your little speech pumps me up see the part where you put the gun to your head and pull the trigger that was crazy i loved it danny needs to take care of our little problem at the hotel well why didn't you say so all we need is carlito and the hotel is as good as ours what we need is to stop benitez as convoy sounds like we're on different pages of the same book doesn't matter which one you read first they all lead to the same end benitez benitez we hit all three and we spread her forces thin make her base more vulnerable and then we strike you remind me of lucky always three moves ahead though she's not big on these machines you mean laptops yeah there's these farmers in sombrero gorge they're super fans of la morale actually they're super fans of me they were part of my fan club when i was on the national team they tipped us off to this special convoy that always rolls through xiao pass we put together a smash and grab attack plan and i told my super fans to sit tight until they hear the word knuckleball nobody knows what this fancy convoy is carrying but we know it's valuable benitez always slams it with crazy security a hundred soldaus danny we need you to hit the convoy i'm sure you can handle this all by yourself but if you want some help my people are pumped and ready to go i'll keep tabs on the convoy and let you know when it's near the pass don't know about you but i [ __ ] love hearing convoys hey danny you recruit those farmers here to hit the pass remember say the word not yet you think i can't do this on my own we need people to feel like they're part of this fight they have the rpgs you need along with other badass [ __ ] and remember there's no i in team but there is an iron win i guess everyone in elastic can go to the beach while you're overthrowing castillo alone i'm kidding so think about recruiting your super fans gracias on ron i think i spotted the convoy they're not even at the past yet you might want to wait until they get there or not hey horse go be nice horse easy you look important drop the coconuts knuckleball is a goal let me finish so yeah pinga i thought this day would never come we need to piss off benitez and spread out her forces music to my ears garria siwa to pass i'll bring the road spikes perfecto don't worry i'm a friend
