[Music] information is the most powerful weapon if it was possible to see into the future you'd know how to win every war before it began global risk had intel the blacklist was mobilizing local insurgents in escargot we needed to find out why they sent us in to extract alexander steiner the blacklist officer in charge cut the head off the snake happy hunting strikes at the base over and out we can possibly guess the scale of what i had no idea what i was walking into okay 30 seconds and go random get out we move fast morales on point hey we want him alive hey man have a little faith oh i got you back you always do south side of the conference room concentrate fire on the north side clear the way mission is [Music] vanguard one take us down okay morales go go go go go oh this is not steiner we got a planet we've got incoming get ready okay [Applause] losing sight relocating right left side [Applause] just grab the cable  busy [Applause] this hotel is getting a review for me the service sucks randall we're about to exit to the left we're sitting down here check it out easy climb nothing about this mission's been easy won't hold him for long [Music] [Applause] i'm fine we're gonna be exposed knew we were coming wait you think we were set up you got another explanation no but come on we need to get to the safe house hey i got you buddy somehow blacklist had known we were coming set a trap for us too many nagging questions meant our heads were not in the game kavanaugh paid the heaviest price i'd never been much of a dreamer and this line of work and active imagination can kill you that's what made this dream so strange too real more than a dream what the hell how did i get home [Music] i was back home my house with my wife evelyn and the kids but everything felt off a skew as if it was somebody else's memory of my home [Music] oh what's happening to [Music] just unpredictable [Music] anybody you just stay over there you [Music] birthday parties going to the pet store [Music] skinnys hurricanes [Music] [Music] we just have to kevin rob they shot you oh i don't what's happening i couldn't save you i'm sorry oh something's wrong what wait that's me oh easy man you're in the safe house where's robin did he i'm sorry man i really am he didn't make it insurgent killed kavanagh snuck up on you i got it more of them came i was lucky to get you out of there i know you guys were close man i'm sorry this puts you in charge just like old times a boss yeah we need to eat that man we can't call the chopper rob kavanaugh had the long range radio christ you sure he's dead no doubt so what do you think we uh make the border on foot we lost kavanaugh getting here we're not gonna make the border what about the comms tower blacklist set up next to the hotel you want to use their gear to call global risk only way to contact our ride we should secure the landing site you take care of the lz and avoid enemy contact if you can stay safe okay randall and i will take care of the comms tower okay oh let's go let's get to that comms tower randall copy not too far plenty of angry rebels between us and it though that's our only shot at calling in that chopper so understood morales will check the evac point hope it's quiet they'll be looking yeah no kidding let's make this quick snatching steiner had become impossible blacklist and every local rebel under their command knew we were here our mission now my responsibility was to get the rest of us out alive hold up control versus chaos global risk versus blacklist as cargio is an unstable region just the sort of place terrorists like blacklist prey on but we didn't know why they were here what their plan was what we'd soon learn through here i'll take point clear somebody's been living here it doesn't look like military but i haven't seen any civilians civilians but it kind of looks like they didn't leave by choice there were reports about people disappearing blacklist what are they not us luckily steiner went to a lot of trouble to set us up he really doesn't want global risk knowing what he's doing here hold on didn't come this way before through here ease up company so so pick a target i'll get the other one i'll be more of them the closer we get i should get on the rooftops he's bought them for you i like it give me a boost one step ladder coming up thanks see if you can take good work these guys are well armed and there's a lot of them building and got a good position up here i don't suppose the place is empty but it'll give you cover from snipers understood move it [Music] entering the building [Music] i see lots of movements it's a goddamn maze in here you've got to work your way down randall i can see the hotel that was close it's that kind of day found the stairs can't find an exit heading into the basement don't get trapped he's randall i can't find a way out look along the walls there might be a gap copy let's see got a tiny window wish me luck suck that cut in ah okay i made it okay the road to the comms tower is blocked the only way through is the hotel the hotel great that worked out for us last time sniper you have to move forward helicopter now this might help my turn can't get to the hotel from here can you see our way through randall let me take a look copy anybody see that global risk guy no he's here gotta take out those snipers first that rifle could if help can't see the move to another window uh don't forget to check your six don't want to get jumped video find a way into the hotel make your way to the ground floor there's a drainage ditch that leads straight to the comms tower be careful believe me i'm not looking for a replay of the last time we were here damn it's blocked can't get through this way randall i can't find a way in i'll check the intel hold on find anything try the stairs of the outside of the hotel go up to go down yeah that makes sense randall there's a monster of a sniper rifle here but it's in pieces that's interesting there's a comms tower getting close gotta get into the ground floor run run get suppressed take it out uh this place isn't any better than the last time we were here it's like cinco de mayo in come here i think i of them where's the exit according to evelyn's intel there should be a door to the lobby another bar yes god [Music] this will create a distraction time to go we had a chance of making it out that was dead how could i go home without him how could i tell my wife his sister that i had let him die i pushed the thought away how's it look out there randall we're i'm almost at the comms tower how's the lz you better be ready to move tower now i can see lots of movement ahead expect company yes god going on okay boys she's ready to haul ass once i make that call the chopper's gonna be here pretty fast copy right on hey boss be careful in there oh yeah yeah i'm just saying that ruckus at the hotel is only gonna distract him for so long well i'm in the elevator it should only take a minute just watch you back i'm at the top locating the cops just got to make that call i was about to see a glimpse of what blacklist was really doing in azcarzia would be the first time i heard the word catalyst and what is this one for will he be another one of your failed guinea pigs fontaine please i have this under control i've never heard that from anyone who wasn't scrambling if you'll excuse us we have work to do just don't make me clean up your mess how would you give me get him in the chair yeah your friend where is he you already killed one of my friend's you're getting out of me is he be polite i assure you rob kevin was quite alive if you cooperate maybe you'll get to see him that's he's not responding well sir yeah enough i don't have the time or the patience for this where is it did you know we were coming where is here piece of increase the dawns then hurt him bad shot just make him talk i need to end this before she uses this as an excuse to shut me down the stuff they'd given me made my mind real but that was nothing compared to the bomb steiner had set off kavanaugh was alive well there you are where did steiner go in the mines checking to see if your friend survived the catalyst the catalyst maybe we start with an eyeball just to establish a baseline the rest is up to you jesus man don't worry don't worry just a little flick go anywhere by yourself oh go on walk away leave my leg alone for a while so i can sneak him out of there oh i got this that's you done think we're clear now how am i gonna get you out of there that's a hell of a token good thinking just stop there you go now get up that's it what'd they give you come on just move hole what's my exit bottom floor i'll walk you through it they got me okay i know i got this moving keep going i'll clear your path where do you think you're going you son of a that's enough out of you thank you again oh randall more of them [Music] more guys at 12 o'clock movement i don't have a line of sight i don't have a line of sight i don't have a shot i repeat i don't have a shot [Applause] uh everything was spinning out of control it felt like the end of the road but it wasn't morales and i had a history of fighting side by side even before we joined global risk he'd have a big part to play in how operation first frost would turn out in the end yeah you think comstar came down on top of yeah yeah i get it i'm close i'll get to the tower see if i can find him what's left sorry guys you're between [Music] so [Music] [Music] let's voice this guy wow uh ah yes randall half the building's gone i'll try and find him help me oh man this ain't good oh sound off i hovered at the edge of consciousness fading out steiner's words of kavanaugh being alive echoing in my head the dream started out the same back home everything felt awry somehow this was not my dream and possibly i was a visitor in someone else's dream kavanagh who was trying to tell me something something vital and urgent what back here digging into my mind [Music] [Music] it doesn't make any sense you have to find me what the hell is that i can't make it out maybe [Music] [Applause] yeah i knew it'd take more than that to kill you paul good to see you randall now can we get the hell out of this god forsaken red infested town change of plans rob's alive ah you were there when he died man no he's alive steiner told me it's diner toy dude he's in the mines we find steiner we find rob this is stupid man we need to call the evac and go we're not calling with that and we're not leaving rob behind that's an order hold on your new sheep to be in charge you want to fight me on this morales come on bro what would you have us do if it were you just walk away so the minds she got ahead we'll take the side route and keep a low profile this was a mining town we headed into the mines where blacklist was hiding their secrets given the scant evidence i had maybe i shouldn't have believed kavanaugh was still alive i didn't care we're going after him and the catalyst somehow they were both tangled up in this mystery close to the mines now home should be a railway bridge leading to them let you know when i see it copy that be careful old signs areas off limits some kind of mining accident plenty of traffic though any sign of insurgents negative whatever happened here it was decades ago nasty gap in the bridge blacklist did they spot you don't think so the railway bridge is broken it's in bad shape but i think i can get across copy we're on the way to the mountain pass but they'll be guarding it gotta go to work [Applause] i'm clear proceeded go quiet ah there's a cliche for you done it [Music] oh more locals oh now until now we've been engaging the local rebels mobilized by blacklist that changed fast when we got closer to the mines what's the situation hold on [Music] so it's deploying blacklist hostile zero dead oh that's another kind of fight put some rounds in the target crosstalk i think i'm clear copy that keep moving the bridge is a wreck rusted out and collapsed and that's the way you're gonna cross there's a train car i can jump on okay i hope you know what you're doing fastest way to the mines [Music] well it's held this long easy go to the oh could have been worse paul made it across okay what's your status in one piece train didn't make it i'd say you got your diversion nice work i'll need to get out of sight asap got eyes on the side now sir it's a total loss no movement return to base we'll send someone down later to collect the bodies on my way they're not looking for me copy find an overwatch position and wait for us steiner had disappeared into the mines if we got to him we'd have a shot at finding kavanaugh finding out what the catalyst was and why it was so important to blacklist what's your situation minimal resistance you got their attention earlier we're staying out of sight it'll be another couple of hours you should be arriving near the train yard we'll find a vantage point up high so randall just an fyi punchy here is walking pretty much normal now he's still dripping though god damn it morales like i don't see you looking at that ain't there i'm combat effective it's not affecting my judgment is he fit to give orders yeah god damn it he's not like unhinged so now that we're done analyzing me we keep going copy you're the boss i'm at the vantage point i can see the mine entrance from here copy that's where we'll find steiner waiting on you randall's diversion had gotten us close to the mine entrance without any resistance but that wouldn't last we had to fight our way through blacklist to get to steiner to reach our goal how do we get in randall can you see your way around these patrols you want that building up the hill the mine entrance is behind it i'll clear out any opposition for you speaking of we got a guy sniper not for long you can't go up ahead coming out of the path another one on the left wait who's left what randall's obviously just asking guys let's proceed whatever they want it kept secret man steiner was arguing with a woman fontaine seems like their operation isn't going according to plan so how's kevin a fit into this we'll find out once we find him he's in that mine morales okay holmes company get ready once i take out the first one the rest will react copy that's all of them you're clear good job we're entering the building see if you can see what's waiting up ahead cubby can't see the area from this position man this place must have a million hiding places how are we supposed to find steiner he's not exactly hiding advise on him as we speak what he's heading for one of the processing buildings up ahead so i guess we'll pay him a visit hey you with me sure we gotta get steiner hey no we you're not in any shape i'll get steiner but they know we're here now you head back give me support if you can okay fine all righty just make sure steiner can still answer questions i'll do my best so what's your plan i got two plan a try to stay quiet get close grab steiner get out and plan b uh wing it i'd prefer plan a but let's be honest we've been on plan b for a while now everything we were after was in the mines blacklist steiner the catalyst and kavanaugh i had no sane reason to trust what kavanagh had said to me in the dream but he talked about a machine blacklist was using to dig into his mind was that the catalyst the way these buildings are laid out you can't just walk up to them you better figure out an alternative route for me right this place is falling apart great that's a lot of heavily armed  between me and there that's the building we're handling about gotta get in there there's no way around these clowns i got this uh seeking cover come back don't lose it now focus oh oh uh on the move you bastards don't give up down ah [Music] covering fire that conveyor over there looks promising heading into the processing building now good you should be able to get to steiner from there trip mine's great gonna have to shoot him hey when all i got's a hammer do we have a fix on steiner's location yet negative i'm relocating just keep going he's close here's hoping this place is a maze but they got rats the size of dogs in here crawling around in the dark dodging trip mines steiner i want to find you and you're gonna pay morales wasn't any happier about the situation than the rest of us less so and he wasn't shy about letting me know but he was following orders regardless always a pro behind the jokes and bravado i didn't know if i was making the right choice but i needed answers maybe that was wrong of me control 2 hasn't checked in the columns are dead ah lay down some fire oh i see the sky bridge what the hell is that thing oh all right well centering in here actually [Music] i'm looking right at him i could wing him too risky i can take him just find me a way to the other side of that electric fence okay the fence the power cables lead to the mine entrance morales i'll have to cut the power i'm sure i'll put my engineer hat on see what i can do i could use some fire support a building next to the crane randall i'm still over here near the crane i'm moving guppy snipers on the rooftop above the mine entrance i need some fire support here right now i ain't cutting copy that hey randall anytime you're ready damn it better be in one piece oh [Music] oh i'm dead [Music] well the power's down stop stop hey this could be a career moment for you holmes i just listen you god damn it guys can't help morales until i stop that gun oh oh oh [Applause] door oh look iff transponders on all of you acquired incoming missile detect repositioning new targets acquired new targets detected incoming missiles detected incoming missile determining light damage to shields airborne threat detected incoming missile detected repositioning airborne threat warning light damage to shields repositioning oh randall am i glad to see you rumors of my demise and all that airborne yeah you know it and i've got steiner you sure it's him this time yeah we got him time to have a little talk thank you for using prowler shutting down okay let's go think you can take me to global risk screw that you're taking me to rob kavanaugh nobody ever listens i guess we're all here to go you got the guy what's the uh what's the sich rob's in the mines this is our guide okay then you're on point randall okay oh so i mean we know this mine's gonna be crawling right here ready to eat a bullet if they start something  if that guy was my boss i might take the shot anyway i think i could live with myself yeah trust me if i was your boss no it's good for you keep your voice down why i thought you're in control hi everyone i'm a hostage now so don't try anything stupid don't try my patience it's obvious you need me alive don't pretend you suddenly drew a pair face it all you stuck with me you need to shut your mouth now let's go [Music] make it easy on both of us steiner don't push me of course who was that woman earlier your boss didn't seem too happy with your performance what now you're quiet you didn't answer my boyfriend what did you take rob in the first place how did you know we were coming what the hell is this all about answer me god damn it there an elevator you'll get your answers soon enough rallies you want to do the honors hey phil this whatever he's leading us to it ain't gonna be no good please let's just get out of here we're not leaving rob morales all right holmes you're completely surrounded stay where you are yeah i took you idiots long enough shut up lady back to hell offer he's dead that's fine by me must be joking you were warned steiner your ends justify the means approach is sloppy and frankly a liability so are you going to kill him or would you like to surrender and let us finish the job we do have you out guns thank you now mr morales morales ain't like i didn't try to see you clear hall you know i needed the money you will deal with our problem weren't you yeah of course i suppose you live with this the same as you did selling out your team no what the hell thank you and now two more whoa hold up lady that ain't the deal steiner is one thing but there's no goddamn way i do this we're operating under changing circumstances we must all adapt yeah adapt to this principles in the face of adversity i can respect that on the other hand a man that gets cold feet when it's time to follow through on the deal [Music] [Music] this wasn't simply a lucid dream or a nostalgic visit home this was an urgent distress call from kavanaugh warning of the present pleading for the future as insane as that sounds i knew it i felt it it grabbed hold and pulled me forward [Music] [Music] i'm seeing things things that can't be real it doesn't make any sense i think it's the future the things that will threaten our families that will threaten the entire world you have to stop this this [Music] future [Music] [Music] [Music] tell me where you are we can't let blacklist have this information it's too dangerous you have no idea what i've seen tell me where you are you have to find me i need to wake up wait ah randall randall come in can you hear me morale has betrayed us fontaine betrayed steiner their deaths brought even more confusion into this already shattered mission randall fell down with me but vanished in kavanaugh he was in this maze somewhere and i needed to get him out what'd you do morales how could you sell us out oh i could feel my mind slipping away dream and reality merging kavanaugh couldn't be here but he was these caves were as deceptive as blacklist itself was kavanaugh a beacon or a trap [Music] oh [Music] get down i got you covered cover me [Music] get closed foreign [Music] kavanaugh you need to hurry rob jesus how deep does this man go the dream that was kavanaugh's urgent message to me fused with my reality these tunnels were driving blacklist soldiers crazy too they did a gas pocket these vents are gonna stay sealed up a lot of pressure in there they don't have to be sealed up forever just long enough for us to finish what we're doing okay let's do this i hate these things blacklist was all over those mines they weren't just conducting an op they'd set up shop down there whatever they were up to it was big this is such a detail down some fire [Music] no way this is up to code my mask i gotta get out of here i'm not gonna make it i need air where's the way out nothing like this i don't want to go like this i can't fit in there i can't fit in there i can't thank god i am [Music] more than any vision that had come before this one felt vital somewhere in this pit of shattered granite blacklist had buried an operation so valuable they needed to hide it from the world at any cost i had to find that right oh can you hear me randall i know where kavanaugh is we have to get him now what are you talking about paul where are you randall randall come in what the hell did blackness dig up down here what the hell oh i'm in freeze stop them gosh fontaine we got one of them at the excavation site orders what don't let him reach the facility kill him understood it's just not your day buddy [Music] oh all right oh you okay still breathing how do i get one i discover later randall had landed above me immediately he got back on mission without so much as a groan by now there up there get him out of the open covering ah oh paul come in can you hear me i'm trying to get to you but these tunnels are taking me in circles damn these tunnels they're missing civilians whatever blacklist needed them for they don't need them anymore that's a lot of dead people good snipe no more russian decisions come on get that set up there hurry up [Music] is moving [Music] oh ah [Music] oh oh can you hear me randall i know where cavanaugh is we have to get him now what are you talking about paul paul where are you randall randall down fontaine we got one of them at the excavation site orders what don't let him reach the facility kill him understood it's just not your day buddy [Music] oh did you get up paul you okay randall yeah hell no but i'm with you flares now can you find your way out of that ah it's that or die down here try to avoid them [Music] [Music] i see what happens here give me your gun what the hell shoot it down shoot yes [Music] oh you've got company i see them oh [Music] on my position coming down paul randle tango down impress the target oh now [Music] need to move to a better position copy rpg you okay [Music] so oh oh cover me reloading [Music] down to pride ran all the gates which is dead i'm in the control proof i can hack it from here give me a minute i can hear more of them get ready once again [Music] hurry up randall need more time oh i feel worse but we're still here boys there that outpost call our birds kavanagh is gonna need immediate evac you sure you want to go it alone i'll be fine [Music] i okay stop [Applause] holy blacklist intelligence have provided us with all the documentation that they have been able to locate which isn't much this project was very deep so what we have is as fragmentary in nature as the original research was rudimentary in practice somehow the original team managed to split the atom with a sledgehammer they got lucky and we are yet to share in that fortune i prefer empirical answers arrived at along a chain of truth steiner just throws lies at us and pulls the handle on the machine in some gamblers hope that the wheels will magically align i have never believed in luck which is maybe why steiner managed to find a compatible test subject through sheer chance circumstance and i after a life of well-regarded signs and standing in an east european mine shaft wondering how to get the bloodstains out of both my clothes and my reputation this is what's coming this is what we'll be up against in ways [Music] this must be it fontaine i wouldn't do that it would be tragically poetic to come all this way simply to watch him die now it's over fonte killing him won't help you do you see that that image the catalyst pulled from kavanaugh's mind is from a war that has not happened yet how valuable would it be to know how to win a war before it even began it's killing him yes but what is war without sacrifice upload complete this is only the beginning of global risks reckoning [Music] ah rob rob wake up man come on buddy oh yeah it's me bird's on the ground time to move you go cover them we've got him let's go [Music] the plan was to not get shot remember yeah next time you're on point whatever advantage those visions of the future brought blacklist was a mystery we were taking home with us too this battle was over but the world is still an open wound we knew somehow we had to deal with these threats on the horizon we just didn't know how dangerously close that horizon was sir you need to check this out fontaine delivered what what is that the future [Music] you
