this will be in my stash when i need it [Music] hey alva i'm in landfall can you meet me here i'll be there as soon as i can hey i'm here i had to sneak past a few machines on the way but i made it all right ready to talk to that diviner yes he's right over there diviner alva what are you doing back in landfall and with the living ancestor we're looking for the at bay research center where leviathan was developed the legacy tells us it's somewhere in the city over mentioned you've been collecting data in the area do you know where it is uh yes i stumbled across it but there was no data there only crumbling ruins tell us anyway we might be able to find something you missed please don't trouble yourself i i assure you our search was very thorough you're hiding something what that that is absurd a diviner must only speak truth as you're well aware oh you're worried you found something dangerous something compromising on eileen sasaki keep your voice down look i get it nyrick you want to make it back to your family so it's safer to turn a blind eye but think of leviathan how it could help everyone isn't that why we're here don't let fear deny us that very well the facilities just south of here along the shore but even if you find a way to fix leviathan it's sure to be shrouded in that which is forbidden too often the truth is forbidden come on let's go a good day there you are did your experience [Music] yeah bad with that diviner back there you've come a long way since we first met and lyrics like i used to be terrified of a misstep and with the overseers he has every right to be but what i've seen and learned since the greenhouse uh it's so much more than what we're permitted diviners are supposed to seek the truth and yet so much is kept from us i'm tired of it that should be the facility ahead we need to find a way in up here well amirik wasn't lying about crumbling ruins at least let's look around uh hey loy why is the ground shaking that's not good whatever it is whoa that that thing is huge we'll have to take it out if we want to find that date uh okay i'm with you yes oh [Music] oh oh this hmm oh and it's exciting oh [Music] oh oh come on come on down it goes well i'm gonna have nightmares tonight we should be able to look around for that data now uh uh hmm [Applause] time for a swim at least the water's not breathing look at this place i always try to imagine what it must have been like when the old ones were here there's less of a climb i bet come on let's check the upper floors you okay on every expedition the soldiers would lay down walkways and barriers first to protect our family but this is actually kind of fun uh [Music] there the console must have been what merrick found let's see if it has anything on leviathan oh the data on leviathan isn't here but there's some kind of log delete the database for miss suzaki when you look at the reports 3 000 exhibiting symptoms over 400 dead the date is clear almorama is contaminating the water supply promoting bacterial growth and with leviathan based on the same architecture you're smart kid top of your class right my father built this company thanks to world-class talent like you and you know what else is world class our legal team so unless you want to spend the rest of your career in some dead end underfunded public research institute you'll delete that database and forward all data on leviathan to my office yes ma'am that was her the ancestor eileen sasaki hundreds dead and she knew their system was to blame but she had the truth erased were all the ancestors like this selfish ruthless immoral and yet we hold them up as paragons of enlightenment and virtue given what we've learned i don't even know if leviathan will work hold on let's not give up just yet you said before that the old ones used leviathan to control flooding which means it probably worked we'll know more when we find the data on it the recording mentioned a copy was sent to eileen's office to their corporate headquarters [Music] there let's go it shouldn't take us long to get to the tower lead on so what was that other system the recording mentioned omuramba the legacy tells us it was the predecessor to leviathan a system that manipulated floods to bring life to a barren desert blind seemed to know a lot about this ancestor diviners spent years trying to figure out how to restore leviathan we found a lot of data on eileen sasaki in the process though entrance is blocked how much of it is you have to find another way in the soldiers built a path on the nearby ruin might be able to cross over from there lead the way yep huh i think this is as far as our soldiers got we'll have to climb higher to get into the tower i'll follow your lead up we go you doing okay oliver yes don't worry about me huh how are we going to get across oh that beam looks promising ah this is a lot higher up than i thought talks we'll only have the element of surprise or we could sneak by and you know not fall off the tower any damage [Music] up this way [Music] uh hey we're really high off the ground you can do it all though okay just don't look down right of course where's the towel super easy you should be able to cross over i'm okay [Music] should be able to make it to the other side [Music] made it okay alva your turn right yeah i'm gonna make sure oliver makes it across can you watch me and make sure i do this right come on oliver you can do it it's okay please don't break [Music] wow that would have been a long way to fall oh door's locked huh this says the code is the month and year the company was founded according to the legacy it was october 2023 got it door should be unlocked now maybe the data on leviathan is in here cost reduction strategy we're talking about people's lives here i did as you asked on omaramba but this is worse relax eileen i've spoken with risk management they're confident the chance of another incident is within acceptable parameters we're moving ahead with leviathan you know dad shortcuts have a way of catching up with you within acceptable parameters or not well one day in the distant future when you're in charge you can run things how you want but until then how about you let me worry about that guess eileen and her father didn't always get along but it seems like covering up omurambo wasn't her idea doesn't matter she still had a part in it well let's keep going her office must be higher up uh dead end there's a ladder in that shaft but it's blocked there's nothing for my pole cast i might be able to pull the rubble out from the other shaft let's see where this leads uh you go on ahead i'll look for a way up that has a lesser chance of falling to my death [Music] okay hey alva yes there's something i don't get you said eileen was the one who built leviathan not her father so what happened i'm not sure the legacy doesn't say either that knowledge is lost or forbidden or maybe we were wrong about that too huh are you doing okay eloy yeah it's just a long way up oh [Music] huh huh [Music] [Music] i know how to get up higher [Music] how about you alva any luck finding a way up not yet well that's done with okay i'm back at the shafts if i blow up that fire green the elevator might fall and open up a path for alva hey uh step away from the shaft whoa oh i can reach the ladder now i'll be right up hey looks like there's another floor above might be eileen's office okay i'll meet you up there but all right alva's on the way let's see what's up here uh another locked door we need to get the passcode these artifacts i i think these were eileen's it's every diviner's dream to discover even one of the ancestors artifacts my focus can show me anything and maybe they'll help with the door it's art i think could it be yes i think this was commissioned in honor of the company's 25th anniversary oh that must be the larsen mccrory award the legacy says eileen won it when she was 40 for her work on leviathan interesting that must be the dragonfly six appei used it in most of their construction projects the dragonfly six was their most successful model huh this looks like some kind of prototype for water purification must be the h2 flow what h2 flow their early inventions had strange names um maybe draw my focus what did you say this was for again the company's 25th anniversary looks like it used to be on the last pedestal all the numbers you mentioned i wonder if they make up the passcode yeah it's worth a try that's it you can almost see the whole city from up here corner office impressive view it must have been eileen's let's see if the data on leviathan is here well it's official eileen sasaki ceo chair and worst daughter in the world security had to escort dad to his vert guess we'll be speaking through lawyers from now on looking down at the world from here it's hard to see the details people become risk factors statistics far too easily rambo was supposed to provide clean water improve lives it was easier to pretend there wasn't a problem easier to believe a lie was truth but i don't want to pretend anymore i will build leviathan right no more shortcuts no more lying just a safe face it won't undo our sins my sense but maybe we can still do some good she overthrew her father and took over the company so that leviathan wouldn't end up killing people that sounded like she regretted covering up omaramba's failure she wasn't perfect not a paragon as the quan believed but not a monster either she tried to make up for her mistakes and now you know the truth and as for the data leviathan yes uh it's here downloading a copy now is something wrong i think i'll stay here a while longer there's a lot more data that i want to look through are you sure you'll be okay on your own down is always easier than up let's speak again when we're back at base okay i'll see you there well after climbing all the way up why not glide down wait you're going to what just thinking about it [Music] this is the outpost is just over there are you ready the rebels aren't going to give up without a fight then we'll have to give them one they didn't stand down when regala was defeated i doubt they'll surrender now what matters is their prisoner nakala maybe she knows where cabo's squad went okay let's head in then [Music] [Music] these holdouts don't give up easily still if i get rid of their leader it might send the others packing [Music] got to keep an eye on i'll find this in my stash later where'd they go let's make it personal make her hey find me where'd they go there you are this is coming with me enough don't want to leave you empty-handed death flies on the wings of the 10. that's a fine weapon [Music] strange planks of wood with nothing on top of it that's all of them our scouts said they saw nakala tied up at a wood post let's look around i should return them to the grove when i get a chance there that's the post oh no nakala obviously but maybe the rebels moved her i can look for tracks there tracks leading away from the post where do they go just enough to bind someone blood and the rebels are nakala dead end no i think there's something under that wood take my hand the color steady now where am i chaplin is that you and with an outlander whoa how'd you end up down there rebels had me strung up they thought i'd give up intel about lowland squad movements by letting me bake in the sun managed to slip my bones and make a run for it they made me pay for that last thing i remember was a crack on the head and the taste of dirt how'd you end up here we're looking for cavo his squad was last spotted leaving this outpost yeah he was here it was his squad that attacked us on the road my comrades got away but i was taken cabo tied me to the post himself if you're looking for him chaplin i'm afraid you'll only find a dead end his loyalties are clear do you know where his squad went i overheard the mention falls edge then we'll we'll pick the search up from there i'll go ahead and meet you at fall's edge southwest of here deca if cavo attacked her squad no he's not lost to us yet we have to find him and turn him from this path okay i'll see you there what about you that wound needs to be looked at it'll scar i just need to rest a bit then i'll report into the grove i'm telling you blood hair the chaplain might not want to hear it but her grandson is a traitor i guess we'll see about that i'm telling the truth listen to him not a chance he's a traitor deca what's going on eloy i'm glad you're here this is a roque leader of falls edge so you've enlisted the chief's champion in your dull-bladed efforts you must be carvo then my grandson and a soldier trying to write his mistakes or trying to lure us into a trap my scouts caught him sneaking around on the outskirts of the village i wasn't sneaking around i was coming to warn you the rebels are planning an attack they're going to send a machine straight through this village i left my post when i realized what they were planning you have to believe me where are the rebels now they were hunting for the machine north of here i i can show you the way the only thing you'll do is face trial by combat you betrayed your clan your chief blood and blades will decide your fate i'll fight whoever you want after we stop the attack why destroy this village regal is defeated the rebellion is over not for some losing regala only gave them one more reason to hate hikaro and hikaro was a lowlander before he was chief unlike the desert and sky clans we've always stood behind him without question falls edge is a strategic midpoint between the grove and our capital on the coast it's true the others hope that by weakening the lowland clan they'll be able to strike back at hikaro you said you defected after you found out about the attack why'd you change your mind when i joined the rebels i thought ragala was going to lead us into battle against our old enemy the karja but all we've done is kill each other and for what pride vengeance so when my squad leader told us about the mission to destroy this village i left my post don't believe his lies anyone who deserved the tribe to join regala knew exactly what they were getting themselves into not everyone if cavo is telling the truth this whole village is in danger we have to find and stop these rebels the rebels built a campfire north of the river near the cliffs i can show you the way from there okay open it up or okay no i won't give him the chance to escape the traitor stays here until his trial by combat then i invoke blood for blood i will take calvo's place until he returns you're making a mistake chaplin the clan needs your guidance not the lies of this bear armed boy the right has been called cava will go with eloy then i'm going to if the boy speaks truth you'll need my blade if he lies i'll run him through i must make arrangements here first then i'll bring the boy to the meeting place fine i'll see you there we walk in strength the campfire that cavall mentioned should be nearby they should be here already someone's waiting ahead but not cabo okay ugh now [Music] [Music] [Music] ah these rebels are waiting to ambush whoever showed up cabo has some explaining to do better wait at the campfire for him okay stuff for the stash found a few of your friends when i got here cavo you're not off to a great start they must have been out on patrol i swear on the 10 i didn't know they'd be here what did i tell you his lies are an open sore better we cauterize it now than let it fester no i'm telling the truth untie him as you say but this is a mistake and my weapon if you think just give it to him or okay we need to get moving lead the way up this way where are you leading us the rebels are stationed at the nearby cliff falls i took this path when i left my post the others won't be expecting anyone to come this way or they are and will be skewered the moment we arrive there's the cliff falls and there's no one there as i suspected let's just keep going i don't like this huh [Music] where is everyone no rebels no machine what did ice over there by the falls blood of the dead if that thing runs through false edge the village stands no chance then we stop them right here on your lead in our way aloy grab your gear we march on falls edge metal on metal we're under attack he left the right tool [Music] oh oh thank you so you don't run out [Music] what mr i will defend the lowland from you we did it you're bleeding i'll be fine what matters is the attack was stopped because of your warning you saved many lives today come on let's get you back to false edge i guess i cracked some ribs too go on ahead i'll see him back to the village okay i'll let deca know what happened one enemy falls eloy i saw your deeds at the grove three leave only you return what happened calvo was telling the truth the rebels had a behemoth cava was injured in the battle but we stopped the attack a rocket regrets that he doubted the boy your grandson proved himself to be honest and brave chaplin he's loyal to the lowland so you'll release him he's earned his freedom but it'll take many more deeds to earn back the rest of the clan's trust i'll do whatever it takes thank you eloy indeed falzadjoe's you a great dad may this begin to repay it thank you as soon as you're healed i have so much to show you welcome back [Music] catch a break from this heat [Music] that must be the entrance to the valley of the fallen marshall vera should be around here somewhere we have to go back you're not going back in you need a medic but ducks you saw what happened as clearly as i did marshally vera i heard you were sent to rescue some tanakh who went into the valley i'm guessing you must be one of them where are the others see they didn't make it i had to fight off several machines just to get kanala out the valley was closed months ago for good reason machines have gathered in number as if they're drawn there by something not to mention the strange glowing lights off the coast the valley is cursed we never should have gone in vivira you were made a martial at the cool route and you were by hikaru's side in the final stand against regala and you're the one who flew on the wings of the ten ended regale's threat in a single combat i was just doing what i could to help in an amazing way and i saw what you did with my own eyes here i thought the cool route was the best day of my life becoming a marshal bearing witness to the vision of unity but you really outdid yourself against regala i have a lot to live up to you said there are strange lights off the coast from an island to the south they appeared one day out of the blue around the same time the machines moved into the valley there have also been reports of a streak of light that rises and falls in the sky above the island i saw it on the fourth night a flame that climbed in the sky until it disappeared among the stars is there any way to get to the island no the currents between the island and the shore are too strong you drown for sure oh it's on an island i wonder if this has something to do with the zeniths don't know what any of that's about but maybe if the valley's been off limits for months why did you go in we wanted to run the trial the valley is a great test for lowland soldiers survive for 10 days and nights take down any machine that stands in the way dax had a plan we'd hunt down each machine one by one until we cleared the valley earned the clan's respect but we got separated from iveka after the third day then machines cut us off from the way out by the time marsha levira found us we were wounded and out of supplies more machines attacked us as we made our escape dax was right behind us but he couldn't run fast enough a lot of machines in one place sounds bad i better look into it see if i can put a stop to it then i'll come with you fight by your side no better let me take a look first trust me it's for the best i guess if you insist once you're in the valley head for the great falls and the cliff south of the metal devil the machines seem attracted to those sights got it thanks we'll rest here a while more than head for the medic and falls edge strike true is the ten aloy ugh glowing lights this must be the zenith base looks like they have a shield around the entire place of course they'd make their base on their own private island hold on beta we're coming for you soon but back to the current problem i've got to check out the areas of viewer mentioned near the big waterfall and south of that horizon ridge [Music] there should be a little around here i might be able to find it in my focus massively much oh [Applause] oh oh [Music] so that should fight circuits a bit there there is clear better take a look at that lure okay let's see if i can turn this thing there's data here looks like a vlog from something called the julius some zenith thing says local vermin exterminated are you attracting machines to kill the troopers here well at least this lures shut down now i should head to the cliff south of the horus there might be another lure there send this to my stash mixed up [Music] [Music] oh oh [Music] so [Music] so huh oh so so [Music] so i can switch it up so without ammo three uh oh [Music] we didn't okay i'll stash this away for later another lure better deal with it all right now to shut this thing down another weird log from the julius this one mentions a third lure close by i better check it out looks like i was right zenith left these things here to draw in machines and protect the approach their base i don't feel like i can before i can shut it off oh so oh first i have to take out the machines then i can override the lore should be able to override the lure now what's an outlander doing all the way out here clearing the valley you must be one of the missing tanakhs everyone thought you were dead nearly dax and canala are they canal is alive marshally vera pulled her out speaking of aloy if ira couldn't stay away could you and miss my chance to hunt with the champion in the valley of the fallen never and i see you found eve now this looks like a fight you with me marshall my plane is yours blood of the ten we get to kill these things what are they ah foreign oh [Music] oh oh relief ugly piece of metal we did it that was amazing i will check on you nearby social media i can send it to my stash gotcha that should be the last one and looks like there's a recording here hey i got a task for you the julius is ready to serve shut up and do what you're told use the indigenous robots to keep this place clear a local vermin so eric left a simple ai in charge of the wars looks like it shut itself down when i overrode the last one hey i got a task for you the julius is ready to serve shut up and do what you're told use the indigenous robots to keep this place clear local vermont i'll do it myself but gerard says i have to stay focused so have some fun for the both of us huh i'll be right back she needs a medic but she'll live thanks to you gotta say every time we meet is the best day ever for fighting that battle was something else and those weird machines do you think there'll be more no i figured out what was causing the machines to gather in the valley and put a stop to it oh good news for the clan then you don't want to fight more of those things avira they're not like other machines the masters they answer to see people as inconveniences they'd kill anyone without a second thought and eventually i'll have to deal with them the lights offshore is that from them yeah it's a kind of shield to protect the island the machines drawn to this valley were meant to kill anyone who got close meaningless slaughter but definitely something for a champion not a marshal here take this then it might help with what lies ahead thank you the valley should be safe enough for a while but you have to tell the rest of the tanakh to stay as far away from that island as possible by the champion's word i hope our paths cross again eloy [Music] this must be the ground made of metal that knocked soldier mentioned looks like a carving door but it's different there's no way to hack it open if i can find some other room i should be able to get data to override some new machines can survive freezing so can i crevice is massive as if the earth split open fast i wonder where this leads this must be the cauldron must have hit here too we're still attacked then i should be able to find data on how to override some new machines here we go okay almost there is that a forge looks like it's making machine parts there she uh uh huh those torches i might be able to climb them to get to the other side gap's too wide i need to find another way across i should be able to climb these hmm huh ah um maybe i can so a guardian of other machines that looks like what so uh so that's what this place is interrupted the process just have to expose the core and get those oh overrides can be good [Music] yep so huh there it goes okay time to get those overrides [Music] should be able to override more machines with this so i can restore it like ayah showed me oh there seems to be a tall neck blocking this platform i'll have to find a different exit looks like there's room underneath the core maybe i can squeeze through does it fall yep [Music] ugh [Music] almost there let's not do that again oh [Music] uh italic's not going anywhere soon these vents should get me across looks like the only way across is up oh that's why the cauldron won't release the tall neck at the core it's missing its head if i can attach it huh what's ah so [Music] oh this should get me no yes [Music] [Music] uh-oh company time to follow up ah oh ugh [Music] my way back good [Music] i think i can hear the head being repaired it's in place that guy's fixed that alarm's keeping it in place maybe if i override the tall neck the shock wave will break it free there goes nothing it worked [Music] it's good to breathe some fresh air again you isn't too bad either [Applause] [Music] [Music] hey uh mr know-it-all is here you know your focus buddy who never smiles i didn't know what to do with him so i had him wait in your room got it thanks [Music] well silence looks like you finally found a door you could open without me i'm glad it's there actually it kept me from having to mingle with the company you keep but enough prattle i believe you owe me an explanation your plans for the zenith base you're right i do owe you my spear in your throat for deceiving me again at the hades proving lab i doubt you asked me here for that kind of reckoning no right now i need your help so i'm giving you one final chance but if you ever betray me again i will kill you no matter what the circumstance understood very well though we'll both face a decidedly short future if you can't get us inside that base hey your other guest is here she's um coming to you thanks good timing the truth is i can't actually get us into the base but she can [Music] the company you keep is even worse than i thought not a fan of surprises are you oh look that must be your little invention does the weapon work without self-destructing of course it does i've eliminated the imperfections and greatly improved its design and output how can we be sure care for a demonstration enough both of you we're in this together at least for now go talk to aaron tell him i said to give you rooms of your own i'll come see you when i get a chance oh no you first better get everyone in the control room so tilda can tell us what she knows about the zenith face you know we've never played machine strikes again oh no i got enough trouble with kotalo always kicking my ass who says i'm getting good at it i'll bet you're a pro did you need something bravo you managed to sway a zenith to your side care to explain not a chance i thought you said the weapon was ready there's always room to optimize but that's not why you're here i assume you want to comprehend my undertakings so ask away since when were you so forthcoming since you turned this into a waiting game and as it seems you have found modest success perhaps i'm willing to be generous [Music] okay so your big plan everything you've been manipulating for the last few months let me see if i got this straight you learned about the zenith from hades when you interrogated it then you came up with a plan to defeat them by using a tanakh army and that weapon and to get the tanakh to fight for you you or rather the sons of prometheus armed regala's rebels with override tech did you have an actual question or are you still playing ketchup so all this time even before i found the coordinates at the spire you were out here scheming why couldn't you just tell me when i learned of the zenith's return to earth i laid out my plans i knew i would one day require an army of overzealous to knock to assault the zenith base the casualties would be extreme and i knew you would never allow such a sacrifice no matter how necessary thus i devised a means to remove your interference from the equation at the hades proving lab you wanted me to surrender to the zenith at the hades proving lab they almost killed me based on everything i knew about them i concluded they would find you a useful asset thereby keeping you out of harm's way and more importantly out of my way so you really didn't know they had their own clone of elizabeth no unfortunately there was no way i could have known that particular detail detail well i guess if it wasn't for that we wouldn't be here today why create the sons of prometheus you didn't need a bunch of awesome tinkerers to make override tech they were a necessary safeguard my time serving hades in the eclipse demonstrated the risks of getting directly involved through the sons of prometheus i could execute my plans all while remaining anonymous tell me about the weapon how does it work i've upgraded the delivery system it now emits a wave like effect covering a significant distance that doesn't fully answer my question no but i'd be a fool to reveal its inner workings after all why did you withhold your plan for dealing with the zenith drones yes even you can appreciate the value of secrecy when warranted suffice it to say that the weapon will work the intricacies of how is knowledge that is mine alone why help regala take over if you wanted an army you could have just gone to hikaro before regala's rebellion hakaro was only concerned with battling machines and fostering friendships with the carja even if i gained his ear he would never agree to send his forces to battle a threat he couldn't understand so helping a blood-thirsty exile was easier yes exceedingly so all regala craved was war against the carja and anyone who threatens the tanakh she would have led the tribe into battle without question which was precisely what i needed while i was out there i had a couple run-ins with the quinn the tribe from across the ocean and their entire tribe was shaped around the discovery of focuses one of them alva even joined me here don't you want to know more about them no they stumbled upon the greatest technological artifact from the ancient world and what did they do with it they shrouded the knowledge they unearthed in mysticism and taboo creating a pantheon out of corporate shills yes well it also led them to thieves did it now so those run-ins with the quinn i mentioned on one of them i teamed up with their expedition to search thieves we found pharaoh at the end you must have needed omega clearance so what was it like worse than you can imagine he single-handedly wiped out collective human knowledge i'm sure it was still less than he deserved let me guess you would have scraped him into a jar so you could prod his brain like what you did with hades for a start all right silence i think i've talked to you long enough i'll let you know when it's time to go and try not to mess with tilda while you're in here okay i don't need the two of you butting heads ah yes about your zenith ally i wonder if you understand what kind of person you're dealing with for someone to live as long as she has outlast as many calamities well your goals may be aligned now but i'd watch for the moment they diverge yeah i'm aware reminds me of someone else i know survival is only a necessity to my greater purpose eloy i hoped you'd recognize that by now do you know something or not well i know a great deal of things but on this you just call it a feeling oh a feeling you mean you finally had one huh guess even you can change silence [Music] so i'm uh gonna clean my gear later i could do yours [Music] [Music] but when it looks impossible look deeper and then fight like you can win i will rest now and always [Music] i used to think no nora would ever accept one before all did even when he was overwhelmed he refused to let me push him away i failed floral a gemini i should have pushed harder i should have done more i'd give anything to have him back with regal out of the way hikaru and tanakh are safe the future's up to them now i do wish they'd drop all the honorary names they've given me but if i've learned anything about them that it's not a battle i am going to win hey aaron yeah i was thinking we could spar for a bit when you have the time oh uh sure yeah of course might be a way to deal with my anger yeah beating the crap out of me makes you feel better i'm all for it eloy it appears that we have some interesting new guests i'm glad to see you're okay though i heard you gave the tanakh something to talk about i was half expecting you to burst in through the ceiling riding a sun wing sorry to disappoint ready to head over to the zenith base whatever comes we will endure thoughts on our new zenith acquaintance i'd say she smells like death but even death smells of something she's more like a cold piece of metal bent on repelling all semblance of life she's definitely different have you talked to any of our new friends aaron and i tried speaking to silence but apparently our tribal prattle is unnecessary charming isn't he i have to go i trust you to keep things civil around here i'll make sure aaron doesn't punch silence in the face if that's what you mean thanks you came back with some interesting friends i wish i could say we don't need them but silence and tilde are here for a reason yeah animated my enemy and all that right right doesn't look like any of our guests are making trouble yet so catala tells me you flew well that's new i've been busting my balls trying to learn to read you're out there having all the fun don't worry you'll be getting all the fun you can handle soon with the zenith looking forward to it i guess silence is keeping to himself as usual i was hoping he'd give me an excuse to hammer his sorry ass to the ground please don't you telling me you wouldn't want to get just one good hit on that smug face of his after everything he's done sure later right now he's got something we need [Music] what's wrong with your shoulder yeah it hurts a little yeah maybe a lot what'd you do well i tried to arm wrestle with catalog yeah maybe that wasn't such a great idea i was just curious to see if that new arm of his was as strong as it looked turns out it really is you uh talk to tildadel i tried i don't think even a hot forge could melt that ice and you say she wants to help i think so well let's hope [Music] i better get going oh you know where to find me [Music] the rebel holdouts can't be allowed to continue their pointless fight [Music] i haven't seen you since the battle at the grove how are you holding up i saw you fly on the wings of the ten and paralyze regala's army with lightning i would say that i am inspired thank you i guess it is i who should be thanking you things will get ugly once the zeniths realize we're in their base you'll need every trick you've ever learned i would have it no other way many soldiers died in the old world to make sure we stood here today we will endure on their behalf though i am curious how you intend to defeat the zenith's defenses without an army of our own leave that to me just make sure you're ready to fight as you say you have more than earned my trust [Music] did you meet tilda there is something about her that doesn't seem natural i wouldn't be surprised if my sword went through her and she didn't bleed at all honestly with her nothing would surprise me anything new going on i should know about the quinn has been more insistent than usual asking about the visions at the grove her pursuit of knowledge is relentless the ten would have a hard time fighting her off just think of her like one of your chaplains yes only more persistent i bet people are curious about that new arm of yours none more than our quinn ally i assure you she couldn't wait to take it apart and figure out how it works i gave her the data i used to build the thing hoping that would satisfy her curiosity instead good luck with that your people keep mentioning the wings of the ten what exactly does it mean the visions tell us that the ten flew on great metal machines with wings and lapped into battle from the sky for us to imitate this feat is the ultimate expression of martial prowess it is why the challengers leap into the arena during the cool route and now you have done it like the deeds of the ten themselves it will never be forgotten so tell me how did it feel i won't lie pretty good i can only imagine i have to go but i'll be briefing everyone on the plan soon understood eloy do you have a moment you you flew cotello told me and took out regala's machines you know what i don't even know why i'm surprised i saw we have visitors and a new weapon does this mean we're ready to take the fight to the zeniths almost oh and i wanted to give you this for helping me get the data on leviathan i didn't really know what to give you so i asked zo what you might like thanks alva oh put it to good use you sure you're okay going on this mission i know things must be happening pretty fast for you yeah i've already braved oceans and mad men who thought they were ancestors reborn why not a few immortals with lethal drones at their command too guess the more the merrier i suppose you saw that tilda's here our very own zenith i almost went up to her to ask her well every question i've ever had about the legacy every diviner i know would kill to get five minutes with one of the old ones but now that she's here all i feel is a vague unease i don't know if i'm scared of finding out more uncomfortable truths or just scared of her probably both i hope our new guests have been behaving the silence he's the one who built the weapon that can take down zenith shields yes though i wouldn't expect him to answer any questions about it he refuses to dole out his secrets to us lesser mortals oh you know that special part of us that makes us warm kind welcoming our spirit yeah he was born without that have you looked through the data we recovered on leviathan there is much to sort through still but i believe we'll be able to get it operational and turn back the floods and i've given more thought to everything we've uncovered about the ancestors the overseers would have us believe they were infallible paragons but farrow wasn't not even close his greed led to machines that devoured the world the archive of the old one's knowledge destroyed just to erase his mistakes so when we learned that eileen had a hand in covering up hundreds of deaths i started to think they were all the same selfish egotistical cruel but in the end it's not that simple the truth isn't a straight line of ink on a crisp scroll it's a splatter smudged and faded on stained parchment i wish more quinn could see that instead of looking the other way or twisting the truth to serve their own schemes i doubt bow high would agree with you no nor the rest of the board of overseers as eileen said it's easier to believe the lie is truth but it's worth fighting for and this diviner at least won't settle for anything less for that i thank you eloy anything new around here kotalo showed me the schematics for his new arm i recall reading about robotic limbs within the legacy but i never thought i'd see one in action technology like that would be treasured back home think of what it could do for injured workers or soldiers but knowing the imperial family they would use it for different purposes their own replacing body parts as they grow older like the zenith exactly i need to wrap up a few things but stay sharp i'll be ready when you call i guess this door is things [Music] hey boy if you were listening to this then um things didn't go as planned at gemini i know you'll keep your promise which means i must be dead well that sounds familiar doesn't it but what's happened since you found me in that ectogenic chamber thank you emily you've been my shelter and i would risk it all again to be by your side i know you'll find a way forward that's what you do [Music] there you are well done haloi despite my reservations you managed to secure silence and his weapon you're truly a shining example of liz's fortitude i've been thinking about what you said at your house how you were friends with elizabeth it was more than that wasn't it perceptive as ever you're right we were together for a time okay so what happened i was an orphan i had always been alone by my 30s i was starting to wonder if that was simply my fate in life and then i met liz i kept running into each other at conferences we'd have coffee at some point it became drinks i thought it was just shop talk an exchange of ideas but then i was surprised at how much i looked forward to seeing her soon we were flying halfway across the world every other week just to meet up for the first time i didn't feel lonely i could imagine a future where i wasn't i think liz felt the same way at first she had lost her mother a few years back i filled a void for her i know i did but as time passed it seemed as though she wanted less when i wanted more and so we ended things so helping me restoring elizabeth's dream it's what a second chance yes i made a mistake leaving earth while this stayed behind i should have done more so when i saw you a woman who has carved her own remarkable path beyond even what made liz a phenomenon i knew i had to help you to do right by her why did you make the data channel look like your house i built that house as a shelter to weather any storm a safe place not just for me but for the art stored in its depths cultural artifacts of incalculable value truly some of the greatest achievements of human civilization and you wanted beta to see them yes her upbringing was so cold and technical i thought if she could experience vermeer and rembrandt it would bring something else into her life a heritage every bit as valuable as the scientific and technical data being drummed into her i'm sorry i had to cut off contact but i'll never regret sharing this house with her she needed its shelter even more than i did you said before that you're not like the other zeniths but you never were but you went along with all of their plans out of necessity i'm not proud of it but complicity became a means of survival both when earth was consumed and when the colony on sirius was destroyed i did what i had to but i resolved to remain one step ahead of the others to try to undo what damage i could hence the data channel with beta the secret passage into their base and the little trick i pulled to save you why do you think elizabeth pulled away i've wondered that for a thousand years she was brilliant visionary she cared so deeply for the world for the betterment of humanity it also felt like she kept everyone at arm's length including me she never wanted to share her burdens i think in the end she had a core that she never let anyone be part of sometimes i wonder if anyone really knew her i found a recording of you and elizabeth back in the proving lab after farzine's attempt to steal gaia yes a most unpleasant conversation she said something after the call i think she regretted how things ended between you did she all this time thank you for telling me i've always hated that those were the last words we ever said to each other and that her last impression of me was as a functionary of far zenith not who i truly am when it's time to break into the zenith base what can we expect i'll go over the full layout once you've assembled your friends suffice it to say we will need to push as fast as possible to beta in gaia's location dealing with heavy resistance along the way there are also printing facilities where the others have been amassing the natural resources they've stripped from the region what for first for use in the base's infrastructure and then to fabricate more specter drones a small army of them when i was out in the wilds i saw a shuttle take off from the island heading for space it was likely ferrying materials to and from our ship in orbit after hundreds of years luxuriating in our digital comforts the ship was barely space worthy when we made our escape disaster can strike at any moment we've learned our lesson have you figured out how silence's weapon works no and he's been very careful not to allow me near it i'll admit it bothers me but regardless of how it functions i am confident it will deactivate the other shields on mass how many of them are in the base 10 including eric and gerard only a handful of us made it to our ship when our colony collapsed so eric was he always a bloodthirsty psychopath i believe he got worse over time on earth he was the founder of a profitable private military company a band of cutthroats in other words even as governments abandoned human combatants in favor of automated warfare he found success with clientele that required a more personal touch there were also rumors that he personally hunted and killed his targets on occasion all for the thrill of it but on sirius he retreated to virtual reality simulations in them he could go on rampages as violent as he pleased though i suspect with diminishing satisfaction all of us tribe believes he was one of the greatest people from the old world then they would be quite disappointed to meet him though i'm sure he'd bask in the adoration what can you tell me about gerard he was the head of the world's largest financial conglomerate and as such had dealings with almost every major corporation it made him one of the wealthiest people on earth and certainly the wealthiest among far zenith what does one person do with that much money buy more more power more influence gerard's always believed himself to be a refined patrician able to maintain control with a polished smile but beneath that exterior is a cold and calculating operator it was his decision to restrict beta's upbringing to her digital educators the avatars of the apollo database while we were painted as her benefactors well we'll deal with him soon enough and the others i would very much like to see his face when he realizes we've beaten him when i was in the ruins of vegas i found data on a man named stanley chen i think he was a zenith stanley ever the optimist he was one of the good ones when we established our colony he built an exact replica of las vegas in virtual reality lights shows gambling every detail perfectly recreated and while others cloistered themselves in their own fantasies he flung his doors wide to everyone the way you're talking about him i'm guessing he didn't make it back to earth no he perished when our colony was destroyed he would have been thrilled to discover that part of his beloved city survived when beta escaped and hid in an ancient research facility i saw another one of the zenith verbena who was she a dull star amidst a sea of brighter constellations unlike most of far zenith's members who amassed their wealth through shrewd business deals and technological achievements verbena inherited her billions her father had achieved great success in the luxury holotourism industry at age 24 she became the world's most eligible bachelorette branding herself a life designer someone who leverages their fame to influence the choice of others what like a cult in a way yes well she must have done something right to have survived this long she was her own brand of ruthless that much is true but even rats can cling to a vessel for escape okay so i've had run-ins with a handful of venus what about the rest an array of the wealthiest people on earth titans of their industries and let me guess all selfish and ruthless to the core most but not all there were a few with whom i got along annika mergani for instance was always delightful she founded the holonet's most successful dance channel and was herself mesmerizing to watch and i had fascinating discussions with song about her work in cellular biology our immortality treatments are due in part to her achievements but then there were others like devin miller the ceo of a fast food printing corporation his only real preoccupations were perfecting his golf swing and taking self hollows when i think about all of us we really should have accomplished more we had eternity okay i'll let you know when it's time i'll be here until then and thank you aloy for giving me this chance my past has always been a struggle more than once i've lost everything but when i look to the future i see liz's dream fulfilled a universe of new possibilities maybe we can make it happen we will i won't let anything get in the way i promise you that okay maybe it's time to get everyone together so tilde can brief us but is there anything i should handle before that [Music] all right people i need you up in the control room right away okay everyone we all know what's at stake beta gaia not to mention life on earth now it might seem like the zeniths are invincible but they're not we've got what it takes to break into their base and defeat them we even have one of them on our side tilda show us the base it is constructed atop the ruins of an ancient military facility on an island to the southwest i can get us inside to this location undetected how exactly you'll know when you need to once inside our goal will be this structure the launch tower gaia and beta are being held at the top but along the way we will face overwhelming resistance most importantly from gerard eric and the others but also once i take away their shields we should be able to deal with them but it will be easier to deploy the device if someone else is carrying it i'll need a strong back carry stuff yeah i can do that even if your device works there will still be specter drones scores of them if only we had an army to fight them i've got that under control you'll know when you need to all right we'll meet up again just before we go in where's the best place to rendezvous on the coast just across from the island once there i'll show you the way [Music] okay i'll let you know when i arrive at the rendezvous point and then you can join me in the meantime do whatever you need to prepare understood you two a minute [Music] tilda helped me get in touch with beta and she told me something important there's an installation inside the base it's called a regulator here once we're inside i need you to split off from everyone else and destroy it so you'll have to bring explosives this will help stop the drones everything depends on it are you with me after that i want you to find a way to infiltrate the zenith network how go over all the data that beta left behind she knew how to do it i'm sure of that all right but why [Music] what am i trying to do find information about zenith anything tilda's not telling us science is right about one thing there's no way we can take her on her word i'll do my best keep her safe okay on my life oh never thought i'd be off on a mission to take down a bunch of immortals from the stars i can hear the drinking songs already oh earlier you mentioned something about tanakh rebels and the asaram but we never really talked about it i'm just saying if you want to discuss it you let me know if that one's not working right you can have one of my spare focuses you know a little bugger's got some personality that's all saved my butt with those spectras wouldn't feel right to leave it behind now you know besides it uh how it goes with my outfit wouldn't want to spoil your look [Music] farro made the right call you know bringing you here thanks yeah varro you know i never knew he had a sister i found out a few days before you guys went to the gemini i was well to be honest i was terrified i'd screw up the mission somehow so he sat me down for a drink just one mind you and we talked about family vala ursa loss and revenge now you helped us you know we never did get that drink you promised back in the embrace and you never told me exactly how your sister escaped the mad sun king i guess we never got around to it world ending and all no time like the present though if you're up for it you think it's time for us to finally have that drink yeah i mean yeah yeah of course [Music] oh so how did ursa escape mad sun king draughn's palace well uh first she had to survive the sun ring see during the war the karja threw a prisoner a day in there you know for what to die as sacrifices fighting machines in a pit thinking somehow that was going to appease all the other deranged machines in the world [Music] and when it was ursa's turn the carja thought she'd go down if they threw a big machine at her oh but she didn't as she defeated all of them even got some of jaron's kestrels for good measure and the mad sun king was impressed i guess thought it'd be funny to have her run around his palace as a servant he enjoyed humiliating her that way i remember you telling me something about that that's how she met avad he helped her escape but but what no carj's scroll will ever tell you is how the young prince snuck ursure out of the palace he knew their best chance was to get ursa to blend in so he got her everything she needed to disguise herself as a cardinal woman now you have perfumes veils and all i get the feeling she wasn't too happy with that oh man ursula would have rather fought her way out of that palace with her bare hands and put on all of that karja eye paints but avod insisted it was the only way so she agreed under one condition a vod had to dress up as well she made a bad dress up like a noble woman as perfumed and powdered as a babe ursus said he looked better like that than he ever did in a crown that would uh definitely make for an interesting sight oh it worked like a charm too not only did they make it out of the palace they paid a traveling merchant to get ursa to the border and none were the wiser ah you were right that was a story bus hold over a drink all good stories are [Music] i guess i should get going i'll see you at the rendezvous point with my hammer ready i wouldn't have it any other way i hope everybody's ready for this fighting the zenith isn't going to be easy hey nothing you do ever is at least now you don't have to do it alone thanks everyone here training working together if it weren't for viral none of it would have happened you know there was this one night right before vara left with you to go to gemini he realized i was having trouble sleeping i was nervous about the mission to be honest i think we both were so he asked me to join him in gaia's dome he brought up this hologram of earth that you two found back in the zenith launch facility we sat there just looking at it i thought about how plain song was just a speck on that great sphere how every corner of it must be teeming with life and any fears i had about our mission were gone i miss him terribly i know you and aaron seem to be on better terms now he may have terrible taste in music but he did apologize for mocking my tribe and that ale he keeps raving about isn't half bad i still plan on beating that stubborn face of his to break our sparring stalemate try not to hurt him too bad i should go i'll let you know when i'm ready to head to the base before you do there is one favor i would ask of you what is it you place this focus in my care and gave me the highest calling an utaru has ever known if i should fall in battle i'd like you to be the one to bury my seat pouch for the both of us so make sure you stay alive to do so let's just try to all come back home okay [Music] you nervous i'd be lying if i said i'm not slightly apprehensive the plan will work if we all focus on our assignments right once all this is over will you go back across the ocean i don't know the more i think about it the more worried i become if i go back i don't even know if they'd let me keep this focus you gave me or what they do to me for reading what is clearly forbidden data even if i somehow were allowed to carry on my duties as a diviner would i be willing to let the truths i've learned about the ancestors be buried away by the board of overseers would i dare challenge them and risk my family's safety or losing federal the rest of us should be enough of a distraction to the zeniths for you to hack into their network undetected but you'll have to be quick in case they do what exactly do you expect me to find aloy i don't know the truth if we're lucky [Music] who's this federa you mentioned she is another diviner one of our best we used to be rivals at the academy i hated her guts but apparently there is a fine line between hate and love we became very close and then i was assigned to the expedition she promised she'd wait for me no matter how long it took well i was smart of her she won't do any better yeah i don't know about that i do i want you to know i'm glad you're with us alva whatever happens i'm grateful that the legacy brought us together i never thought i'd get to actually meet an ancestor come on do i look that old katala will protect you inside the zenith face i'm not afraid i know cattalo will fulfill his duty as will i if we die doing so at least it'll be alongside a friend i'd rather you both stay alive if you don't mind we'll try and keep that in mind i need to get going i'll be at the rendezvous point may truth lead us to victory welcome back aloy would you like to continue our chat i should be going i'll be making final preparations a-lord something else i'll be going as you wish so how are we feeling about the mission i do not know everything that you have planned but it doesn't matter all that remains is to follow you to the end whatever that will be thank you kotolo i'm glad all this brought us together you brought us together and i am grateful too now that training time is over what's on your mind the bulwark the kulrut and how we need another miracle if we're to survive the zenith base i'll try not to let you down i know you will not we didn't really get to talk about what happened at gemini there was nothing more to say if he were to knock varl's bravery would have earned him sacred burial at the grove among the most distinguished of our tribe's warriors his deeds were worthy of the ten when the fight is done i will have the incurs etch his memory on my skin so that it may live on i'm sure he'd be honored i'll see you soon then it will be my honor i see you've got your new arm ready to go yes it still feels strange i've gotten used to the absence but no matter i'm sure i will need it before the attack on the zenith base is through this will break my fall there monday no point i should take care of everything i can before calling in the others to attack the zenith base okay everyone i'm at the rendezvous point it's time to rescue beta and gaia understudy we're on our way where are the others not far behind [Music] egghead here couldn't stand traveling with the pack [Music] are we all here [Music] then let's begin a tunnel an ancient escape route from the ruins on the island when i realized it ran all the way across the water i i thought it might prove useful to come and go undetected so i concealed it from the others [Music] shall we i wish there was a less pungent way to get way inside the base agreed [Music] there's the launch tower that plane offers a little cover so the only viable path is through there there will be specters guarding it and many more can be deployed from those hangers all right alva catalo get to it where are they going somewhere important erin you're with me you guys take the high ground in case we need covering fire tactically sound i suppose what will she do there's a sensor node nearby if i hack into it i should be able to scramble the network and keep you undetected but not for long then we should proceed one more thing open up the channel to beta audio only hey boy we're here and we're coming for you you know what to do right as long as you hold up your end we will see you soon be careful [Music] let's go get to the launch tower as quickly as possible i'll do my best to conceal our intrusion beware specter's ahead [Music] company follow my lead that's what i do i should hit it with plasma i do and that is a good time oh keep them coming don't get that stuff oh over here i think you're right find anything yeah i think there's a cave up there that might get us through that ridge let's climb up to it huh [Music] up [Music] what's in this backpack metal bricks alva and i are closing in on the regulator keep me posted it's creepy don't worry i'll protect you there's a lot of dead machines on this island we killed a great many when we landed here their salvage may prove useful to you now sneak or fight you choose uh it's fallen used as oh look at that thing fizzing away shot i guess better than any of them [Music] tired yet yep yeah clear those weeds we're through it here hello it's not beer but it'll do we can take this one eloy keep moving [Applause] that stormbird carcass should get us over the gap i hate storm birds but i guess that that dead one's handy enough you remember the good old days when our only worry was whether meridian would be destroyed you know instead of a whole world oh yeah good times more spectres i'll attack when you come in [Music] huh here when he won that's the weak spot you need help yeah get the fumes in your eyes let's push on i'll take this one any good look a little here of this rock [Music] we're gonna have to climb around this corner i'm trying not to complain i can see the way forward keep moving not as fast as we can you all right short off you want to target me do ya [Music] how many spectres did the zeniths have well then we want to fight at once i guess we're not going for stealth and that's a good time looks like the others have things under control come on up the slab do it blow the regulator a moment will i ignite the charges i think we're in trouble whatever you plan to do to stop those specters you better do it now i'm not doing anything beta will she just needs a little time time [Music] what is that our army i think you got their attention very clever you had beta inject hyvestis into the base's printer matrix which is faster and more powerful than any cauldron and now we can crank our machines to its heart's content [Music] come on let's get to the launch tower before this whole place becomes a war zone your maneuver as clever as it is means that if skipped containment it will no doubt feed back to the cauldron network we grabbed it once we'll get it again in case we don't make i just have one regret what is it we had to do all this climbing but a big rock might give us a bridge to get up and through gotcha plasma will do a lot of damage here hit it again hey lloyd now you can hurt it hey you want to fight the vanguard smack take this and take him down another i think they can handle it use ass corroded wow this way big jump to the right i think and now to the left you can get to the launch tower through the hanger up ahead i'm heading over to join you now the hanger's in bad shape but i can see the way in hurry here we go bottoms up oh they spelled that one hey boy can you hit this thing with acid that's the quick way to take it down good work everyone let's go over here this way whoa look at all this scenic space stuff this place is gonna come down around our ears hold the moon guy who doesn't have to carry much they'll come folks hey lloyd it's been intense but catalog got me to a network node i'm trying to get in keep at it we're almost to the tower [Music] ah now we know who's been causing all the fuss tilda's little pet silence zenith inbound can we drop their shields please i'm powering it up stay still this is pointless you can't hurt us face it your worms that ooze to the cracks into our basement silence one moment more but i might just spare you if you give up tilda i think it's safe to say she's forfeited her share of our operation permanently uh there [Music] no nothing fine all right people light them up [Music] are we supposed to be scared [Music] ugh we can't let gerard escape it won't take long before he preps the shuttle for launch then he'll be able to take beta and gaia into orbit and on to the odyssey beyond our reach we got to go through there i failed to see another option then we'll carve a path ready get to the top and secure gaia i'll stop gerard ugh [Music] i gotta get to the top of the tower and free beta ah apologies time that we're okay as long as all the hurries i'm almost into the network just do the best you can okay an elevator promising [Music] we got some unfinished business little girl [Music] yes i don't need a shield to take you out trust me you're gonna wish you had one give it a break [Music] i'm taking you down about that didn't you [Music] [Music] take that come here he's almost done come on now ah don't like that do you i almost forgot what it was like to hurt [Music] right [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay i will be in time go rescue your sister i'll regroup with the others and make sure they're all right looks like the machine's inspectors have almost wiped each other out what was that a gerard just activated the self-destruct fail-safe on the printing matrix he's taking control of a number of systems including the lift i'm afraid so he's restricted its axis to the top he'll have to climb from there i have to go i almost had [Music] aaron is everyone all right down there mostly we're cleaning up the last few spectres what about the zenith dead i think i zo told me you got eric good work yeah thanks i guess only tilden gerard are left then hey you there listen i got into the network but only for a minute before i was shut out i found a bunch of flight plans and trajectories as if the zeniths were planning to leave earth it doesn't make any sense i know but there's more the files i found have a lot of references to something called nemesis whatever it is the zeniths are afraid of it alba alba what's going on here maybe beta can help me figure it out she's okay uh huh almost there [Music] this is it [Music] are you okay look i know you've been through a lot but you have to help me access the zenith network i need to see their files anything referring to the word nemesis okay over there [Music] are down all over the base i should be able to take advantage of yes nemesis healing there's something in deep space it's following the scenes to earth look escape vectors all that tried to warn me about this the zeniths aren't planning to stay here it's a machine of some kind or a swarm of them the energy readings are astronomical hey i don't think a natural disaster destroyed the zenith colony on sirius this thing did earth isn't a new home for them it's a weigh station [Music] they're on the run i see you've been busy and you've been lying nemesis what is it it is us the minds of far zenith or failed copies of them anyway back on sirius some of my peers weren't satisfied with physical immortality they wanted digital transcendence a way to upload their minds into any form organic or mechanical nemesis was a failed experiment to that effect abandoned but never erased an immense database of our memories emotions and prejudices left to fester and it destroyed your colony we didn't realize it gained sentience until it broke containment it had everything it needed from our memories security protocols system specs override codes it hacked everything before we knew what hit us then it took over our printing facilities allowing it to gain any machine form it needed to wipe us out but why imagine being trapped alone for decades with only the twisted echoes of megalomaniacs for company it hates us for abandoning it to that prison and now that it's free it will do anything to destroy us including denying us a safe harbor on earth the extinction signal that will catey's you didn't send it nemesis did finally you understand and when that failed it launched from sirius to finish the job itself which is why we must flee to a random planet circling a random star somewhere it can never find us with gaia so you can build yourself a new world that's the plan even now earth is finished nemesis will scour it of life to deny its creators a viable home but elizabeth's dream won't die you'll come with me to the stars and with gaia we'll create a new world together where that monstrosity could never find us what no i loved elizabeth more than you could ever know and i let her stay behind to die with the rest of humanity a mistake i have regretted for a thousand years now she stands before me again not some inferior copy but her best possible self so i'm not asking you're coming with me it may seem harsh now but you'll forgive me in a few centuries you can't force me tilde your shield is gone i have something better spectre prime to me [Music] take cover get to the door i've heard that before and stones against [Music] lightning i better scan that thing first i could use it ask yourself why you're holding back uh oh that thing's fast this factor was designed to survive against more than that i need to get my stamina back first i can endure you cannot [Applause] [Applause] sticks and stones against the light taking me tilde plus it's something you must submit ah [Music] [Music] i am the only [Music] a few more hits elemental ammo is making a dent in the cold place ask yourself why you're holding back uh [Applause] it's over just let me choose [Music] she tried to take you and she told you about nemesis so you've known all along [Music] from hades yes along with data on how to circumvent the zenith shields everything i did to create the rebel army was based on that knowledge to reach this place this moment and you couldn't just tell me come now eloy you're the last person to act sensibly in the face of impossible odds when i learned of nemesis from hades i saw the pieces on the board and how to play them and in that same moment i knew it was a game you would never play the deal would interfere and attempt to save the tanakh i was correct to a point you ruined my plans but brought your own to fruition the end result is the same we're here and now it's time for me to leave this doomed planet behind to seize the odyssey in the apollo database and begin a new chapter in my pursuit of knowledge one with infinite possibilities you can join me if you so desire you've more than earned your place unlike tilde i'm extending a polite invitation you're going to just take off and abandon everything [Music] stay help me fight that thing perhaps tilde didn't adequately define the threat nemesis can't be stopped it destroyed a highly advanced zenith colony in a matter of hours what hope does this primitive tribal earth have if you brought gaia you wouldn't be abandoning life you'd be saving a seed for a new world just as elizabeth did it's the choice she made the

battle ahead elizabeth [Music] very different than the one you fought [Music] not about the distant hope of creating a new world it's about preserving the one we have my friends have a new mission to spread the word and ask for help they've taken its stride i think it's because they've always known what i've only just started to understand that the people of this world have the strength to fight any battle [Music] the ingenuity to solve any problem courage to overcome any obstacle and the resilience to rise after any setback as for me i can't say i'm not afraid [Music] what lies ahead will be
