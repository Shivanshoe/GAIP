[Music] um no sign of life out there general sensors are in place you'll know if anything comes around i know it's cold out but princess leia is very concerned about master luke's whereabouts exactly we need to find captain sarah and tell him that master luke has yet to return if captain solo isn't in the hangar then he must be in the command center now follow me [Music] this better be important me and chewie are getting out of here soon excuse me sir princess leia is wondering about master luke he hasn't come back yet he might have forgotten to check in not likely are the speeders ready uh not yet we're having some trouble adapting them to the cold so we'll have to go out on tontons those signal towers if we recalibrate them we can boost luke's comlink signal and triangulate his location if you say so general let's go many creatures graded small reside in these planes some friendly like our tauntauns here and some not so friendly oh great did you at least check the area for the not-so-friendly ones when you arrived we were as thorough as we could be in conditions like this fantastic i lose an arm i'm blaming you hey you think we could get this thing working again those cannons could be useful scout joints great we can't let them leave the surface now things are starting to heat up well okay wait for it [Music] [Music] it couldn't just be easy could it you gotta melt that ice you don't say yes [Music] we need to get to the top to recalibrate it uh come on huh [Laughter] that wasn't my stomach by the way stay vigilant that's one down but the signal still too weak let's find some more towers we're recalibrating the signal towers the old outpost there should be a signal tower in there thanks rican keep warm gee thanks princess don't worry it's easy to get the cold shoulder out here oh so you think you're a comedian huh give me a break [Music] huh [Applause] let me guess we need to find a way to get across this broken walkway right [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] what's up [Music] hey that doesn't belong to you now play nice and hand it over huh [Music] now we can get the power back online and climb this tower hmm it actually looks pretty high from down here i'll be a gentleman and let you climb up this one uh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] what is that a womp and our reason to be hasty all right now let's get the last one luke's still out there somewhere i don't have time to talk about dinner right now chewie i'm freezing out here hey not all of us are covered in fur you know you finished work on the falcon he hung up on me how come you guys haven't defrosted these already in these conditions it'll be about as fruitful as herding rathtars club huh huh huh huh [Music] that's all the towers up and running and it looks like they've already triangulated luke's position and what are we waiting for let's go find him before the weather gets worse uh [Applause] [Music] luke luke huh from yoda the jedi master who instructed me ben and luke man ben fully functional again thanks well your worship looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer i don't know where you get your delusions laser brain laugh it up buzz paul princess we have a visitor an imperial probe droid i didn't hit it that hard it must have had a self-destruct general there's a fleet of star destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four prepare for ground assault i'll be nice this time i even have new hints for you you heard him r2 the empire's coming let's get a snow speeder ready and head out there hmm not in great condition we can fix it right r2 all troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance the heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded only two fighter escorts per ship the energy shield can only be open for a short time so you'll have to stay very close to your transports two fighters against a star destroyer the ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path when you've gotten past the energy shield proceed directly to the rendezvous point understood good luck great that's the engine fix well we'll need a new wing if we're gonna fly out of here good we did it time to get out there r2 oh we have spotted imperial walkers uh go go go it's really heating up out there still feels pretty cool to me stop those atsgs we need that power generator fully functional to power the v150 planet defender it's the only weapon we have powerful enough to hit that approaching star destroyer gotcha great work rogue squadron luke you have to stop those at80s the base can't take much more no i will be able to save us don't worry that's it right boys so keep going luke [Music] good job luke you did it i'm glad that's over luke do you copy it's getting bad here and we got three more at-80s heading our way you have to bring them down think you spoke too soon get ready we might actually survive this don't

going prepare to make the jump to light speed they're getting closer oh yeah watch this i noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged it is impossible to go to lightroom great we can still outmaneuver them all right chewie you ready hold on let's get bumpy see i'll get us out of this no problem there's still more tie fighters on our tails but less than there was before i call that progress i don't want to be here all day we need to escape these star destroyers oh no need to stop them from tracking us so we have to shoot out their radar dishes and their turrets those things have quite the range trust me regular laser cannons won't put a dent in them you'll need to hit them with a proton torpedo my senses detect that we have taken severe damage what gave you that idea hey fly boy wanna start concentrating you two give me a break oh [Music] [Applause] asteroids chewing set 271 you're not actually going into an asteroid field they'd be crazy to follow us wouldn't they
