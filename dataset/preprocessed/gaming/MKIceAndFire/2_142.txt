hair you were on the verge of turning but uv light and inhibitors pulled you back the bat helped too of course you're alive let's keep it that way guy almost kills us all and you're chatting him up girls relax they're frightened you almost destroyed our workshop we need to move out can you walk but i i don't understand where are we going to a safe place i got to get to the fish eye the fish eye without the biomarker you won't get near it what the hell is that biomarker monitors the disease's progression in the dark that's your ticket into the city without it stepping out of the light is sort of a lottery you don't know when you turn you need a biomarker and i know where to find one come on he's turning again relax everything's under control it'll be fine hey you're weak take a minute drink seriously what next maybe we should draw him a bath sounds pretty cozy to me ladies maybe next time get banned no she adores me why are you helping me let's get to know each other and find out you go first where'd you get all those new business you're careful good you live longer are you a real pilgrim or did you steal that badge i was a pilgrim an hour to dusk i'm serious heck on he's not staying the night here here your weapon on your radio not even a pilgrim could get by without that come on let's go that's a nice place don't get comfortable we don't need another roommate especially one that could rob us while sleeping not every pilgrim is a criminal you know uh-huh you have a nice workshop here assembling uv lamps huh yeah you shouldn't be here pecan's risking our asses can't you see the door maybe i can help i'm sorry i guess i scared you huh felt better after i hit you or even yana aidan what is this place our home our workshop our whole world you might say you're nicer than she is hey back off sarah doesn't trust anyone but me besides i'm a better fighter than she is so i can afford to be more open [Music] you got a thick skull usually when i whack someone they don't get up [Music] not bad where's the fisheye the canteen is there in the center past the chemical dumps ah i need to get there too bad only way to go is through the tunnel they protect it like a portal to the [ __ ] valhalla they are impossible to get through [Music] well can you help me you seem to be familiar with the city i've lived in this city since before the world got [ __ ] up i could help you but you need a biomarker you won't get far without it where are you from pretty far i guess about 2 000 kilometers oh [ __ ] how the heck did you not get infected that's easy didn't let him bite me here it's different here we're all infected heard of haran they isolated velador too they built walls they locked us in turned out to be the thing that saved us and how do you get a biomarker uh you can't get them unless you know the right people and i do let's go by the way i'm hakon i'm aiden nice to meet you aiden [Music] welcome to paradise [Music] oh you do know the moves i was in the military special unit for seven years i even liked it except when i didn't for insubordination got blacklisted and they zeroed my bank account ended up driving a cab ouch now the mighty have fallen [ __ ] you at least i got to know my way around the city oh come on you're too weak without an inhibitor you won't last why didn't i smash everything in sight last time you gave it to me that was just the first time but then it gets better if you survive of course catch you're telling me i could have died if i hadn't given it to you you would have died anyway so why are you helping me i know people are generally scared of you guys but one pilgrim saved my life i was a pilgrim now i'm infected it'll be much harder to travel and welcome to your new beginning my friend check out this place they're like treasure chests usually got good stuff in him check it out i'll wait people hide a lot of things in places like this in case someone can't make it back to a shelter before dark what's that crystals someone must have stashed them here they formed after the chemicals were dumped on us some believe they delay infection folk superstition so you don't collect them sure i do superstitious people pay a fortune for them and i'm always happy to take someone's cash there's one specific chest i'm after come on let me show you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] come on come on stop so you have an army here the peacekeepers they treat people like that too watch out for them they got the tunnel you want to go through tell me more about them they consider themselves righteous protectors they are good at killing infected so you got to give them credit for that yeah pretty efficient killers yeah but their righteousness comes with a price always remember this you either play by their rules or you're [ __ ] their protection of the bazaar is more like an occupation on the trail i met a lot of tough guys who talked about the new order and always seemed like the same old [ __ ] to me yeah it's like that here too and the pks are getting worse i'll proceed with caution good though it might not help the pk are a pain seriously riling up the bazaar folks the bazaar is a box of dynamite one spark away from blowing up hey are we going you uh wanted to show me something sure follow me [Music] uh [Music] almost there i hope there are no surprises [Music] it's getting dark they are about to wake up quickly open the chest in return we'll get your biomarker [ __ ] thieves wait no no no leave it mess up that lock and everything's [ __ ] anyway enough for a biomarker where'd you get that i've been all over the city more than most but even i haven't seen working gre equipment for years i can't say much but a former gre scientist dylan gave it to me a guy named waltz killed him and before he died dylan gave me the key to keep it from waltz contains important information apparently i hope to find out more at the fisheye we'll have to see won't we [ __ ] me we took too long plan me run like hello [Applause] we can make it follow me quick [Music] they're close go on [Music] over there do all the light can you hear that we're almost there a bit further [Music] open up hello stand in the light come on open up now i got a howler's coming biomarkers there's no time we've got the holland on our asses biomarkers did you hear behind us i said biomarkers here and his he's with me i have to see his bio well it's just inside the door at least i need to see his body how about some electronics huh [ __ ] open up [Applause] piece [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they almost got us don't look back run faster there's more it's me open up we're friends here huh keep them busy killian [ __ ] you gideon come on killian jump over my body this morning i get killed [Applause] [ __ ] there's a lot of i doubt we're done trouble loves company get us in there i'm crying kill him [Music] [Applause] yes [Applause] is that all of them i think so help me [Music] oh we're so [ __ ] [Music] oh god damn it gillian should have waited a while longer almost did didn't want to clean your guts off my doorstep in the morning they've left soaking you oh come on stop being such a bastard already look at this where did you that's rare invite us in or it'll get even more rare and who is this i'm a pilgrim haven't been here long have you how did you get into town i'll tell you everything just let us in i waited for a pilgrim once he was supposed to oh forget it doesn't matter anymore what are you up to hack on her i gave him an inhibitor survived are you mad he needs a biomarker don't have one [ __ ] seriously [ __ ] the hospital then i was hoping to avoid it always looking for an easy way huh i don't i just need a uv lamp i'll come back for you hold tight hack on why are you helping him huh remember when we used to help people me sure but i doubt you do stay here and rest by the lamp don't listen to that thomas idiot we used to help people remember sure and remember your [ __ ] a [ __ ] cabbie and a mother of mercy everyone around you said that's what you should do cook life would have been easier no night runners no haircuts no problems but no you wanted something else higher [ __ ] causes and you could just cook biomarkers why are they so hard to get because they're complicated devices hell the factories that made them have been out of commission for years biomarkers are keyed to blood they can't be reused after someone syncs with it without them the infection runs unchecked like what's happened to you that's why people pay a fortune to get a new one all the money and crystals they have fortunately me and hackon found a place where they can still be made what's wrong with hakkon giving me inhibitors kills most people in seconds it's a powerful drug most can't handle it but i survived i said most so don't get excited just be careful with them you would hack on you know each other long too long what did he mean when he said that you used to help people we served together in a special ah doesn't matter ancient history where can i rest so you just got into town what brought you here this ain't the promised land far from it i need to get to the fish eye and help when you get there you seem like a good kid but take my advice don't go dolin out trust like penny candy hell how do you know you can trust me okay enough jabber go to sleep nothing to be done till morning anyway [Laughter] [Music] yeah very funny did you make it almost biomarkers are at the gre hospital i'll be there shortly but to get the job done i need you to join me where should i go with killian's door to your back you'll be pointing right at it hold the line keep to the roofs because if the howler spot you yeah i know don't want to go up against any of those anytime soon once i was taking my second wife to the hospital never drove that fast in my life her waters broke three months early you have kids there was no saving that one and other than that none that i know of sorry it's fine what normal person would want his kids to see a world like this the lock is broken don't worry find the old bus the bus at zero hour a bus crashed into the hospital broke through the wall you can use it to get inside since no one could get in there's a good chance there'll be some markers left um dude i'm at the main entrance i marked a safe route for you i'm waiting by the lobby hey this way big building huh gre took over quite a few of these for drug research when it all got [ __ ] they grabbed research volunteers but they paid them loads of money what was the result a lot of [ __ ] just a little more we don't have much time stay close to me i don't you know how to open locks sure turn the key what if you don't have a key i can't i've traveled thousands of kilometers you think doors are a problem for me okay just checking i think this room should have all the instruments you need maestro i found some scrap you can make lockpicks out of that ah good work [Music] um you didn't lie you know your stuff i had no other choice was forced to know my stuff [Music] oh what the hell um that won't work let's go this way dark zone in front of us keep quiet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] eddie mia eddie where are you that's a bad idea mia if it was a good one it wouldn't be fun what are you doing [Music] yeah not on the wall stop talking and give me your hand [Music] aiden everything okay yeah are you sure talk to me this hospital i've been in one like this before a gre facility where there are a few of them around the city i'm having these these memories the person i'm looking for is mia she's my sister i told you about waltz before mention something yeah i don't know it's all mixed up in my head you suppress the memory like i did of my third wife look i'm sure the infection ain't helping chin up we'll find the marker and clear out let's go yeah thanks so uh uh sleeping berries yeah we have to walk past them if you crouch and move slowly they shouldn't notice you get too close and you're done for you probably know that already i do yeah uh uh what is that chemicals nasty [ __ ] when they lost control of the virus the gre started spraying the whole city with that filth worked out great fun [Music] [Music] so this guy you told me about what was his name waltz yes why did you mention him because i remember he was doing some kind of experiment he wasn't the only one doing them there were more cities like villadore with walls cut off from the rest of the world many people were working toward a vaccine eden but the world is full of [ __ ] all right be careful it's not stable come on you alive i guess so can you climb up sure give me a sec hurry we're running out of time i can't make it wait i've got an idea remember the cocktail i served you earlier at the girls workshop enablers exactly you fell to the first floor there's some gre storage down there look for white green crates inhibitors should be inside if you take another dose you should get your strength back [Music] i know i've seen this [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i ran off try to go around it somehow [Music] foreign [Music] hmm aidan hurry if that infection finds you your day quick this way to the kitchen all the ice cream they hid from us i'm scared mia yeah me too and i'm younger don't be a chicken lady what if the doctor sees us he won't besides you'd have to catch us too come on don't back out now [Music] don't be a chicken lady [Music] [Music] [Music] so oh i took the inhibitor um [Music] [Music] hello hi god [Music] hurry i found the markers [Music] [Music] oh are you in one piece you were gone a while how are you feeling i'm infected but good to go yeah that's great sorry about this what i'm sorry about

would you do without me pilgrim i never wanted to become a pilgrim i just sort of fell into him i run the country for another reason entirely i'm looking for my sister and then what then what will you do once you find your sister i'll find some place for us to live you know someplace quiet gotta settle down somewhere now that i'm infected where will you go any place is better than this city come on

out in the open what do you think we cover each other's asses how does that sound [Music] okay let's do it awesome deal you won't regret this hayden i promise as for your goal here's the situation around here after the pk commander was murdered they blocked the route to the center they're trying to keep the killer from escaping to get to fisheye we have to outsmart them but i know when they

the roof bet you i can get there before you unless you're afraid of losing wouldn't blame you if you were slowpoke not sure i could use some extra cash that's the spirit slowpoke ready to show me what you got first run through the old gre dark zone and reach the roof follow the sign what what sign [Music] [Music] ready for this choke on this [ __ ] so uh hmm god [Music] jeez what took you so long slowpoke how did you do that i jumped to the side wall pulled myself up the gutter but hey why should i tell you trade secrets wait till the next leg of the race that's where the rubber really meets the road hey what meets what i okay clearly you need a moment to rest take some time and when you're ready meet me on the roof of the building across from the old military base on mill street [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um he gave me [Music] one thing [Music] is you see that piece of [ __ ] here [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] alive uh the winds blowing from the east that's a bad [Music] [Music] hey watch where you're going what a day no freaking way i can do it five years of running and all for nothing for me i just have to get it right this time it's easy enough what's the problem hey aren't you the pilgrim they wanted to hang man you were in luck there i could use some of that luck i'm alberto's apprentice not for long probably it's the third time i'm taking a shot at this test if i fail again craft master alberto is gonna kick me out hey what's a craft master you're not from around here right craft masters are people who invent new technology design innovations all sorts of gadgets that might help in combat alberto's the grand master around here like i said i'm his apprentice people laugh at him that he's slow and not very eloquent but he's a real freaking genius [Music] what's this test about i have to design something useful for the citizens i already invented underwater reading glasses for alberto then a retractable dog leash but he kept jamming and besides we have no dogs here all my dears are worthless now is my last chance to prove that i am not ruthless so i spent the last several weeks walking around the bazaar and thinking thinking hard and then i hit it our goats they're kept in cages because they eat crops but life in cages makes them sad and they give less milk so i came up with the idea of a fence energized with just a tiny bit of voltage that would keep the goats under control but let them produce more milk i called this invention the electric fence [Music] so what seems to be the problem with this invention of yours i'm missing a few parts and they're not that easy to get i'm worried i won't be ready on time maybe you could help me if you find them for me i'll give you one of my super cool inventions nothing to do with goats i hope nah something much more interesting you'll see i just need some electric parts i'll dismantle them for resistors and other useful things as far as i know they can be found in two places one's an old hardware store on fitzwilliam place near the water tower alberto says they'll be there for sure but it's a dark place full of turned creatures you have to go there at night and the other option whatever is left of military patrols i know of one place south of horseshoe near the old electrical substation bandits roam in the area so it's possible there's nothing left there in which case you'll have to look for other patrol remains or take a night trip to the store [Music] looks like you're in luck after all i have the parts you need on me are you serious that's just fantastic heaven must have sent you here i don't know how to thank you one more thing could you help me set up my show my installation's right outside the main entrance turn it on please i'll go get alberto wait till he sees it meet me by the goat pen then near the wall [Music] man i'm so thirsty [Music] what are you up to these days aidan hey back up [Music] [Music] barney said hey hangman how's the neck who's barney everyone knows barney here i don't tell me well i wouldn't bother yourself about barney he doesn't like nosy people liable to piss him off if he finds out and you don't want that kind of trouble but now i definitely want to know more okay he's sophie's younger brother some say he's crazy but he's a pillar of the bizarre the pks are afraid of them and they should be barney is no one to [ __ ] with [Music] find something you like in the bazaar [Music] don't recognize me or are you allergic to making money listen pilgrim we can make it killing you and me you just need to get me some beets radishes parsnips there he is grab him ed he's a murderer what julian luke's been poisoned from the water you sold him bevin says what but i don't sell water liar luke told me he got it from you whatever's in it has him ranting and raving now you're sure he didn't blame me after he started renting [Music] but wait a minute do you have proof of course the water came in a bottle luke got that water in one of your bottles when i tell carl about this you'll hang bevin wait i swear i don't even sell water damn it if you're lying julian you're [ __ ] toast you haven't seen my kids so then if you're not selling water how'd someone get a hold of one of your bottles knowing that [ __ ] had luke he probably stole it that would be like him even if he did my water's pure as melded snowflakes so maybe it's revenge for what everyone loves me never had an enemy in my life wait a second wait [ __ ] except maybe marco that bastard come to think of it he's got an axe to grind for me it was a long time ago never mind listen he lives above an old shop on the west end of villadore on hamfield lane i traded him a few kilos of my finest flower for the water prove he poisoned it and half my flower is yours can you do that for me i guess i could check it out and there's one more thing i'm a little embarrassed hands might also have a bottle of this water i thought you weren't selling it i'm not accepting well to hands and can you go warn him he's also on hand filled a few buildings down something's fishy about this julian look you better be telling the truth otherwise it'll be hard to help you since the chemical bombings almost killed everyone in the city i swear to god you know how i cope with all of this i have a secret garden you're a pilgrim aren't you that's right do you hang people for that too i just wanted to say that i was rooting for you uh-huh thanks for standing up for me what but i didn't ah i get it sarcasm look it's not that easy to go against the crowd sure i know people are scared of pilgrims sometimes but [ __ ] you survived outside the walls it had to be some i wonder what the hell is going on in the center since pk's restricted access some say the renegades are about to attack no need to be shy people seem to like him [Music] did lucas have enemies he was a pk commander what do you think what if there's nothing to it and this is just some random killing a little what do you want to do the worst thing was they took all the equipment can you hear yourself at all maybe there's a way to fix this be respectful you can fix it by figuring out how you're gonna pay me back and quick then you wonder where all the guns went right looking at all the dead people that says here they're missing same difference they never find them anyway yeah then why the board it's been 15 years many people disappeared back then my neighbor lost his two kids but life goes on except nobody has the courage to take those photographs down but it's hopeless since there are no night runners the search always ends the same those night runners tell me about them what's there to say nearly all of them are dead when they were around they were the only ones not afraid to go out at night they rescued those who didn't manage to get to a shelter but of the entire group only a few survived including frank their former commander once upon a time he was great now he drinks himself into a stupor at his place in the central loop hard to see how much longer he'll be around when did all this happen a long time ago looking at you you are still a kid yourself once upon a time i came across two of them two girls they were five or six years old and it looked like they hadn't eaten for a month what were their names i don't remember i threw them some old bread and took off because they were shaking as if they were about to turn red eyes swollen veins i don't know what they were giving them there those psychos from the gre where are all these kids at now after all those years most of them are probably dead if someone got luckier and is still wandering around they will probably be in the central loop more peacekeepers there easier to survive someone must know more why the past is the past and there's no point in dredging it back up everyone has their own problems here and now pilgrim everyone fights for themselves [Music] water runs out we're all gonna be [ __ ] [Music] yeah the guy you almost got hanged why worry you're standing here aren't you excuse me look we had no choice if you had turned like we thought you were gonna it would have been a massacre a crowd of people against one infected odds were in your favor huh i see you already got a marker more time you spend here more you'll understand our rules are strict but that's how we survive sure haven't seen my kids in months because of this ridiculous blockade at the center got a gig as a finisher tomorrow someone's gotta take my hand says viral spit cures pimples i'd rather perennials would be better how do i start those would be less complicated think you'll make it to next season i'll be fine you know sometimes i wonder what we did wrong have you seen a ginger i'm not doing that much better everything all right no it's grilled the goat is grilled i'm such an idiot what happened i must have over calculated the voltage see he's useless i'm sorry i don't know how i could get it so wrong i told you it would be a waste of time why i don't think so this is very very that it has big huge you're saying it has potential potential yes it could be an effective weapon a weapon it's already formula if you just use it on a weapon it could raise your odds against turned creatures the brave goat gave its life to science there's dinner for everyone and you i take you as uh and pronounce you uh uh a uh craft master really oh my gosh thank you thank you we'll talk later come vincenzo i can't thank you enough here take this if it's not strong enough come around to my craftmaster workshop sure thanks just uh watch yourself out there okay no worries friend months because of this ridiculous blockade of the center [Music] not too bad [Music] hey kid you know some old world folks recorded audio time capsules when they realized the [ __ ] was gonna hit the fan gotta look inside buildings to find them though [Music] hey there rehearsing for the big night where did you come from handsome i heard you uh singing don't lie to lola sweet cheeks bet you thought someone was strangling a cat not at all i i see this neck you shouldn't be able to usually it's wrapped in the softest most rare of mink stoles lola was the grand dame of the bizarre but until reunited with her beloved mink stole she is unfit to perform but how will lola dazzle anyone without her beloved mink stole without it i can't hit the high notes then you don't see minks scampering about everywhere do you oh where is it earlier a strong gust of wind ripped it from lola's tender throat and carried it away i saw it flapping from the scaffolding near the gre quarantine at the intersection of market and horseshoe lola is powerless to retrieve it well i could would you lola could return to the bazaar to entertain not frighten children like a lurking screamer well we can't have that no indeed thank you my knight and shining whatever it is that you're wearing i shall await you at the bazaar hurry my fans await aydah how's it been kid cause it tastes for city life yet i've been here and there you know the best part is always happening in the center and that's where we're going i have a plan for how to get there i'll tell you everything on the spot meet me on the roof near the main metro station saute the the mushrooms [Music] to deal with [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's nice to have a safe spot in the middle of this chaos [Applause] it tells me that they're lying let's try again later i told you [Music] inhibitor container nearby uh uh [Music] inhibitor container um [Applause] [Music] sometimes i venture out at street level just to look at the shocks and signs from before the fall i don't know why you're a better climber than one crazy girl i used to know she was something she even wanted to climb the tallest building in the city the vnc tower was she one of your wives almost too hot tempered even for my tastes what about this passage to the center right look from this roof you can clearly see the peacekeeper's base so the pk run the city they sure think they do that's what they need the uniforms and ranks for they tattoo them they're [ __ ] obsessed with hierarchy but they don't control the city at least not all of it who controls the rest the colonel the renegades well you won't meet them here for now you brought me here to take a look at the peacekeepers the pk are your ticket to the center i told you the only way to get there is through the metro tunnels i'll go inside and draw their attention away from the platform then you enter the metro technical station there's an airlock there we'll take it together to the central loop we can't just ask them to let me through no chance right now each new face they see belongs to a suspect in their commander's murder they know me i trade with them sometimes i deliver lamps from the girls or goods from dark zones there might be a few infected there nothing a pilgrim can't handle though when you get to the main station let me know now you better get some sleep you'll head out at night when there's less infected in the tunnels [Music] um extremely fast probably a bolter you can find some interesting stuff on them but catching one requires serious hunting skills now is not the best time for this eden head for the tunnels [Music] protect our crops from the winter cold you heard the people say the night brothers are back [Music] don't you have things to do move along please [Music] [Music] ugh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh so [Music] uh hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] i'm in the tunnel okay now watch out for the infected there might be a few or a few dozen i'm already in the pk base i'll throw a uv flare through the vent and you'll see how to get to the main station [Music] um [Music] [Music] uh uh [Music] oh [Music] uh uh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] the heck out i got to the flare look around the technical tunnel to the main station should be well-lit i've already lured the guards upstairs i'll chat them up while you get inside oh [ __ ] situation here back on yes [Music] [Applause] hmm [Music] in three days [Music] i'll give you two packs never mind bye [Music] back out i'm inside five packs think about it and i'll be right back i'm on the platform open the airlock i'll be there on a second [Music] hey what you doing here where did he come from he was wandering through the tunnels [ __ ] bizarre riffraff more like a renegade spy doesn't look like a renegade uh he's awake what were you doing at our base i'm only trying to get to the city center the center the tunnel's going to be closed until you hand over lucas's killers bizarre scum how is it that you lost all nothing heard nothing and you managed to forget about the ban on passage maybe we'll start punishing you by cutting off your hands that would improve your memory huh what were you doing four days ago i'm a pilgrim four days ago i was a hundred kilometers away enough anderson we need the truth and you won't get it through coercion but commander lucas is dead and now i'm in command you've read the reports a pilgrim appeared in the bazaar yesterday looks like he's not lying leave her sergeant i want to talk to him alone [Music] where did you come from from crossdale river that's over 1500 kilometers from here it's actually more than 2 000. the freeway bridge has collapsed there are no straight paths and you've managed to make it so far away impressive what's it like out there these days [Music] when was the last time you were out of the city about 15 years ago then there are that many fewer survivors and that many more infected stands to reason most people endure living in this hell hole because what's out there has got to be so much worse my wife and i lived in england i had two sisters two brothers haven't heard from them for 10 years where did they live in and around london from what i've been told london doesn't exist there may be four settlements left on the entire island [ __ ] hell why would anyone think i killed your commander you tried to escape to the central loop four days after the murder besides if i were carl i'd hire a stranger to kill lucas too the cleanest way well i don't know who carl is you'll find out soon enough carl keeps both hands on the steering wheel he's a faux sanctimonious prick who's turning the entire bazaar against us even though we protect them [Music] what's it like outside the walls you never know where danger's gonna come from always new territories new threats and you came here to take shelter i came here because i'm looking for someone and a lot of people are said to have survived in villadore you're looking for someone hmm maybe i can help you but not for free i'm used to trading what do you need no nonsense that's good the tunnel will be closed until i find our commander's murderer commander lucas his body was found in the bazaar horribly mutilated the people of the bazaar aren't making this easy they're proud and loyal they refuse to turn anyone in but command has lost his patience i have orders from the top pilgrim if the inhabitants of old vilador continue to revolt our army will come here and burn the bazaar to the ground now i'd rather avoid that and what do you need from me lucas had a weapon a rare set of brass knuckles called the lazarus this is the key to finding the killer if you learn anything about the lazarus tell me and i will most certainly return the favor it's worth a lot and we didn't find it on his body i think someone from the bazaar may have appropriated it and why should i work with you you attacked me and accused me of murder with no proof whatsoever a mistake you're clearly not the murderer why can't you investigate on your own i hardly know anyone here that's exactly why you can help me nobody will talk to us to them we're occupiers the fact that we clear the streets of the infected and catch criminals doesn't matter what matters is that we eat their food and drink their water but you you're a pilgrim there are many ways you can help people and you're from the outside they can trust you they tried to kill me no look we are your only chance if you want to get to the center that is [Music] [Music] so if i find that weapon you'll let me through to the center it's not that easy vilador suffered much first it was isolated from the outside world because of infection then the walls became its salvation the people here learned not to trust easily i won't open the passage until i've caught the killer but if you can find the lazarus i'll remember that you'll be the first one through once justice is done sounds as if i have no other choice i'll try look around ask people and don't come back empty-handed good luck i haven't seen a uniform like yours before i'm a carrier a carrier what's that i belong to the carrier's guild i'm one of many if there's so many of you why haven't i seen your uniform before we're discreet we're entrusted with valuable information and therefore keep a low profile now your profile isn't so low right now indeed our headquarters are located in the center and the only passage right now goes through the subway tunnels peacekeepers control the passage and aren't letting anyone in or out of the center right now until they do i'm stranded that sucks especially since i'm in need of some information i can't help you we have a strict code of confidentiality only our guild master would be authorized to share information and then he's the one i should talk to any other ways i can get into the center not that i'm aware of on the surface the border of the center is a no man's land it was devastated in a chemical attack cutting this district off from the center the air and ground are poison only the most freakish of monsters can survive there damn well i'll have to find a way somehow good luck hey hack on are you there hey then buddy it's good you're alive yeah i got caught and questioned good i didn't kill you meet me outside these are peacekeeper premises [Music] do you have alcohol if you're lucky like me found this bottle in a basement while on patrol i say you got patrols covering the whole area someone's got to do it city's got us to think that it's even still standing what you want to join us what i need to do complete the training hard as [ __ ] not everyone can hack it don't need weak links you know there's something in the air hey man where could i get some food in the canteen we have a canteen and a hospital in our base like in the army not like in the army this is the army we're bringing order to this [ __ ] chaos and who are you no one in particular doesn't matter it always matters i'm someone other than i was a [ __ ] philosopher go to carl he likes that kind of [ __ ] [Music] you must help us otherwise there will be a rebellion help us in the investigation we'll help you with the bandits i told you already nobody in the bazaar had anything to do with lucas's death then why won't you let us search your homes huh if everyone is so innocent then there'd be nothing to hide keep your brutes away from our homes anderson so you're hiding someone time is running out carl you don't hand over the killer we'll raise your precious bazaar to the ground so the wind and reap the whirlwind anderson don't bite off more than you can chew old man hey then come on i'm on the roof next to the metro so come on tell me all about it [Music] so what did they want from you if you've been there like you said you'd be i'm oh oh i did my best i didn't know there was anyone else in the tunnel lucas's death is a big deal they love this [ __ ] like a father atro doesn't have lucas's charisma he's going to have problems ater said he might let me through to the center if i help him what what are you supposed to help him with he wants me to find lucas's weapon the lazarus went missing from the crime scene he believes finding it will help find the killer the lazarus huh fancy set of brass knuckles right i know a guy who trades stolen goods and other [ __ ] he gets from thieves offense part-time fence full-time scammer and heartless one too he's got half the city after him for death right now if anyone in villadore is fooled enough to buy a peacekeeper weapon it would be him what's his name hubert kobazos also known as half-ass huby every day he sets up shop in the nearby windmill and waits for customers probably selling booze and weed to the pk's if you want to find the lazarus talk with you be i'll chase down some of the leads okay let's keep in touch [Music] [Music] um [Music] okay um ugh uh [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh you hubert no not me i'm waiting for hubie too so get in line got it no one will be here maybe in an hour maybe two you never know with old half-assed that said he's got the best moonshine so worth the wait um nothing to do but wait i guess hey you hubert who's asking a customer i want to buy something hey you're that stranger they wanted to hang aren't you hey hubie you got a special customer it's that pilgrim from the bazaar wait i just want to buy something so that was huby wasn't it yep apparently had an urgent appointment with another customer yeah sure uh he's running away nah sounds like you be oh what do you think i see him running to the northeast [Music] faster aiden you almost got him [Music] don't like to look at that [Music] he's climbing to the roof can you hack it take him down you [ __ ] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] yeah baby [Music] so um [Music] find him [Music] hubert i just want to talk leave me alone i ain't done anything don't hurt me i don't know anything about what i haven't asked you anything yet i don't know anything about anything i swear i'm told that you're a fence hm offense no way a reseller maybe but i'm looking for the lazarus yeah i used to belong to lucas the late pk commander don't try to tell me you don't know who lucas is well then i won't know anything about the lazarus are you kidding me even if i'd been offered those brass knuckles i would have refused i'm not an idiot that weapon is way too hot why did you run away from me because every five minutes someone's coming after me man okay i may have given people a reason to be mad but i'll make things right soon eventually maybe how did you know that lazarus is a set of brass knuckles hmm i didn't say that come on everyone knew about lucas's little love glove he was always showing it off if anyone thought i had him they might also think i killed lucas which is [ __ ] but someone tried to sell it to you right i told you i okay fine maybe someone did but i can't say who client confidentiality stop [ __ ] around tell me or her name is maya i met her in the tenement building at meet packing square near the old butcher shop but i don't know anything else

pk weapon to hubert yeah but the jerk didn't want it got all freaked out and chased me away how did you get a hold of a peacekeeper weapon we all found it was wandering around with these punks and ran across a corpse happens a lot he was totally dead we searched him and i take the brass husa watsits cause i figured someone would pay a pretty penny for him maya i need that weapon it's very important you expect me to just hand that brass hoosie what's it over are you nuts the whoosie what's-it's real name is the lazarus and it belonged to an important pk we might have a war if i don't return it you could help us find a murderer okay i'll give you this stupid thing but for 500 that's a lot of money kid of course it is life's damn expensive i have to buy water and a marker for my brother he's

has returned i hope not empty-handed i found the lazarus i'll be damned i was right that you could open doors we couldn't where's the [ __ ] who adam in meat packing square you didn't let him go did you i could have been the murderer a girl had him she's 10 or something she didn't kill him just looted the corpse stop we'll get back to this later leave us [Music] looks like a constellation on your arm those are ranked tattoos when we ran low on resources tattoos eventually replaced medals they show our hierarchy like in prison prison or military is all the same there's always a pecking order [Music] i did what you wanted it's your turn get me to the center opening the tunnel to the central loop is beyond my pay grade pilgrim command wants me to find the killer ater you promised cool down pilgrim i keep my promises first take this token of gratitude ater i have to get to the center get it you're looking for someone right i want to go to the central loop too my wife and kids are there and i can't protect them when i'm stuck here the tunnel will open when i find the killer is that clear you can help me or you can wait until i find him myself i see traces of blood on the lazarus's blades lucas managed to wound his killer before he died bastard's got to have a nasty gash if you find him you'll not only help me you'll be helping yourself okay do you have any suspects the commander was murdered in the bazaar there had to be someone from there [Music] the people of the bazaar are simple folk why would they risk defying you and that's why i want to discover the truth before the orders come down to use force besides appearances can be deceiving they want to get rid of us they think anarchy is the key to building a new world well there is plenty of anarchy these days carl is a faux pious hustler who brainwashes others with slick speeches he says everyone's equal but it's [ __ ] you can't be a leader and an equal at the same time i'll try to find lucas's killer splendid that's your ticket to the center head back to the bazaar is there anything else i should know before i go yes as a matter of fact but this is totally hush-hush word of this cannot get out sounds serious whoever killed lucas took a little trophy carved his tattoo right out of his bloody arm they cut into his corpse that is seriously [ __ ] up yeah seriously men found out lucas was desecrated like that they'd lose their [ __ ] and it would be total war i'm telling you this because if you find that little trophy then you found the sick [ __ ] who killed lucas got it i'll head out right now you found a lead i didn't steal a knife worried about me are you of course i have high hopes for you aiden meet me outside hey ater got a minute you telling me you've already figured out who the murderer is not yet but i have other questions just be quick about it do you know anything about a man named walt a long time ago when i was a soldier patrolling the streets of the central loop i ran into a renegade squad i was alone scared but i stood my ground they almost killed me but their leader stepped in told him to stop he looked me in the eye and he said why is such a brave soldier on matt's leash and not mine when you wise up come to williams's stronghold he gathered his squad and then they were gone it wasn't until later that i found out it might have been waltz he wanted to recruit me you mentioned you wanted to go back to the central loop because of your family yeah they're everything to me you know since lucas's case got stuck i've been wondering is it possible that my obsession with getting promoted taking more missions that i neglected my family ah never mind almost everyone under my command has someone in the central loop everyone wants to go back there was commander lucas a good leader too good sometimes i even wish he wasn't so competent what do you mean you know he's a tough act to follow you might have heard that not all of my men value me but once we find the body everything will change i'll regain their trust we gotta start rationing the water should have done this weeks ago summed him up right there i think imagine peter wants me to find lucas's murderer only then will he help me get to the center not doing his dirty work well that's no surprise he told me to start with the bizarre figures pk and the bazaar really hate each other only two people matter at the bazaar one is that overblown preacher carl i know that who else is there sophie his right hand she has a way with the bazaar's more rebellious souls helps him keep control there's also dodger a local gangster he knows what's going on and about the bandits led by joe but they're afraid of the pk okay i'll talk to sophie and you look into carl unless you prefer the girl sophie she's not really my type you know and headstrong she's you'll know the squad see my back [Music] you
