[Music] this can't be happening he was absorbed it's over now no it might not be huh doesn't something seem a little odd to you when he absorbed someone before not only did his power increase but his appearance changed but now something's different he hasn't changed at all what does this mean it's possible vegeta was absorbed by majin buu on purpose well isn't he a crafty one [Music] to commemorate my newfound dominance i'll destroy this planet [Applause] look something's happening i knew it i knew it he went into boo to find a way to save his friends [Music] [Applause] what [Music] this can't be happening [Music] there he is what are you doing [Music] he's returning to his previous forms what what in the world [Applause] [Music] [Music] we did it everyone's back to normal we need to hide them boo still hasn't noticed us yet [Music] all right i'm heading back to where boo is [Music] right all right gohan and the others should be okay now who still isn't budging i guess we better keep a close eye on him hey something's happening to buu [Music] wait a sec vegeta is it just me or is his energy increasing [Music] [Music] [Music] it's not possible he's reverting back [Music] reverting back what do you mean the majin buu that bibbidi created was evil incarnate something even he himself couldn't control it wasn't until the mild-mannered grand supreme kai was absorbed that bibbidi could finally control him so what you're saying is this little boo now is even more of a handful than what we've been dealing with yes absorbing others had a dampening effect on him but now now his evil is unrestrained he's lost all self-control and is again pure evil what is that [Music] what's he doing [Music] whoa unbelievable that was close he tried to blow the whole planet to pieces dang that little bastard hey boo go ahead and destroy the planet if you want but you'll have to go through us first [Music] there's no way we can knock that thing back [Music] the others vegeta over here no use we're not gonna make it i can't use instant transmission fast enough [Music] [Music] well done you made it yeah we did but gohan and the others and earth [Music] you takarat what the hell have you done why did you bring these fools instead what about earth it's gone i'm afraid nothing but space debris now earth's gone what are you talking about we're standing on it wait yeah i know what's going on this is all a dream yeah it's just a dream it kakarot gohan and the others are all dead because you decided to save this dumbass instead and now earth and everyone on it can't be brought back the dragon balls the only safety net we had are gone what dragon balls why in the world were there dragon balls on earth those are forbidden powerful objects entrusted to only the namekians no one else should possess them that's right if we head to new namek the new grand elder should be able to give us access to the new dragon balls there we can do it we can bring back earth and all those killed by boo with planet namek back i should be able to teleport between here and other planets with no problem all right now we're talking ah take a look majin buu's returning to his original shape [Applause] here give your potara to goku and vegeta they should be able to beat him if they fuse again uh we don't need those huh yeah that type of fusion technique really isn't for us i want to fight him on my own anyway besides he's not relying on anyone else's power anymore that's what i like to hear kakarot you're finally talking like a saiyan [Music] how the hell did he get here whoa i can't believe this he saw my instant transmission before and copied it well whatever that saves us some trouble we'll just end this here then get out of here find some faraway planet and take everyone with you okay right then i guess we don't have much of a choice a no mind to this world of ours go all out and show that monster what for good luck oh no i forgot to bring that satan fella with us forget about him for now all right who's going first let's find out rock paper paper scissors yes i win at least i'll finally be able to see this super saiyan 3 of yours yeah let's do this boo hmm hey he's sleeping are you little are you messing with me [Music] here goes [Music] he's messing with me [Music] yes [Music] you gotta be kidding me this guy's a real goofball [Music] [Music] hey [Music] yes [Music] you gotta be kidding me [Music] yes [Music] [Music] you gotta be kidding me [Music] [Music] lend me your energy [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] i might not be able to pull this off [Music] it's not over yet [Applause] [Music] you gotta be kidding me [Music] disgusting [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's gonna be kidding me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] kakarot you really are something else i think i finally figured it out i think i know why a genius like me can't keep up with you i thought it was because you had people you wanted to protect it was as if having a strong desire to save others gave you some mysterious power [Music] and maybe it does in some way i too have those i care about now but you're always different you don't fight to win you fight to continue pushing yourself past your own limits that's why you never took the lives of your opponents you you even had the opportunity to kill me but you didn't you didn't damn you kakarot i can't believe a battle-loving kind-hearted saiyan like you even exists you're in trouble now boo here comes [Music] only you can do this you are number one so give me a break already this guy never gets tired does he kakarot forget about me and just finish him off yeah i'm trying but i can't i'm gonna need another minute to charge up my energy if i'm gonna beat him one minute huh i'll hold him off for one minute you hurry up and charge your power i'm gonna need that whole minute you know just hurry up and do it yeah i got it super-sized spirit bomb [Music] are you sure though you're already dead you do know what happens when a dead person dies again don't you they disappear from this world and other world you cease to exist don't die on me vegeta mind your own business [Music] all right let's go [Music] damn you prepare yourself prepare yourself [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] prepare yourself aah damn it i still don't have enough energy i need more to beat fool i can no longer stand idly by let this continue the great mr satan world's martial arts champion will put you in your place yeah that's the stuff it's a shame this isn't real but man i nailed it i know it's a dream but it sure doesn't feel like one hey it's boo [Music] what in the world is going on the larger majin buu developed a strong friendship with mr satan [Music] that boo must have objected to harming mr satan and prevented the attack [Music] that explains why he spit him out then but to be honest losing that satan fellow in this fight wouldn't really change things indeed [Music] who hate you you bully satan [Music] do you have enough energy now or what no come on no no i'm actually losing power [Music] no way you complete idiot you were supposed to restore your energy not revert back to normal man this sucks this was a lot easier back when i was dead [Music] guess it's safe to say super saiyan 3 really drains all your strength when you're alive [Music] it looks like we're completely screwed there's nothing else i can do here supreme kai's dende you can see what's going on here can't you can you hear me if you can then answer me already [Music] for what's that now oh yes we can hear you good i need you to go to the new planet namek immediately and gather the dragon balls oh but but why do you quit just stammering and just do it we don't have much time [Music] okay [Music] vegeta what are you up to it's a little early for us to use the dragon balls kakarot how many times have you saved earth and its people [Music] ah why are you asking me that quite a few times i guess [Music] i think it's about time the people of earth save themselves for once [Music] we've been waiting for you today huh oh my you grace us with your presence supreme kai everyone we are fully aware of the situation come let us hurry thank you vegeta we've collected all seven of the dragon balls just like you asked but good now hurry up and summon the namekian dragon i've got two wishes for you to make first ask to have the earth return to the way it was [Music] then asked to bring back everybody that's died since the day of the world tournament excluding of course anyone that's evil [Music] those are the two wishes should i make the wishes now what about the third wish the third wish doesn't matter you've got to hurry [Music] vegeta about that second wish it'd probably be easier to just bring back everyone killed by boo don't you think if we ask for that bobady and deborah will be brought back too plus all the people i killed at the world tournament arena wouldn't be brought back [Music] oh oh yeah man you really thought this through [Music] we have a problem i just remembered that perunga can only bring back one person from the dead at a time [Music] that is no longer a concern after the incident with frieza i took the liberty of powering up peroga's wiscratic abilities really so we could bring back as many people as we want never mind everything's okay good now make the wishes [Music] paro [Music] state your wishes i shall grant any three wishes that you desire paprunga paprito paro a faraway planet called earth was recently destroyed please bring it back okay consider it dog [Music] your first wish has been granted now then state your second wish uh um how should i phrase this pipotara sariman popo toterapo um please bring back all those killed after the wizard bobbity arrived on earth no except anyone evil [Music] understood however it will take some time that there's a lot of people to revive right what what's wrong tindy have you made the wishes yet hey now quit your yammering would you this perunga fellow is doing what he can you for your patience your second wish has been granted vegeta we did it everyone should be back now look your halo's gone vegeta you're alive now that's great i guess that means you're not a bad guy after all [Music] what the wait a sec wasn't i killed by boo huh what's going on [Music] oh i think i get it now you're thinking of having gohan and go tanks join us in the fight no you're going to prepare that attack of yours the spirit bomb a spirit bomb really you're kidding me right who's totally not gonna let me gather energy little by little from people on earth didn't i tell you that the people of earth need to save themselves for once it's not going to be little by little they're going to give every ounce of energy they've got hey supreme kai listen up get me in touch with the people of earth right away leave that to me that's my specialty who's that i know that voice it's king kai bingo you know vegeta i'm quite touched you thought of my technique now then speak not just the earth but the entire universe is listening good thanks people of earth listen here i'm communicating with you from a far away place every one of you was killed by majin buu but we used a strange power to bring you all back to life everything should be back to the way it was before and no this is not some kind of dream you're having as i speak right at this very second there's a warrior here fighting majin buu on your behalf [Music] but the truth of the matter is he's run out of energy and can't fight anymore that's why we need your help raise your hands into the air we're going to use your energy to defeat majin buu you'll feel tired afterward but no more tired than after a good workout now raise your hands all right kakarot begin you bet [Music] everyone lend me as much of your energy as you can please he's forming a spirit bomb you got it huh dad didn't

watch out everyone sounds like your energy could really be drained [Music] that sounds painful it's gotta be a trap yeah i'm not gonna listen to some mysterious voice in the sky i bet it's that poverty guy trying to trick us again [Music] damn those bastards not a single one of them are listening to a word i said the hey where are these voices coming from oh damn things are looking grim the fat one's hanging on by only a thread what are you doing cut it out stop it right now [Music] damn it he spotted it [Music] kakarot i'm going to try and buy us some more time you try and convince the imbeciles of earth to give you more energy [Music] hurry kakarot wait a second you just came back to life there's no way you have enough energy to fight prepare yourself prepare yourself prepare

cooperate do you intend to ignore a request from the great mr satan as well mr satan huh what's he doing there it's really him it's mr satan [Music] wait so it's mr satan who's fighting majin buu
