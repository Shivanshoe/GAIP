[Music] beautiful with her deadly aim should pierce it in the heart of a hummingbird fine type things all of them i see you there come closer this one killed six innocent children to satisfy her age they squabble with chelsea she fight and murder their cruel vibrant shellfish and let the heel of achilles these weaknesses will be very happy i have no such only one stands between me and the rehabilitation of olympus only the foundless most arrogant narrow-minded boxers now i've missed you prometheus my favorite cousin you chained me to this rock and fed my liver to an eagle out of love you need my help typhon is free you once fought beside his allies the titans convinced him to stand down it's not that simple he is even blocking my ability to glimpse the future i cannot see past him go on blast me my god he took my lightning he took everything even the other gods are missing look to the mortals that's done those evil imbecillic tasteless parasites were all turned to stone one of those evil parasites is about to save your royal ass my ass is safely lodged in the aegean stables and mortals will never be anything but a mistake care to make a wager if i'm right my sin of stealing fire and ensuring their survival becomes a blessing you find your punishment unjust it's a little extreme do we have a deal if you win i'll end your punishment and set you free but if i win you help me stop typhoon whatever it takes very well let the tale of phoenix be my redemption oh no not one of your stories how long is this going to my tale begins at sea a ship of soldiers returning from a far away battle their victory ambushed by an unexpected storm the sea tossed and turned waves churned to a frog the line between sky and sea all but vanished the mountainous peaks of the waves descended into valleys nearly as deep as turtles you're really painting a picture here [Music] it's an art point is the ship didn't stand a chance at dawn the sun rose on the few remaining survivors the lowest ranked among them a shield bearer who dreamt of the storm wake up i have to wake up the storm wake up i have to wake up the storm wake up the storm wake up i have to wake up body like this body like uh this face like a face you like concealing in my mind a sharp bird [Music] hair like burnt out burning just burn the color of cold lips [Music] beach fuss has a beard the color of an empty room the color of unripe grapefruits the color of burnt bread eyes the color of fresh mushrooms there i see him clear as day the lowest ranked among them a shield bearer who dreamt of battle but had seen area skirmish a teller of tales not a doer of deeds phoenix what a name fenix sounds like the sound a dumb bird makes when it lights itself on fire which would be ridiculous although i should write that down washed up on an unknown shore phoenix awoke captain can anyone hear me looks like the only way off this beach is up that cliff [Music] [Music] phoenix saw his captain and fellow soldiers in the distance through a trick of delight he could almost see them waving and calling to him phoenix again you may not be your brother legeron but i will make something of you yet hold my shield try not to drop it this time i didn't see you there don't let them get to you they're just jealous it's not often someone has a brother like yours logo goes local ghost can you hear me you've gone cold what magic is this the kiron where are you brother unarmed and lost phoenix was vulnerable i have to be calm i have to follow my training huh my brother's sword now [Music] brother you've always been my hero my north star i will bring you back i swear it phoenix had never been allowed to hold the hallowed sword a gift from achilles for bravery it balanced perfectly in his palm as if forged for it achilles sword brother must have been good is something wrong with your voice i never got a sword just say phoenix by the gods stay back he readied his sword for his first real fight come into force [Music] yes i should be able to survey the land from up there this is the largest statue of hermes i've ever seen i wonder who built it besieged by challenge totally alone this young hero was determined to save his fellow soldiers and brother boring can we skip this path no this is important for the sense of atmosphere hermes my old friend it's an honor to finally meet you in person just don't tell anyone i'm speaking to you i got in enough trouble for memorizing stories instead of tilling the soil back at home and then the other soldiers well they really don't appreciate a good story [Music] phoenix's destiny was becoming clear so far all you have shown me is a mortal soldier who has fought one real battle and typhon grows stronger by the hour don't toy with me prometheus i swear to you that soldier shall be our salvation for if he fails and typhon defeats us source king of gods the world will fall to chaos a temple of apollo if it has an oracle or a seer they could help me undo this curse a griffin but they aren't real let me go hey i'll save you i'm coming i need to find a way to reach that rift how to get down the pond what is this it smells like honey and the first day of spring and my first kiss all rolled into one phoenix got into the ambrosia too prometheus you worried zeus about losing this bet please he can't use it anyway yet phoenix felt the giron's blade with every step its weight a reminder of the heavy responsibility you gave him your blade oh achilles i meant to ask why exactly would you expect to receive a sword from achilles oh uh as an offering just a routine offering from someone who gazed into your eyes and told you you were special that's all i left the rose on his breastplate got something in my eye keep going [Music] huh [Music] sing of hermes the lock-bringing messenger of the immortals he consorts with all mortals and immortals little he profits but through the dark knight he continually clicks that's nice who wrote that my favorite poet who just happens to not have been born [Music] yet [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] huh huh [Music] huh hmm unlike the mortal flesh which had been frozen into marble the pomegranate sprung forth defiantly bursting with life a lot of poetry for something that just got a stick in their mouth isn't that what the best poetry is about huh hello can you hear me in there i'm coming i found your axe phoenix approached the axe feeling it called to him looks like the axe of atalanta must be a copy although but before felix could claim it the axe was pulled into the pit by a terrible force no one you think that all trick will work on me come into my partner said as i closed well that's the end of phoenix perfectly possible storytelling i won't lie there were moments that dragged but you really got me with that ending now let's settle up time for you to help me against typhon it's not over yet not by a long shot what what is this indeed what was this strange place it's tartarus just exactly where had phoenix landed tatoros the nasty abyss where i imprisoned tie for he must have opened rifts into the vaults of the underworld when he escaped you know it i know it say it phoenix wasn't uh sure i hate you but aren't you intrigued no keep going [Music] let's see if you can meet my talent or if you will fall like all the others who are you hello hmm huh uh huh what's this wings phoenix ran his hands over them noticing that several pieces were missing as if someone had ripped them apart they seem to be man-made i wonder how they work if they even work they actually work sort of the axe the acts of atalanta deadliest of hunters swiftest of heroes falling at the hands of typhon didn't i change him into a lion you turned a lot of people into a lot of things i need to stop drinking and now know you're still standing i sense something a bolt of my lightning scattered hidden by typhon it's over phoenix is helios no one can handle those bolts but me oh really a replica of zeus's lightning bolt no way power it was too much for him to bear ah what's happening to me bye-bye and then just like that no the wings grounded the lightning they were designed to withstand storms that shouldn't be possible and yet this is just the beginning having plunged into the abyss of tartarus and living to tell the dead phoenix emerged victorious for now that stranger i was chasing where did he go with the wings he would be able to flit across the ancient bridge and find out i wouldn't just step on this guarded junk who knows where those have been many a night phoenix had told tales of a genius an inventor named daedalus and his extraordinary wings perhaps someone copied their design phoenix mused so junk ooh maybe it's cursed [Music] [Music] huh huh huh [Music] i'm coming to help hold on if only the giron was here he's the famous hero not me what am i going to do put the fiends of tagaroos to sleep with storytelling [Music] [Music] [Music] huh huh [Applause] [Music] ah uh a gorgeon what's that glimmering maybe if i sneak up on it uh these bracers i've seen them in drawings they can't be ah but they were heracles mightiest slayer of beasts defied hera and accomplished the impossible wearing those bracers and now they belong to phoenix through damn luck stop over here fight someone who's armed instead so phoenix after boldly besting the gorgon that ambushed heracles what are you doing there that thing with your voice heracles yeah that that is how it's supposed to be pronounced seems like a lot of work but it's your funeral except i can't die don't remind me by the gods i feel like i could lift a mountain only those bracers this one hades alive you two get a room [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] ah huh hmm i'm coming how do i get in if he fell into that vault i'll save you i promise so let me get this straight instead of heating up the temple of apollo to speak with the oracle phoenix is high-tailing it after this stranger phoenix truly a good person sought to help the mysterious stranger but he never lost sight of the fact that he was getting ever closer to the temple of apollo and the solution to the terrible curse inflicted upon his brother and fellow soldiers oh yes remind me to erase my own faults with narration zeus truly a good person murdered his first wife by getting her to turn into a fly and then ate her wait that's what happened to mattis i thought she was visiting her sister in [Music] babylon [Music] huh odysseus [Music] huh building power requires more than that footwork little one let's see if you have control who are you show yourself ah of the target seemed easy enough to hit but the third would require the focus of a master archer forget it kids today play seashells they skip rocks stare at the wall you know they're hyperactive this from the gods who thinks a week constitutes a long-term relationship keep that steady hard little one [Music] [Music] huh huh um armed with the agility of achilles the speed of atalanta the wits of odysseus and the strength of heracles phoenix was ready to face whatever the future had in store that's it that's all he has going for him fur good luck i'm nearly at the oracle the desire to save his comrades and brother harden phoenix's resolve ah too easy though [Applause] hmm oh huh [Applause] oh [Music] hmm [Music] huh huh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] phoenix saw the minions of typhon had cornered the stranger leaving no escape this would be his greatest battle yet oh i hope the stranger dies [Music] [Music] [Music] it's over you can come out no thanks i'm good there's nothing to worry about if i had wanted to hurt you i could just as easily come and stab you back there through that so i'm going to go phoenix unique name appreciate the assistance phoenix nice bracelets thanks i'm on my way to the temple of apollo to see the oracle me too it's right over there oh great i can use all the help i can get we should go together hey where did you go my bracers that rotten little thief i saved you i know how you feel kid you do everything you can for them and then they betray you what's up with that who designed that entrance a circus performer a magician i don't know aren't mortals wonderful [Music] huh forward into the light [Music] the mysteries i have to offer are as infinite as the grains of sand scattered across the floor what is your question oh wise oracle how do i reverse the curse and turn everyone back from stone wow that's a real that's a real question i don't know it's a mystery well then how do i get my stolen bracers back ah another mystery yes that's why i came to you the oracle oh yes well they're calling that i'm just the priest the oracle here turned to stone but the smoke here is something else the euthan sand is called sand because it's between the sea and the land ah have you seen a little guy with golden hair no i'm going to go what's so funny you said the goat twice but you still haven't left my brother was turned to stone and i can't save him the one person i tried to help robbed me and all you can do is laugh whoa those are all true are you an oracle [Music] oh oh on your way out can you pick me up something i'm starving father of your life a mountain ground with flowing locks is how you win the monster shambles hungry for immortal flaws the true hero owns them all stolen from the beast's jaws with the wind heroes go on the attack and sooner than later change them all back a barrel of seas forged fires lit a wise child convinced a feather's weight of which eldest of details father overthrown dear old high it's time for you to come home now that was a prophecy what was isn't it weird how prophecy ends with i see but in this case i don't stop thief you can have these bracelets back you're going to need them where you're going come with me no look i'm sorry about stealing from you it's just something i do it's kind of a problem so we good not even remotely i needed an offering for the oracle i thought you were a nobody and i didn't like your face but that's all behind us now we have to go didn't like my we don't have much time he will be here soon who i have just a ticket for you to make it to the mainland where are those wings these now who's the thief don't look so smug they won't fly yet anyway you have to find the other piece what do you mean fly focus after that we need a jar stolen from eggless it's in there i'll go begin the preparations meet me at the top of the observatory with a jar i i don't understand you're in grave danger help me help you okay but about what you said earlier and you're gone okay well gotta figure out how to get past that barrier the labyrinth in behalf before phoenix seemed daunting but the light of endless stars helped show the way yes we now know where cargo goes to die ugh [Music] [Music] [Music] you made it farther than most huh uh huh uh uh hmm [Music] foreign huh uh uh huh huh [Music] uh as phoenix traveled through the other one he starts turned toward his mother and father were they safe in argos had they too been transformed phoenix a huge monster appears it's ginormous but phoenix just laughed no so you want to dance huh oh oh it's perfect the adorable monster was ever so playful everything he had prayed for to take his mind off his worries it was a gift from olympus he would treasure forever deep within his vulnerable yet ever expanding fine have it your way just don't make me vomit phoenix face the monster ready the monster attacked [Music] [Music] wow [Music] whoever or whatever you are you don't scare me wait when the thief said this was aolis jar i thought that it would be a jar with the god of winds on it not in it this little thing can't contain the wind that's impossible uh [Music] ugh [Music] huh [Applause] huh ah [Applause] [Music] [Music] huh huh ah the wall is crumbling i wonder if there's a way to break through it as phoenix continued his journey he couldn't help but wonder if his story would one day be told amongst the stars hermes always says the stars tell stories but i don't get it it's like i can't read somehow that doesn't surprise me looks like i'll need to solve this to get to the missing wing piece you can't solve the stars the stars solve you at least that's for the seer named miss clear once told me and i won't tell you what happened after that but those stars were bright she stole your money she did yes but i turned her into a juniper berry so overall not a bad night huh [Music] hmm wow hmm welcome to the golden isle in remembrance of my greatest success and my greatest failure may the gods accept my offering may i see you again vigorous these are the great deadliest wings he must have built everything here too all these temples i can't imagine losing a sun like that what it does to you the wing piece recovered and dialysis jar back from tartarus now to find that stranger at the top of the observatory hmm what i didn't kill a cross daddy lost his faulty wings did that and where is daedalus now i see silence i'm sure phoenix will find out eventually huh uh huh ah huh [Music] [Music] i thought you said you were preparing something yeah preparing for you to return you got the wings yes not really good as blue but what is something new you have the jar right get ready to open it what is that you decentful thing you thought you could escape me you stole something from that thing i told you it's a problem three delivery boy you do not deserve the crown you were given we'll take you down typhon just like before there is snow not anymore phoenix no open your wings i can't okay we need to get to safety stat what was that monster typhon not the typhon oh you have no idea gonna get to the hall of the gods then we can talk you ready to fly these were daedalus wings the daedalus the great inventor so so they didn't work right and killed his son you'll be fine just don't fly too close to helios and also don't try to go to the bathroom during turbulence you should make it to the mainland without crashing probably you literally robbed me and now you're saving me why i didn't follow most of what the oracle ran through but if the prophecy is on the money hero on high you're the only one who can stop typhon from remaking the world we don't even know if it's about me for someone trying to help everyone right and left maybe you should accept help once in a while what are you talking about fate's alive how is the winged herald supposed to provide aid when you won't let me with the wicked herald's aid wait when it held no way you are hermes i like telling half-truths playing tricks and taking long runs on the beach now can we go please the other gods need our help other gods you mean all the stories are real something's wrong with your face it's doing that slack-jawed thing again fly to the golden isle meet me at the hall of the gods i'll be waiting and with that hermes disappeared phoenix gazed across the narrow band of sea at the peaks and valleys of the golden isle ahead the long path to his true destiny they stretched out before him wait that was just a prologue how does it take someone that long to begin a story odysseus made it home faster he's about to jump be quiet and listen [Music] huh [Music] uh [Music] ah huh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] huh suddenly the majestic form of a wild creature of phoenix's eye if phoenix wanted to tame the beautiful beast the military would have to befriend it first why are you whispering because i don't want to scare you what are you on because can i have some [Music] [Music] [Music] uh yes uh all right [Music] [Music] huh huh [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] ah uh huh [Applause] huh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] huh yes [Applause] uh huh uh [Applause] what is duty but slavery to principles oh we'll make our mark on the golden iron hopefully they'll be able to fill it in later we who are about to die i feel personally attacked by thai no you will all fight for your stupidity huh wow [Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] yes [Music] um huh yep oh [Applause] the sight of the great hall took phoenix's breath away this is incredible it's all right could use some updating the column motif is a bit laid out so we're safe here remember that thing i stole from typhon it was an itty-bitty piece of his eye to hide this place from his terrifying gaze you're welcome you said this is the hall of the gods well where are the others let me start from the beginning with his hand on phoenix's shoulder hermes recounted the tale of typhon destroyer of gods typhon born of gaia was a terrible cruel beast who vowed to free the titans and obliterate the gods he challenged zeus for the rule of the cosmos fortunately tyler was defeated damn straight he was and imprisoned under a mountain where he could do no more harm i got to get back into that kind of shape for thousands of years typha festered until helios was eclipsed and burning stars fell from the heavens the stars burnt through typhon's chain and in an explosion of fire and smoke typhon burst from the mountain the gods had wronged and tortured him again this world will be cleansed the gods will pay and so typhon sought his revenge destroy the veil that separates this arrowed land from the upper wall let tartarus walk around the you have underestimated my power and work in your hubries go to my unseatable perfection some gods fled in fear others still many were captured typhon split them apart cleaving their essences from them and transforming them irrevocably in the final desperate attempt to save their lives the gods called on the heroes of old the last warriors who had more than a few drops of god's blood remaining in their we veins selfish your heroes will exist the shadows of their former souls serving me forever the gods had failed and so had the heroes but just when all hope seemed lost so yeah a lot of fighting and losing and now you are our only remaining hope to restore these lands to their former glory and save the world from chaos all we have phoenix is you no pressure i kind of lost track of who's who is that one with the spiky hair you or tycho forget it the vanquished gods need to be reunited with their severed essences to regain their power and then together you must defeat typhon huh this is honestly a lot i wish my brother was here look kid i'm not perfect i'm the guy who escorted pandora to earth for zeus's sake but maybe just maybe you're the right hero at the right time also you're literally all we've got seeing as how everyone else has been defeated good luck i'll be right here doing nothing i mean beginning preparations thanks i think oh there's that face again fine your best starting point is to reach the top of the other statues on the golden isle so you can track the missing gods find them and they should be able to help you locate their stolen essences although they haven't been themselves so i'm really not sure um what's that mean i guess you'll find out phoenix think what would my brother do the giron would probably take on taipon single-handedly like when he bested the entire spartan fleet who am i kidding i mean way over my head [Music] ah there's that wonderful smell again ambrosia is life you want increased protection it here and drink up then enjoy the ride one time athena down that whole helix and destroyed the entire greek fleet right after she had sided with him in battle it was epic sorry guess you just had to be there many of my relatives were they died and i told athena not to do that but did she listen no [Music] [Music] oh is this a festus's forge you're cute try not to impale yourself on anything but phoenix wasn't listening he was drawn to the forge by a hidden force the aramantine he'd gathered calling out to be reshaped [Music] so [Music] oh [Music] [Music] hmm nice cauldron phoenix let the empty compliment die in the ensuing silence and instead tried to focus on potential potion [Music] recipes [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] ah [Music] hmm those are a few ideas for ways to stick it to typhon you mortals seem to need an incentive so i'll pay you electrum for accomplishing each and since i'm the god of merchandise you can spend it right here on you guessed it merchandise ooh creative or you could always just pay me your own electrum i thought the incentive was for me i'm the god of financial gain those prizes wow i'm also the god of thieves we all have our vices what's that underneath it's a chore chart someone has to get aries to clean up after himself ever try to get blood out of a sea of blood now that is a feat i'm here selling if you're buying [Music] [Music] [Music] is this where the gods get their dental exams no it's where we rip off our skin to change our appearance still better than visiting the dentist [Music] what's this not sure hades had it delivered deposit an offering for the ferryman and unexpected help could very well arrive be careful though argo broke the last key from the underworld and look what happened to him who's argo exactly [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] ugh you know if you're in the market for anything [Music] [Music] huh [Music] this is where you train oh gods no what a waste of me time just cheat using zeus's lightning to enhance your muscles and stamina that's what i do you're an inspiration i get that a lot [Music] huh any electrum burning a hole in your pocket let me know what you're feeling huh [Music] ah uh yes what uh here um uh [Music] huh [Music] oh [Music] oh phoenix stumbled upon a winged creature easily mistaken for a fairy however its true identity would soon be revealed as phoenix freed the small creature imprisoned on the isle she left out to cry which meant great hero i am but a piece of nike the goddess of victory please free the others so i may return to my full glory they won't win without nike she's like a glove or a thing you wear that protects you while running a helmet so what is it phoenix would need to be free to find out yeah but you can tell me now can you please respect my narrative pacing [Music] what was that [Music] [Music] ah ah the valley of eternal spring its highlights include a massive tree that reaches up to the heavens the whole of the gods [Music] heroes's palace oh i'm glad he finally got his happy ending and a palace belonging to the goddess of beauty herself of course aphrodite would claim the prime real estate with the best view as long as she's safe from drying eyes i'm happy from such great heights a fluttering of birds feeding from the most beautiful apple tree caught phoenix's eye phoenix was about as high as i was when i thought marrying aphrodite after hephaestus would stop the other gods from fighting over her yes that view from mount olympus is something else i haven't seen it in years you're not getting that high again so stop asking [Music] you
