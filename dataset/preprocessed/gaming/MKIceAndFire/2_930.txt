the nexus tower holds a quantum computer used by albion it simulates civilian response to large-scale events mass arrests deportations bombings simple mouse albion is using it to test the limits of

huh what in the world is happening oh always look forward to payday word is you're looking for dead sec i wasn't sure you'd come knowing i'm part of the establishment or at least i was until albion dismissed parliament i do want to say what you've done in westminster is remarkable you've given the people hope well if the government hadn't caved into albion so easily we wouldn't be in this mess but it doesn't matter anymore this city needs our help i couldn't agree more that's why i contacted you albion haven't simply shut down the government they've sullied the palace of westminster the great bell with their propaganda do you understand what that looks like if you really want to rekindle some of the people's fight and spirit then restoring the clock tower would go a long way brilliant people will see that they do have the power to take back what's theirs from albion the clock tower represents their political voice we'll return it to them i knew i could count on you it would be wonderful to hear the bell once more share their wealth there is some security around the bell tower but that shouldn't pose a problem at vigorous you will be getting to the top ideas a spider bot should do the trick you
