you said earlier you've been making poisons it's the vermin out of our rice can you make it stronger enough to kill a man no one deserves that can you do it the effects in larger doses are ugly good oh my lord sit with me a moment poison has never been the sakai way no suck I had to fight the Mongol Empire I need every weapon we have Tsushima can't afford anything less the Mongols have changed you young master the world has changed my mother taught me about plants that heal others that harm even kill but they must be consumed how will you poison the invaders Logan and dot's I've read of their use ing warrior who studied with monks from the West will you help me promise me you'll remain the good man I know I promise I've looked after your every need since your mother carried you I won't stop now all I need is something to make a blowgun used to be plenty of reeds downriver near the old crossing remember you and your little friend gathered them to make little boats use oh and I

his way enough of a pasty you have a blowgun and darts all I need now is the poison of course you must come with me you have a small camp where we gather plants and herbs for ointments and poison it kills vermin within moments make it strong enough for the invaders [Music] it's nice to ride with you again you and Lord shamone taught me to ride on that runt pony you sat so tall and straight in your little saddle but you were the Shogun himself what's so funny I just remembered it was out here you nearly killed your uncle what you are three or four the poor man was trying to teach you how to hold your wooden cottage you wanted to chase butterflies I know the story my uncle's black I took weeks to heal Lord see Maura and your father laughed so hard I fear they'd vote choke to death I don't remember my father's laugh you lost his humor after your mother got sick but you have your father's laugh here we are now goes on that and a campfire you sleep out here only when I spend the day foraging for plants I look for the flowers you mean rest you go I will get them for you don't eat the seeds they're poisonous another child at Utica Oh she arranged them for the little alcove at home that should be enough bring them to me young master your plants good we extract the seeds crush them make a paste and dip the needles make sure the dose is strong it should do what you need it's done you're sure he came this way the old woman has a camp around here somewhere yes someone's gotta stay there Utica let's see if this poison works you will regret what he did to Saddam Lee and the others I just want his head and a price limit how much father it's around here somewhere let me get my barriers oh yeah yeah I don't want to lose him [Music] oh you heard young master don't worry I dealt with them ah sometimes I forget you're a grown man I forget sometimes too we should get back to the estate I'll stay I need to straighten the place up don't push yourself too hard hush you are not a child and I'm old enough to take care of myself what other kinds of poison can you make always so impatient there is another the causes confusion and rage but the ingredients what were they try to remember it sounds useful [Music] [Music] gods will investigate odd sounds these chants can be a destruction no it has petals flower no not that Oh mother I wish you were young master would you like something to eat I'm fine Utica I just need the poison you are trying to remember the ingredients they were flowers you remember them don't you the ones I planted at your family cemetery I remember washing the graves father made me hold buckets of water from the lake he knew it would make you strong and teach you to respect your ancestors don't you remember the flowers gin spider lilies that's right not spider lilies the poison that makes rats go mad tear each other to pieces it's awful it's for a good cause just make it strong enough to work on men if you think it's necessary I know exactly where to find what we need this way this part of the forest I was here when I was a child after your mother passed away I refused to believe she was gone so I ran from home and came here your mother loved to take long walks here I searched until sundown kept shouting for her she was gone I was lost you were missing for three days nearly dead by the time your father found you I've never seen him so angry angry at himself for failing to protect you I've seen your father before countless battles and he was never more worried than the sleepless nights he spent searching for his only son not much farther to the cemetery I wonder what your father would make of that ghost he would disapprove like my uncle don't be so sure they argued often kazuma's I thought your uncle too rigid willfully life and possibilities Kazu Massa had imagination imagination my father you're like him in more ways than you know Jeff is respecting the dead stay here [Music] [Music] Keisha [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I must [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but we must set an example for our people by remaining true to our code and to ourselves the poisons just for now after the Mongols are gone I won't need it [Music] what go give back then that's what the touchback [Music] [Music] did you drive them off yes it's safe to look for the spider ladies why would we look for them here isn't this where you used to plant them oh no not here it's been so long they're in another cemetery your great aunts branch of the family it's not far Utica do you remember I was five or six I had a nightmare about this forest a fight he had wasn't a nightmare I told you it was to keep you calm that was real I remember men shouting our retinue was returning home late one night we were ambushed by Ronin the Ronin must have been dangerous my father samurai were frightened not of the runyan of Kazu masa my father why he and his hammer I drove the Ronin off but Kazuma supper sued them on foot you could hear their screams he returned to us just before dawn covers in cut some of his own men mistook him for a demon of the forest do you recognize this lick we used to meditate here how you digit you told me to pretend I was a rock and all I wanted was to swim use much better from the shore join me young master these old bones need a rest this time you'll have to keep me from fidgeting some of my favorite memories happened at this lake stopping a child's fidgeting your mother and I would come here when she was pregnant with you we should keep moving huh a grown man and you still can barely sit still you meditate again after the war yes young master yeah cemeteries in Faja it was much closer when you're north carrying water oh hey they may break stone but they cannot erase the memory of these warriors please gather the spider lilies I can't bear to look my heart Matsu would weep at the condition of this place most of these warriors fell in the rebellion at yahiko they deserve better than this this is all I could find it is enough to make the poison but I don't want our time to end the shimmer of cemetery isn't far with a view of the waterfall let's go my lord those of us I do enjoy our rights together did you say you ride did you often go riding with my father Lord Sakai taught me to ride no Jeff whoa Mongols ahead
