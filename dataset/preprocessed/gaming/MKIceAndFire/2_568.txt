previously on alan wake something i only know is the dark presence held my wife that came true i'll bring her back some part of me had been aware enough to write my escape into the story and wrote a better ending for the story but not without a price i was trapped somewhere in the dark place a strange zone somewhere beyond our world after the completion of any difficult undertaking there are mixed emotions accomplishment and relief sadness depression for a while everything was about the work like an illness that consumed you changed you you locked yourself away from the world to do it and now you need to recover learn to live without it find a way to crack open the door and let the light back in i knew this place it was familiar everything had a surreal dreamlike quality i but something was waiting for me at the back of the diner try the coffee just don't blame me when you fall in love because it'll break your heart when you have to leave here is no longer human nothing but black coffee under a thin layer of skin do me a favor sonny i could really use a tune right now number six in the jukebox i do it myself but both of my legs have gone to sleep bad circulation yeah are you serious again you disgust me call yourself a rocker unbelievable just because we're brothers don't think i won't murder you in your sleep yes that's my favorite tune shut your mouth you demanded has been if i had my hammer i'd shut it for you jeez to number six in the jukebox there's a song for you don't go in there young man you can hurt yourself in the dark you don't want to die do you worse i warned you about it but he didn't listen alan listen to me go no deeper what focus you're losing yourself i will try to help the best i can but it's up to you find a better point of contact what do you mean i cannot hear you please you're the one making all this happen concentrate this is what's happening nightmares too deep can't take the pressure it's too much suddenly wake found himself face to face with himself at the sight of myself the dream suddenly became lucid the dark place that's where i was you will need weapons it's not the light itself but what it represents you will need this is not a gun it is a tool and a logical process of elimination be careful i will try to find a better point of contact i didn't understand zane's message and knowing where i was didn't fix anything something had gone wrong after i'd finished departure what the hell was that then the door was smashed off his hinges and wake had to fight for his life much zane wait for me the world had become twisted these trees didn't belong here oh um i knew it was my writing but the words were jumbled to dream like fragments reloading frantically the rounds she was startled by the phone the gps system was working i hadn't expected that hello i'm trying to reach you can you hear me can you hear me now yes listen i can help you but you're drifting deeper i can't reach you you must come to me i can't maintain the connections use the words follow the signal it made no sense for the gps system to work i doubted any satellite was in range here these were alien skies but it was guiding me towards something something had shifted again the dark place was playing tricks on me it wouldn't stay still the town itself turned against wake cars flew toward him they cracked bone and crushed muscle it oozed hate he wanted to bury him my everything i saw was familiar and yet it wasn't hello i cannot keep up you're going too deep i will try to guide you follow the signal i'm trying you must face yourself folk the gps system was supposed to lead me to zane but the ships were interfering with it i had to keep trying i wouldn't survive alone the changes were becoming more violent the street wasn't so much ripped apart as it was missing like some great hand had reached down and scooped it up everything felt erratic unstable so aah so where are you look i'm trying to follow your goddamn signal the dark place is playing tricks on you're still going deep i'm trying to guide you but it's hard what is this i can help you if you just stop singing what this is [ __ ] it's happening again brace yourself i was running after zayn and he was telling me i was going too deep it was ridiculous but i was more scared than amused i felt like i was being hindered by an unseen force in ways i couldn't fight all i could do was keep going so god i don't see barry look wake maybe that's him that's the way to the chopper i remember this this happened before we found barry the playground that wakes pathetic memories of the wonder years in the contrary little boy pretending he didn't miss his father he never knew it surged up and beat right down glaring around slides eager to cave in his head i had to find the key to get the door open i'm gonna give pastor howard a piece of my mind about this lock i told him to get it fixed wait i got the door open run for it the world was it was changing twisting out of control it was too big on the inside he couldn't see the ceiling something was moving in there he was lost he couldn't find the exit that's all the shifts were getting more severe i wasn't sure if the place got bigger or i got smaller the signal so ah so so so zane left me a page he was trying to help me oh [ __ ] what gave me away i'm a figment of your imagination just like pretty much everything else you see here maybe even you that's insane yeah you're right everything that happened before made perfect sense but this is insane good catch al okay okay look i gotta get going the gps the gps yeah i know follow the signal got it so anywho i'm here to help you the thing is you need to get a grip all right you nag the way the real barry does you know that well hey you know be fair it's not my fault you think i'm annoying i don't think you're annoying ah baby relax it's cool just try to stay on the ball here you need to do what zane tells you he's been here for ages he's like the expert anyway if this is insane and it's all from your mind what's that say about you fine enough i can't believe i was actually happy to see you oh come on don't [ __ ] a [ __ ] owl deep down you're always happy to see me can't lie to yourself know what i'm saying i must be a sucker for punishment you no really and i always thought you went out of your way to avoid trouble thanks thanks for that i think the signal's pointing towards that thing in the distance yeah that'd be the biltmore sawmill how the hell do you know that i don't know anything you don't so why don't you ask yourself that huh maybe you saw a sign for it back in the real world or maybe it's the sawmill because i said it's the sawmill and now you can't get it out of your head fantastic yeah sure has given me a headache or is that your headache do you have a headache barry dude we're bonding if you complete that sentence you're fired mightier than the sword you're fired shadows and ghosts uh uh you know you're gonna have to make your way across here i'm thinking the solution probably has something to do with those words really you think yeah you should probably use them your inside is staggering i know see this is the way things should be i give advice and you fall that's when things go right when you get up to something on your own that's when the trouble starts that's horse [ __ ] uh al i'm not saying anything you haven't come up with first pigment remember this kind of thing could drive a man no this is great hand is probably therapeutic for you too wake's own words littering the landscape his books common and discarded like mud beneath his feet hardbacks paperbacks turned against him trash just cheap trash i had seen weird transmissions of myself before but not like this the version of myself i saw now sounded insane like a demented storyteller who was out to torment and destroy his protagonist those are bad words bad words so so the earth shook street lights pushed themselves up to the ground flickering madly and spitting sparks in the shadows wings off far too many figures advancing early already tasting the kill okay this is just too weird you're weird barry is all this really coming out of my head that's just the way this place is al all that random stuff in your head imagination but you're from miami you know what al do yourself a favor don't pursue that train of thought any further so so so you need to get that door open before you can get into the warehouse that's the way forward if i'm making this up why is it so complicated because you're a complicated man and no one understands you but i'm talking hmm valley so oh that's crazy ah hmm hey what are you up to i thought this was my side of the bed he entered the trap surrounded by enemies wake had nowhere to run i'm so sick of you foreign so oh that's never a good sound is it no isn't it so so i think the dust in this place you're not even really there well my allergies are definitely here see allergies [ __ ] ugh oh stop it they're waiting for us downstairs we don't have time for alan i knew she wasn't really here but she still made my heart egg i had saved alice but i wasn't even sure when that happened was it days ago longer i had no way of knowing so whoa that's fast that looks crazy dangerous now uh hey lover come here i've got something for you i could only hope that alice was all right i didn't know what happened to her after she left the dark place zayn is that you oh hey hold that pose that was a good one like this yeah but smile a little more no that's too much you want to look mysterious maybe a little tough you know how people go for those dangerous bad boys but i'm not dangerous oh come on you write about terrible things all the time people want to think that you're intimately familiar with them you kill casey in this book you need to look a little bit like a murderer oh that's good do that again you look handsome and dangerous you know i wasn't sure about the beard before but i was wrong it looks good on you okay i think we're done great i want to get out of this suit hey things are looking up guess danger is sexy that was when i was still working when i felt like a real writer instead of a fraud it was a good memory i wished i hadn't seen it alan you made it this area of the dark place is calmer at least for the time being we can talk here but we don't have much time zayn how do i get out of here that's what you face that's you even as we speak that's not me it's just i don't know an echo a hallucination the dark presence the dark presence is not responsible for this you are making this happen you're trapped in your own nightmares you are fighting yourself shut up swept away by the gathering insanity zane was gone wait could feel the pressure gnawing at his mind the darkness wasn't so bad it was in him he felt it he knew the voice spoke the truth it was just too hard to think you can't couldn't make sense of it couldn't he wanted to go with the flow stop thinking and just let go uh ugh is the stuff it would have been so much easier to let go is he was gone uh he couldn't even understand what he was facing foreign it's all in your head you've been making it up why is oh how do i get out of here it's all in your head you've been making it up see what i mean i think i'm stuck on this side well you're gonna have to find your way out of there i'll wait just remember you're still in the dark place you know that right i don't want to alarm you pal but it's sink or swim time fine i could feel the pressure mounting barry was right time was running out everything i saw was a dark twisted version of reality based on my memories and thoughts i had to accept it if all of this was from my mind then i was the one making all this happen i was literally fighting myself it was a moment of clarity so after finishing departure i felt finished myself all i had wanted was to save alice after that a part of me had been ready to just give in and die but i hadn't given up thomasine had reached me i had run across a nightmarish landscape following a signal from him he kept telling me i was sick i wasn't sure if he meant the dark place or insanity perhaps they were one the same hey nice job al so you really are nuts huh let's face it we always knew this was coming i guess but i actually feel pretty rational all things considered crazy people don't know they're crazy that's where they're crazy hey check out the light show behind the lodge that's zane's light yeah you're done sinking now that means he's just about caught up with you you better go talk to him lots of fireworks here nice wake heart the old gods play music came out all wrong it attracted the horrors oh hell yeah remember this owl hunting endangered species is the wrong screeched and boomed around wake as the monsters that you're a writer and you're threatened by your own imagination it's like your greatest power turned against you that's very deep but i'm a little busy not dying over here jeez always with the melodrama surrounded by the enemies you can get inside now al the big guy busted down the door whoa see out this is flashing always making things complicated this is just a memory even your memories are complicated uh yeah so i guess you're gonna need to talk to zane out there now that he's actually here i'm just gonna you know let you non-imaginary people talk in peace you have done well alan now i can accompany you you're trapped in your own dream you must wake yourself up but first you have to reach yourself the cabin yes my cabin it will not be easy your previous work can help you i still have some pages of your manuscript left words like that have power here the lighthouse it's very appropriate i can help you reach it but after that you will be on your own i cannot enter the cabin now the dark presence made sure that on our last encounter you are facing yourself the parts of your mind that are hard to control this is not a fight anyone else can win for you okay that's different i was glad to have zane with me in this place he knew the terrain such as cars if he was even human anymore after so many years in this place the world was tilted it was turning upside down wake was lost he would fall he couldn't tell which way he was up he would die here torn apart by the whirlwind the wind was picking up weight was too high too high at this height the water would be like hitting concrete it would throw him off it was made of darkness the dark presence just another memory but it could still kill so ah me things are getting pretty crazy here zane it's to be expected to reclaim yourself the landscape reflects that strain but each step takes you closer if you persevere you can attain the lucidity that thins off the darkness now that i knew what i was facing the environment became even wilder and stranger like it was no longer even bothering to pretend that things were normal ah so hmm hmm ah clint was forced to run through a maze hopelessly sprinting in the wheel never getting anywhere his life in miniature it was useless oh now what oh mr wake can i help you with anything let's have a look at your head mr wayne damn it i said please hmm huh an elevator sure why not next stop sanity you're doing well keep going it's hard to make sense of this place it's a dream this is a vast place home to forces and beings that are completely alien the dark presence yes i don't know what happened to it after your final encounter is there any way out of here sometimes transmissions can be sent between worlds you've done this yourself but to actually leave the dark place i haven't found a way stuckey's gas station but obviously i wasn't the one in the driver's seat would never make it the insanity he was facing was already a part of it in him his own doing he couldn't possibly win he didn't even want to at least the lighthouse was much closer now i would have to make my way up there somehow um ah foreign uh oh hmm uh oh ah the part of you that is in control is in the cabin dreaming and insane i don't think i like that you represent the part of alan wake that is capable of rational thought and planning which is why i'm talking to you if that part can regain control then you have a chance of making it but a part of you wants to give in there's comfort in the oblivion of dreams you represent the part that isn't ready to quit and die wait are you telling me i'm not real you're as real as anything else in this place yes and the one you called mr scratch he's me as well no zayn are you playing some kind of game with me i am not the author of your story how can you say that when you wrote that page about me and the clicker it wasn't one of my pages you directed me to it you had we regard it yes she was needed and you needed to click but i am not what i don't understand you should keep going zayn zane come on well that cleared things up foreign alive uh a moment i can help you here how the hell are you doing that it's like learning to control your dreams there's a connection you were in my dream yes i taught you you fixed the foolish mistake i made with barbara ah wake ran for the light it was pointless he would never reach it his life would be snuffed out just as easily as the very thing he thought would save him even with the light gone all i could do was keep going uh since we're being so frank here alan and let me just reiterate how happy i am that you've had this breakthrough i would like to summarize your condition by all means and please just let me know if you think i'm being unfair all right well let's start with the obvious the car crash untreated head trauma all due respect to doc nelson but he's hardly a neurosurgeon i think that the injury has affected you more than you realize yeah i have had bad headaches then there's your history of substance abuse which combined with your chronic insomnia has resulted in hallucinations and extremely poor impulse control that's a dangerous combination one which your wife has unfortunately had to suffer from far more than you i know i know she has i don't think i'm exaggerating when i say that you are existing in a state of all-encompassing denial your vivid fantasy casts you as a heroic victim and allows you to skirt responsibility for your own actions it allows you to solve your imaginary problems and dismiss the things that truly trouble you in your self-serving delusions your personal problems are assets that allow you to save alice perhaps even the world dr hartman i i think that's spot on i can't argue with any of that well i'm sure i'm stating the obvious i don't want to labor the point but well um no no i understand it's important that i face it precisely alan you've put so much effort and imagination into this self-deception but what good has it really done for you you refused my offer of help and here you are did being so obdurate really get you to a better place no no and did it really help alice was this really the best thing for your wife probably not probably not why don't we find out you know i've been talking with her there's something she wanted you to hear oh hey that sounds like fun all i ever wanted was to help you alan i ate all the [ __ ] you handed out and tried to understand your pathetic wealthy white male drama until my life consisted of managing your never-ending crisis i hate you for your childish temper and the arrogance and self-indulgent pride that undermine all efforts to drag you out of the hole you insisted on digging for yourself i hate you for leaving me in the dark with that insane monster [ __ ] all you had to do was act like a loving human being for once in your life and stay with me if your dramatic exit hadn't been more important than making sure i was all right she would never have taken me i don't know where you went but that's okay i don't want to know i don't think i'll ever be all right the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the hope that i'll never see you again ouch i i just can't argue with that i think i should stay here before i ruin what life she has left i think this is a breakthrough alan i'm really very proud of you it was nonsense i knew i'd saved her i'd succeeded in that and that was all that mattered what i heard in there wasn't the truth it was just another toxic mirage it cut deep but that made me all the more determined to force myself to snap out of it i didn't want to be that guy anymore i had to make myself see the light oh jeez foreign ah well done far but there's still a little further to go you must take full control of your own mind reject all of the fantasies you have constructed yeah well i think i can do that a lot of the stuff i've seen here is personal and ugly as hell i'll admit it hurts but it's not fooling me i know it's fake good you are aware the part of you bent on self-destruction is not but you must be careful just because you know the lies for what they are that doesn't make the danger any less real i'll make it i don't have any choice here i cannot come any further but this will help you on your way thanks hey let me tell you something alan i know how your mind works you screw up then you start analyzing it and before you know it you start writing all these horror stories in your head don't you come on i don't do that yes you do i know how it goes you're a complete failure i hate you and i'll never forgive you for whatever am i wrong oh man see i know you but alex they kept coming there were too many of them i loved the hearts and horns of them swarming over the landscape eager to kill they were coming for wake and this time they would get it with sheer numbers oh sure foreign foreign the lighthouse i was relieved to have made it here but i wasn't sure what was going to happen now zane had left me i wasn't sure what the dark presence had done to him if he couldn't follow but from now on i was on my own still he had gotten me this far i would never have made it by myself this thing was going to end it wouldn't be long now um i was surprised by the change of scenery but not much i was starting to understand the symbolism the way the dark place flooded wow it's gorgeous it's something all right hey al uh feeling kind of depressed here what so zange a new buddy now i feel abandoned this is ridiculous you're not even real that doesn't mean i don't have any feelings thing is you need to get all rational here abandon your fantasies right well i kind of hate to say this pal but i'm one fine you're abandoned bye al what i'm saying is the only way you're getting in that cabin is through me it's one of those kill your darlings things but hell you're used to that big shot ryder am i right it was in everything it was even taking the people turning his friends against him they were all against him what does it say about you when you're this dish that keeps yourself from getting bitter here we go i'm earning a 50 commission it's great that you first make yourself an imaginary friend and then you can't even get along with that guy evil skills al a master let's crack that writer's block of yours and a master of substance abuse you'll make a great could we discuss your relationship with your father impulse control because they make a dozen times over cfl because really running low on patience here uh is um uh to me it's too dark where am i i can't find my way why is this happening at me if i'm away it's too dark why why is this happening to me just like that my mind was clear zayn had been right i could think clearly again but i couldn't survive in this place the way he had and i might not make it back a second time leaving this place would be hard maybe impossible it wouldn't take much for my thoughts to stray again it was too easy to get lost in the dark place before i was ready to curl up and die let myself slip away but here i was the yet unwritten future waiting to unfold before me a sequel to departure my name is alan wake and i'm a writer you
