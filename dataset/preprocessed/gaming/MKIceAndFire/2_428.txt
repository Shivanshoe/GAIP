it okay guess it's time to fix the dimensions wonder what rivets up to hi wretched i'm ready what are you doing nothing just thinking about building the dimensionator and saving the universes are you nervous about meeting ratchet what yeah a little he is friendly i promise and once we build the dimensionator he will help us find dr nefarious right our adventure's coming to an end bolts you two and dr nefarious will be back in your own dimension in no time bull mongers are ready for purchase oh i love being a rocket launcher the warmonger a weapon whose destructive capability is matched only by its simplicity pull the fire trigger it shoots a rocket pull it again it shoots another rocket but what happens if you fire on third time [Music] come on back when you need more sugar sugar i do like the side of that come on back for upgrades when you level that up glad to be in service hey hey yes um hi um i have clank oh pal i am fine ratchet in fact i am beginning to like my new look for the record i found him like this come on i knew you wouldn't hurt clank pretty sure you're me after all wait what makes you so sure you're not me well i mean come on i uh you got nothing yeah i got nothing oh sorry rivet this is kit i have been looking forward to meeting you um me too i suppose it is time to fix this mess do you want to um thank you dr nefarious does this dimension love me or what my problems deliver themselves right to me how many times you beat this guy clearly not enough can i try be my guest [Music] [Music] you think you're so tough let's turn up the heat [Music] [Music] and let me enjoy my rain this is not looking good i've got it covered i'm totally fine what did you do with the emperor i never met the guy because i am definitely buying that [Music] it crowd how about a change of scenery [Music] two against one isn't fair so yep this is where i'm from funny story wait maybe i should focus pretend i'm not afraid i'll show you more brilliant and powerful than ever [Music] yes that's it i'm gonna send you into the heart of a supernova labels [Music] in front of this audience of my adoring [Music] [Applause] fans [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Laughter] wow what a battle [Music] are we done having fun come on give it up for rivet and her first victory i wish i could have been here sooner however i am thrilled to announce that i finished neutralizing my enemies with the exception of captain quantum and anyway when i heard that the rebel lombax was battling me i had to come hear the universe celebrate your defeat who was celebrating you mean them no wait i've been fighting rebels for years let me help you wipe them out ah my um strange fan wants to assist tantalizing why don't we make this interesting a home game perhaps he's going to sargasso i have to get there first we're coming with you ratchet we must find quantum he is the last rebel on that list go to ardolas and find pierre he'll take you to him wait if we are going to face the emperor we should gather as many resources as we can you're right maybe a good idea to hit the arena before we go little circle spotted the remains of our star in the junkyard [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh take damage never overriding our limiter nothing can hold you back come now [Music] [Music] please uh deep oh [Music] hmm [Music] chaos and violence yes it's an opportunity [Music] [Applause] [Music] the establishment has no place [Music] time for you to quit uh [Music] timmy [Applause] [Applause] shut down [Music] [Applause] [Music] is amazing that poisonous gas was supposed to kill exterminate their disgusting overly complicated bodies wait maybe turn it down a little and risk the aesthetic not even for you my friend not even [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] to extinguish [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] little zircon's only trigger is the sound of frozen to naughtiness aliens being obliterated with hammers so freezin [Music] can you see that [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] of sargasso for this oh operation [Applause] hmm would like thank you of course the emperor would come back just because he was on the news oh not for the dimensions falling apart the emperor has always been a threat to our universe we must get the dimensionator away from him before we have no home left to save make an entrance with the bombardier guaranteed for an explosive good time all of the other names on that hit list it is not your fault that they were captured [Music] have no fear little zircon has the bumba deer raid disaster on your enemies with merely a pull of your fire trigger the bombardier will soar over that battlefield and you know the rest go on you know you want it i do like the side of that let the uprights come commands looks like you got some open cells and the raritanium to match here to bob you tried to add extra water and blast off the emperor was bad enough but now that he has the dimensionator we will not lose your friends so if ratchet is an alternate dimension me and clank is an alternate dimension you were we meant to team up too they do seem happy together yeah guess being on my own is just what i'm used to me too so maybe this is just temporary furious is all this fighting really necessary can't we talk about this over some lemonade no the emperor despises lemonade nothing should be sour and sweet i am done with these guys nobody messes with the morts the emperor is truly the worst interested in swarming your enemies with black holes a doom try the black hole storm what is best in life love friendship no it is riddling your enemies with hundreds of bullets over and over again the black hole storm takes a second to spin up but when it does what is best in life love friendship no it is riddling your enemies with hundreds of bullets over and over again the black hole storm takes a second to spin up but when it does that one is just begging for an upgrade hey honey hey you done picking on the little guys emperor's forces are here for us i need you all of these rifts emperor has become even more dangerous with the dimensionators oh all enemies neutralize your friends are safe for now let's go talk to morton find out what's going on you are just the best a little too much [Music] oh rivet sorry you had to come save us again we tried to hold our own i fixed up the secret bead and everything but one of those dimensional thingamajiggers is blocking it from taking off first off none of this was your fault second leave the thingamajigger to us raise her up by the way say hi to kit hey there kit any friend of rivet is a ton of hours um hello that's maynard the mort says helper bot he'll lead us to the secret [Music] is tell the emperor he should come say hi himself [Music] right he is taking out all life on the planet come on we have to keep following maynard rivers it's a bit tasty nice of you to disrupt my welcome wagon i put a lot of thought i hope you don't mind i've watched from a distance i'm just exhausted from eliminating your allies i seem better resisting to be honest a lot of talk for a hologram why would i waste my energy fighting you and your fellow rebels will still be a memory along with this sludgy excuse for a planet [Laughter] [Music] yeah keep laughing let's see how you feel when we free the seeker pete threatening me over holograms classy instilling fear from a distance is a common tool of oppressors i have seen it many times in my studies but we should come here so i can stick getting closer to the secret let's keep pushing forward the emperor requires your immediate incarceration loyal subject our troopers will assist in your [Music] compliance [Music] surprise let's keep master maynard [Music] thorough it'll be okay we'll free the secret pete and the fight will start going our way it will [Music] uh somebody must be missing a lot of crates if i'm careful i bet i could carve out a path i'm so cut my glutes have glutes out there i'm like trapped outside of space and time with nothing to wash my gate they're fading wow right [Applause] so [Music] wow [Applause] ah oh oh [Music] for the emperor sure why not [Music] [Music] i gears [Music] [Music] resistance i am looking forward to examining that so when i was with clank he it is just like what i imagine [Music] get get you're all right this oh this is an electric sphere oh you remembered your training what happened to clank he's traveling to our doors with ratchet you two have met he's been helping me take care of these dimensional anomalies oh so that explains why this all feels so familiar it does fascinating some kind of dimensional deja vu anyway care to help absolutely wow feeling lighter does that spinergizer look powered down maybe it could use a boost that's intriguing the spinergizer converted the dimensional energy into action beautiful job kit you're just as fast a loner as clank how bad are things now well we're circling the drain it seems that the dimensional cataclysm has been intensifying even faster than i expected i assume the emperor stealing the dimensionator and firing it recklessly has something to do with that ah that would do it all right so what do you think of clank oh talented resourceful very shiny agreed agreed agreed i can see why he'd be your counterpart what does that mean it's a compliment kit to both of you what do you think of clan we have barely spoken but i am glad my counterpart is a good guy you were worried about that it is a reasonable concern well it wasn't for me you're good no great so of course he would be too [Music] um [Music] that synergizer could use some energizing hello [Music] look at you kit you're doing work worthy of being catalogued in the archives that synergizer could use some energizing so if clank is with ratchet does that mean you're here with rivet as we have been destined to be is that what you think is happening i do not know with ratchet we worked well together but i was always worried about disappointing him and i still am with revit but it also feels like we already know each other well destiny or not i hope rivet realizes how lucky she is to have you this should elevate things i hope i'm not interrupting the process that spinergizer could use some energizing super heavy energy that's it you know that you've done better than i would have if i had been in your shoes right what you went out into the unknown without a lifeline doing the last thing you ever wanted to do and you're succeeding i could never have done that but you are trying to fill in for your father helping clank and i navigate all of this you are doing that and succeeding in that case go with us go us that synergizer could use some energy i am so proud of you well done i could not have done it without you [Music] gary thanks a bunch there kid now these jerks will really find out who they're messing with don't you know wash please nice work want to blow that up i could be persuaded not exactly a straight line to the battle cruiser but that hurl shot should get us closer you know it is quality when you buy from miss zerkon you unlocked it sugar gotta blast some more patties before you can upgrade that one you will be missed sweet thing trying to use my own secret beat against me oh i do stop watching others embarrass themselves yes i think you possibly hope to defeat me the barriers right honestly now i want to see how far you can go before i trample you now i want to see how far you can go i'm about to find out i'm coming for you the love bags have reached the cruiser sorry to crash the party oh [Music] [Music] uh how do we sync this thing maybe there's a way to damage its power source good thinking let's look around [Music] let's make things a little more interesting shall we all cruises activate your destructo beans planetary devastation finally did he just say planetary devastation river our equipment's gone haywire the cruisers are blasting straight through the planet's crust those destructor beams can destroy an entire planet in mere minutes the emperor is going to wipe out all of sargasso we'll keep her busy with our pesky sneaker piece you got it oh a cruiser has been destroyed i'm devastated whatever will i do i know it shields up my darling battle cruisers shields just couldn't be easy those shields were impenetrable to any weapon we have i do not know how we will detach them [Music] hey we threw together some bombs at our gelatonium stash that should help you take down those shields pretty can pick them up and toss them at the cruisers they're the bones mort mentioned let's grab one let's see how their shields hold up against one of these take that emperor nefarious nice kit let's keep it up that lizard has bombs now i grew tired of waiting all cruisers increased beam strength to 120 i want sargasso broken oh geez things are rumbling and tumbling down here rivets we're all counting on youtube so jason is becoming unstable we must act quickly and destroy the other battle [Music] cruisers [Music] destroy it all exterminate all of those flying creatures too oh blind come on you did it we did it there they are [Music] all right all right you're welcome mort break got the lemonade we're getting crazy tonight [Applause] another unlikely win just in time to cross you off the list after zordo prison you go oh who needs tradition let's spice things up we appear to be in a pocket dimension huh luckily the all-knowing emperor didn't realize i know exactly how to get out of him no too far come on rips work with me here you two seem to have a lot of history yeah you could say that i've bought a long time to win our galaxy back lost friends my arm the emperor did that oh uh uh not exactly it happened during a mission i found a secret entrance into the emperor's tower so i tried to sneak in alone the door was right there i didn't notice when a nefarious war bots was nearby i thought i could run i am i wasn't fast enough then it just stopped i got away before i could finish the job but i built myself this cool new arm so it's not all bad rivet i that's fine hey look an exit check this out let's get to xerkeys maybe ratchet and clank have some good news foreign
