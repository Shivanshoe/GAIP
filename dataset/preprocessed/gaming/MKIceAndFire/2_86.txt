in a universe populated by monsters giants and larger-than-life beings i was determined to find my own path to the top of the mountain in sports entertainment i wasn't gifted with superhuman size or strength but i did have an insatiable thirst to learn the physical gifts to take to the air and an uncle who was more than happy to give me the tools needed to become one of the greatest competitors to ever lace up a pair of boots starting my career in mexico i'd be known first as a verde which means the green lizard and hummingbird still a teenager i would eventually earn the highest honor from my uncle as i was officially crowned rey i would take everything i had learned from my uncle and make it all my own i would bring lucha libre to the world stage i would make cruiserweights as popular as our heavyweight counterparts and i would prove that a cruiserweight could win it all as long as they were given the opportunity i would arrive in america first stopping an ecw before garnering the attention from the top people at wcw who quickly signed me to a contract with my foot in the door it was just a matter of time before i took over the world of sports entertainment every step of battle every opponent a new face who felt they were superior to me every match giving me a new objective to strive to meet should i try to weaken their legs throw all of my aerial techniques at them maybe surprise them with some defensive lucha libre take it to the outside show off my newest move by the time i got to the ring i always had a little mental list of things i wanted to try in order to win and with every victory i got another reminder that the best was yet to come after winning wcw's cruiserweight championship cruiserweight tag team championship and the world tag team championship i would finally head to wwe to further build my legacy in the near 20 years since i debuted in wwe i have become known as quite simply the greatest luchador in sports entertainment history the greatest mass superstar of all time ray is the king having competed against every big name possible and having defeated nearly everyone that stepped in my way not every road is paved with gold and mine was no different but even when the world gets challenging there's always opportunity the opportunity to learn from mistakes to grow as a competitor and to get better i may not have had my hand raised every time out but there's never been a time where i didn't leave the ring better than when i entered [Music] the memories behind the infamous match of halloween havoc 1997 which i truly believe is a match that put me on the map i was a big fan of eddie growing up so to be able to forward all these years and then eventually share the ring with them it was incredible it was an honor for me to face one of the guerreros overall that match was highly important for me the fact that i could become cruiserweight champion that night and defend my mask not have to be unmasked you know that was something that was really in the back of my mind i just didn't want to go through that they were trying to take off every lootadores mask one by one and i was on the list so you could only imagine the stress that had built up and for us luchadores it's very prized possession you know this is something that i've carried since 1992 we both know addie and i what the mask means to us that carry it so he knew what was at stake i would never give him the satisfaction of taking my mask never [Applause] [Music] you know that's that slingshot same time that eddie always does it's beautiful to see when you're not on the receiving end but it sucked being on the other end of that center and seeing him taught me you know it kind of boosted me up it fueled me up to keep going during that match [Applause] ah hmm wow but then i get a dropkick on the back of my head i was starting to really wonder if i'd be able to win this thing and was really getting desperate [Applause] uh [Applause] ah [Applause] me [Applause] two incredible bring awareness respect [Applause] two three one two ah three uh [Applause] eddie had me in a splash mountain move when the only thing i could think of at that point took them into a runner that's exactly what i did i remember taking him down felt my knees bang against the mat but i hooked that one leg and then i just pushed my weight forward and i just heard the one two three it was over at that point i have to admit regaining the championship was one of the greatest feelings in the world i've sat and watched that match i actually watched it not too long ago with my son dominic and it's a match that i still learn from and you know it's a match that doesn't get old i truly believe that if there was no eddie guerrero my career would have gone a different direction eight years after our epic halloween habit clash eddie and i were on better terms but still found ourselves unable to resist the friendly competition in wwe holding the wwe tag team championships only drove us to wonder who the better man on the team was we both held victories over the other but the chance to meet at the showcase of the immortals wrestlemania was something we couldn't pass up for the first time ever two tag team champions would go one on one at the grandest stage of them all we both knew what this match meant to the other and it's what made it so fun to go out there and try to take the glory for ourselves with no hard feelings of course [Applause] oh uh wow you know i take this back to halloween havoc i try to get fancy with them he pulled me off the apron immediately so this time i made sure i ended up on top in the ring when i wanted to show off for a quick second live and learn correct wow [Applause] oh yeah oh one two three four foreign one two but again always eddie he knew and had incredible ring awareness another backbreaker i was really wondering if this was just not gonna be my night two oh thank you me eddie went for the back breaker one more time which he already done before and i made him pay with the perfect my signature move from feeling hopeless to beyond words that i won so many times he'd won i'd win but i swear that at wrestlemania 21 i faced the best version of eddie guerrero the man there's a small part of me that still can't believe i pulled it out i was actually shocked he was just on a different level that night what a win that was for me historical the toughest thing about this day was what we were all living what we were going through it was hard for us to accept that eddie was no longer with us everyone was hurting i asked myself what would eddie have done and eddie was all about the business whatever happened show must go on i did expect to wrestle shawn one day just not under those terms one of the greatest legends in wwe history he has a lot of respect for this business and for the superstars that are up and coming by shawn michaels asking me if if i had the energy and the courage to have a match against him that night he didn't have to choose me but he did because he knew that eddie would have loved it that speaks of the type of human being that he is losing eddie was one of the most painful experiences in both my personal and professional life the wwe universe came together to pay tribute to one of the most respected and beloved superstars of all time this was a difficult night for all of the obvious reasons but we wanted to put on a show that eddie would be proud of i found myself in a rare one-on-one match with another living legend the heartbreak kid shawn michaels of course i wanted to win for myself for my fans and for eddie and while sean was also grieving i knew that he would still give me everything he had just as eddie would have wanted [Applause] uh put one two [Applause] you don't see this often and i was really surprised to see hbk make such a basic error if that 619 connects i'm thinking to myself it's over i remember sean biting on that 619 fake out and just thinking to myself let's go and just launching myself adam to the floor right wow ah so i connect with the 619 and i already know what's coming next springboard like when i hit that and i saw that he didn't move and i connected i remember hooking the leg and i was in awe when i heard the three i couldn't believe it i really was shot [Music] now you have to keep in mind this is my first time facing sean michaels but at the same time my brother had just passed so mixed emotions but i felt like a truly blessed man and i know eddie was watching i know eddie was in that ring he had a special corner that night and enjoyed every minute of it just like we did i believe defending a championship is way harder than becoming a champion there's always more pressure defending keeping that title that you work hard to get anyone who ever wants to become champion they just want to destroy they want to take what's yours and with a guy like jbl he just wants to destroy you he would always nag and put you down he would step on you and step on you crush you down and just make you feel this big being the smallest superstar in that ring facing giants in a world of giants that was my fuel to overcome every time i step into the ring i had finally reached the pinnacle of wwe by winning the world heavyweight championship at wrestlemania in honor of my good friend eddie guerrero as a world heavyweight champion i knew i had a target on my back and would face some of my toughest opponents including john bradshaw layfield jbl always made it very easy to get motivated for a match his loudmouth the constant mockery and his knack for crossing the line to make things personal he didn't think i was a real champion he thought i'd just be a stepping stone to his reign as a dual champion went into judgment day ready to show him that all his bluster and power wasn't enough to stop rey mysterio oh yeah whoa [Applause] two [Applause] three five [Applause] three four five six seven me [Applause] um wow uh [Applause] good [Applause] oh when that big boot catches you right across the face you're talking to size 13 all in your face [Applause] [Applause] four two five [Applause] good [Applause] foreign [Applause] common move in wrestling suplex obviously i didn't see this happen because i was on the floor and i'm glad i didn't because i would have got right back up and kicked him in the face wow [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] six [Applause] seven i remember hitting jbl with the baseball slide dropkick right at the side of his legs and yeah to remind jbl just who he was messing with this was such a satisfying win nobody throws you off your game like jbl getting the victory meant a ton to me and of course and still world champion the big red machine kane had his sight set on eliminating me from wwe in 2008 the monstrous seven foot tall behemoth took pleasure in mocking my pain and misery kane thought he could use his mind games to break me but i wasn't gonna let that happen it's tough keeping your head in the game when facing someone is so sick and sadistic but at cyber sunday before the wwe universe would choose our match stipulation the fans chose no holds barred i didn't know what type of strategy i was going to bring to the table that night my technique has always been ariel maneuvers at an old holds barred match i made a promise to myself that i wasn't going to show fear how do i take the big man down hit him with whatever i got i was going to meet him head on regardless of the match type and show him that you can't break navy stadium uh now oh [Applause] and kane already had me in big trouble anytime he hits you takes you out foreign good dude oh the back of my head i knew that kane had more left in the tank but i was going to try to do anything i could to try to pin him and win definitely a little let down that he kicked out but i just had to stay focused and on top of them put them into the stairs with the drop toe hold maybe [Applause] here's where i took all my chances it was now or never i had to put kane away and i was going to empty my tank if i needed to once i hit the 619 and the springboard splash it was over now [Music] to let the fans down they were the ones that chose this match they wanted to know dq match here it is and what a true honor to be wwe legend like kane and a hall of famer i mean i have to admit cain is special but an evil special when i became intercontinental champion i was honored to hold the title with such a vast legacy of greatness i was excited to face new challengers as the landscape was evolving a brash newcomer named dolph ziggler thought he had me figured out and brushed me to the side my point of view of dolph ziggler coming in i had the utmost respect for him he was very exciting to watch he had a style but with a new spike to it a new feel to it i knew dolph was hungry coming into this match and he was one of the up-and-coming superstars but there's a mistake that he made that you never make in this business doll felt like he was already the intercontinental champion before our match had even started so i made sure to teach him a very valuable lesson at the biggest party of the summer at summerslam dolph's arrogance was going to be his downfall if i had my way [Applause] oh [Applause] yes no problem i'm defending my championship you know that meant some more high-risk lucha libre too wow [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] ziggler showed me some real high ring iq when he went for broke here but he also showed his experience when he let me regroup right next to him while this was all going down and he was doing his tantrum can't do that when you're against me ah dog's an incredible opponent no doubt about that but that night i was at a level [Music] i'd like to think he learned a lot from that loss like maybe even i helped him become great you know but what a big win that was for me i love being intercontinental champ love defending it against hungry competitors like dolph ziggler that bragging rights for the world heavyweight title was every man for himself i would have thought that batista would have known that walking into that match no stranger to betrayal throughout my career i had people that i thought were friends end up turning their backs but this one for some reason it hit a very soft spot i couldn't make sense of what had gone down after weeks of verbal and physical assaults i knew that we could never go back to the way things were i wanted to make him feel the same way i did to return that feeling to him and the best way i could think to do that was to beat him on smackdown and get that number one contender spot that batista felt belong to him [Applause] yes i knew batista's game plan from the get-go was gonna be the man handle me it definitely did the trick [Applause] oh [Applause] three four three oh [Applause] ah element so i just drop kicked him back down to reality he gave me a chance to reset the match just a little and i was happy to take it [Applause] ah [Applause] uh what's up oh i was going out on my sword you know i wanted to get revenge on him but i knew the best way to do it was winning the match and taking the world championship opportunity for me batista just wanted to hurt me and his forgetting the gold made it possible for me to get that win i hated having to fight him hey you got to do what you got to do once that bell rings after dealing with batista i felt like i was at the top of my career that was a number one contender i went into the 2010 royal rumble fully believing in myself confident that i could defeat him i knew i had the speed advantage and that if i could maybe take out a leg or catch him with something unexpected i had a chance it's not just the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog right well this dog had just found himself in the yard of the top dog the fina it would take everything i had to avoid ending the night resting in peace [Applause] oh [Applause] unfortunately for me he was more than ready for that plan but i'd seen the blood i'd hurt him he was human and i knew if i just kept at it i could win this match and become world heavyweight champion again i just had to get back to my feet wow [Applause] [Applause] ah three really going aerial is always a double exit had me struggling to get my breath once again what could i do to this guy to stop him uh oh oh an undertaker did what he does best and my name was added to the tombstone of all his victims coming so close to defeating him and having him just take it away in an instant after you compete with undertaker you gain a full appreciation for why he truly is the phenom and forever will be it wouldn't be the last time we compete but it's one of my favorite matches even if it didn't go my way that night with the wwe championship controversially vacated in the summer of 2011 i fought and clawed to the finals of the wwe title tournament with my opponent the miz had to face three different opponents to get to the top of the tournament dolph ziggler our truth and then the miz i hate the miz inside that ring because he's very dangerous he'll do anything to win maybe we weren't in the middle of a huge personal rivalry but there was no chance i was going to let the miz stand in my way of finally winning the wwe championship with an opponent as tricky as he is i have to be ready for anything every time you face him you just don't know what he's going to come up with to try to steal one from you which can make the whole pace of the match feel fast and chaotic but i thrive in that environment and that night i was going to use every bit of my experience to get that victory [Applause] ah [Applause] maybe i have come in taking this a little lightly but i can tell you after i kicked out here i understood that i was going to be in a dog fight despite his thing saying otherwise on this night he had not come out to play oh now foreign [Applause] two miss took advantage when i let frustration take over for a second and that ddt that he hit me with had me seen stars maybe he didn't get the pin there i don't know but if i made another mistake like that i was gonna pay miz would be leaving the arena with his second wwe championship uh [Applause] uh [Applause] uh ah then the 619 landed and i saw he wasn't really moving at all as i climbed those ropes the winner i never thought i'd hold the wwe championship when i started getting that three count on miz holding that championship in my hands it was an incredible moment in my career even if it didn't last as long as i would have hoped no one can take that achievement away from me and without someone like the liz to push me in that bout i truly wouldn't know if it would have meant as much as it did after a short time away i finally returned home to wwe and was looking to make an impact and found myself in the crosshairs of the samoan submission machine some more joe i believe some more joe is very dangerous and many qualities in this game he's strong he's fast his submissions are incredible i felt all of those three and more every time i faced him each time we met it felt like he found a new body part to target derail my wwe return so soon with the chance to battle him again on raw i knew that if i could dig deep and avoid his devastating blows i had a chance which against joe is all you can really ask for [Applause] [Music] [Applause] uh wow joel thought he could just do whatever he wanted to me i definitely overestimated the damage i'd done to joe at this point he just waited for me to come to him and i obliged huge painful mistake right there yes had to get creative if i was going to win over joe never had someone just block the 619 before like that joe's little and i had to act fast precision beats power correct placed the boot perfectly and got myself a little time just to breathe but if i didn't do something quick this was going to be like every other match i've had with joe one two three uh foreign luckily he went to lift me up and not go for a cover right there joe had me right where he wanted me but he waited just a little too long to act and that gave me the time to realize what was happening i counter the unagi [Music] and finally get the pinball victory over him i know the united states championship wasn't on the line that night but beating some more joe that night made me feel like a real champion joe made me realize immediately in my return that wwe hadn't gone any easier and i'd had to be on my a game each and every night he's an incredible opponent not too bad of a guy when he's not jumping you after you beat him for the u.s championship i guess throughout my career i competed against the best luchadores on the planet and i own victories over them all the greatest match superstar in wwe history the chance to take on another lucha libre master in grand metallic was something that got me very excited competing against another lucha lord it motivates me it inspires me to learn from the new generation and i have something to teach them as well this guy right here garam matalik at one time was watching me on tv and said i want to do that and look at him now one of the best he's the king of the ropes loves to fly it's a different style of high flying it's a different control this generation has something new under their sleeve you have to respect that the heritage and culture of luche libre in great hand here when i had the opportunity to face iran with the league i knew these were deep roots we were going back to where i began i was so excited to give the wwe universe a taste of true lucha and knew this was a dream match that they couldn't afford to miss [Applause] yeah uh from the second he grabbed me i knew right away that he was here to make a statement he pulled out and then just rolled me up one two kick out i was like wow okay i knew at the beginning of this that he was gonna bring a fight but he really brought the fight two three oh six seven aah [Applause] three this was like peanut butter and jelly i hit the centon and right after that anything and that rana man i don't remember even being knocked out so hard normally it's me giving them not taking them i still had the fight with them kicked out at two but i had to stay sharp if i want to leave with my hand raised gran me talik wasn't letting up now this match had been non-stop back and forth action and i knew we were both getting a little tired in there honestly i was and i thought he was as well so that he didn't offer much resistance to the runner i thought maybe this is the right time i was on the path of the six one nine it connects in a matter of moments finishing up with a frog splashing back and forth at its finest when that frog splash landed i knew that was it it was over now i gotta say put up a hell of a fight he was everything i expected and much more to be as an opponent and i told him once it was over i would love to have this match once again i love seeing the next wave of luchadores and getting to test myself against one of the best and the upcoming was very special to me getting the win of course just makes it much sweeter okay [Music] rivalries in wwe often go beyond pride or championships and turn personal with that said i've never felt a more personal better and gruesome rivalry than i did with seth rollins the messiah and his disciple murphy attacked my livelihood and targeted my eye that particular attack was unexpected once they took that they targeted my family and brutalized my son down for months our intense rivalry continued to escalate and i knew it was coming to a head i desperately wanted revenge at payback we were going to show seth and murphy that they picked on the wrong family to mess with and we were going to return all the pain they put on us right dominic was going to show me that he was more than capable of standing on his own i was surprised as much as the wwe universe with his ability to perform wrestling against seth rollins summerslam for the first time that was his first match ever and he'd done moves he had never done before positioning timing that all takes years to learn and he managed to pick up on it in one night teaming with my son for the first time i felt like i was flying higher than any west coast bomb we were going to overwhelm them from the start nothing was going to stop the mysterio family that night nothing oh um [Applause] we obviously want to get our pay back here but i definitely had a moment where it just hit me i'm teaming up with my son we're doing a wait this is what you want huh be careful what you wish for ray okay yeah uh we're against it was really hard to stand on countless championships and let me tell you they really were allowed nothing felt as good as this one did getting the team with my son was easily the proudest moment of my career and seeing him get the win was a rush unlike anything else revenge was great but seeing my son succeed is what mattered the most is i'm so proud when i first started in this game there were a lot of doubts about what i'd be able to accomplish from day one i took that doubt and used it to fuel my desire to reach for the sky and achieve everything i could desire in this business whether that meant taking to the air against fellow luchadores and high flyers or trying to out maneuver the greatest mad technicians or simply trying to avoid the biggest finishers from the biggest monsters i was always ready to prove that i had the ability to not just be good to not only become a champion but to go down in history as one of the greatest superstars of all time i've traveled the world in search of the highest competition and while things didn't always go my way i made sure to try and turn every negative into a positive when you have the entire world taking urine over your head sometimes the best feeling in the world is reminding them that you're exactly where you're supposed to be after spending over 30 years in sports entertainment i still have the same hunger the same desire to show people that doubt me that they're making a mistake i still want to win championships and i still want to compete at the highest level i just have the added benefit of getting to watch my son now walk the roads that i traveled years before he'll face those same doubts and hopefully i've given him the tools to overcome and prove people wrong as for me the greatest mask of all time well let's just say that this old filthy animal still has plenty of tricks left up his sleeve plenty of 619s left to dial up and plenty of lessons to teach the wwe superstars i'm fortunate enough to say that i'm so proud of what i've done in the ring proud of who i've competed against proud of who i've defeated and proud of the records i've set the love of the fans the friendships i've made everywhere i've been and the security sports entertainment has given my family i couldn't have asked for anything more it's no mystery that the love of the fans is what makes me truly feel like a king [Music] you
