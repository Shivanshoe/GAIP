would you i get the distinct feeling that you're looking for someone of the earth persuasion i get it man i get it us earthers we all look the same it's not like you guys who very clearly look different get to the point the point is is i can help you find who you're actually looking for terence do all look the same except this taren's got a word on his back just like the bounty says what's that word on your back saying the die hard nowhere or maybe it says star-lord either way get him we've been hired to clobber some karen with words on his jacket uh uh lots of people have jackets [Music] uh lady h whatever lady hailbender's paying you i'll double it no dice you don't cross i'll triple it [Music] did we just talk about this scrawny little tear this is maybe we sit down have a choker dog start this over [Music] okay okay okay yep yeah timeout wow heart is pumping guys it's very clear that we're evenly matched [Music] oh well that sucks but we're all professionals here right right maybe we can work something out [Music] peter shoot now we need to keep them separated draw them apart before shooting peter they've had this trap ready for a while [Music] we need to split them up now this is almost a fair fight [Music] this new one is pretty quick [Music] am i ever glad to see you where'd she come from [Music] [Music] miss us [Music] black hole guys huddle up [Music] i've got this one peter let me end it my blade will not be silent purpose call me that again and i'll murder you i am not the enemy traitor guys guys chill out stop fighting each other we'll win this together just focus on the enemy in front of us chill out and share the winning with all of us who's with me fields caution prepare yourself you will keep drawing their attention the slicey one is you don't stand a chance these what is happening come on it's gonna be sick it's about these zombies that invade earth and then it's up to these kids that have to blow them away of course you would remember that and then i asked you if you packed your lunch and you gave me a blank stare i'll be careful mom i always am not so fast before you go there's something i want to talk to you about something i want to give you 20 bucks don't push it think of it as a long overdue gift from your father it's upstairs on my bed go on and get it while i finish up in the kitchen and we can open it together hey kubrick buddy no matter how long you wait here for grandma and grandpa they're not coming back i'm sorry little guy put up a big fight wouldn't have been able to land him without grandpa's tricks sure it'd be nice to believe there are other worlds out there but what are the odds pretty slim i bet dan says every ufo sighting is really a weather balloon or a bright star but there's so many of them couldn't the few be real i'm gonna have to get mom to show me how to shoot grandpa was supposed to this summer meredith quill perfect game not bad i knew you wouldn't wait [Music] do you know what a birthright is peter [Music] it's something that's a part of you like your name before your father returned to space [Music] i know it sounds crazy that you've never believed me but something has changed and now more than ever you need to trust me and maybe this will help [Music] wow [Music] easy there cowboy these belong to your father i used to think he left these for our protection [Music] but they might as well be paperweights [Music] still if they're enough to convince you of who he really was then maybe they're protection enough protection from what your father wasn't just from another planet peter he was he was important and important men have enemies what sword enemies i'm not sure exactly his people were at war and he knew that if he stayed with us the war would follow him to earth so he made the hard choice [Music] he gave up this life for the sake of his people your father left to protect us and for 13 years it worked but now something's coming [Music] i know we're being watched mom if you really want to play a game that bad you could have just said so i hope i'm wrong peter i really do [Music] but being the son of a king on any planet means that you are going to have a target on your back for the rest of your life and you're plenty brave but you're gonna have to be smart too things may get messy i'm gonna let kubrick out i'll be right back [Music] sick oh [Music] hmm mom i can't believe you weren't lying aliens really exist hmm [Music] [Music] for now [Music] these lackluster bounty hunters claim lady hellbender hired them to kill us hey we're no slouches we're part of a league now no no no not a league it's a legion what's the difference don't know and don't care cause we ain't slouches most confirmed kills you said yourself she'd hunt us to the end of the universe i had hoped she'd send a monster not these two we would have murderized you but don't worry there's more coming did you hear that peter quill a silver lining yeah that's great drax be silent hey this is a big mistake i'm innocent cosmo are you out there cosmo nice that you finally showed up would have been even nicer if you didn't abandon me in the first place i never left one minute we're having a great time in the next wait a second did you use me as bait well your plan worked a little too well seeing how we're in jail now we're all in prisons of our own making peter breaking lady age will get us out of here then i reckon someone will a name miss lady hellbender should we be straight [Music] [Music] hey guys didn't expect to see you here yeah cram it flat no flat nerd yeah and a scruff ruin one too shut up and get in there come on dude what's your problem you are that's why we quit yes you did now stop talking to him rock it buddy come on we had a good thing going you and groot are better than two-bit bounty hunters scoff what did you say i said scoff you don't say scoff you just scoff oh so now i don't express myself proper like you know what you're a real piece of art what do you think i was going to say i thought you were about to say rocky dude woof we should have left you in when we bought the cans [Music] i told you a bajillion times i'm not a ruffin animal what are you talking about where are we you are still unknown osmo how you doing buddy we're just about guardian of galaxies will tell cosmo get biscuits you work with blood brothers create destruction so pesky raccoon and synthetic tree friend can use continuum cortex cosmo also known guardian of galaxies have nova tracker on sheep i'm sure it's just one big misunderstanding right right we're here because something happened guardian of galaxies yeah we went to find centurion corral and pay our fine why strange transmissions spreading across galaxy like rabbits in springtime cosmos sent many team to investigate non-return now nova rock sending same signal guardian of galaxy will tell me what they saw the nova corps were killing each other [Music] it was like they were drinking funky juice or something or joined the cult yeah during that ritual with the priest they kept talking about a promise [Music] that's them that old man that's with him shuttle exploded on the hall as hope grand unifier raker leader of the universal church of truths that membrane billf cosmo is old cult very powerful during galactic war now not so much you said the rock was transmitting a signal what if the religion were somehow yet the universal church of truths died with gold's king god let us investigate the household for you what you said none of your team's return right seems to me like you're short staffed we want to find out what happened as much as you do do so let us investigate for you always catch peter quinn and not fun kind with paul simple drop the charges contact nova corps hq and get the world mind to forgive our fine then we'll go it's not being so easy face it dog breath you need us us for now unless you got someone else stupid enough to go in soviet russia cosmo would not trust words of capital is come but this is not motherland and cosmo no power of collateral guardianship still nowhere what you can't take our ship my ship how are we going to find the hallows hope yes now come essence of time you mean the first mining colony is still here now abandoned mostly entirely stopped so this is the place you broke into broke implies it took effort wait this is the continuum cortex is the best way to reach nova ship before moves again you feel karel where is she currently in illiteracy orbiting michael contraxia cosmonauts surprised garbage planet their restrooms do provide valuable information the entire planet now broadcasts same signal as nova rock cosmonaut understand purpose or in touch don't worry cosmo we'll get to the bottom of this weird broadcast or die trying no wait dude i've got your back thanks crew i know you do how many people know about this place enough is not broadcast across girls but scientists come from many backgrounds if thanos had known this was here nah dead titan king no longer concerned for clause i am surprised the rodent so what is this like another elevator they'll figure it out we used to stand back witchcraft i know it's like they've never seen a giant trans-dimensional hand before please to step involved what if things go sideways how do we get back with passport can communicate with cosmo and if emergency bring guardian of galaxies back better you take it than captain valor over here this time investigate nova ship use passport to report findings and you'll speak to the world mind get rid of that fine right those won't do best good luck guardian of anyone see any seat belts you better not throw up this time sorcery i was going to say dizzying you get used to what kind of name is avengers is that sound normal normal you ain't heard nothing yet oh pat benatar and john jet watch over us who are these gods who speak goddesses uh drax i am not the one laughing it's obviously an [Music] or illness an alternate reality i know i am proud definitely next stop alice hope probably hold on groot here we go you guys okay do we look okay we'll hang in there i'll try to restore gravity oh great we're gonna be stuck like this forever rocket body what am i looking for tracks tell skutt lord most ships use external power conduits to generate pseudo-gravity in hyperbaric air locks the beast says to find a power conduit right and what do those look like tell him any vestiges of power should show up on his visor and to stop asking so many flocking questions and get us down from here [Music] something terrible happened here what gave it away the lack of gravity or the general destruction both are undeniable clues [Music] i am making mental notes of the investigation it seems pertinent that a number of escape pods are missing rocket what were you two doing in the cortex coming back from a job a successful one okay i've got two conduits here someone tell them to turn them on thanks buddy [Music] any day now peter yes our investigation cannot continue until we anyone else thinking rocket should be the one with the rocket boots [Music] nothing's happening gamora tell them to check the power supply it's empty then tell him to find a battery did you catch that yeah yeah bro call the mud let him know his hand gave us his finger you think insulting him will keep us out of jail we have not yet completed the investigation we should wait nope useless [Music] go to danger mission cosmopix not to worry ah an accurate impersonation i am impressed the mutt's playing us for patsy's storm drain find the battery yet we are still floating so no might be just what we need then pick it up already okay got us a battery took him long enough hey i'm trying man and we're still floating around okay i got the battery installed tomorrow but nothing's happening seriously fine i'll tell them listen up slug breath tell me what you see uh there's a blue wire and two connections yellow and red and one big green thing don't touch the green thing what a great time to start yelling dude okay okay first plug the wire to either connection all we need is a little jump start to either one it's not brain surgery just pick one i have begun to enjoy this weightlessness it feels like when hovat and i fell in love we were shoved naked from a cliff in a cataphian mating ritual someone tell quill to hurry up weird isn't a strong enough word get him to hurry why isn't he doing anything just connect the wire quill when nothing happens you can try something else what if something terrible happens then it hopefully only happens to you not super inspiring dude you must here goes nothing oh crap everybody [Music] gravity was not restored had one job quill i did exactly what who were those big red jumps you tussled with impressive peter quill i didn't know you could do that neither did i those firearms are becoming quite formidable second time they've transformed like that what do you mean fine brood won't call the mud until we all agree on a cold war it could be useful if we get cornered by whatever's on the ship how about quell kill not covert enough must be something said in everyday conversation easy we went on a dumb mission and quill killed us oh oh the co-word is ride the stars and we should hold off calling cosmo until we figure out what's going on we should also standardize our use of the term dog report item to distinguish information of interest to our investigation yep sure thing buddy dog report item something caused novacore to abandon their ship maybe they all just quit some people don't give up when things start going wrong was that a crack no it was a pointed criticism they're upset how do you think i feel can we just focus on what happened here i agree the dog's investigation is our priority and finding out what happened to corral and nicki i wonder what else peter's guns can do if he'd let me look at him i could tell you this is the only way out but the door's got no juice that'll do it if i had any units i said that button you what we were getting into here he did not require much convincing that ain't good what was it i don't know but i think it shook a couple of my teeth loose there you all felt that right yep the same thing happened when i tried to restore the gravity it ain't never his fault is it grooth dast looks just like what happened on the rock indeed it was a desperate attempt at a last defensive position good bottleneck for it all the blaster scorch marks are from standard issue nova rifles dog report item belligerents are using similar weapons if this was a fight then where are all the bodies good point they weren't any in the evacuation hangar either maybe everyone escaped i wouldn't get your hopes up peter okay we need to get to carell's office someone tell quill come on dude can't we just talk to each other fine you do know your girlfriend probably didn't make it now you are just being spiteful still nothing but emergency power dog report item power outage in several sections of the ship what are we missing let's run through it all we got arrested by your girlfriend as did the church man grand unifier raker and then his ship exploded so maybe that's where it started raker might have had something on his ship a gas maybe the explosion could have released it i've used something like that before right pump it into the vents and it spreads through the ship uh should we be worried if we haven't already gone crazy we might be safe [Music] so dog report item strange rumbling on ship continues maybe keep track of your items mentally that is what i am doing he means never mind why does that keep happening it may be a key piece of information in our investigation i find it strange this area is abandoned knew this would come in handy where'd you get a nova passkey nikki gave it to me to keep it away from her mom we could sell that it must be worth a couple thousand units do you know what novacore does look around how much you want to bet there aren't enough nova left to execute us fine fine i'll make you dumb stuff just tell me what you want [Music] perhaps lady hellbender sent a worthy beast to devour us oh yeah and how would she know we were here it is said the monster queen has eyes across the galaxy ah got a crick in my back because of that what do you hope to find here peter quill nikki had all kinds of secret passageways on the ship maybe she left a message or something i i guess i mean we actually had a lot in common kind of reminded me of me you know i do not know it doesn't matter i just want to make sure her and her mom are okay [Music] oh no please don't did you know this maintenance worker peter quilt no you seem relieved i am what the flark are you two doing let's go already now we're exploring maintenance tunnels no way drax's rap sheet he's got to see this [Music] so what's the deal with quill in that kid anyway look at that i don't know i thought he tried to save her just to impress carell what do you mean it worked there's a tracker on my ship that's not good [Music] strange i'd have expected more signs of fighting it does seem localized to the one area wish i knew the layout of this tub better then we could figure out where this started you know where we are gamora not really anova never really let me out of their sight they had good reason not to trust you this again i was only stating that nova's position of not trusting you was accurate at the time you have since proved yourself a worthy ally the longer we bicker the more we might miss very inspirational yeah you get that off the place matt all i'm saying is we're in this up to our necks and we'll need to work together to get out of it [Music] this frigate is one of the most stable in nova's armada the rumbling doesn't make sense perhaps contraxia's gravity is crushing the ship no way we beat that already you would my frame would survive no wonder we've been stumbling around in the dark oh look at you you sexy beast oh flirting rocket is it supposed to be upside down uh only if you wanted to channel all the ship's power up through the ceiling makes no sense to me there must be a reason a bad one try that console yeah we can use this to reinvert the core or uh de-invert the d-vert rocket now the console safety lock because the mounting arms are retracted if we can pop them out of them side panels we can flip the core [Music] huh looks like the arms are stuck without any power i bet we could jump start them hell got to be a power cell somewhere [Music] safety locked that's what i said wait did you really just use your visor to check if i was lying well stop flarking around it ain't gonna work without the arms [Music] there's got to be more machinery up there gamora give me a boost of course [Music] definitely something up here hell yeah it worked you know them guns would make better engineering tools than weapons nice try let's get the other one free [Music] all right gamora let's get the second one done okay [Music] now let's see what we can oh scott [Music] guys we've got incoming yeah it's more than infected man i was hoping we'd find novacor here but not like this [Music] [Music] our progress [Music] is i can't wait to see your face on a wanted poster [Music] responsible [Music] i shall break their bones we must find a way up there and discover why for the dog report rocket what's that console telling you that you should come do the honors okay [Music] surprise this whole thing's a lift we can ride it all the way up there i guess nova grunts and grease monkeys don't get the cool flying suits typical nobody respects their engineers these days if you want efficiency you got to make whoa mark eclipse you're shutting us down more freaks approaches at the core again i thought already [Music] people [Music] can't break through and let's take him out first this [Music] what's next peter [Music] [Music] the i hate banging up [Music] [Music] all right let's get those clamps off so we can keep moving i will tear them from their sockets ain't gonna work muscle head but this time we've got a control room to play with [Music] foreign
