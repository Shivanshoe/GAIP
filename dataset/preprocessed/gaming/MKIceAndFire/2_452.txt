[Music] the rain is clean now but wait till it gets to the goo stories keep moving whether you drive them or not let's see [Music] ain't the easiest tongue but i think he says he's happy to see a friendly face not too many of those around these days says it's good to see you again he's goop you might remember him from the old days when he tried to teach you how to swim says you were always so righteous as a child and he can still feel it even at a distance group says memories fade surprisingly fast we are all pieces of what we remember it's only together we can remember the story as it was he knows he's easy to remember there's no one out there as cuckoo as him he's one-of-a-kind goop says our memory keeps things for us and protects them until we are ready to face them again he understands you've returned to face looper looping that's the destiny you've been carrying within yourself all these years he says that the catastrophe back then didn't vanquish the good in you it's still there as bright as when you were a child now the time has come for you to remember and act your life is your life not the story you're told about it he understands why you seek revenge but he doesn't think you realize how that'll make you feel once you claimed it nothing shines like the dark oh no wait oh well you know just when you think there's no hope hope comes along blinded by the light shining like a brand new day next time go with your gut your dark dark gut says life on the goo is wide open you have so many choices of where to go some harder than others of course which kind do you like hit the open surf then the trouble is you can only rely on yourself at least until you reach a new shore and make new friends can hardly believe the world is going to make it wonders what that's going to do to the goo you thinks the myriad made a good match with you you're both like sunshine on the surf claims he didn't say that out loud but hey back to the goo knows yesterday is already gone it's what you do today and tomorrow that'll move you forward you need to set the past aside at least for now he can't leave the subnautica station as the pollution has worn down the insulation of his suit so you must salvage enough scrap to fix up his goo glide starting with the old wreck box outside you should return when you've retrieved the scrap there's no time to waste if you want to make the goo glide strong enough to fight the porky puff you're lucky that way there's still cargo left on the shores from before the apocalypse his best guess is a power tanker hit a reef and went under foreign you make this look simple just a few moves left make them ground here the day can't come soon enough [Music] so just a few moves left make them count what else fight between the eyes raid oh i stinks stop ripped beginning [Music] at least you're not coming out of this empty-handed so toxinol's offshore drilling caused oily matter to spread with the rain and contaminate both the groundwater and open surf the long lasting effect this had on the evolution of wildlife was as we know now the only reason we came to exist you need to line up the switches so they match just a few moves left make them count good that's enough electric current to initiate the actuators and activate the framework take this seriously or it'll take you down [Music] he's got the goo glide functional you will have a pull hook and a salvage net but no armor and an engine strong enough to break through the thick goo further out there are lots of valuables left behind on the surf floor that the salvage net will enable you to haul you just need to find the right spots goop says gizmos devised a cannon for the goo glide but instead of bullets it flips quacks squeaky distractions for the triple attentive porcup which will give you time to get yourself in position [Music] the best way to find quacks is to talk to gulp he has the bearings of the surfy pelico and knows where the quacks like to float this means you'll have the privilege of visiting gulp in the sinky dink he'll be able to give you directions to where you'll find quacks he only knows what's visible to the naked eye gulp is not much of a babbler and mostly keeps to himself and his drink don't lose your way in the blackness welcome to the surf epeligo where the horizon rests on the surfy goon you're poking around pogba a prime village good hit fan i'm back [Music] [Music] says the tribe sifu sent them here to help defend against the rival tribe that's been terrorizing their village isn't sure how long the village will last if it continues as if the plague ruining the land and destroying the crops wasn't enough to bring the village to its knees already that's what they call the blight that's been haunting the land since the old world ended in the apocalypse around here the sifu asked you to help and that's what you must do [Music] sparkles about how brilliant it is to have someone like you that shares both genetics and karma in the myriad spectrum the sifu asked you to help and that's what you must do says they like your kind hello my name is [Music] claims to have strange things from the dead zone that are so rare they need to be seen to be believed [Music] it's shopping time you better get a move on if you want to change things [Music] [Music] says everything's changing in these dark coming days nothing stays the same not even the houses have you heard of chubza such a wild wanderer even his hut moves but he'd have a lot to talk about with aroma like you know figures have seen things all sorts of things things that might help [Music] says chubster isn't the sort to wait in one place for you they might be looking for you too you just got to watch for chubsa and his mobile hut asks you to tell him they say hi [Music] has no doubt you've earned the trust and support of this village actions speak louder than words you did good here [Music] is always willing to listen you did good here that worked out as long as you're happy about it you can see the horizon now this here is the sinky dink home of gulp of the very least let's see if you want the tree of life to keep standing in the city he's pretty sure he's heard of you before although the details are maybe a little hazy he wonders if you have something for him to drink [Music] good bad not really sure but it seems like you've been drinking in your destiny and liking the flavor wonders if you could take the time to help a man slake his own first you'd be doing him a liquid solid you're a do-gooder so you know you want to either way he hopes you find a way to wet your whistle before the world comes to an awful dry end and leaves us all thirsting for more [Music] says life's like a mystery drink sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's awful but either way you can't stop drinking until you're dead sure but that's nowhere near as quick and easy who wants to stop to chew wants to raise a glass to you getting the world fixed up a bit oh my new gillan respects how you always try to help no matter that the world's fate is hard to swallow i mean yeah seize why you joined up with the myriad they like a peaceful drink just like you ah [Music] says he sells them drinks they mostly suck them down on their own and his favorite radium syrup that one's even more intoxicating now aged in truck tankers and all [Music] without a drink and radium syrup especially he can't move much less think as the power of his mind is directly proportioned to the quantity of syrupy sweets that's why he's called gulp the drink helps him forget the state the world is in but it only lasts until tomorrow the world is still doomed even if the sun goes up it makes most dumber but that's his special burden to bear he wants you to know he has other interests too he's the surfico self-proclaimed ornithologist for example [Music] there are other ways than a cold drink to relieve stress even in these dark times and fortunately for you he can help watching pippi's flap is calming but better yet are the ones you can look at and touch like quacks squeezing them is a great way to relax [Music] says he read that in an old world book it means you're an expert of all living things that flap and tweet is glad you crawled out of your shell to help [Music] foreign no more ghoul glue the quack hollow it's just lonely so [Music] so [Music] not opening for you [Music] someone has to end this plague before it's too late uh nice shot [Music] all right so [Music] [Music] you need to line up the switches so they match [Music] just a few moves left make them count good that's enough electric current to initiate the actuators and activate the framework you could experiment with that uh we're all heroes of our own stories or so we hope gun it and go all ashore that's going ashore e-waste the stuff you need as long as it's drinkalicious even rocket fuel he once mixed up some tankers and drank that it was a real lift off searing said they're goodness [Music] that leads him to the bottom of that particular bottle radium syrup if only he could find a tanker truck to empty he's not in a state to go looking so he's counting on you to help go find him a tanker truck and bring back some of that precious radium syrup thinks you're not the only one who what we'll be talking about again [Music] [Music] ah [Music] that's enough quacks to sustain the goo glide flipper with infinite ammunition goop says he was there when the porky puff took out of dates leg so this world eater has made it personal [Music] after that out of date started using his head instead of his legs and came up with the plan on how to best make a stand against the world eaters and it wasn't by foot that's how he got tasked with rebuilding the goo glide he seems happy to talk [Music] thrilled to know you're on the side of those glad to see you out and says you're welcome he seems happy to talk hopes to see you again soon that'll soon pay off dismounted a story has got to keep moving forward fred soft that's a monster nest if ever i've seen one foreign [Music] [Music] so just check that strong out all fired up oops [Music] it's okay to smile at the growing light so there's some bouncy rubber strap over there a key for every lock a buyer hazard like that can make you real sick [Music] come on [Music] so that was fun get things done before the darkness falls again so it's the porky puff nibbling bulk it took quite a liking to the crunchy stuff after munching down out of date's leg beneath unleash the quacks can you feel it it's the brisk wind of change don't let this opportunity slide so so so he thanks you for dealing with another world eater you're halfway there he's got word out of date spotted looper looping and has a feeling your time has come he hopes you're up for it even though you're good-hearted you shouldn't miss this opportunity to confront the predator just head back to the foot of the tree fingers crossed loop a looping will stay put until you're there got word you found the greatest glider of all an ark and it's all good to go can't imagine how that would feel to zoom so fast funny that you found an ark when you don't need to go anywhere in it the world's still going to be here do something proud of you for thinking about helping before escaping by the way wonders if there are any open seats left in that fancy arc glider of yours so what we have here is an opportunity to help your next there's a seat open on the arch should you want to offer it as a gesture of appreciation why you don't need anyone else but yourself and me of course but i'm a part of you so that doesn't count if you want to go quickly go alone if you want to go further go together the only one we'd want to get away quickly from here is darkness but you know you can't go on without me even if i'm bad company i complete you i think we can finally agree on something it is better to be alone than in bad company but best of all is being good company yourself feels thrilled to snag a seat in your ark can't wait to glide through the skies goop knows he's repeating himself but can't help talking to you says you'll see each other later [Music] [Music] some used to go there every week to join hands and hope together not so much hope to go around these days hold on [Music] come on catch it it's time to create your own path [Music] out of date says the time has come for you to reconcile with your past is still staying in the camp where he was brought up he hopes you'll find the answers you were looking for there loma uttonu even though darkness is a part of your nature he suggests you try to keep your cool as the best fighter is never angry he'll point you in the right direction but the rest is up to you this part of the journey is one you'll have to do on your own lupa lupin's camp has always been there hidden deep inside the mountains out of date hopes you'll find your way and the answers you were looking for once you're there he knows he said it before but the time has come to put an end to the lupine's reign of terror you should get over there come face to face with destiny it's going to be you against the lupine no rules he's happy to help lupa lupin's camp has always been there hidden deep inside the mountains too bad but all days must come to an end tread carefully here this is looper lupin's camp [Music] [Music] [Music] where it all started he was so little when your mother and kin came here to put an end to his mother just because she was different a hunter that night the hunter became the hunted trapped with nowhere to run he says your mother showed no mercy only a vengeance he can see that you're not like your mother there's something different about you maybe you would have made a better decision than she did and let them be they orphaned him left him alone an outcast and a freak looper lupin says he's been reliving the moment every night since then [Music] he says your mother and her disciples started something that couldn't be undone they created the monster he would become he knew his time would come and he was patient so when he got news about your birth he knew how to get revenge that would last that's why he spared you that night he raised the village when you were a child he wanted you to suffer for life like he had he mocked you for life so he'd recognize you when you met again and you'd eventually remember where you came from his hunger grew insatiable over the years to come he tried but being vegetarian wasn't in his nature and he couldn't go hungry but he's never taken a life for the sake of appetite it's always been about survival and that our true self is being who we are a deep look into nature will make you understand everything better and that natural selection eliminates and the strongest survive fate is for those too weak to determine their own destiny and now the time has come for you to accept yours so so [Music] smack bang all right [Music] this might be the end of everything as we know it [Music] so [Music] out of date says that from what he's heard you've been busy waiting [Music] he says he appreciates what you've done so far but unfortunately he's got urgent news from his friend noco in the east out of date says that even though he's unsure about your intentions he hopes you'll support naco but he says he'll point you in the right direction but finding noco and making sure she gets what she needs is up to you that doesn't sound good out of date was spot on the hoof puff needs to be stopped out of date says that noco is worried now that the eastern world eater is stepping up its activity he explains that noco keeps a fabled steed that she has planned to ride out to the world eater but needs help to get it prepared [Music] out of date suggests that you should head east as fast as possible and see what you can do to help he's happy to help to hawaii says good keep focused on what you can do today tomorrow's already gone you almost slipped past the village of flibbid [Music] um monsters sleep here and they're just as messy as you guess so try again when you have some key energy [Music] this is all about you whether you succeed or fail so stick in the key [Music] might keep you dry at least find us keepers [Music] that's a little too much for you yet it's far away juju's shop is here somewhere [Music] let's see juju is just thrilled to finally meet you even in these darkest days when the spotlights are growing dim you're like a fresh outfit claims to make clothes that help you make a statement about who you are [Music] thinks you have the power to steer the fate of the world one way or the other he wants you not only to save it but to look fabulous doing so [Music] he knows you have the heart of a hero he just wants you to look like one too he tells you to dig deeper into your past and remember how it's all stitched together you need to follow that thread to figure out who you are and where you're going [Music] wonders if you ever think about how things might be if you'd chosen one style over another it's amazing how even a single switch stitch in the right spot can change things [Music] figures that's good because your suit shoots you so well that's seen you yay likes how the world seems to be getting its act together been sliding down too long thanks you for darning up the whole holes in the world it's not a perfect world but it's the only one that fits coach thinks it's good you're working with the myriad the sifu there has the best taste in styles [Music] and binder i know you don't have you claims to have made his favorite the one the sifu wears every day but that's enough about them he wants to talk about him he wonders if you can see it too the common threads that have sewn everyone together through the years they're all broken thus seeing you but fortunately he's good at smoothing things over choosing things that are chic and blossoming the aesthetics most come here to get relief from how ugly the world has become he works a lot with mood be it good or bad thank you says we bury our dead in their best not their worst why should the end of the world be any different [Music] say don't you some even think what he does is magic changing the way you feel with style that's how he got his nickname juju playing me okay he's been zig-zagging all night he has a fiber he needs to get done but he's run out of bobbin now his reputation is hanging by a thread and anyone hein bog and joking him newton he needs to thread the needle but the only spare bobbin he knows about well he saw it attached to a kite flying free in the wind he'll do what he can for you if you get him that bobbin [Music] says you'll get it all stitched up in no [Music] time juju says it's fantabulous to see you again what's up jujit [Music] juju says it's fantabulous to see you give some seal juju says it's funny [Music] even up in the mountains you can't touch the sky this region is known as the canucks stones you can't find a harder place in the world you finally found the village of bum lid off let's see [Music] it's a monster lair for sure smoked you have a chance to change the future for good or bad hey there's some e-waste find the key that fits [Music] oh that's rare [Music] uh [Music] that's an upsy dumps good for learning how to haul up don't see that in the shops you can't really understand your story till it's done says there's an interesting place nearby that no one knows about but doesn't really want to talk about it right now says you look trustworthy might as well tell you where it is oh [Music] focus on the tightrope it soars like a kite so it better be one latch onto it before it flies away reel that in juju will be pleased to see you manage to get hold of a bobbin even though it's the unconventional kind oh [Music] someone set up a camp in a tree middle hmm took along the ropes [Music] there's a serenity about this spot it's fits nice so many places to be today juju is thrilled over the bobbin and the fact that he'll be able to finish the fiber [Music] he believes couture can do that for you you know change the way you feel and also change the way others feel about you what's up he's prepared something for you while you were away do you want it to fit your mood or do you want a change of heart fashion can help you define mood and this should make you more menacing [Music] that's what he wants you to feel when you wear it yeah juju thinks it's amazing that you found an ark and are refurbishing it for a launch no but he imagines it's incredibly stylish suppose that even if the world goes on you could use the ark to find new places to explore yay just happy the ark wound up in such deft and responsible hands not that juju's asking for a seat but who's going to pilot that thing for you so what we have here is an opportunity to help your next there's a seat open on the ark should you want to offer it why you don't need anyone else but yourself and me of course but i'm a part of you so that doesn't count if you want to go quickly go alone if you want to go further go together the only one we'd want to get away quickly from here is darkness but you know you can't go on without me even if i'm bad company i complete you i think we can finally agree on something it is better to be alone than in bad company but best of all he's being good company yourself [Music] thinks you could have chosen someone better but juju can't wait to join you on the ark as soon as you're ready he's invested in helping you look your best [Music] juju is curious to see what you're interested in you got the best of that despite the fact that clipper fingers are in safe hands he's still lacking something to make his personal complete trims embarrassed now he can cut but he's out of die a bad fur do is a shame to you and him both and you can't have that can you he once found some leftover cans of spat dye near the concrete wall paint sites and they'd do the trick this time he promises just come back with a can of spot dye and he'll give you that fresh coat you deserve [Music] she farted figures that will be true we know trim thinks you're still good looking [Music] killer understands [Music] [Music] uh ah the ganot pen noco never leaves this place she's always put the living things first let's see feels like you could be blown off the world look at those notices on the board too bad the notes couldn't read them if you wander around here you might find noco she just loves those gnotes once the power ran out it made sense to ride gnotes and that tradition continued through the years powered types of transportation polluted the world but didn't poop in the street obviously they didn't have their priorities right in those days watch your step here and you might find tracks of another traveler [Music] [Music] isn't an easy language but at least it's manageable she says she is so happy to see you again she wonders if you remember her she's knocko she let you ride her majut when you were a kid it's intended remembers you used to chase around with so much energy and is glad to see you haven't lost any of that spark but that's all long gone now though memories show us where we've been not where we're going sure they'll come back on their own once you stop forcing them hopefully not to haunt you though you've suffered enough already remembers those days too but she never lets herself wallow in them no matter how tempting that can be she sees your back to buck with looper lupine can't see how there's any way to avoid that now not for long at least she says the horrors of your younger days were enough to ruin anyone but not you you've got all that cheer history is like the trail you've been on you can walk back down it anytime you like until it's worn smooth but you get to blaze your own trail from here then you are stronger than her she can't help wanting looper looping to pay for what he did to her gnoats despite the fact it's against her nature run dark run it's not a race you only say that because you're losing that doesn't mean i'm wrong no there are lots of other reasons you're wrong [Music] asks how many paths you've wandered in the world and if you ever wonder about what might have changed if you've taken different ones you can't do everything you want can't go everywhere can't see everything only what you can [Music] so happy the world is going to live would have been crushed to see all the gnoats die with it likes that you stood up for the world and spurred your way toward helping it out glad you saw the light with the myriad they always bring a sparkliness to any day and sometimes the knights do come on they're just so shiny makes her smile to think about them andrew but let's not speak of that now she has an idea where the majut might have gone as there's no other place it likes as much as its own corner of the open wild she's even named it the majut meadow bial tu ma will recognize the scent you've attracted while being here so it'll probably trust you enough to follow you you should lead the major back here when you find it it's going to take time to get it calm enough to be able to ride out to the world eater it's the most magnificent creature she's ever encountered a creature straight out of a dream or [Music] story [Music] found it even under all the muck in the gnoat pen hard to believe the notes didn't trample it they seem faster than you and don't forget that when you ride them they do all the work to keep you moving you should keep moving can't let those good notes place the trails for you so [Music] [Music] [Music] the mountains stretch higher than the clouds [Music] you can make so many amazing things out of wood scraps there should be more cliffs here handy you found the major meadow watch out for the majority well-placed [Applause] the world is full of secrets waiting to be uncovered so smarten up [Music] now that the majority is back in the pen it seems calm but noco is still concerned she says the majority is still anxious but fortunately she knows just the thing it needs to calm down the major once found and ate a bonbon gummy by mistake and that the chewing really calmed it down she says that you should find some bon bon gummies for the majority by the crossway at least that's where she found some last time she figures the choosies from the old world are made from gummy trees but wouldn't be surprised if they were actually made from some chemical concoction though [Music] wow [Music] a crossway this means you have a choice to make which way need a key [Music] that's the good stuff [Music] foreign it's time for an adventure for good or [Music] bad better hold on to that [Music] foreign wow um so want to get your arms swole grab those guns flexes and get pumping that iron got to time it right to make them work left right left right [Music] pumping good looking better tp tapper so fast voltage shut you shouldn't flick the switches in order to green light the current and activate the electrons in the panel good the loop is electrified enough to spark that's a motored blind box dispenser these auto markets were quite popular in the long gone for those who had coin left for fun cranks like these usually need to be wound to operate the dispenser just a few moves left make them count what you see is what you get once it's out of the blind box that is the world is taller than you think with its attention diverted to the chewy bonbon gummy the majut calms down but noco is still concerned she's relieved the majority's calm down but you'll need a heavier sit tight to ride it than the one she's got the only sit tight she can think of that would be heavy enough is one she's spotted mounted on an old world if she remembers correctly she spotted it at the smilo shop area while scavenging for treats for the notes that's not so far away in the old world maybe the notes were near extinct is always willing to help [Music] fate is funny that way but it won't always make you laugh why you made it to hoofer there's a living thing trader somewhere around here let's see looking for a bargain a sealed deal the smilo shoparia guess shopping here put a smile on your face so great eye boxes like this are few and far between however that's no great loss talking pictures from the four times lacked a message as the ibox broadcasts it's hit or miss but when it does hit it's usually right in the field oh it's locked no windows to look out at the sky from down here biohazard makes your skin cool clinic me [Music] you need to line up the switches so they [Music] match just a few moves left make them count [Music] good that's enough electric current to initiate the actuators and activate the framework [Music] now hold on sit tight isn't that the mecca major over there you need to loosen the bolts without rattling the mech matured just a few moves left [Music] that's it the sit tight is loose time to stop horsing around and get the sit tight back to knockout careful in the mountains falling is awful landing is worse and the brand new sit tight is in place the majut is ready to ride noko's been training another fantabulous little critter that'll hopefully become a distraction for the hoof puff when you confront it she's called them glitter moths and the best way to find them is to go talk to mito she's asked him to keep them somewhere safe you'll find mito at bright light he's a light-headed fellow but hopefully he'll remember where he stored the moths they're small airborne creatures with bright reflective wings and a conspicuous fluttering flight [Music] psycho what you do here matters to you and the world let's see with the world getting darker by the day there's not much time left to save it and even though you've just met he feels you're bound to play a huge part in that figures that doesn't make it any less worth fighting you found your way through the darkness you shine like the sun in the sky but will you use that power to warm the world or burn it hopes you see how much good you can do with power like that and how easy it is to let it drive you mad [Music] no matter where your path takes you though it's important to remember where you came from the past bright lights the present wonders if you know how much of an effect you've had upon the world your presence changes things like light changes darkness did you realize that when choosing where to shine [Music] says he can see that in the way you brighten everything up so happy you know you're helping brighten the world there's plenty of it that's still worth saving whatever happens to the world you've shown as bright as you could that matters more than you know [Music] says you did the right thing in taking up with the myriad they buy lots of his lamps that's a tribe that believes in the bright things in the world it's clear you do nothing shines as bright as being right says he can see by the twinkle in your eyes that you're not here to talk about your allies he assumes you are here to be enlightened he can't blame me was everything just feels dark and hopeless these days there's something about you like your nip together your face connected what you've said he feels too so why not call him me too he senses you're like the day fly living every day like it's your last afraid that when night comes it might be proved right claims you both walk in different types of darkness but you guide yourself by the same light nito says he's not only into those who shine bright he likes things that glitter too he reckons you haven't seen a glitter moth and says it's about time you did even though they're nesting near gone grass they never run out of glow finding yourself a glitter moth would give you that glimmer of hope you need to continue all the way to the end figures you should do it if you want to become as enlightened as him this place is called bright light meter lives close by for a beastie this mount is so gentle don't know what that e-waste was ah see that e-waste always handy looks like some solid wood scrap there life is a difficult game no matter how you play it uh your reserves are tapped great uh [Music] [Music] [Music] glittermoth cave is right here you can see a lot farther now than at night that's enough glitter moths to make her plan work mommy she wants you to stop worrying about the paths you've ridden and focus on the inevitable road ahead the one that leads to confrontation with the world eater the hoof puff is evidence of the duality of evolution utterly beautiful and grotesque at the same time she means that the hoof puff has had more time to eat at the root as it's been isolated in the canoe stoney's mountains so based on that alone she reckons it has suffered as much damage as the north west route that's hidden beneath the [Music] it surface her of the good notes and like them it's hoofed they're just a lot bigger [Music] uh history is nothing but a series of stories you should be able to use that [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign hmm so so good so so [Music] [Music] look so [Music] much um so [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] that sealed the fate of the third world eater just one more to go out of date asked to see you again to congratulate you and let you in on the final phases of his plan this is your chance to get his priorities aligned with yours do right by your tribe and the world at large just head back to the ark he seemed eager to see you again she wonders if the rumors she's heard about you finding the ark are true thinks that's impossible of course but she also knows you regularly make the impossible happen with the world recovering the ark would be a wonderful way to see it so much faster than even her favorite good notes loves that you did your best to help the world rather than hurt it you could have used much more of that even before you returned it any idea who might be joining you on your arky journeys so what we have here is an opportunity why you don't need anyone else but if you want to go quickly but you know you can't go on i think we can finally agree on something it is better to be alone than in bad company but best of all is being good company yourself feels deeply honored that you'd want her to come with you an ark is no good note but she can't pass this up she's coming aboard noco knows she's known for saying things over wishes [Music]
