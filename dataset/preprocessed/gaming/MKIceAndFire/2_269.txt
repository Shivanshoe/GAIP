yeah if they ever decide to play out here in the boonies [Music] satisfied [Music] holy crap drax you gotta stop doing this man it's weird we're approaching the quarantine zone how long was i out for 15 338 ticks that's very specific the betrayer is ready to begin our mission she has requested your presence in the cockpit gamora's on our side drax she is the spawn of my sworn enemy a murderous and a traitor i do not trust her we'll try we're supposed to be a team i make no promises oh it ain't just a junkyard the quarantine zones the biggest pile of galactic war debris in the known universe just think of all the tech we can find hey it's only illegal if novacor finds us inside which they won't groots right be nervous rocket don't underestimate the nova corps oh come on am i the only one who ain't scared of the galactic police they've got the numbers on us but they ain't got the brains sure takes a genius to catch my ship my ship who said that quill no i think i heard him man ha take a look at this had to use her last ah there you are quill tell groot to stop worrying about getting arrested i'm not overconfident i'm just the right level of confident arrested for what our ship just accidentally slipped into the quarantine zone oops our navigation malfunctioned oops how would we accidentally cross into the nova corps force field details nice gizmos rocket i'm calling them thumpers on account of the noise they make assuming we get past the force field and reach your coordinates in one piece all we got to do is set them up and these babies are going to draw out our monster in no time how's that even gonna work the thumper goes beep beep beep beep and the monsters come running yeah it goes more like uh [Music] stop this ruckus at once and then the monster comes running out of its hole are you sure about that hey oh my intel came from your source my sources are very reliable those coordinates are 100 pointing towards a rare elusive priceless creature with no physical description to go by what do you think elusive means it don't matter what the monster looks like as long as it's got ears you could be sure my thumpers are going to drive it right into our arms peter quill we must soon discuss the status of my official team membership badge tracks once again there is no official badge obviously you would not have one assassin the small one indicated the procedure is a well-guarded secret rocket stop messing with him drax about gamora can this not wait peter quill i am readying my body for battle uh you know we're supposed to capture this monster right not kill it of course but i suspect it will not go down without a fight cool it muscles lady hellbender ain't gonna buy damaged goods i will aim to preserve the integrity of the beast as best i can good what is it dude take five we gotta talk about that gamora thing she is waiting for you in the cockpit i know i know i just meant are you gonna be okay you two are gonna be alone on the ship for a while rest assured peter quill i will keep a watchful eye and thwart any attempted treachery or you could try trusting her you are naive peter quill she is a mistress of deceit all good buddy you know i don't understand you group but i'm going to assume you just said something super kind and thoughtful [Applause] what did the tree say no idea who really needs to get these plants under control morgoth be with you hey morgoth yourself good old milano the engine parts from at least five different black markets she's only been here a few months but her room's already decked out here you see that yep that's the cable coming out right there flark and thing keeps slipping off the socket got to be careful when you plug them in just in case you doubt you'll have to fiddle with any of this once we're on the ground i wonder if drax was allowed to decorate his cell in the kiln probably not not so sure about tooth cleaning tablets manual brushing is where it's at just pocketing a little something so this job don't turn out like our monster hunting gig in the hilda cluster please no if i see a single jellyfish right in the quarantine zone i'm turning around hey come on gamora don't lie to yourself we all know you like slicing through the squishy critters nice this moment of quiet reminds me of the legendary siege of sekhnov 7. oh not again it is said that lady hellbender held her breath through ten moons while riding across the stars on the back of a great horned beast and when she went when she arrived she exhaled and the wind blew away the shatari indeed it did if he realized it didn't make no sense he wouldn't be telling it rocket why are the array cables everywhere on the floor i'm working on it nice rocket finally cleaned up the fur balls you're welcome oh yeah you remember that dealer who asked about the emitters after you left he he leans over me and he says uh what what do you need these for then yeah like i'm turning the milano into a dance club or something please refrain from creating this club of dance yeah yeah we all know how you feel about dancing what was i supposed to tell them uh you know i uh need them to build uh some ultrasonic lures so my team of ex-cons can trap a mystery creature in the most uh legal place in the quadrant you want to throw in a discount almost 20 years and those tracks are still fire that escort job and orega ever pan out what do you mean you never called her back don't know if you notice but we're flark and broke what what kind of escort was that contract about yeah maybe i'd rather be broke wish you were here mom gamora up here peter hey that's my chair oh then why aren't you in it i was uh strategizing it's one thing to get into the zone but we still got to catch that monster right so did i miss anything other than a ton of suspicious glares from drax not really now if you're done strategizing feel free to grab your seat we're almost ready to go once we breach that force field there's no going back your black market codes are gonna crack that nova net right yep as soon as you enter them in your console rocket did you bring back the docking chips you took from the alignment console i'll do it as soon as i reconfigure them you better not try to sell them off not like i'd make any money things are so cheap they couldn't align two magnetized connectors okay here we go rocket crew tracks get in here we're going in we still have a few ticks before the next time window actually the next one nova core security guard resets every rotation we want to be in and out before our code expires or we'll get stranded and if we wait for the next reset we'll get a full rotation to do this nice oh why is the nova net still up i thought we were going in it appears the assassin's contacts are as untrustworthy as the betrayer herself oh please don't tell me gamora's backdoor coats are bust we nearly went broke getting them relax rocky we still got a few ticks before the next time window the network just reset you can enter the sequence peter zero four five one that's it four digits suspicious these security measures are too simplistic for nova core it's not that simple the code only works on this date for this ship oh i get it gamora's codes are more like an encryption key of some sort designed to integrate temporal coordinates and our ship's hard-coded serial into a local number generator info gets in digits come out four of them two two one eight no do not confuse him rodent there [Music] and we're in incredible people realize there was so much stuff left after the war restraint wasn't very popular in the shotari army especially with thanos in charge it's probably all harmless now i mean novacore had 12 years to get rid of the heavy-duty explosives right that's why i like you quilt you're so pure oh the wonderful and terrible things i could do with all this stay focused we did not come here to scavenge why not the milano's weapon systems could use an overall plus there's good money in it the beast that we seek is far more valuable to the monster queen of second guy than any illegally acquired salvage whoa oh place is really shifty i'm not seeing a monster but that big cylinder up ahead looks like mining peter's friend set to look for friend for a knight and you'll see the monster soon as we place rockets monster summoning thingies vlark yeah group quell soda team rockets up first i still do not understand why i must remain on board with the assassin oh because you're part of green team assign me to the team before you named it my skin is not green steel teal listen if we want to trick the monster into going inside that mining rig we need to place thumpers on both sides two sides two teams and two clips at the drop side grounds two and states you'll need to that's our cue let's go group don't worry once the thumpers are placed we'll meet in the middle and we'll capture the monster together very well [Music] bumper one done meet you on the run gamora take care of my baby [Music] hey starboard wrong way you guys sure you don't need help yep very sure focus on your own task yep being here definitely feels a little weird oh you okay quilt yeah i think so this uh big resin stuff's definitely strong enough to hold this place together oh yeah yeah yeah definitely probably strong enough look at that brittle he is i told you show off just making sure my guns work insubordination we talked about this on the milano drax try harder i'm thinking that big cylinder thing is our rendezvous yeah that's the mining rig so weird seeing it all clustered together like this bits and pieces of a war that span the entire galaxy held together by pink goo abrian bass nano resin whatever i'm just saying it's a lot to take in how many of these ships did you personally destroy assassin you know i think i do sort of get it thousands of worlds fighting for some fleeting greater good whoa look yellow and blue looks like an old nova corps frigate nice come on dude people probably died on that ship killjoy why'd he even bring us here if the place is so sacred i can name at least a dozen planets with monsters on them so why here you think it's to impress gamora like hey check out the serious intel i got from you know shady sources flap broke rocket we need a big break aren't you tired of eating yarrow root it's so mealy listen this is a restricted zone whatever monster lives here nobody else has one lady hellbender values rarity in her acquisitions exactly what is this omnipresent pink substance name you mean the ebrium based nano resin cluster foam never trust something with that many dashes okay i'm okay you almost made yourself a very late war casualty not funny you know i like this this is fun the three of us hanging out just like when we started this gig before you know who joined us i do not hate everybody i tolerate quill quel's uh swell guy i hope you get that promotion rocket come on rocket drax and gamora are valued additions to the team you're only saying that cause she's listening is that why your plan has dragged knight taking the ship maybe hey can a guy want to spend some quality time with his friends just imagine what kind of blasters the shitari had to use to wreck some of these freaking whoa pretty sure that weighs a dead end yeah you sure ah there we go pass this way come on how can you even tell just trust me all right hey group you think we can find pieces of the tryon shard in here you never heard of the try on chart pyramid of pure evil that corrupts everything it comes in contact hey come on oh come on i know thanos had his hands on it during the war it's got to be in here somewhere how did you even know the other way was a dead end because unlike you i have a very keen sense of direction yeah i'm sure it's safe-ish safer than flying with kimura anyway i heard that what someone's been practicing ah i hate these ship-eating parasites flarkas would chew right through the milano in two cycles nice bladder hey 50 unit says i can clear more of these suckers than you as if whoa what the rocket did you do that the scoreboard you like it hacked it into your visor cover last time you took a snooze you hacked into my stuff considering how many times i fixed the flarkin thing it might as well be my stuff optimal thump replacing distance should be just up ahead i'm thinking right in front through the giant hole where this ship's cockpit used to be well that's grim yeah try not to think about it it's better not to wonder what happened to anyone working on these old wrecks it was a long time ago anyways amazing i should have been recording break over i want to see if he's alive i don't know but he's twitching clark and scott stain quilt you okay down there yep yeah i just uh thought i saw a shortcut right go ahead without me i'll catch up okay there's a cracked out novacore missile bait just on the other side we'll meet you there yellow and blue missile bay got it okay crawling through creepy old ship no big deal easy bear quill pretty sure nothing's gonna jump out at you except maybe me and crew now this brings back memories you fall into another whole quilt i'm uh assessing stuff if all else fails show something like strange creatures when installing a thumper holy well was that you i shot something like you said i've got a way forward see never fails [Music] we're busy that's cheating you guys should have seen that it was this weird blobby thing not falling for this again [Music] hurry you're fat hey [Music] everything okay over there quill nearly got himself eaten by a blob or something should hurt and squeal you must fight with dignity peter quill or at least die with it not funny hey gamora make sure don't get stuck in any of this resin uh quell we got a lot riding on your gal pal's mystery monster tip i hope she's legit like you could even tell if she had an honest face yeah she did smell like flowers too much probably the sadhu starstruck over there if we set up all these thumpers and no monster shows we'll just need to salvage what scrap we can and haul it back with us if it even comes off just trust me on this it'll all be worth it in the end are you kidding me son of a smack that was too close you okay groot well we're fine we can't jump that you don't gotta jump there's a sturdy support beam on this side get groot to grow a bridge across just ask him nice light he does it for me all the time all right groot let's see that cool that's one hell of a party trick big guy gross more ship eaters they're everywhere all right back to business boom right under your nose quilt ah i can't stand these things chewing up all this beautiful salvage root i found a hitch can you latch onto it hey greenies if you see any blue and gold ships out there you will let us know we have seen many such ships he means active ones we haven't talked about what to do if we run into another patrol ah we will restrain them until we are done here bad idea those cops are all connected through their stupid helmets if they do spot us all they have to do is close that barrier and we're stuck if you see cops you get my ship out of here even if it means leaving us behind ah that trust me i've dealt with nova corps before even help him catch real criminals i can talk my way out you think that milano cannot run a football okay here we go all right set her down right there yep one to go [Music] attacking batteries fry that's what's wrong maybe you put it down too hard let's just find a solution the solution's a new battery with a charge okay we're on what's left of a ship full of ship things gotta be things that power things around here right yeah maybe you're gonna want to use your visor for this you find a replacement while i finish scraping the fried wires found something with a charge kind of looks like a spacey car battery okay this thing isn't gonna zap me right the chance is minuscule at best you'll be fine what are you waiting for quilt grab it here you go that'll do nicely just let me tinker a bit i want to do some tweaking once i see how much juice this thing puts out so uh watch my back watch it from what just grab the battery and give it a yank in monster things everyone get ready away from that missile group [Music] [Music] oh i hate bugs just keep swaying those branches we're just killing party papers [Music] how long does it take to shoot we're working on it done we're all plugged in wow just in time i'd like to see you fix it next time come on two down two to go brute's wondering if the reward's gonna be worth all the risk we're taking for this job me and groot are nearly unkillable but what if the rest of you don't make it out alive if the two of us got to lug that monster all the way to lady hellbender guys we deliver this monster to lady hellbender we'll get bigger payouts and jobs that don't suck a for each one of us i mean a team only needs one ship perhaps more spacious what no i love my baby we can modify her i'd kill for a gunner's rotunda we'll think about it groot wants a plant group man we will get you two plants man that thing is ridiculous i think it was a ship or a robot that's a cree century a robot but it would have been space worthy that ain't even the biggest one they designed at least five experimental models twice that size plus half a dozen mega century prototypes star stealth models with modified sneak attack parameters how do you know all this because they were my fellow experiments back on half world most of my parts came from the cybernetics hanger next to the door so uh i got a sneak peek at all the new can see the parts come and go from my uh uh my cage i didn't mean to open old wounds most of them are just scars now anyways i wasn't even a person to the worst of the cree's mad scientists more like a real smart walking gun a very talkative gun yeah that part was an accident they tried to fix it a few times the entire facility was the problem i wish i'd gone back and blown it up before the end of the war yep not even close huh so what do i gotta do they got a last name like drax catalysts have no need for surnames what about the destroyer it is a moniker to mark the countless i slaughtered during a shameful period of untempered rage yeah one of those i could be rocket the ruthless cause i'm pretty sure i ain't never had no roof oh yeah how do we know the monster we're looking for one of these things we already killed that we're worthy of lady hellbender's collection i would not die so easily hope we know this thing when we see it and not after we stomped it groot need you to shoot a bridge right into that eye socket now i want to see you do that to something in combat wait is that yes i'm about to win this bat quill [Music] we're inside a giant robot head and i got robot parts inside my head you do when i win this guys i mean with the units he'll owe me once i win don't congratulate him found a nest maybe this is the parasite clubhouse huh no we can't take the giant robot home and believe me that's a painful sentence for me to say exactly you suck star god let's see when i beat quilt i'm going to get my hands on some rotating hyper circuits boo no one knows what those are [Music] ah you know what quill i think it's unfair you got two guns i got one i think my points could count double from now on that's cheating all right bumper goes there quill it's not gonna piss off every critter around right sorry quilt not taking no chances after the last one i gotta test it real quick not again i only flip the switch on and off and see if it's gotta love that kill radius [Music] it shoot it very helpful thing you're welcome now stop distracting me do we really need to test these things appreciate the confidence of my work but yes i need like you for breakfast that one was [Music] how are there josie many of them about to be one less dangerous [Music] time you're on your own i'm gonna be cleaning gunk out of my fur for weeks oh yeah i'm gonna murderize melania just watch where you're shooting i knew i was missing all the fun last time hey i'm happy to take this round [Music] off at least they make a good flag that's the spirit i'm loving this [Music] nice bladder rocket i know right what was that worth five points oh come on you can't just give yourself points like that great job we'll meet you at the mining ship all this firepower now it's all just scrap yeah sorry bud sorry about what groot's people never even got a chance to fight old aston planet was torched at the start of the war all right mining rig is right there of course it's secure as secure as a broke down shitari shipwreck's ever gonna be come on groot we need to get across here and rocket wouldn't put you at risk right that's right i've always got your back this looks unstable like everything else in here don't get your twigs in a bundle yes the resin can hold a stupid warship i'm telling you it's totally safe see i'll even prove it huh look at this [Music] rocket guys jump fine you flark a piece of moldy driftwood you could have died saving me i love you too you're selfless on cool he says let me set the mining ship i don't want to make him wait that's it we're not going after him he says it's fine we'll meet him later team rocket is everything okay his radio must have broke when he fell what happened to your timber companion he ain't timber he's alive so i i really don't know if you're being clever or dumb right now team rocket's out sounds like green teams off our backs now we can stop worrying about that uh dumb accident groot's fine anyways there's nothing to worry about an accident rocket come on what that's all it was it's your fault if you hadn't fooled around on that ship i did it you don't know nothing stop trying to be smart that sure didn't sound like an apology nope man if that afterburner kicked on right now we'd be toast let's hope it don't because we have to find a way through this thing money gets on the other side of that turbine so we got to find a way through try not to jump on anything this time groot's not there to grab you if you well either shut up or help me figure out how these blades open there's a drone access tunnel over here too bad we don't got a drone can you squeeze in there knew it rock it fix the thing rock it clean up the mess rock it crawl into the mystery hole see anything yeah emmanuel override rocket we hit a snag one of our separate points was covered as close as possible to the original one because of maps and angles great another turbine yeah that is how these things are usually built it's stuck on something and someone's been practicing come on let's get out of here we're back on track the mining ship ain't too far i think groot's already ahead of us maybe hope he didn't get it wasn't me this time i swear i don't like that one for me that point don't count before dead great timing how did you guys good to see you two or you're gonna want to cross the ship as fast as you can we're seeing a lot of movements yeah scott's getting real violent out here uh just try to hold her still for us that's not gonna be an option soon this position is untenable track says uh this way can you make it inside yeah all in one piece got it meet you at a tick no rush it's uh nice and cozy in here not so much when you can't see in the dark ah i think i felt the panel yeah there's wiring in there see if i can get the systems back on how long is this gonna take oh come on larkin tensorjoint just neat wiggle v okay so life supports booting back up what's it look like out there oh mother of space barnacles [Music] up [Music] quill you okay yeah yeah it's just man [Music] uh well that's concerning what was that uh it's a swarm of old cleaner butts maybe old cleaner bots i don't know [Music] uh you okay buddy [Music] sorry about the shooting yeah thought you were that freaky thing we accidentally released we saw we saw some cleaner bots accidentally at a distance we're totally all right they just ran away when it saws right quilt and i'm glad you're safe too rocket i'm not so sure that swarm thing was inoffensive i feel kind of bad about releasing it quill took a pot shot at this massive warm nest chunk of something fell off and the big floaty creature came out of it that's all anyone else get a weird vibe off this place maybe it's haunted haunted with what you know ghosts oh please quilt don't tell me you're one of those it would suck to get busted in here you know with just one exit is that supposed to make me feel better here you go rendezvous coordinates are that way but we'll have to find a way around the rubble i'll try to find a side passage there ain't nothing spooky it's an old ship is all right [Music] hey quilt groot says there might be something behind the big unit over here there's a doorway behind that big thing someone help me push it look at this old beauty a table this is a vintage model t engineering workbench they don't make them sturdy like that no more hey come on quill let's see if this beauty still works maybe i can fix up your gear hey hand me that part [Music] one tick done [Music] ding ding done [Music] [Music] and it's done [Music] [Music] yeah there's a way through if we can clear out that crud oh yeah nailed it and uh thanks for the upgrade perfectly safe right i don't trust your definition of safe it seems a little wobbly you guys hang back a sec well scott ah this place is crawling with ugly guys [Music] holy is the most crap thing i've ever seen [Music] go ahead i'll be fine what's the man worst you really missed out that was amazing team rocket finally we couldn't hear you before something about the mining ship's been messing up our comms yeah something really ain't right in here and quill fell down another hole another one i'm parking the milano but trash is out there searching for you maybe you'll find quill before we do we're trying to catch up to him guys we really need to get better at the buddy system uh old metal old mining equipment just old noted huh i wonder if rocket knows what this is a weird bunch of stuff to mine what was it i don't know weird cubie hunks of rock or metal drax hey you want to mute your calms if you're going to scream your lungs out hello oh another freaky thing outbreak i can barely scratch it harder i'm killing it as hard as i can hide behind me i will protect you nobody's hiding [Music] you can find that pokemon can find us too i do not share your hope they're soft precious for slicing you sure did save me not gonna be a problem my turn feel this i just love hearing them [Music] hey go on ahead then we'll catch up just making a uh pit stop i parked the milano near the last thumper spot we'll head that way keep an eye out for you how's my baby you can see for yourself if we can get back up there if we can get this thing down it should give us the extra height we need all right pretty sure that baby's our ticket upward somehow it's a possibility maybe try something else that crate is being held up by this crane we could free it where it's not out of reach helps to be nimble let's see that fancy footwork gamora bet you can't do this that is physically impossible drax think you can half that container behold the might of a catastrone warrior you want some more stuff for me drax you can put it down here understood remember this moment should you ever think of crossing the assassin all right rocket we're back on track oh yeah uh good for you this ain't stealing if it's abandoned wait oh rockets not now quilt rocket perhaps he has located our monster we don't even know what it looks like the intel was extremely vague it wasn't vague it was rushed it's probably some cute little nightmarish abomination lady hellbender is a renowned warrior an ideal specimen will reflect that strength like i said something scary i disagree strength is endearing my little camaria and her mother hovat were two of the strongest people who ever lived maybe we would have gotten along i bet it's something cute women dig the cute stuff right yes all women in the entire universe get weak in the knees when they see something fluffy maybe hellbender is an exceptional female she would desire only the most worthy of pets you've never seen a baby otter playing with its hands i cannot refute this once we deliver her cries maybe hellbender could become an influential ally how so they say that the mere mention of her name can end a negotiation you want to turn the guardians of the galaxy into an extortion racket no i want people to offer us bigger tasks because they fear her wrath same thing drax oh we got company is this from the last stopper we haven't even placed it yet you're right this isn't working just hang in there [Music] guys huddle up [Music] it feels like they're everywhere laughing at us and yet we cannot retreat no one wants to retreat big guy but i gotta say it's scary out there quote partners on the field danger on all sides it's time we stand and face it and make sure they're nullified are we heroes to be laughed at no i'll laugh at them instead who's with me we'll talk fields what's up sometimes you did not know the lyrics one last freaky eye thing [Music] glorious bring on our monster i am engorged with the throne of battle didn't need to hear that come on last thumper spot is this way how do you know my senses are fine-tuned to measure even the tiniest vibrations really no i'm tracking it on my display the milano should be right on the other side of this door it was open when it came through here who says i tripped on something murder mom probably closed the door behind her excuse it me like it's still got some juice give it a go rocket what a genius at work you are a miracle worker man this tech was built by people who make holes and giant floating space rocks i have to say that is an immaculate parking job thanos never tolerated imperfection never been a problem for quilt my blades are eager to meet this monster remember we take it alive no accidents this time i don't want to repeat yeah yeah this is it last spot i can't wait to be out of here this place feels like it's about to collapse on itself i cannot wait to meet our monster i thought you were mostly interested in meeting the buyer she is a respectable collector is it working yeah yeah don't worry sunshine ow [Music] is it uh doing it what it appears to be broken ain't nothing broke that's the sound it's supposed to make what sounds you can't hear that dear what our monster has arrived crap the door we that works let's catch our monster man don't let it get behind it could be poisonous that's one less thing to hide behind maybe try calling it like a pet here monster who's a good monster bad creature confess the i punishment it's staring at me perhaps you resemble its natural prey [Music] abomination perhaps you speak its language ugly smelly what the is that definitely not a monster adorable it's more matted than an asgardian goat we cannot present this pathetic creature to the monster queen of sect off nine she'll laugh at us maybe we can use it as bait i knew those slumpers wouldn't work what my thumpers are state-of-the-art muscle head's the one who rushed to the first thing that came through the door my head is not made of muscle you guys seeing what i'm seeing yes that is a monster all right enough with the warm-up time to catch us a real monster let's get paid what house name is that definitely not cleaner bots watch it the whole place is crapping out we gotta get out of here now curse these volatile ruins rags go hold onto your fudge people rock it get the music on it focus on flying peter someone play this man a song now we're talking watch the ship i'm watching i'm watching you ain't dressed i am holding my buttocks displeasure someone give me a hand am i right how about one upside the head heads up we have debris time to thread the needle don't even think about it through that's it let me drive you're gonna get us killed we're not dead yet maybe we are in this town do not be ridiculous this place lacks the eternal process your hell is frozen catastions do not like to be cold try putting on a shirt see yeah thanks for the heads up you
