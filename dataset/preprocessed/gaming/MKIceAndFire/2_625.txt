sub-zero you will demand nothing night wolf your aggression is misplaced what do you know of mine you're not the only one whose people have been victimized but i have found new purpose in serving the spirits i do not cling to the past you no longer seek retribution you dishonor your kind i will honor the memory of my fallen the spirits have forsaken you shaman an impressive start you waste my time sorcerer restraint scorpion you will fight sub-zero soon enough scorpion i understand your desire for revenge but nightwolf is right there are other ways in which you may find peace sub-zero deserves death defeat sub-zero if you must but do not kill him i fear his death will give rise to a more treacherous foe i will have my revenge spare sub-zero's life and i will request that the elder gods return the shirai ryu to the realm of mortals i understand there are benefits to the grand master's plan but his plan goes against the inquiry principles we are lin quay cyrax we will obey the grand master's commands it means giving up our free will our souls it will turn us into scorpion your inferior clan is dead soon you will join them my clan may walk the earth once more a challenge scorpion versus cyrax and sector your obsession with sub-zero ends here scorpion win i will have my revenge but i will not kill sub-zero as they did to hell with your clan the netherrealm this is where i was

[Applause] [Applause] [Applause] your clan your family [Music] no that is not me ouch despite my efforts my vision has come to pass an unfortunate end he once defended earthrealm from the nether realm armies of shinnok and quanchi scorpion will pay for this sub-zero's fate is his own doing his own doing the lin quay have a history of making ruinous choices such as the cyber initiative i am among those speaking out against the grand master's plan surgically transformed the lin kuei into glorified robots it kills our intuition our instincts did you speak out against the lin quay's participation in this tournament you were invited by shang tsung he pays you to kill earth realm warriors betraying your own realm i expect better even from an assassin my loyalty is to the grand master victory for shang tsung means the end of earth realm and the lin kuei we should stay together tundra assuming your brother's identity will certainly draw attention not all of it welcome you are right smoke but assuming bihar's identity is the best way to honor him let us proceed then sub-zero we should separate our fellow lin quay will not be far behind once our absence is discovered if only they had been more forthcoming with the details of your brother's demise we will find shang he will tell us all he knows if he killed bihan he will die be stealthful as the night and deadly as the dawn no one in outworld or earth realm could stand up to you well done you may tell your fellow black dragon that i am very interested in your merchandise shang tsung i'll take care of him no charge one dead lin kuei in a ticket stay down i would have words with your associate tell me what you know of sub-zero's death what despite his failure at my tournament i'll wager he was more powerful than you lin quay assuming his form will not give you his skill shape shifter let us see if smoke can freeze smoke wins now answer me what do you know of sub-zero what smoke you have disobeyed the directives sector you will return with us to begin your transformation you actually did it you're a cyborg we are the league way more stealthful than the night more deadly smoke wins i will never submit there is great

my efforts the future remains in peril how could i have failed earthrealm do not lose faith in the spirits raiden they will guide you protect you sub-zero we will disrupt the soul nato i will be there momentarily hurry the smell appears to be nearly complete who is you you are not worthy of the name sub-zero who are you to judge i wore those colors before you be hon yes quielyang it is i guanchi restored me restored you and i both we are flawed copies of our former selves i have no flaws quan chi has perfected me for what end to serve the nether realm and outworld it suits my purpose but brother you share blood we are not brothers then i will not regret your defeat you are right we are not brothers [Applause] gold your soul is not safe earth realm state is sealed night wolf not yet we fight until the end night wolf wins your time is over [Music] [Music] uh but how do we know braden could be having visions of possible futures not the future sonja's right was i supposed to have my arms replaced with these or was it caused by interfering with the timeline my head hurts just thinking about it this isn't helpful we cannot second-guess our decisions raiden what are your thoughts raiden yes that is best what is our next objective night wolf it is done earth realm souls are safe no oh is it not enough i must speak with the elder gods shao khan's violation must be punished but the battle is joined here an earth realm we cannot win without the elder gods but master who came close as a shadow night wolf you will lead until we return as you wish well now what standing around here won't do us any good wait so much for standing around attack [Music] what is it [Music] [Music] come forward if you dare i will finish what the ling cray could not let's do this attack [Applause] [Music] [Music] mother please i am no longer your mother mother this is not your way shao khan has corrupted you shao khan has resurrected me you have betrayed him embraced a pathetic cause remember edenia mother remember your rule before xiao khan's invasion quiet child it is time for you to join your friends monster [Music] still alive no matter soon you will reunite with your ancestors oh where are you elder gods i beseech you earth realm is in danger we are aware of your plight then you must intervene on earth realm's behalf we cannot but shao khan liu kang has bested him twice yet he still khan has not violated the rules of mortal combat what he invades earth realm as we speak invasion is not itself a transgression it is the merger of realms that is prescribed a distinction without a difference innocents are dying at the hands of outworld it is regrettable but the mortal combat tournaments are not intended to prevent certain outcomes they are intended only to maintain balance among the realms please you must we have spoken the last doors are closing we are nearly trapped ah a victory is mine shaman not if i take it from you oh by the elder gods katana new king you were right i wish we had met under different circumstances katana [Music] they are dead i we abandoned them and they're dead my heart too is heavy with their sacrifice their deaths achieved nothing what is next raiden tell me the future how do we honor their sacrifice i climbed to heaven now i must plunge into the depths i will go to quanchi ally our realm with his against the forces of outward what groffle before quan chi what will he demand what price will be paid would any price be too high to save earth realm i had prayed it not true but you have gone mad raiden please enough i must help the wounded leave on your hopeless quest may the elder gods protect you [Music] it disappoints me to see you here save your pity i will have an audience with quan chi you may address me i will inform him is this why you chose not to save your family and clan to maintain your place at his feet do not talk with my family raiden fetch your master scorpion i must speak with him you speak only with me now scorpion fetch your master you seek an audience i seek cooperation between earth realm and the nether realm losing the battle are you we will prevail but with another realm fighting at our side poorly raiden earthrealm's defenses are overwhelmed you have mere hours name your terms what do you offer i offer i offer the souls of earthrealm warriors who die in this conflict [Laughter] [Applause] they would agree you are cavalier with other men's souls not just others i offer my own soul as well if i die you will have it how noble raiden yet utterly pointless no you see their souls are already mine shao khan's payment for netherrealm's allegiance no this was not meant to be earth realm has lost raiden now so shall you finish victory is nearly complete soon he will arrive in earth realm no the elder gods cannot allow it the elder gods are toothless your world is near destruction yet they do not act they must only through mortal combat may shall khan merge the realms lest he face the judgment of the elder gods lest he face the judgment of the elder gods he must win it is you who faced judgment raiden thank you quan chi i now know what must be done [Music] back from the nether realm empty-handed i see lukang liu kang i now realize what we must do we must allow shao khan to merge the realms that is insane the elder gods forbid it without victory in mortal combat when he does the elder god's fury will fall upon him defeating shao khan before the merge is but temporary he will return bringing armageddon i have foreseen it enough raiden he is here no do as i say have faith in the elder gods have faith in me liu kang i cannot let you fight shao khan then you are do not interfere no enough of your madness if you must die so be it no this was not meant to happen what did you do lucan forgive me you have killed us oh come on it's up to us ah readin you have come to your senses earthrealm citizens suffer further resistance serves no purpose all these ages you have fought me you denied me my rightful claim not this time the elder gods fear me now their pathetic mortal combat shackles me no longer [Music] huh they masquerade as dragons but are mere toothless worms i know you can feel it it is the end of all things elder gods where are you why do you forsake me your time has passed ages wasted in foolish resistance i have won yes you have won now raiden your world ends [Music] our penalty is clear an anemic effort from ineffectual deities today i become the elder gods [Music] uh um [Music] uh oh it is over but only at the gravest of costs [Music] so many are gone their light has sunk into the earth i am responsible for their loss you did what you had to to protect earth realm loss is in war inevitable come let us tend the fallen then we must help our realm rebuild our work has only just begun [Music] [Music] khan was blinded by rage how easily he was convinced that the elder gods would ignore his merging the realms yet the thunder god still lives no matter neither earth realm nor outworld can now withstand the nether realms onslaught it is time soon i will be free earth realm and outwards oh [Applause] um destination head head set her down nice and easy for me don't i always if by always you mean not once major all right you have the rendezvous coordinates far into the forest from there we access the portal to raiden's sky temple where there's an angry former elder god and his devil's waiting for us gods portals flying demons blind guys with magic swords the world has changed for the worse if we do not expel chinook from raiden's temple he means to poison earth realm's life force the ginsei and we're not gonna let that happen kenji and i appreciate the major allowing us to join you we're happy to help kick shinnok's bony ass back to the nether realm [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] nasty [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] no the end is near getting a little ahead of yourself aren't you hope someone got a shot of that gotta get back to the chopper sonia get out of there that was unpleasantly cold i liked it better when we fought on the same side are you okay we fared better than the men add them to the list of things shinnok will answer for oh uh [Music] [Music] foreign wait we must re-fortify the portals defenses below no fuji it is too late [Music] the mighty gods of earth realm you be foul of these hallowed grounds quan chi be gone surely you are pleased to see your friends you abandoned them to their deaths i returned them to life a life worse than death one you will soon share and my lord himself shall witness your fall [Music] [Music] uh you see it now raiden your legacy you poison their hearts with hope and what do you offer the same as you did millennia ago when you betrayed your fellow elder gods and attacked earthrealm we stopped you then imprisoned you in the nether realm we will do so again remove the shadow from the light the shadow grows the legacy of life is death raiden my followers accept this and live on they fight for me uh yes will not touch the ginseng oh i will and all of earth will learn the truth of death [Music] oh sorry ma'am didn't see you there miserable wretch insignificant speck of faculty scum how dare you that is mine ready as always [Music] she will be the first to join me now [Music] i'm not sure what just happened to me but i am sure

team's first mission you're going to the linguay temple we haven't heard from the grand master in a while so we need to make sure he's still on our side that he's got our backs if things flare up again without world you need to bring him in but don't be surprised if sub-zero's not willing to cooperate why be worried about outworld i thought cottle khan respected the reiko accords he does but he's facing a civil war the rebels win those accords will be history nope no evil sorcerers in here would you get serious quan chi needs to clean up his man cave it's cleaner than yours you're

family our honor is indeed stained please sit [Music] after you and i were freed from quan chi's control i sought out my clan i had hoped rebellion from within would have quashed the grand master's plans but sektor had realized his father's vision the lin kuei had been fully cyberized i pledged to kill sektor and his followers reform the lin kuei and restore our honor i am not interested in lin quay politics sub-zero when i finally killed sektor i discovered the lin kuei had not sacrificed its honor with the cyber initiative we had abandoned it long before there will be no peace scorpion

strong but lacks judgment she cannot see the wisdom of peace i will deal with her you spoke of the linquay's lost honor for years i had thought you would unfairly blame the lin kuei for the deaths of your family and clan but sektor's cyber preserved memories revealed the truth [Music] the lin kuei need to abide their agreement sector the grand master gave shinnok his word chinook's currency is lies as is yours payment is due i exterminated the shirai ryu as promised hanzo hasashi lives he's your spectre scorpion i created scorpion from asashi's soul after he died we observed the agreement the letter not the spirit you are owed nothing [Music] satoshi had i known of my clan's complicity in the shirai raju's extinction our history would be different i killed your brother because i

reactivated it he's building an army by processing linguay warriors kidnapped from my temple i can see why you need me we could enter through that tunnel but a frontal assault would be here bloody needlessly dangerous there's another entrance less populated and the rest of your plan we get help on the inside we'll avenge your clan cyrix is your inside man he was converted against his will if we disable the behavior inhibitors that control him he will turn on sector all cyberlink way are linked to a common network cyrex can shut them down from within who is the woman i don't know focus on

request the shirai ryu's hospitality my sky temple has been compromised there is no safer place for us to gather lord raiden welcome to the fire garden the elder gods are gone shinnok is cronica's son no wonder she sent the black dragon after me and dad we both kicked his ass it is not vengeance that drives kronecker she restarts history to balance light and dark among the realms what can we do lord raiden gather earth realms forces but that effort will be for naught if kotal khan's armies cannot join us cetrion informed me that xiao khan has captured kotal khan we must spare no effort to free him kung lao and i will go we will rendezvous with princess katana you both may the elder gods protect may you return victorious those warriors must be headed for chronica's keep agreed but why not use karon's fleet the bridge clearly taxes her power the fleet's bound to caught on it sails only by his command that it's still moored suggests he won't help konica in which case he may help us [Music] it looks like caught on his home perhaps hosting some unwelcome guests return to earth realm tell the others we found him we'll deploy as soon as i return are you certain karon will aid us no but he's our best chance [Music] [Music] you should have aided caron now you must suffer i am immortal devorah you cannot kill me this [Music] now chronica you fight for lost causes this one ensures the hive survival you will not save the shrai rail this should i like you will not fall the plan of imposters will indeed fall i've restored the [ __ ] i ryu built a clan that's never been stronger on a foundation of pretenders and outsiders cronica told me [Music] without our original bloodlines there is no [ __ ] our clan's massacre extinguished them kronecker will revive the true [ __ ] ira you in the new era do not trust kronecker she uses your anger to enslave you as quan chi did both of us i let go my rage and it saved me to save yourself you must do the same it's past time you were freed we both know what truly drives you it's not should i you pride it's your wife and child harumi and satoshi was stolen from me murdered seeing them again it's all that matters we share this pain i fought through hell to end it but chronica's new era is not the remedy she would resurrect shinnok the same devil who brought death to our family and clan he cannot be allowed to return when i revived the shirairayu i vowed our clan would ensure earthrealm's protection help me keep that promise poison chronic i knew your past sins would distract you now this one ends your misery now you die ah

fool blue kang kronecus puppet we only battle because she wills it i must help him i was wrong to doubt you i too have been a slave to anger i do not understand lord raymond your rage was caused by chronicle yes i succumbed to her influence but then our confrontation it unlocked memories memories not only from this timeline but from timelines that have come before wait a sec timelines plural cronica has restarted time on countless previous occasions using each timeline to learn and to perfect her plan the details of each timeline are different but in each one events conspire to bring lou kang and i into conflict in each one he dies only cronica has such power to control time and fate i don't get it why do that i do not know but be assured kronecker will control us no longer at long last you see the pattern the pattern but not the purpose why set me against lou kang is it not obvious your combined power threatens my vision for the timeline lou kang and i will not be divided further by your machinations oh raiden do you think this is the first time you made that vow we have repeated this exact conversation so often in so many timelines i have lost count this timeline will end differently we have played out all possible scenarios raiden you cannot win you are welcome to try of course but without lou kang by your side [Music] enjoy these final hours raiden they are all you have luke hey where is he cronica has taken him to her aisle we must leave immediately to save the realms we must save liu kang you're shaolin masters they're ready they will fight until the last man that is likely what it will take there will not be a fight if kharon does not help us is there any word from grand master hasashi no if we do not hear soon i will return to the nether realm wrong scorpion this cannot be good get raiden the fire gardens rebuilt the [ __ ] i know you are indeed restored why are you here scorpion where is grand master hasashi he is dead and now you have come to finish us i understand your mistrust but i am here to assist you i find that impossible to believe what is he doing here we are not together if you are here to help prove it join me against the sorcerer i shall [Music] forgin raiden thought you lost when the timeline was broken but you stand with shang tsung we have urgent news for raiden please let us pass this may be the sorcerer's trick the fire gardens will not be defiled by his presence why you have joined shang tsung is beyond me fujin what has he done to corrupt your mind you are no challenge perhaps listen before you judge [Music] thank you fujin the storm is not yet passed since when are you friends with this filth i'm here to save you raiden we hail from your tragic future in it liu kang defeated cronica but their battle destroyed her crown without this a broken timeline couldn't be repaired our only hope was to return here steal the crown and make use of its power now we can change the outcome of the fight against kronecker we can defeat her and fix time i had never thought you gullible brother shang tsung's schemes serve only to benefit him how could you fall for such lies be rational raiden spread your falsehoods elsewhere sorcerer you will not deceive us lord raiden we should listen he may be telling the truth there is only one way to find out now the truth braden stop this step aside lou kang put down the amulet its darkness is taking hold of you you also betray me this is not the way sangsung is not the enemy this time the realms hang in the balance and you form this unholy alliance enough of this madness if you both must die so be it my brother is my problem i will signal if i need help shinnok's amulet inflames your anger and clouds your judgments have faith in me now listen brother we're running out of time i am a fool i have allowed myself to become a slave to anger i will not allow my temper to fracture our resolve further surely you just north fuji not at all liu kang raiden's power makes you a fire god of course it does unfortunately i cannot transfer my power to lou kang yet first i must free his revenant from quan chi's curse we will face their evidence soon enough what else can you tell us about the final battle we must use every advantage [Music] lord fujin shang i trust you are enjoying your travels you have already been defeated once cronica of course fujin how else could you have escaped the void if you know this accept the inevitable surrender but clearly my loss was not your victory raiden if your future savior had gained full control of my hourglass we would not be here this timeline would no longer exist i see no harm in confirming your suspicion even if you defeat me what then who claims the hourglass surely you realize that shane soon will break your alliance we are prepared kronecker are you have you wondered why shang knows so much about my crown because he did your bidding gathering souls to fuel it shang is far too modest the crowd is his design no one save me knows more about its power i told you we would still be marooned at the beginning of time bickering among ourselves you must decide raiden who do you wish to keep time for all of creation me or shang soon neither cronica you will be beaten and if shang soon betrays us we will finish him you are a fool raiden do not condemn the realms to oblivion the chrome [Applause] it is a mistake challenging a titan now i end your existence you are vulnerable groningen [Music] [Music] brother are you all right yes but the crown truly my finest work i will instruct you in its ways what just happened chronicle came here to retrieve the crown we forced her to retreat we must strike while she is weakened let us join the armies massing at the sea of blood together we will storm kronecker's isle and take command of the hourglass [Applause] [Music] foreign race for impact [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] uh [Music] [Music] this mean you're back this means i'm sorry jackie in hell yeah i'm back [Music] so [Music] [Music] this [Music] [Applause] dad back uh [Music] you have no one left to betray concede chronica while you have time i'll let you live to serve me in my new era or would you prefer to be wiped from history sculpting the sands of time requires great power and skill you may wear my crown but you are not a titan destiny is mine you should have accepted my offer chronica i would have allowed you to wield great influence surely service is better than death you were chronically time and destiny on our mind to command every realm will bend to my wheels cease before you do my soul no kang i thought your duties required you stayed behind a lie something you know well i see now the hourglass showed that only i could wield the crown against chronicle successfully you let me win and to ensure victory you sacrifice the lives of your friends oh deliciously cold-blooded they are not gone shaxon they will live again in my new era your new era you underestimate my prowess chosen one i have the crown i have absorbed chronica's power you may have attained godhood but i am the keeper of time you are no match for me kronecker said much the same samsung you will share her fate now hand over the crown this is your only chance my only chance this is my triumph and your final moment your worthless existence is at its end fight make no mistake shanks you have chosen this fate [Music] [Applause] ah no more timelines will be twisted by your evil [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm oh [Music] where did you who who are you i am lord lucay god of thunder and fire god [Music] forgive my disrespect my lord enough you are humble not like the kung lao i knew the kung lao you knew a story for another time i have chosen you as my champion we have work to do you must be prepared trained trained for what [Music] after the victory over shao khan sub-zero learned from raiden the truth that the lin kuei were ultimately responsible for the deaths of both sub-zeros and scorpions families enraged sub-zero offered scorpion a chance to share in his quest for vengeance with a might of fire and ice combined they were a storm of vengeful fury as they cut down their foes once justice had been done sub-zero and scorpion disappeared into legend emerging from obscurity only to avenge the innocent the forces of darkness will never stop this deadly alliance zhao khan's death did nothing to relieve scorpion's pain the loss of his kin still weighed heavily upon him for reasons he could neither explain nor understand he was drawn to the home of the shiraira you standing amid the rubble in solemn contemplation scorpion was visited by apparitions of his fallen comrades who revealed the true mastermind behind their brutal deaths enraged he returned to the nether realm as the spirits of his kin immobilized quan chi scorpions slew him finally avenging their deaths remorse for his role in resurrecting shinnok weighed heavily upon scorpion's soul his desire for vengeance had brought earth realm to the brink of destruction scorpion offered to perform harakiri to atone for his offense but raiden suggested a more productive alternative instead of death raiden sent in scorpion to life he imbued scorpion with a small portion of the ginsei's power linking him to earth realm's essence scorpion and his shirai ryu clan would protect the jinsei and earth realm forever grand master sub-zero knew his lin quay clan would need more than martial arts to stave off future threats to earth realm in the frozen reaches of outworld he found the answer a female frost dragon with a clutch of eggs with his ability to freeze sub-zero hatched the dragonlings they accepted their lin quay masters and their training as combat mounts with the force of dragon riders the linquay's ferocity became legend none dared risk conflict with earthrealm once i gained the hourglass my first thought was to rewrite history and redeem the lin quay's honor but then i thought of bihan his life consumed by evil before i could redeem my clan i had to redeem my brother with the hourglass i wound back time to our childhood i studied every second of bihan's life to understand why why he embraced sektor's corruption why he reveled in the vile power given to him by quan qi armed with that knowledge i re-sculpted the sands of time i changed bihan's life and unfroze his heart now we are comrades not rivals together as joint grand masters we lead the lin kuei in defense of earth realm i made my future self a promise that i would not stay mired in the past but once i controlled the hourglass i could not keep that promise i had to restore my family over and over i crafted the sands of time yet in every new timeline my family's tragedy repeated i was powerless to change it after eons i learned the truth cronica was not alone she was one of many titans each more powerful and ancient than the elder gods it is they who conspire against us myself my family we are pawns in the game why i do not know but i will find out and then i will have vengeance [Music] you
