scale as you can see here the eight maka reactors form a ring around the center of our city and keep Midgar running day and night a maka which flows beneath our feet is a truly limitless resources at Shinra we've developed technologies to extract it and transform it into the fuel and electricity that powers everything we do thanks to the miracle of imago energy our lives are richer and better than ever before maka keeps our lights on at night and made made car into the city that never sleeps the triumph of technology and testament to man's potential nothing but a bunch of lies except that Marko

empty [Music] [Music] yeah in the distant past our planet was home to a people we call the ancients Melony Oh before we discovered Marco and his precursors were already pioneering its use somehow they learned of the great reservoir of energy pulsing their feet [Music] and once they have the ancients developed the needs to harness this powerful energy and bend it to their will the fruits of their labors have survived to this very day in the form of certain kinds of materia they're scripture to has endured we who are born of the planet with her speak or flesh machine and unto her promised land shall we one day return by her loving grace and Providence may retake our place in paradise alas the ancients themselves are long gone 2,000 years ago a meteor brought an end to their civilization but before their fiery end did the ancients I never thought of that even now we have only to wonder times have changed and the Shinra Electric Power Company is committed to changing an evolving with them

visiting a repository for shinra's expertise and know-how please make your way to the 60 second floor the corporate what greetings and welcome Avalanche I presume my name is Hart and it's a pleasure to meet you I've come to escort you to mayor domino per his request the mayor of Mecca the empty soup is just a mouthpiece for Shinra yes the mayor of our dear Midgar the most magnificent city ever built that Mayor Domino the visual entertainment Hall has been experiencing technical difficulties of late and he suspected that these difficulties might impede your progress so what does the mayor want with us I'm afraid you'll have to ask him that yourself yes we're supposed to follow look at this place so what you telling me to mayor some kind of crazy bookworm [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] through here if this is a trap you're a dead man here the mayor is waiting this can't be right ah wonderful you finally made it I am the mayor of the great metropolis of Macao Domino at your service I must say you three haven't exactly been discreet huh I wonder who's been cleaning up all your messes what the hell's going on come on think about it you've been caught by security several times walked in front of every other camera and scared an accountant half to death do you hear the alarm no you're welcome [Music] hmm I can only assume your cell wasn't looped in I am avalanches man on the inside see what is it really that surprising to you you've seen where they put me the mayor of the greatest city in the whole wide world tucked away in a secret prune closet in the damned archives the nerve those stupid Shinra pricks thought I just shut up and accept their treatment but they were wrong dead wrong huh well this oughta make things easier we need to break into Professor Hojo's lab what why you mean you're not here to give president Shinra his comeuppance we're here to save a friend who was taken but the president's going to get he is too if I have anything to say about it well I don't particularly care what you end up doing so long as it hurts Shinra great so I can hit you as far as the 64th floor polar you telling me that that's the best you can do that is indeed the best that I can do but you're them there but you're the mayor does this look like the office of a mayor I'm a glorified librarian nothing more they don't even invite me to their meetings sorting records and reports that's all I do my hands and fingers have more paper cuts than skin no one knows my pain my daily torment they've made me a pathetic shell of a man okay they did you wrong like us but we'll make it right so just calm down deep breaths man deep breaths hmm let me see that key card of yours hey you are you can now use it to access the recreational facility on the 63rd floor and then what are we supposed to do you look for a fellow Avalanche collaborator identify yourselves and he'll give you a key card to the 64th the countersign is the mayor is the best midgar's bear is nothing less everyone says he's cooler than the rest just say mayor to the guy and if he goes the best with gusto then you found your man you got it if you think you've found the collaborator said you got it now [Music] if you require additional assistance please do not hesitate to ask so can you tell us anything about this collaborator certainly I could do just that but a man in my position must conduct his affairs with discretion which is to say that that which has been requested cannot be freely given if you take my meaning you want money disclosing confidential information entails considerable risk do compensation is to be expected in this particular instance that would amount to ten thousand Gil rip us off more why don't you the 64th floor is reserved for our executives the individual you seek is fastidious and well-dressed this individual likes to visit the 63rd floor to decompress from the stress of the job that really all you've got forth are you dissatisfied with your purchase come unfortunately perhaps this will help preserve our relationship an expression of my gratitude and appreciation that's better [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] before you ask all purchases are non-refundable the information I provided concerned an executive after all you will know them by their carefully cultivated appearance I still can't believe the mayor is working Favell it would have been nice to know idiot today's juice should have kept us in the loop [Music] yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] so about this precious promised land of yours come now Aerith you misunderstand my intentions I wish only to satisfy their material greed so I can be left to pursue my great work our great work my dear you're the spitting image of her now I regret it to this day if she had only trusted me instead of trying to run he could have played out quite differently what a terrible tragedy to lose the last of the pure blooded ancients though not completely would you like to see your mother I'll be it through the lens of one of my microscopes did you really think we'd leave such a precious specimen to we collected and catalog every last bit of her pair skin organs every fragment of every bone as breathtaking in death as in life at you my dear I found that what right doctor her cellular structure and there it is that same elegance oh
