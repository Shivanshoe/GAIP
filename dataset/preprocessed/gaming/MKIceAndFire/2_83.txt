defined the lives outlasting 29 other superstars to punch his ticket to wrestlemania you have to think he's got a sight set on smackdown universal champion let's not get ahead of ourselves saxton let's just wait and see [Applause] let's hear what wwe champion seth rollins has to say after his little misstep on social media his account was hacked part of being the monday night messiah is being honest with your disciples it's that trust that bond that gives us strength and allows us to accomplish great things so i'm here tonight to tell the truth about why i did what i did to show it was all for the greater good and still can be so i'll speak directly to our discontented brother messiah to man first let's get this out of the way my social media account was not hacked we did have intentions of striking you down if you chose to face me at wrestlemania that's the truth but full disclosure there were other transgressions that took place before that i told mandy rose that you didn't want an automatic qualifying spot in the rumble that you really wanted to earn it which got you put in the 10 man qualifying match that's the truth and then when you won that match we needed another plan so i pulled some strings and got you the number two entry spot in the rumble and then of course we all know how that turned out and how we ended up here tonight and all of that is the truth so now i bared my soul to you and shown you everything we can still work together we can still do great things win the universal championship at wrestlemania and we can take over wwe like we had planned or you can ignore the truth throw everything away and take on the monday night messiah and his disciples and face your destruction at our hands make no mistake if you challenge us we will finish the burial that i started but remember i was just trying to steer you toward the correct choice to help you succeed and that's what i'm doing again now but this is it it's your last chance make the right decision honor the truth and trust me for the greater good will the royal rumble winner listen to the monday night messiah and put this all behind them or will he choose to take on seth rollins at wrestlemania we'll find out soon enough the wwe universe heard from seth rollins earlier tonight and we all want to know did his words have any impact on who you will face at wrestlemania you might be wondering why i'm holding this shovel you see seth likes to speak in metaphors and talk about all sorts of things like the greater good and embracing the truth so i figured i'd speak his language seth you and your disciples tried to bury me but you failed and now i'm gonna bury you at wrestlemania that's right i'm not changing my mind but you know what why wait until wrestlemania i'm gonna start the burial tonight by taking out your disciples in a three-on-one match actually i forgot about the shovel make that three on two as seth rollins followers prepare for this three on one match against their former ally you have to imagine their leader the monday night messiah will be watching closely with the odds heavily in their favor seth won't be satisfied with anything other than a convincing win i think that's exactly what we're gonna see here tonight from behind with that shovel he's not waiting for the match to start it's no longer three on one that shovels an equalizer he's taking out weeks of built-up frustration after being held back by seth and his group he said he was gonna bury seth's followers but i didn't know he meant it literally i think mustafa ali and austin theory could have serious injuries it doesn't appear that the scheduled match will take place seth's crew is decimated maybe but it looks like murphy still wants to fight poor decision on his part this guy's out for vengeance nonetheless it looks like we're now going to have a singles match [Applause] and here's a superstar that has all the tools to be one of the biggest names this business has ever seen i'm not ready to crown him as the next big thing just yet but his performance in this match could sway me you're not the only person to be looking to convince tonight then there's murphy across the ring a man searching for recognition a superstar is trying to step out of the shadows and make a name for himself murray may be overshadowed at times but make no mistake about it murphy's a wildly talented competitor with a tip on his shoulder and fire in his lungs murphy turns that away he unpacks a well-placed punch [Applause] another reversal [Applause] scorpion smoke no other way to put it guys that was kind of a butt kicking this is what you get when you have complete confidence and control of the situation the following contest is scheduled for one fall and is for the wwe championship [Applause] we are about to see something good here we go gentlemen huge title match coming up and a huge opportunity for the champ to prove to everyone that there truly is none better in all of wwe right now the challenger looking determined he will need the performance of a lifetime to become champion [Applause] well the messiah has arrived it is time to embrace the vision [Applause] now we're talking [Applause] come on let's go the messiah in his kingdom set rollins at the showcase of the immortals michael you of all people have to remember the heist of the century when rollins cashed in his money in the bank at wrestlemania 31. he'd go on to defeat triple h at wrestlemania 33 but the highlights don't stop there byron no rollins won the intercontinental title at wrestlemania 34 won the wwe championship at wrestlemania 35 and rollins is guaranteed to perform another wrestlemania miracle [Applause] tonight introducing the challenger from new york weighing in at 269 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke [Applause] and introducing the champion from davenport iowa weighing in at 217 pounds he is the wwe champion that's what it's all about the wwe championship the challenger wanted this opportunity now he's got it well it's always fun to go to the zoo until you fall into the lions then the challenger had better sharpen his teeth the road to wrestlemania has led to this the defending wwe champion seth rollins will take on his former associate a superstar who's so called the gravedigger due to his vicious pledge to bury seth rollins once and for all in tonight's no dq wwe championship match one of wwe's most fearsome alliances has been shattered by the quest for this wwe championship michael you have to wonder how those betrayals will affect the outcome of one of the most personal wrestlemania main events we've seen in years that's right they've all got something on the line tonight and what should be an absolutely brutal no disqualification format listen sometimes the only road to wrestlemania is the roll road seth rollins and his opponent know that but only one of them will leave wrestlemania as champion rollins struggling rollins in deep deep trouble step up hold on it's seth rollins disciples well last we knew they weren't medically cleared to be here looks like they're going to get revenge for what was done to them on raw with that shovel never underestimate the monday night messiah we should have known he wasn't going into this match without a backup plan i know there's been a lot of turmoil between these men and this is no disqualification but this is wrestlemania it's not supposed to end like this this is gonna get ugly i can't watch what the hell what just happened he could this be it [Applause] he's done it after a shocking tournament where former allies turned enemies became allies again seth rollins has been dethroned and we have a new wwe champion and more than a new champion it looks like we have a new alliance with a new leader i think we just saw the birth of a new monday night messiah and seth rollins can't believe it he thought he had the match and his wwe championship secured but that was not the case the new champion set out to bury him and that is exactly what he just did this is a wrestlemania moment that will be remembered for a very long time i'm in shock wow congrats to the new champion i guess the following contest is the wwe universe just exploded oh we've seen the opposition tonight post on social media about lane and on the line to leave here tonight with that coveted prize and it won't be easy this champ is as dominant as we've ever seen from a title holder i've got a feeling this one will live up to the height the pressure is on for the champion looking to cement himself as one of the best of this era with a big win tonight [Applause] introducing the challenger tonight the monday night messiah reaches gospel from inside a steel cage as he tries to win back his title from the newly minted wwe champion who has proven time and time again he may very well be the most powerful man in all of wwe there's nothing like strength in numbers wwe champion has that in spades with three new disciples in this corner i just don't see a world where murphy austin theory and mustafa ali don't find a way to get involved tonight lock caves or not yeah yeah everyone in the wwe universe has been talking about the shovel heard round the world at wrestlemania but the reality is the new wwe champion has been the man to beat all by himself and rollins capitalizes and look here he's making his way up the cage fortitude being tested unceremoniously sent right back down to the canvas [Applause] just turned that around getting set up for something in the corner and he's one step ahead there oh big knee to the midsection the challenger is not in a great place yeah this has been grueling this cage match is getting written on these competitors bodies and here he is scaling up the cage wall [Music] the sprint of the cage is on now that is why there's a champ getting ever so close to the very peak of the steel cage and now he has finally been able to reach the top of the cage and would you look at that he could be well on his way to escaping the steel cage the longer he's up there the more fear starts to seep into the mind the champion retains here is your winner and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this win never a doubt barely a moment's suspense this one was about as lopsided as they come so well misery loves company the following contest is scheduled for one fall on the way to the ring at a combined weight of 389 pounds sub-zero scorpion smoke and mandy rose two of the very best at doing whatever it takes to win i think we're about to see some brand new ways of cheating iron sharpens iron saxton one half of the street profits stir it up michael stern and representing the street profits from chicago illinois weighing in at 230 [Applause] true honor to be a a part of his matches spent four years protecting our country as part of the marine corps also worked for the navy but now he makes his living and wwe we all want the smoke you can't handle the smoke yes i can she calls herself the e-s-t and from knoxville tennessee [Applause] bialca's been exceptional her entire life she earned all sec and all-american honors in track and field at the university of tennessee and if you just ask her she'll tell you why she's better than everybody else you got eyes byron you understand a freak in the weight room a beast in the ring bianca bel-air can do it all and she's got a lethal hair whip raw's general manager mandy rose and the wwe champion are teaming up to take on bianca bel-air and montez ford after mandy's had some issues with bianca as of late i'm not sure why mandy chose the wwe champion is there something developing between these two it's simple mandy chose her partner because he's the wwe champion as far as i know there's nothing else going on here let's keep it professional saxton place to the corner how about this nicely done solid connection now tracking the opposition he's taking some good hits oh check out this power this is ridiculous [Applause] montez ford oh my god gets beat to the punch she's then flying into the corner nicely done into the cover he really thought that was it he is just reeling from that offense yeah this is exactly why constant frequent tags are so important in a match hole being ended here oh come on rap get some control shut up byron pair of chops and another here they come over and over and there's more [Applause] oh look at this incredible together nicely and there's the cover [Applause] scorpion smoke and mandy rose and this mixed tag team proves to be a very effective one tonight two men with one common goal can be a dangerous thing they're putting the entire locker room on notice so [Music] the following contest is scheduled for one fall oh yeah i like this guy wow the scottish warrior is ready for battle brandishing the king's blade this is a man who fought his way all the way to the top of wwe completely different mindset than his first time around in wwe for years people always talked about the potential of drew mcintyre what he could accomplish well it seems finally drew mcintyre is embracing those expectations the chosen one has now become the one introducing the challenge there's been a lot of whining from drew mcintyre coming into tonight's match about possible illusion between the wwe champion and mandy rose am i the only one who thinks it's possible that drew mcintyre is just a little bit jealous oh come on corey i don't think it's considered whining if it's justified only one thing is for sure the deck is stacked against drew mcintyre will be able to climb the mountain and recapture the wwe championship let's find out stomping crouch mcintyre gets away from that following wow [Applause] mcintyre reverses and looks to capitalize some serious damage to the arm being inflicted here and he's able to reverse oh perfect kick getting sucked strikes with a kick another one bites the dust to the chain oh sharp kick the champions shock is palpable the champ will have to dig deeper now that was the home run shot that got robbed at the fence that dodge can buy drew time paying it right back with the reversal oh stinking kick just stomping every single part of his body mcintyre gets met with a response [Applause] holy moly how out of the way and the champion finally ready to put this one away [Applause] and still the wwe champion sub zero scorpion smoke that came out of nowhere and an unexpectedly quick end to this match an absolute statement by the victor here tonight what a steam rolling oh one of the best superstars around there's certainly been no shortage of drama leading up to tonight's extreme rules match between ron strowman and the beleaguered wwe champion especially after the champions very public falling out with raw's gm mandy rose extreme circumstances for this extreme rules match michael it's the monster among men first the monster among taking flight oh a huge miss there oh he just rarely dodges turning the tables there he decide she's dodges he saw that one coming [Applause] back and forth from these competitors looking to catch him off guard and he breaks the pin right away he wasn't even close on that pin attempt he reverses it [Applause] he's pushed to the break [Applause] perhaps the perfect match never any doubt in this one here we go in this highly anticipated wwe championship match hold on it looks like raw gm mandy rose is here i wonder who she's gonna side with certainly not the wwe champion after everything he's done the wwe champion has already overcome lauren's braun strowman's size beat down tonight but can he handle back-to-back thrashings no man should endure that much pain in one night but that's exactly what the rainy wwe champion will have to do to defend his title against the former champion drew mcintyre i'd wish the champ good luck but he's gonna need a lot more than that to survive this match but hey embarrass mandy rose and this is what you get off the turnbuckles what's he gonna do stirring back to his feet but he might not know where he would look out oh god that's a bad landing that is what happens when you throw your body around you eventually meet the pavement i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the longer way down last ride look at this blue thunderbolt this has got to be it challenger's a little worse for wear now drew fending him off reversal on top of reversal he finds a counter to mcintyre there oh foot just stomping down well piercing strike that kick will stop you in your tracks oh what a kick makes him pay with a counter so much damage inflicted answering back oh that's going to sting saul and he said you're not getting me with that this time neckbreaker laid down with a powerbomb was ready for that that's a good way to make your presence felt mcintyre holding him at bay oh god he's back into the ring and he has free reign to the outside with no count-outs to worry about i think the paradigm has shifted oh a nasty stop to finish it off he turns it around knee right to the midsection and this match will head back to the ring are you serious how much more can the wwe champion endure tonight we're about to find out staved up oh this is [Applause] here is your winner and still the wwe sub zero scorpion smoke that came out of nowhere and an unexpectedly quick end to this match there's the consequences of getting caught unprepared just goes to show you you got to be on your toes at all times yeah now we're talking to hold one of the biggest titles in wwe means you're one of the best in the industry it's been a wild ride on raw these past few weeks but the wwe champion and gm mandy rose have bound to put their drama behind them and focus on this triple threat match for the wwe title it's about time michael the wwe champion will defend his title against bronze sherman and a hungry drew mcintyre who's had his eye on this title ever since he won a number one contenders match what feels like a lifetime ago good things come in threes love triangles triple threats bounce teams if you don't count saxton and right now we've got three superstars that absolutely loathe each other facing off for the wwe championship what more could you ask for [Applause] just like that brawn gets passed on drug great athleticism challenger's a little worse for wear now he is truly feeling it right now as well he should [Applause] great presence he's definitely being the aggressor here yeah he is showing us a lot out look at him perfectly executed escape just in time the challenger not looking good right now this should come as no surprise you know you're going to take some big hits strong is being cut down in every corner brown is shockingly being dismantled debilitating attack on the leg he foiled that attempted to retain the title that's it the champ stays the champ here is your winner and still the dopey and here we go introducing the chip wwe championship title match is now officially underway history could be made regardless of which one of these men you're a fan of or you support you cannot argue these are two men with championship pedigree you can't be in this position if that weren't true second one didn't effective now trampling the opposition [Applause] knee smash able to avoid there the challenger eating up some damage no need to panic he's still swinging he must have had that scouting that one's scouted sequence of reversals there absolutely spike ddt mesa avoids that's a big clothesline [Applause] reflexes and the champ stands tall once again here is your winner and stick me so with today's technology i can watch wrestling anywhere gentlemen you were looking at a man who was sick of the doubters sick of being questioned by his potential and i can't disagree with him i expect tonight to be a night where he can silence the skeptics and prove to be the future of this company he'll be a tall order but the confidence he possesses could take him very far and then with ricochet you know he's willing to step up to any challenge that is presented to him ricochet steps up but he also steps up when it's not the wisest decisions at times he's got more heart than brains [Applause] oh this is kicking the spine really just laying it in great counter by ricochet series of reversals big knee to the midsection solid contact there ricochet being grounded for the time being ricochet's knight is not going according to plan but ricochet has to push now while there's an opening i don't know if i want to go on this trip guys but you might have to because it's the last ride goes into the pin gets the shoulder up wow what's it going to take just kicking out at one takes a lot in a match like this he's looking a little weary now everything's considered cold it's not a bad condition to be in at this point in the match there's some shock in the arena after that kickout ricochet can do now an emphatic victory here is your winner me well hearing that otis wanted a late night snack and devoured everything catering had prepped hope you're in the mood for peanut butter sandwiches and nothing else just don't take it out on otis okay i heard he was hungry could have happened to anyone here he comes looking into the eyes of this competitor tonight you know he understands the significance of this match this is an opportunity to make big headway on the roster well unfortunately for him he's facing otis tonight i'm not gonna lie i kind of miss that's because you're a simple man saxton this otus is an upgrade in every conceivable way he's lost the goofiness leaned into his natural ability and now he's leveled up into one of the most intimidating superstars on the roster both wrists captured [Applause] it's nothing he hasn't been through before [Applause] uh-oh this is not gonna end well and the attack from otis avoided oh stomping away [Applause] there andy's able to counter counter after counter and he barely evades up [Applause] here is your winner hmm any truth to the rumors that dolph ziggler is messing with everyone's stuff backstage hearing is doing a bit in his comedy routine about the weird things he's found in superstar's luggage shouldn't a locker room leader step up and get him to knock it off and you can sense the anger emanating from the competitor tonight like a blazing fire this is a man you don't want to be in front of right now the man possessed is what he is and for dolph coming into this one i think you need to strip away all the talk on social media all the interviews they're all just smoke screens trust me dolph's coming in with sinister thoughts yes always using out of the ring tactics to distract his opponents from the vicious in-ring wrestling threat that he is oh man talking about dismantling your opponent [Applause] oh [Applause] oh he knew what was coming out striking combination lethal whoa this is surprising byron yeah i think he was just looking to soften him up a little here and there's dolph being out wrestled he planned for this and can still rally the stop in every single part of his body oh no no no no [Applause] that holds back ziggler's attack samoan dropped byron wait now why byron what's the sense in this decision i don't have an answer michael if you could put him away you should put him away he knows how to avoid content knew what was coming there initial reversal ziggler looking evasive catching a drop kick kick a little extra lester behind that kick [Music] [Applause] scorpion [Music] you
