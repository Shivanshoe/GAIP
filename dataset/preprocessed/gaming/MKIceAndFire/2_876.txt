he was right here i was holding him he was right there nothing i could do the i've seen myself get killed club would like to welcome its newest member say hi to daniel everyone seriously that's some real cold-blooded [ __ ] taylor lighten up will you we're going crazy here not doing any harm now we know the pattern angela was killed after seeing her double executed taylor had a narrow escape from that thing you see your double get it and you're next that's real reassuring thanks for sharing isn't it better to know what's gonna happen to you but there it is that's what's been after us we can't let it trap us up here what do we do now with that thing outside quiet it's out there listen it's out there for now what if it decides to come in after us maybe we're okay if we stay inside the church because because it's holy ground a church maybe it can't come in really it's a [ __ ] vampire now i'm just saying this is a solid building he's right we're safer in here we're staying put that thing is hunting me just like before it wants me you don't get what we're dealing with that thing out there is something [ __ ] else we gotta get away from it right she's right we need to split we stay here and it's snack time for that thing whatever we do we stick together remember what happened to angela okay let's do this we're going out the back amen to that what the hell is that another good reason to split let's go maybe those things have gone looks clear stay close go get out of sight wow uh uh huh yes where are you taylor come on talk to us got to do something now hold on we need to become [ __ ] calm taylor's in trouble daniel taylor is that you i'm over here oh am i happy to see you guys i thought i'd lost you we're still in big trouble here i need a break we got to keep moving can't stop no wait he needs a break forget those things are coming after us not you we can't hang around i keep telling you stick together and we'll be fine fine like angela right all right what's our next move i'm not sure we should rest here for a while you asleep that's impressive i wish no way i could get any shut-eye after what went down tonight would love to though i'm beat any ideas how we getting out of here listen it's clear now there's no help available we're on our own sure seems that way our best shot maybe our only shot is to stop that girl mary getting to mary stopping her might help sure okay but what about the other kid the one that keeps running from us mary and her are connected somehow i'm sure of it maybe the other girl is trying to lead us somewhere where i don't know maybe to a place we can stop all this everything feels out of control i don't think there's anything we can do at this point mary's the key to everything that's happened the trials the executions sure but how are we supposed to stop her not even sure she's real too late for us to do anything now i've had it this is over mary may look like a kid but she's the embodiment of evil we have to stop her it's not that simple and like you said she's just a kid we can't listen to me we see her again we do whatever is necessary what's that hell no that thing is back to finish me off didn't you learn anything from almost killing that old man put it away that old bastard isn't out here this is something else point that goddamn thing at someone else will you angela my god never thought i'd see you again i was sure you you were gone we thought you know we're all glad you made it stop it you're gonna make me blush but thank you no one messes with you for sure you are one tough lady so the whole crew is back together you rounded everyone up good job not quite they found us right now our priority is getting you safe let's go we've come across more of those things since you left us the thing that chased after me was horrendous now you're telling me there's more of them what in god's name are they you okay without your glasses i most certainly am there is plenty here i don't want to see you lost your glasses but not your sense of humor good you hear that i heard it sounded close too just gotta keep moving let me help you down will you hold up andrew wait professor angela you there daniel taylor guys where the hell are you get the [ __ ] out of me hold on taylor i gotta help oh taylor we're over here oh we got out of there in one piece i'll never know hold the celebrations we're still cornered in [ __ ] central and the [ __ ] mutants are still out there we gotta keep moving we have to go right now it is conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles then free is yours it cannot be taken from you not by angels or by demons heaven or hell perhaps you've started to realize something that everything and everyone may not be quite what they appear to be three executions three tormented beings and so far your students have all avoided damnation eternal suffering any thoughts on what might be around the corner hidden by the fog something wicked this way comes keep a lookout for the girl we have to stop her pretty sure she'll be back real soon this may sound crazy but what if saving our doubles from execution is how we save ourselves i was only hunted after my double was killed is anything here not falling apart fireflies that's what's causing the glow looks kind of beautiful don't you think kind of weird looking no this cannot be my own eyes deceive me my apologies for the lateness of the hour but i must speak with you what ails you my friend it is mary i am troubled by her by the part she has played in these trials those trials trouble us all there is more to this i saw a smile as her own sister was executed she took pleasure from it are you certain i am but now that she speaks of guilt and remorse it is hard not to believe her keep away from her abraham no god can come from being with that child too late with her brother and sister gone mary now lives under my roof your charity places you in grave danger what do you advise tell the court you suspect she toys with us all but you saw a delight in her own sister's death i implore you i am torn mary seems full of remarkable suspicions to yourself and it's our community which will suffer none of us is safe from a wild imaginance very well if the court will listen i will speak i am bewitched you're not bewitched how else can your presence be explained i can't explain this but you're not she has conjured you to defend her to press me into silence only the devil could create a demon who saw resembles me i'm not a demon but we do look alike which i agree is pretty damn weird what do you want from me i wanna know what you're gonna say to the court about mary i was decided to speak to the cause now i'm not so sure i know how this must look but you have to speak out tell everyone what the girl did like your friend is telling you to the devil has sent you to tempt i must not succumb little hope is no longer the town i knew strange and disturbing events have become commonplace you whatever you are are but one of these revealing the truth about mary may save my friend but it does not sit easily with me that in doing so i condemn a child putting it all on a kid isn't right the priest is the one driving this whole thing that's way off we got to stop the kid no other way to do this reverend carver is a man guided by god no one can doubt that bad move there man standing up for the kid is probably gonna do us all in i hope you're wrong for all our sakes what happened you get a chance to confront mary no we never even saw her [ __ ] we met up with andrew's double abraham he was thinking about testifying against mary but good boy andrew talked him out of it that was a smart move are you [ __ ] kidding me we are seeing glimpses of what happened here hundreds how are you doing not great demons from the past don't know how much more of this [ __ ] i can take one thing i didn't see coming i feel like one of the teams makes no sense i'm good with that at all it never happens to me yeah i hear that learned a few things about myself tonight shame it had to be from witches and ghosts we could have used one of those uh what do you call it a paladin a fully warrior holy [ __ ] i never had you down as a game geek there's a lot more about me you don't know i'm full of surprises you'll see we need to get moving [ __ ] this place in this stupid ass crash that got us here taylor where are you taylor taylor that you hold on to me whatever happens do not let help go don't let go i'm not letting go uh ah we gotta move okay what the [ __ ] is that thing let's check that out it'll get us out of these damn woods and we can talk on the way you
