hike it's all on this usb drive all the evidence you need to nail typhon for gabe's death and plenty more all right bring it with you i'll meet you in an hour thanks talk soon citizens of haven springs we are live at the spring festival one final reminder to head over to the lathe flower cart and grab a rose before they're gone at haven's inaugural spring festival eligible women of good stock and birthing age would offer up roses in order to attract a mate what can i say history is weird thankfully we've lost the mating stuff but kept the roses and if you do have a special someone in mind a rose is a great way to say you care and an even better way to say hey look a rose sounds fun is giving away a rose something i'd do maybe i can decide downstairs for now i'll grab the usb stick just dropped a block of alabaster on purpose because i wouldn't stop digging guess the festival started a while ago steph did a really great job putting all that together it's very tempting to curl up with this all night instead of leaving my apartment i'm thinking this will make an excellent after festival snack i think i'll stick with minesweeper from now on pretty but not very gabe why does he have this [Music] traditionally you give roses to your crush at the spring festival so [Music] i've never had a girl give me flowers before i'm sorry i didn't know you cared so much about traditional gender roles i'll get back to my butter churning in doilies shut up you first i've been meaning to tell jed about the sink but i'm afraid he'll try to teach me how to fix it myself yeah this one ornament will really bring my tree together for now i'll grab the usb stick don't worry i'll come back to you man the latest issue gets dark i'm sure ethan will be fine i've been playing more these past few weeks than the last few years feels nice the world really doesn't deserve feynor will you be my date to the festival shoe shoe i've got a lot riding on you small inanimate object i'm about ready to start my own list okay time to head downstairs i'll win the bard will ride again [Music] test test check check check holy [ __ ] you own a skirt [Music] hey guys happy first spring fest thanks i need to apologize to you guys what happened in the apartment something really messed me up these past few weeks i thought i had a handle on my emotions but after what happened with charlotte it's the same old story i lose control and i hurt the people i care about i'm sorry yeah [ __ ] that if anyone needs to apologize it's me ever since we've met you've been there for me and then when you're the one struggling i bail not cool i'm really sorry it's totally fine but i still owe you a new trophy let's play for it not to spoil the moment but typhon blew up their own mind why i don't know yet but we have all the evidence we need to nail them for gabe's death i got a hold of pike he'll be here soon once he sees what's on that stick it's over for typhon hence the celebration i think we've all earned the right to enjoy ourselves a little tonight the band's coming on soon you'd better be front center oh red do you need help setting up for the show nah it's all good we're almost there i have to run back to the trailer go be a normal person for a while can't make any promises text me when it's ready if i wanted to give away a rose steph and ryan would definitely be on my list anyway time to enjoy the festival it happened last year i remember clear's day probably around 10 or 11 p.m and he was already drunk as a skunk boy and i'm not advocating for that kind of drinking mind you despite my occupation spring fest is different from the lantern we all agree but anyway he comes racing out of the diner bowled over a couple of tables along the way i see him hauling ass toward the dock and i get on after him because i know what he's aiming for and sure as hell this son of a [ __ ] jumps right off the end of the dock and into the water smack belly flop and the poor bastard is so drunk he forgot he doesn't know how to swim so i jump in there after him took a minute but i dragged his ass back to dry land and we called him an ambulance just to be sure he was fine though [Music] so then i got to spend the rest of the night soaking wet which doesn't bother me none but everybody keeps offering me a bunch of goddamn towels next morning he shows up at my door with a box of chocolates chocolates god knows why he thought that was a right token of gratitude but in all fairness i ate the whole damn box best i ever had [Music] it's been a hell of a month but this makes it all worthwhile chad loves this town so much it's inspiring it's nice to see jed so in his element 232 233 234 no the red one was 2 30. it was so demoralizing why do i do this to myself hmm maybe i can help him somehow one two three hi oh hey nice to see you you're taking this jelly bean thing very seriously yeah because the prize is a 100 gift card chrissy's been all anxious ever since she got lost so i thought i could get her a bunch of treats which is really embarrassing saying it out loud not at all that's sweet maybe i can help oh for real are you good at this how many jelly beans do you think there are it's always more than you think it is i'd say like 800 or so huh yeah could be feels like something just changed in that lady by the jar maybe i should read her [Music]

like ryan is ready for me i better head back what are you so happy about been a while since i've seen you smile like that it's that cake that dragon shaped ice cream cake i feel like something clicked

[ __ ] keep flexing ice cream lady like ourselves as a promotion what if we called our loyalty program the rose can wait for now but i should give it away before the music starts i love that the radio

festival sounds like ryan wants to meet me on the rooftop okay i gotta admit this is a pretty great feeling [Music] neighbors come on back to the party but i should get to the rooftop eventually that's sweet but i think i'll avoid touching this bench just to be safe i get the feeling she's really enjoying herself so this is that whole communal gathering thing everyone's always going on about you enjoying the party ducky absolutely with a performance like that how could i not thanks you know i'm no stranger to the mandolin if you're ever looking for backup i'll keep that in mind typhon is not normal i made a mistake coming here so then where's the after party this year after party come on young man like yourself you must know what the haps is honestly i'm getting pretty bushed thinking of calling it a night soon my goodness what is this town coming to used to be that the spring festival wasn't complete till everyone was either asleep in the park or in someone else's bed must have been pretty wild back in your day my day i'm talking about last year god i just hope riley is doing all right hi eleanor good evening dear you were absolutely marvelous on stage i loved every minute of it thank you it was a lot of fun so we doing shots tonight or what of course body shots who's going first just kidding or am i the decorations really turned out beautifully it must have been a huge amount of work it's worth it i better get going oh i talked to riley earlier i think she's doing okay in case you were worried i so appreciate that alex thank you enjoy your night you too there's no graceful way to sample everything on this table is there the world's most unnecessary vodka delivery system doing this takes a certain type of person and i am not that person wow did that really happen [Music] hi there oh my god hi can i have your autograph okay i i'm serious oh uh sure find me later all right awesome thank you so much holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] she actually spoke to me okay i'm flattered the spring fest is pretty cool but this is awesome favorite time of the year by far that kind of enthusiasm is infectious especially for me it's a tree thank you wilderness expert i was more wondering why my mom used to get insomnia when i was a kid she'd drive over here to the lantern three in the morning to work in the garden sometimes she'd take me with her it's always been a special place for me i hope it can be for you too i should have been taking better care of it come on you've had other stuff to worry about like totally killing that set you're such a rock star thanks for everything i had fun so did the audience you know they're gonna make you do it again next year right you you good yeah fine i guess i've just been too wrapped up to think about what the future looks like okay so let's think about it alex's future in haven springs the major motion picture the ride on ice close your eyes it's morning chilly you can see your breath you're walking down main street on the way to work where the record shop oh i'm sure steph will appreciate that before you ruthlessly push her out and take her job that is so after work sun's still up for another couple hours it's warm now you're carrying your jacket under your arm what's the plan sit right here on the roof and play my guitar smart stay in practice only a few more months till the next spring fest anyway someone's at the door who only the coolest person in haven springs he walks up to you in an extremely cool way his plaid jacket swaying the breeze dork yeah i'm not trying to get you to plan out your whole life but if you decide you wanted to put down roots haven springs will always make space for you was that a gardening pun no maybe i i really care about you alex a lot you're the most amazing person i've ever met [Music] [Music] come on dummy kiss her kiss her [Music] i really want to kiss you right now [Music] i know [Music] wanna rejoin the festivities i'll get you a fun cake maybe you could save me one yeah of course i'll see you down there so so hey gabe can i tell you something i think i solved it why you died who's responsible isn't that crazy i'm out of threads to pull which is terrifying because on the other side of all this after typhon after you there's just normal life i was kind of counting on you to show me how to do that but i think i can figure it out i just wish you were here to see it oh um also i kissed ryan so that happened alex do you have the usb drive i do it's all here gabe's call their secret plan the cover-up you need to come with me to the station alex don't make this hard probably isn't how you pictured your first spring festival huh not exactly coffee i'm all right thanks so good cause we're uh actually out pike why am i here [Applause] the long and short of it is diane is charging you with stealing her usb drive that's [ __ ] i haven't done anything wrong they're the criminals here did you steal this usb drive or not at least tell me you looked at it i can't i'm sorry conducting an investigation into typhon right everything you've been looking for is on that drive despite my best efforts the case is closed the order came down today i did what i could but you know the evidence just wasn't there sorry alex the order came down today from who high up boss's boss's boss it's not my job to know look what happened to my brother wasn't an accident it was criminal the files on that drive prove it that could be true but let's say it is the issue is you stole typhon's property i can't work with that i just handed you a smoking gun it shouldn't matter how i got it maybe not but it does alex you're not thinking about this clearly seems pretty clear to me diane wants to charge you with computer fraud that's a federal crime alex 5 to 10 easy you know what [ __ ] diane this isn't justice this is a joke it's not that bad hey i talked to her and despite how angry she is at everything you did she's willing to let it go if you agree to drop everything typhon won't press any charges she's only offering that deal because she knows i have her she's guilty pike even if you're right your only evidence is inadmissible i think you should do it [ __ ] that i'm not signing anything alex no typhon buried something in the mountains something so massive they ignored gabe's call and set off the blast just to cover it up don't you want to know what it is what do you mean cover it up another blast unannounced set off at the exact same time at the old mining site and all of it happened just a few weeks before inspections were set to begin come on pike it's all right here like i said it doesn't matter alex please just sign the form and we can both go back to the party no alex this is not an offer that you can choose i said no no it's not an option what are you so scared of see for yourself [ __ ] what could be in that envelope alex please i don't want you to get hurt then help me damn it a deal just like they offered charlotte [ __ ] me is this a threat what did you expect huh the typhon a global organization with billions in revenue an army of lawyers who knows how many politicians in their pockets would just throw up their hands and say you got us i thought i could get justice for gabe yeah well typhon has their own idea of justice [ __ ] believe me i want nothing more than to make these [ __ ] pay i've learned the hard way that it's not possible they're too big too connected too ruthless you can hate me if you want call me a coward but i don't want to lose you like we lost gabe pike is terrified of typhon i bet if i took his fear away but it's not just about me steph and ryan are in danger too [ __ ] i want to hurt typhon so bad but can i really put their lives at risk along with mine do you want to risk your life over this gabe mack alex who's next [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] just keep your head down typhon doesn't lose typhon disappears people let them get killed not you i know you're afraid i am too i know you think that typhon is too big too invincible but they're not i will bring them down i just need your help if not for me then for gabe please [ __ ] i'll think about it thank you get the hell out of here really alex be careful those pictures how long have they been watching us and what will they do if [Applause] i have no idea what to do next maybe talking to jed will help me feel better first i need to get out of this dress i'll treasure it too ryan enjoy that ice cream i'm glad ducky had a nice night he deserves it can't wait to have nightmares tonight that must be ryan's i guess the night wasn't all bad might as well go talk to jed now [Music] hey chad there she is have a seat something tells me you've had a more exciting spring festival than you planned for you saw pike arrest me and let you go apparently then there's that business with ryan and steph earlier today i wasn't sure why it took all three of you to work out diane's lunch order i know you're used to looking out for yourself gabe was like that but havens a community we help each other i want to help you but first you have to let me know what's going on [ __ ] it what have i got to lose typhon killed gabe i have proof what proof i stole it from diane emails and documents proving there was a second explosion the night gabe died to cover something up jed some secret they buried i don't know what it is i don't even know what to do next but i'm not giving up not ever i know what they're hiding wait you're telling me you knew that typhon's crooked this whole time typhon's the devil that runs this town i've been carrying their secrets for far too long i know what they buried in the mountains tell me i'll do one better i'll show you there up ahead where are we middle of nowhere about two clicks that way is the mining site where you search for ethan five clicks that way is town what is this thing ventilation shaft they're scattered everywhere over the years mines grow into mines creating a labyrinth under haven what you're searching for is down below [Music] joe why are you sad i'm sorry kid jed what are you doing i tried to talk you out of it scare you off i was sure those pictures of ryan and steph would do the trick but you were relentless won't leave damn well enough alone you don't have to do this i do 12 years ago i made a mistake the kind of thing that you you can't undo but typhon made me a deal oh way to save my town give my boy a normal life i never wanted gabe to get hurt go to hell [Music] you
