telling the truth yes they found you bruce that don't judge me grandpa i'm doing my best oh great nana's flying machine still a thing of beauty can't say the same about her let's get airborne we're party crashers ah great uncle rob war hero gotta finish suiting up okay it's gotta be around here somewhere good thing i don't have neighbors you'll be so pissed off right now you always love to make an entrance stark how did i do uh i'll give you a 7 out of 10. good to see you georgie boy you've been working out feel any other billion dollar companies lately just yours hey you're gonna pay for that window tarleton this is your new place and i expected more mirrors i got rid of everything that didn't spark joy guess what pile you're in turn the girl over stark and that will get you off my lawn uh mr stark i'm joking kid just stay near the nice green [Music] the girl needs our help well you know she seems fine to me inhumans are sick they need treatment do people actually buy that crap yes i don't know he got powers after the accident i saw him controlling a robotic spider thing once well leveled up from spiders nice moves kiddo yeah kamala you have looked down on me from the moment we met let me introduce you to what i like to call technology catching stay close to the hulk or as close as he'll let you no i got you frankie she's great short stretchy really good at guessing um the avengers were dangerous i wasn't the one who ordered you to [Music] the kid's right you're mind melding with robots now chose my side five years ago you showed up and forced my hand give me the girl and you and banner can do whatever you want forget it took the words right out of my mouth wow okay you need to listen to logic and reasons why start now wait no this stuff was in there how are you feeling i've never felt better your synthetics were useless if you'd let me deal with the hulk and con earlier the archive would still be standing watch your words you no longer make the rules he does when i was young i found an orphaned wolf cub in the forest behind our farm what dad said it was too dangerous he told me to get rid of it i fed that cub i named him i watched him play with my beloved dog darwin you're wasting my time i felt if i could instill rules the proper boundaries i could harness the raw power of that beast a few months later while hunting the adolescent cub turned on me snarling frothing at the mouth darwin bought me a few precious moments to call for help my dad shot the wolf but it was too late darwin had been torn to pieces sir i'm sorry i don't know what came over me leave please jarvis you haven't aged a day welcome back mr stock missed your buddy you flying free in full working order give me the worst of it the chimera is running on secondary power major hull damage is also detected engines are offline climbing so it's bad that is an accurate assessment okay we got to get this bird airborne excuse me aim knows it's here so it needs to not be here when they get here what all right while we work on cleanup you mind taking a look at something for me certainly sir see what you can do about decrypting this file at once gotta see why the turbines won't activate better check out the initiator cores in the hangar do i want to know what's going on here hey tony just lending my um technical knowledge to bruce here well i can see i have my work cut out for me not helping tony i'm phil sheldon reporting live from somewhere in rural utah where are we again i don't oh oh i'm live okay following ames emergency public warning today i can confirm that iron man and the hulk were seen together in a remote area of utah apparently resisting arrest by local authorities meanwhile on the east coast a small crowd gathered in new jersey's heroes park to celebrate their reappearance after more than four years but they were quickly dispersed by police an aim spokeswoman called any celebration pre-a day thinking and cautioned that iron man and the hulk have shown alarming signs of mental instability in recent years we've all seen what can happen when beings with this kind of power operate outside the law and that's what they're doing now she warned we won't risk the loss of any more american cities end quote if anyone has information about the whereabouts of any former avengers they are asked to contact an aim call center immediately ah the old commissary wait what this working before okay jarvis time me 1.04 seconds sir guess i'm a bit rusty jarvis pop question where do we keep the spark plugs the initiator cores can be found in the far corner of the lower deck sir correct amundo do i win a prize now sir the biggest prize of all my infection how exciting [Music] [Music] seen enough desert for a lifetime love to get this thing airborne oh yeah that looks perfectly up to safety standards i think i found the problem i just oh it's definitely the initiator course wait don't the bigger aimbots use similar cores if we could get a hold of one i could get this old bird in the air in no time indeed sir but someone would need to procure said initiate a cause yeah i barely have a suit maybe i could cobble something together i'll search inventory for leftover pieces of armor thanks buddy hey tony i'm still working on the door but can you check on kamala i think she may have turned off her comps oh okay sure yeah this whole thing it's uh probably a tough adjustment you got it second floor of the old crew quarters right jarvis can you see if she's even up there so there are no surveillance systems in the private quarters who's terrible hit the idea with that yourself right so in case you were wondering your old room is still in town yes i'm about to barge into a teenager's room you whoa hey sorry you should have knocked i was trying i was knocking fist jarvis help me out here it appears the locking mechanisms on some of the chimera's crew quarters have not been enabled there you have it i will fix that please do i meet up on the command deck about 10 minutes you should uh you should come i know i i look ridiculous yeah of course you do no no no no no we all do it's part of the job have you seen thor's outfit flowing robe vegas shoulder pads pretty ridiculous i am digging this uh oh it's a bikini my mom bought it for me muslim ladies like to wear it for sports and stuff it's great all right i'm just gonna change wait wait wait wait the outfit is is all about attitude you gotta wear it like you mean it show what you got come on you can do better than that yeah now we're talking all right you know what maybe i can help you with some upgrades for that gear's already spinning really yeah oh and if bruce says anything just remind him that all he wears are super stretchy shorts [Laughter] bros the kid's fine she's tough kind of like her and she laughs at my jokes yeah she uh she grows on you hey uh meet me at the tech lab i've almost got this door fixed you got it stretchy pants sorry what was that nothing on my way this place is a mess just as you left it you know when i was living on the ranch it took me years to stop asking you out loud for things jarvis start the coffee pot jarvis empty the sewage tank jarvis where are my socks i'm pleased to see that you survived without me sir ah it's good to be back jarvis any chance you can read all these memos for me oh don't pull that regularly scheduled maintenance crap i know you can hear me sure glad i kept a spare here so so you're still working on this door huh well i just need to remove the entire junction box and reconnect ah great job buddy see it wasn't so hard this place is starting to really come to life again huh you fishing for a compliment no no never just making an observation fine thanks for helping to fix things up tony see that wasn't so hard was it home sweet home yeah no not ready to crack open that project yet all right if we're going to get anywhere we'll need to establish an alternate power source chimera was built for terrigen but i can convert it to run on something a little less exploding i'm scanning the region for sources but it'll take some time to identify potential initiator core heat signatures well in the meantime i need a new suit where can i find parts to repair the fabrication unit i've located a good salvage spot and have sent the coordinates to the war table when you're ready war tape got it fix the fabrication unit get a shiny new suit and get this bird off the ground [Music] all right first stop no way i'm gonna be any help fixing up the chimera without my own upgrade jarvis what do you got for me aim is moving an experimental drop ship which could be appropriated for parts to repair the fabrication machine unfortunately it's extremely well guarded but aims local defenses are designed around a large scale air assault if i fly in alone using the canyon for cover i should be able to slip through and jack the drop ship it's risky but i don't see an alternative at this point i'll upload the drop ship's last known location to your hud the canyon walls prevent me from fully confirming the intel i suggest you work quickly while not exactly rocking a state-of-the-art suit but it should get me there in one piece two max we need to move fast updating your heart aim appears aware of our intrusion how about we call this a surprise visit intrusion makes it sound like we're the bad guys sir acquisition trip it is how much firepower does zane have down here rather than lost it would see and how much was there with technical stark possibly rather a lot karma is not my friend ah that's funny make the ai sassy i said it'll be fun that elevator goes to the landing pad we need gotcha look at all this which nation stayed his aim planning to go to war with them this munitions also appear similar to your designs makes a guy sort of want to blow them up [Music] yes access the elevator let's get the drop shipping get gone before aim brings the big guns literally i quite agree sir it's safe to say dr tarleton would relish the chance to dance on your grave thanks jarvis now i'm stuck with a mental image of george doing the robot on my headstone apologies sir if i'm correct the drop ship should be just up ahead well this place looks homey i find this amount where the hell is my drop ship scanning the drop ship was moved to a more secure location ahead we can't get there before it takes off we can't if we overcharge the suit by 300 and take the direct route so you might literally explode and that canyon is treacherous sure but i feel the need for speed do it goose and play something fast your suit won't last forever this suits all i've got left after george for a golden anchor to the ground i'm not losing it gloves are making weird noises unsurprising you just lost an acoustic dampening circuit all systems are red you don't say i think keep going sir jarvis this is my shot to make up for a day help the kid and if i'm honest stick it to georgie boy you're damn right i'll keep going [Music] watch out their artilleries targeting you incoming all the juice left in the suit to get an emp burst ready for me to trigger made it jarvis yes sir i've scanned the drop ship and it contains the needed parts to repair the chimera's fabrication machine excellent let's check in on the kids and head home [Music] bruce kamala you read me loud and clear uh bruce is in the harm room pretending to be uh i don't even want to know so any luck out there success we'll all be in new threads soon the fabrication machine should be back online in no time great can't wait to make bruce a new pair of yoga pants well that was fun gotta say it's nice to be back in the saddle yes sir you haven't missed a beat ah glad to see that flattery upgrade kicked in now let's take a peek at our loot ah we hit the jackpot buddy this is exactly what i need to fix the fabrication machine glad to hear it especially as your current suit is now how would you put it kaput hey hey it's a job right i thought this tech looked familiar these are all based on my designs some are near exact they're sure taking advantage of the stark tech acquisition i was kind of hoping they just sit on the assets [Music] you
