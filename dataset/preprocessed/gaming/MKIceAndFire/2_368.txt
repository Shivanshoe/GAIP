have awarded you the expeditionary service ribbon for heroic service upon loss of contact with a marine unit you advanced into a xenomorph hive and confirmed the status of three mias you then completed their mission resulting in the destruction of said hive your boldness and dedication are in keeping with the finest traditions of the colonial marine corps and united america's armed services given this day in may 2202 colonel olivia ship commanding officer 33rd marine regiment 11th marine division some things don't belong in official reports katanga has been a stain on the honor of the corps for years if you haven't heard the details yet don't worry about it i'll just say i'm personally glad to see the place blown to hell report to lieutenant santos for debriefing dismissed hey uh aside from esther i think you're the one i've spent the most time with it was all running and shooting and screaming but that's time right look one of the police station crew was a spy for hyperdyne systems we never found out what he sent off station maybe his handlers know all about the pathogen and the xenomorph outbreak they could be on their way here now well weyland yutani used to own hyperdyne but now they're competitors especially on the frontier no governments claimed any of these systems they're both dropping colonies all over trying to beat each other to the best planets and besides that i mean hyperdyne's a big defense contractor for the upp right shouldn't we be worried about this starting a war between them and us the pathogen could be a terrible weapon weyland was just trying to make better xenomorphs with it but you could just drop it dump it in a water supply there's enough down there to wipe out every human colony weyland yutani's got to be on their way here if hyperdyne is two things could get real bad for everyone caught in the middle i know you've got things to deal with right now i'm just worried about what happens next guess we can't call you boot no more huh hello deployment we found [ __ ] waylon yutani spent a lot of time and money hiding ruins left by aliens that looked like us an orbital refinery used as a xeno breeding farm and a lab using tech from the ruins on xenos from the refinery we still got a secure lv895 in the alien ruins there's zenos and mutants running loose down there normally we carpent the place ruins be damned but doc hanukkah says that can make things worse spray that pathogen [ __ ] all over the damn moon near term we're gonna hold orbit keep this [ __ ] locked down i bet my ample marine paycheck they're on their way here right now they'll send military contractors dog catcher units lawyers maybe they'll talk maybe they'll just start shooting but that ain't all we got to worry about doc hanukkah says some rival company to wayland yutani sabotaged palestine whoever that was if they heard his mayday they might be on their way here too and shit's gonna get real interesting right here [Applause] hey i'm here in scuttlebutt around the squad bay talk that maybe colonel ship took this too far we could have quarantined katanga right caught in more ships listen the colonel knows about everything people know about cenos how they react how their guts work she knew that before she joined the corps when she was a teenager she survived a xeno outbreak little outlier colony you would never heard of it one thing she'll always hold to gotta kill them fast the longer you wait the more chance they got to spread i don't know all the details and you know what it ain't my place to ask but i do know she got a twin sister viola oh so ship went into a goddamn hive to rescue her that's how she learned some of the [ __ ] she know about xenos watching close range from inside maybe but by the time a battle group got here waylon yutani would have their people in system executives and dog catcher teams mercenaries and lawyers they find something to cite that the colonel don't got authority to override colonial protection act or not then they swagger aboard katanga or land on lv895 and [ __ ] it all up real good xenos fine ways they hide go where humans can't tight spaces vacuum deep cold wait for their chance come when you ain't looking and don't expect them but just don't go bringing it up with herself to javi colonels ain't in the habit of explaining themselves to grunts yo it's just between you and me [Music] you
