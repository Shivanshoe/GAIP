[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] initiating artillery thrusters and we are 20 seconds atmosphere breach initiative primary ignition set to 30 rotating we are engine first altitude 20 000 feet and falling hold on we're getting interference switch to high gain antenna command confirm signal strength you're looking great for the one go for landing engines off one has landed [Music] almost looks like home that's what worries me well boss you're ready got my truck i want snipers at three and six multiple defense lines and an operating base established within the hour move goodman a word you know the stakes of this mission flores is already half dismantled our engines on its way down to power city of half a million now if these outrider bozos had paid it you report to me first sir i'm only here to answer a proper procedure we're not on earth shira there is no proper procedure listen up outriders i know what you're all thinking there's no going home and no one has a clue what's waiting for us out there but the eca pencil heads can't greenlight this land until we find their missing probes so let's do our job negative hq our systems are all functioning we'll set up further instructions i'm gonna scout ahead on foot need to stretch my damn legs i'll take point don't need to see it get eaten on day one relax outrider you don't know me anything i wouldn't be here without you i'd be buried in the ashes back home all right let's move out stay sharp watch our sixes ah will you smell that air i can't even process breathing air that doesn't smell like a burnt carburetor that didn't mind the air back on earth i'm used to it trust me you'll get used to fresh air too truth is none of us should have even gotten off earth survivor's guilt you think any one of us isn't feeling it it's not just that if the caramel's engine hadn't exploded back on earth and killed most of the real outriders with it there wouldn't be a bunch of mercenaries down here in their place i hired you because you don't let anything get in your way we'll make camp here outrider said a beacon flag let hq know the air is secure all right people we got jobs to do cuthbert skarstead set up a perimeter i want fortifications going up within the hour jacob you're field testing the munitions gootman get your scanner up and running so we can find those damn probes outrider a word hey no matter what happens out here i need my best gun on this in case things go south can i depend on you just tell me what to do get my weapons haven't been fired in nearly a century why don't you head over to yakov and get your gear checked and then be prepared to move out as soon as those probes are located any questions no word from earth i assume it's really gone she went dark 15 years into our journey more or less as predicted aca has confirmed no communication since you know i grew up a slum dog fighting for scraps lost everyone really long before the end doomsday just wasn't a thing i worried about hell i was never going to live past 20 anyway somehow i was one of the ones who made it don't even know what i'm supposed to be doing here these things go right time's coming you're gonna have to leave all that behind this is a new beginning you could have a family here build a cabin roll and get fat that's not me chad know my way around bullets not kids there's gonna be no need for someone like me here maybe the old you outrider but you're one of the chosen few you get to build the future don't waste it [Music] did any more of your people make it off earth cap my brother almost but no they got him in cryo as we evacuated l.a hoping we could stop the bleeding ah he was too far gone ah sorry to hear that i haven't had the time to think about it what about sarah she's good right yeah my sarah's up there they don't wake her group for another six months but i can wait i'm uh i didn't have a chance to tell you this and all the madness but my little girl's pregnant that's how i got her the seat two for one special huh so that's why i've been such a good mood since they unfroze your ass don't push it out right yes sir granddad sir i'll go find jack of shooting range good we're on standby for those probes so stay staying alert hey there little guy almost touched on you how many feet you got there what's on your mind boss i know that look you get what do you make of this place jacob it's perfect beautiful how long you want to bet before we bury it all under concrete and plastic oh come on you can't still be that cynical just look at this valley maybe we all just got too much riding on this we already have one dead planet in the rear view if we screw this one up do it maybe we won't sure maybe this is really it maybe we can finally stop sleeping with our guns under our pillow stop worrying about food every goddamn day i want this to work you have no idea people don't change still got your money on black the house always wins that last day got really hairy i wasn't sure if any of us were gonna make it we cut it pretty close you can't stop thinking about it either i know it's insane that was 80 years ago yeah it feels like days my knuckles are still sore my ears still ringing from all the gunfire i mean there was thousands of them all climbing over each other slaughtering everyone in their way tried to pull down the launch tower to bash in the doors of her shuttles i've been in a lot of war zones but that was  anarchy look it was either us getting off the planet with them we just did what we had to do we do what we have to do we look out for each other well we better other than the cap and cut bird you're the only person left alive i know i'm the only person left alive worth knowing i'm glad you made it on board your basket time to test my gear up for some target practice bush let's get started fancy stuff yeah a new toy you're the first one to test it out boss think you could take on a tank all right you can stop showing off now give that sidearm a try did i ever mention how glad i am to be on your side damn somehow 18 years has improved your aim feels pretty good doesn't it just like riding a bike fresh haven't lost your touch yep still got it outrider check on our eca rep see if shears hey chill out man what's eating oh my gosh this is stunning i don't wish you could have seen this that hey yoshiro right i'm sorry can you believe this landscape it's so beautiful now if only we had an internet to post those two scientific record besides we'll have the internet up and running in the first six months the entire thing was backed up i'm just pulling your leg shira any luck with the probe the scan's still running i don't know what else i can do it's just how can the probe signals have simply vanished yeah they said it was some kind of interference or something not from space maybe but not from down here still seems initial readings are right we're breathing yes but before the eca can authorize half a million more people coming here we need the probes data to know we can support them and if we can't what's the easiest plan b do you have any questions i get answers to how's this colonization gonna work you're in the planning rooms right yes we've already started disassembling the engine we need to bring that down first the nuclear core should give us enough power to get the colony up and running and when do the civilian pods start coming down within a few weeks if all goes well first just enough people and resources to get our infrastructure running you know water food and shelter then we'll keep working folks from cryo a few thousand at a time no more than we can feed until before you know it you'll be standing in the middle of a city meanwhile the florist stays up there the ship was built in orbit it was never meant to land we'll have to keep it in our skies until we're capable of space flight again one day maybe all right tell me the truth you think the eca's thought this whole plant through well my father was part of the team that designed a plan my entire life he held prepare for this day the greatest undertaking of human history oh so that's how you got on the ship huh daddy smoothed your way no i studied engineering spent years in orbit designed structure drilling rivets into the hole i helped build that shape so you earned your rayon good for you it was my father does not like the way you thought he gave up his place for me he stayed behind  i'm uh i'm sorry you would have been in all this place but in the end it's just me it's strange not knowing anyone here when this is over come hang out with us we're not such a bad punch i might take you up on that hey is that supposed to blink that way oh oh oh that's a probe tanner i think you've got a signal it's close excellent workout rider now go locate the damn thing so we can land this beauty copy that hey it's an historic moment we should document it for the scientific record heads up i got movement nine o'clock something big oh you're the steeler perimeter hold your fire until we know what we're dealing with oh i got eyes on some kind of hyena cow things yeah i'm seeing them over here too a whole heart of them are we sure all the wildlife around here are vegetarians whatever they look for the ugly you ask me astonishing i bet they can be domesticated performing i bet they make some fat juicy steaks uh one of those cow things is sonic itself right on my path hey maybe he can get close enough to get a dna sample not exactly our priority but if i can get close without spooking it i'll try ah scared it off but i've secured the objective fantastic got some kind of storm brewing yeah found the probe looks like it landed pretty hard but the data seems intact copy that transmitting to hq now good work outrider hold on tanner i'm picking up the second signal but something's weird about this one weird the is rising and falling it's hq hold up on calling in that green light we got another probe out here to analyze negative alpha your job is done damn it maxwell listen to me we can't afford to make mistakes give us time any more time and we lose our orbital window we have the data i'm calling it in you want to keep searching don't blame me if you find trouble over and out all right now riders rendezvous back with a convoy let's go find that straight hey guthner any updates the probe signal is mostly noise but i've tracked its source there hope you all brought your galoshes jacob same different planet [Music] [Music] piece of electronics are freezing up trucks are down we continue on foot soldier your primary focus is here understand we keep moving eyes up [Music] choke on your own spit dude it's nothing i'm good [Music] jesus share back to the alert the medics stay back tanner got eyes on the probe i got movement heading in hq we've encountered a potential biological hazard requesting quarantine procedure at base damn it tanner i told you posers not to go mess up this operation it's my name on the line when it's landing and you have no authority over me maxwell hey boss we lost you i'm getting her straight probe no skarstead he looks like any idea what this black gunk is some kind of sacrifice but [Music] okay you want to play captain got attacked by one of those cow things something drove it crazy i had to put it down keep an eye out copy that out writer now move your ass and find that probe so [Music] tanner i found it good work get the drive to get the hell out wait hold on this thing's just in relay mode tanner the signal isn't coming from the probe it's coming from outside our search zone somewhere else on the planet that's impossible there is nobody else secure the hard drive we'll analyze that signal back at base copy oh damn it something's frying it tanner give us the frequency uh carrier frequency is nine seven point tanner do copy tanner tanner i'm seeing some really strange down here the what the hell was that oh this is the landing [Music] hmm come on [Music] okay [Music] oh [Music] john got heavy casualties possible contamination i mean quarantine set up a base to copy maxwell what the is all this what does it look like sergeant major sir we have to follow quarantine procedure and hold the landing whatever the original reports about this planet they were wrong there's some kind of anomaly if we land now everyone will die there's no holding the landing it's too late for that there's nowhere else to go we need medics see to them hurry no stop they're contaminated we contain them that's an order you always were an  look around you we got men and women that needed medical attention now get your asses in gear and do the right thing i'm gonna have to no contain this now burn the bodies i got you all right sure right after you call off your goddamn goons pleasant major the entire colonization is threatened we need to warn the florist threat imperil this mission so maxwell set up a block he's gonna burn everything you need to get into the region attack kill the traitors don't let them near do the right thing pull it in postpone the landing it's too late [Music] hey you and you helped me with the wounded we have to get them to med lab over here come on move your asses they're almost there what are you doing i'm putting you back into cryo until med lab can save your  life don't be ridiculous i'm done for pep talks aren't really my thing [Music] when is something truly over was it when your people left earth behind was it when you watched the first spaceship crash and burn was it when you saw your fellow outriders crumble at your feet was it watching yourself die but enoch isn't done with you yet outrider like i always say it ain't over till it's over [Music] huh you what year are you from here what year what is this your pot where were the uplink notes come on doc we need to go they're coming wait we can't just leave them here these are outright they're not why we're here i'm sorry [Music] thought your kind was all dead dead uncuff me and find out the anomaly is coming let's see how fast you can run romance land like the others [Music] hey soldier you're eca too right when we get to no man's land we gotta stick together if we want to survive survive what getting our asses fried by the big storm hey i told you to shut the hell up we're here come on come back go back what the hell is happening here they've got an altar to carry our guys apart you need to get out of here but where storm's coming you think the elders care about a storm  take the back way through the frame we're not gonna make it here and while the captain on the show oh how long how long has it been what this this war how long who knows that before i was born that's impossible come on open the goddamn gate and move how tight almost there almost where where are you taking us i'm not supposed to the hell is the matter with you you just wake up or something oh i just well let me get you up real quick that paradise you outriders promised us guess what we got instead goddamn alien storms no shelter no food just kick to the curb like exiles while your eca pals got fat in their bunker it wasn't like that we lost electronics we could have left you all to rot in your cryopods but we can't we sent you ungrateful how many times did i tell you to shut up welcome to the valley of death you people are insane all of this is  it's hell yeah it is [Music] oh me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] i need to get out of here i just gotta get across this hellhole the happening i don't belong on this side wonder oh hmm did i do that oh  this run who's your position are they running for me all right i should get used to this [Music] so this these flares this sword i've seen this before before when we landed this can't be real [Music] [Music] altered [Applause] i could smell the storm in your blood your stink of enoch your kinder abominations exile who the hell are you outrighter impossible such untapped power such confusion you want answers whatever you were before you're something new now a second life don't waste it who was that lord seth he's he's altered i think he's a little man a little man altered what the does that mean you you don't know what you are where'd you steal that uniform didn't it's mine yeah if he's really an outrider the new fight's in the wrong side altered what are you talking about yeah the grand marshal she'll explain come on where is she there what is that go go do whatever you have to do lieutenant shira i'm sorry to disappoint you you came from their side you got any intel for us are you kidding me look i got a war to win so either you help me or you get back into cryo hold on i'm just walking up to mud and  i've been asleep for god knows how many years 31 years so for 31 years i've been seeing people fight and die while you were getting comfy in cryo so excuse me for not throwing you a little welcome party what happened to you the anomaly that's what happened you mean that storm we told them not to land anything more advanced than a grease engine got fried all our data wiped out we couldn't grow crops or make medicine so we ended up in the same place as when we left earth just killing each other over the little we have left why didn't you go somewhere else the outriders could have the outriders are dead what and the anomaly keeps us in this  valley we can't go anywhere else you don't get it do you you think you're dreaming this is real believe me it's real so whether you like it or not you're stuck here in the mud and like the rest of us you should have never woken up i didn't miss out on all this marshall we were too late the hounds haven't he's been taken underground well get him back well it may be our side but that's not our turf ma'am i'm not losing people over yaku yakub he's still alive not too much longer it seems then i'll go find him never mind i've got it covered hey shira i'm geared up and tracking down yaka now who the hell are these there are thugs drug runners and child flavors they call themselves the hounds and believe me no one's gonna miss them if you put a few dozen body bags why the hell haven't you done something about them already honestly because their black market keeps our soldiers happy and at least they're not eating their own kids like the insurgents were fighting out there yeah i met a few of them not so friendly please it ain't fair move along nothing to see here so what did the old guy do [Music] i'm looking for jakob go away listen you got a gun pointed right at you what the hell is going on out there so so [Music] i'm gonna wear you around my neck i know [Music] now where's jacob [Music] nice eyes hey whoa oh sorry guys this is the bathroom you okay i had it under control been a while no i know you gorma then i thought you were dead you'll soon be dead if you don't get your ass to shears right now oh all right come meet me there when you're ready shira i got yak about in one piece he's on his way to you that old trunk just refuses to die well you should come join us we have some catching up to do seems like i find something no because he won't because he can do what the he wants hey never been so happy to see a familiar face you have an age today you got old my friend in the hallway that was seth what was he doing here ignoring our police for help i thought it was on your side says he's not on anyone's side the insurgents have altered their walking nightmares where lucky seth shows up to fight them back sometimes but only if it fits whatever the hell game he's playing hey damn it you have no idea how bad it is outrider we thought we escaped the apocalypse we thought we could start over again here but we were wrong i was wrong do you know why i'm in charge because i'm the only officer left alive the insurgents at our door they're feral sadistic they have us around it we're low on food and bullets and if those freaks don't kill us this planet will welcome back the black fungus in the forest we never found a cure the mountains are filled with abominations and the anomaly storms get bigger every year we don't have much time left if we don't find a way out of this valley if we don't find a miracle this last shred of humanity is over shira would you look at that i can do things now i don't understand but maybe there's a reason yes you are i guess i know why i saved your damn life all those years ago i'm sure this isn't exactly what you had in mind i'm not complaining still i don't get in the day we landed that storm and tore cuthbert apart but not me why why was i altered who the hell knows when those storms hit some get ripped inside out some turn pink polka dot and a few come back  immortal nothing about the anomaly makes sense it disrupts the laws of nature it mutates whatever it touches early on the eca's best scientists tried to understand the storms to tame them none survived i guess you got lucky boss or maybe not all i care about is that you are on our side the supply line is blocked by an altar that our weapons cannot touch out by the old solar array seth had no interest in helping us but now you're here hell why not maybe i can buy humanity another day lieutenant what the hell was that the whole front line just collapsed like an earthquake all right i i think we lost our whole first line of defenses on my way go go go hey in case i don't get another chance i i tried to find you but it all went to  we had to run for our lives i just forget it i'm alive we should have been dead ten times over if not for tanner if not for shira i'm the one with dudes to paint now yakum awesome i missed you it's good to have you back now go beat that altered ass for us so we can get back in this goddamn fight outrider be careful out there it's bad i'll see what i can do shira i still got about 30 years of questions to catch up on so if you make it back in one piece come and ask me but i don't promise i'll have all the [Music] answers some writing here move the whole goddamn front to hell if you can't open the supply line we're done for okay boss do you see a big tower that's where you need to get the old solar tower but it's a mess out there everything's upside down yeah i noticed don't worry i'm carving my way through it [Music] oh so so oh you're too late what happened here what does it look like we got mutilated we had the bastards cornered but they had a captain for the captain yeah you know the  with powers you get put in charge not a real alter not like we could note the difference what's he look like this captain star down his face sadistic oh he forced half my squad to walk into an anomaly and he enjoyed it yeah i think i know the guy where is he inside the bunker of the hill i wish i could look him in the eyes when you make him pay for what he did i think i'll pay him a little visit for old time's sake okay give that captain what's coming to him so i settle up with this captain i hope so over here [Applause] i remember that voice not thought i'd have a harder time getting back through captain should be holed up somewhere in here [Applause] you think you can fight me give me all you got so so [Music] wait stop you're an altered you can do whatever the you want why the are you fighting for those those fascist weird ones fighting for our lives do you even know what they did to us i know what you did to me no outriders always pay what's owed that soldier will want to see his head for herself if anybody on this planet needed killing it was that sadist he paid not enough you're gonna be okay you need a medic or something you nuts a metaground hero kill me faster than the shrapnel will don't worry about me i'll live to fight another day hey you did a good thing in fact hey so [Music] uh [Music] deja vu in this place reminds me of that mission in damascus when we rescue those diplomats i had to save your ass from that machete wielding mob more like the time i had to save your sorry ass from that redneck mob storming dc those missions felt like we were fighting for a reason but this it's never been worth fighting for so what's it all about for you then just trying to live another day boss we're barely holding it was a good day to wake up then [Music] [Music] so sauteed be careful jacob i've reached the solar tower i'm going in what are you seeing in there some kind of weird electrical sparks flying everywhere means you're getting close this altered did i not mention he's a goddamn electro freak you mean he lights up light bulbs more like flash frying everything for a mile look i know you've always been able to handle yourself but this son of a is on a whole other level as of recently so am i [Music] hey [Music] man where are you so please [Music] and so outrider you've had your first kill we also do not die so easily do we sith come we must speak they asked you to help them to fight the altar down there why didn't you that pathetic monstrosity was a distraction people are dying because of him without the supply route open they all die these feeble creatures slaughtering each other over scraps you waste your gifts running errands for them trying to win their meaningless endless war you must realize you're not like them anymore also why i should play being a god like you i am not playing but you are something even more altered and outright the last outrigger do what you were set here for go beyond the frontier these people need their gods only one like you could lead them to a future why not you they call him moloch i fight another war far above this petty squalor my war is with the worst of our kind this one is too powerful he will destroy us all unless i hunt him down but this is not your fight you are to be the shepherd find a way for them out of this slaughter writer sure it's done your supply line's open i'm heading home i can't believe it outright or what you just did i've lost a hundred men trying don't thank me yet you still got a war to win not sure anyone's winning this goddamn war but there's something even more important you might be able to do come see me in my bunker ain't nobody i don't believe you they do peck yeah good sure the signal in the forest you remember it yeah like it was yesterday you still have its frequency don't you you mean this frequency good you got the winning lotto numbers tattooed on your ass cheek too still don't believe me i hate when you play that i told you so that signal is still playing like a distant echo it's digital which means it must be coming from a place where there is no anomaly the problem is we've never been able to locate its source because we've never had the right frequency until you showed up so now listen close you need to bring those precise numbers to dr abraham zahidi one of our last scientists  he's been deep in the enemy territory for weeks now five rations says zahidi's dead we don't know that you i've seen you before it was in the med lab you woke me out of cryo guess life's real funny that way meet jane sniper first class she almost died trying to save his life she'll guide you wait shira when we landed that signal was already playing do you have any idea who or what is sending it do yourself a favor don't ask that question whatever's out there they don't want to be found and whoever goes looking for that  signal ends up dead but it's the only chance we've got and if anyone can get there alive it's all of you cheera come on jacob that's in order sorry i left you to die in that med lab hey no worries didn't really have a choice i'd have done the same i'm not willing to write mccain off yet he's one tough son of a so yeah where do you think the signal is beats me just some fake whole for losers you can't accept the world has gone to but i guess our goddamn mission now show me this is my garage when you're ready i wouldn't know what to do with all that time give me the good stuff bad sign damn is hotting this up what happened to everyone else none of the other outriders survived well you had front row seats for the  show that started it all you know most of us were dead that first day the few dozen that were left they did what we came here to do they explored who do you think died tried to figure out we couldn't leave this valley why are you the only outrider alive you think i was going to explore this damn planet after what we saw him let him have my badge i didn't need to be an outrider that bad anyway what happened and again dobroski has outdone himself whoa you've managed to keep my truck working after all these years [Music] well i had to strip the ai systems bypass the graphene cells cost me 20 bottles of vodka and parts but now our baby will run on anything these are turpentine even potatoes if we can grow potatoes [Music] you still got tunes dudes hey boss we got no electronics no tunes no nothing but somehow we make do okay i tracked the dock to that radio tower on the hill but the slums between here and there are infested with snaggletooth and enough patrolling insurgents that those mutated things are out hunting wait what kind of mutated things we talking about i'll stick to the roofs give you some eyes from above good luck that thing's the nuclear engine from the florist right that's the reason half the city is an irradiated ruin let me guess the anomaly that thing got battered by it until boom no more energy don't tell me you still had people in cryo yup the eca had a choice let them die or wake them up all at once to an unfinished city without food or water the slums you're looking at that's where they got exiled to starve and die your insurgents call themselves exiles you quick there's some notes here i still can't get used to seeing your face young it's like you're a walking memory so this was the first city looks like a ghost town what happened here some geniuses decided to wake up half a million people when we barely had enough food for ourselves and put them in a city built to house 50 000 people you can imagine how well that went people stuffed into boxes starving to death living in their own like some  slum and no shelter from the anomaly those storms only had to kill a few thousand before the riots started so the rioters destroyed this place no what we did to stop the riots that destroyed this place he's good together from the dead [Music] so place is crawling with insurgents i need to clear them out [Music] [Music] [Music] but [Music] so this is gonna take some getting used to [Music] everyone hmm so ah um hey outrider is it from earth what was it like oh nothing like you imagine my generation we lived our whole lives knowing earth was over we killed to survive to earn our seed on the florist we got a few happy memories but they weren't much better than meals on death row so [Music] uh [Music] so do ah [Music] so [Music] so okay hmm the journal [Music] so [Music] ah dedicated so i see the radio tower sign of zahidi they're probably keeping him in one of the buildings close to the tower judging by the number of insurgents heading your way i'm guessing they know we're here [Music] awfully quiet here [Music] so so uh get back i'll kill him calm down step closer i swell rip him open get back this man's gonna bleed out who are you sure goodman sent me to find you i thought you might want to see this that's a frequency what the where did you get jane hurt it's nothing doc tell me the briefcase is safe no the truck is gone oh the wait no no no no no no hold on hold on hold on hey hey hey listen to me listen to me i might be able to stop the bleeding but you have to tell me where your people took my truck i will save your life promise yes go down pass river all right doc move back wait no no no i just gave this man my word we can't leave him alive he knows too much no he doesn't have to die we already have what we want james no okay get her up i'm taking her back to my truth you have to find the dog's truck it's more important than me you have no idea there's a briefcase under the oil tank bring it back safe [Music] hold on jay hold on stay with me okay jane stay with me damn it go outrider go the cable car will take you down to the slums it's the quickest route to the river the truck should be on the other side what the hey jacob i think i found some of those mutated snaggletooth yup and now you're really seeing this planet the war is the least of it looks like some old reports that tree this is where i woke up ah what do we have here some kind of writing outrider we're almost back to your camp coffee how's jane doing she's barely hanging on i'm doing what i can but she'll make it she has to up [Music] [Music] notes interesting some writing here zahidi i'm crossing the bridge where can i find the truck there there are old garages near the city gate they probably would keep it there to protect against the anomaly [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm so [Music] so [Music] [Music] ah uh [Music] [Music] hey zahidi i'm in there's a lot of trucks in here they all look the same i hit the briefcase under the truck's driver's side door just just search them all welcome make me dig my own grave next this better be worth it oh my god it's still intact the satellite uplink the last satellite uplink so that's what you were looking for when you found me yeah and it still works wow the case it's new metal it insulates it it's never been opened so the electronics inside have been safe from the goddamn anomaly so what does it connect to the floor is i thought it was all disassembled for the colonization mostly but we lost contact towards the end half of the resources we were meant to have are still up there the trap and the supply pods seeds electronics hard drives full of data all out of reach we could rebuild civilization with those resources but they're useless to us unless we can find a place beyond the storms no it might sound like a dream but for those of us that believed it kept us going so this is it that's why shearer sent me to get you she wants what's inside those pots so what do we do now your frequency i can use it to locate the source of the signal i need to reach an antenna up high somewhere you got one in mind yeah eagle peaks but uh not yet i told you everyone who goes on the stupid mission ends up dead [Music] my turn to leave you behind maybe we'll meet again do uh cat have come all this way only to let those creatures stop me are you lost old man are we all what are you doing here this place isn't safe what do you see when you look at this shattered city i see my own story in every street i lived here through every crisis every revolt and riot until they tore it away from us afraid i missed all that we lost earth soon we'll lose this planet we lose everything in the end maybe that's how it has to be i left some things in my old hut valuable things i couldn't survive a minute on my own but i'd show you where they're hidden if you would open the way just like to go home once more stay here i'll handle what a it strange trip it's been to leave so much behind for so little gain why did we ever even come here please an old man's home my old home's near the radio tower overlooking the city hey old man what was this place like back in the beginning oh it was miracles daily industrial printers constructing anything we needed from enoch's raw materials in a flash we were building a city on an alien planet until the storms came you saw the first storm oh yes lights on the horizon machines coming from the entire city went black just bolts of lightning and screams i could see people lifted into the air trees shredded fires everywhere whatever hope for enoch we had it was gone in a breath what happened after the engine flew no electronics and the sleepers getting woke in thousands an hour and they tried to keep us calm but there was no food no medicine nowhere to hide from the storms eca closed the gates and left us all to rot and we would have too if not for the altered i never wanted to be an insurgent i just wanted what my family had been promised place is crawling with insurgents i need to clear them out so what's up [Music] [Music] ah ah so i've cleared the weight of your hut container 99 but thank you please wait for me there [Music] what happened here whose graves are those sarah hello g michelle it wasn't their fault i was picked as a community leader to distribute food i admit i kept some for ourselves or my girls was i supposed to watch them starve i traded for favors seemed harmless enough i only took food but they took everything from me oh but you told me you had nothing of value here for me but my memories take it all then go please i'll stay here a little longer so every single disaster we brought down on our heads condensed into one dead city zahidi's truck is in bad condition i've scavenged all the useful equipment doc will have to ride with us all rider what can i do for you i'm wondering is it possible there are other outriders still in cryo well it's entirely possible jane and i you weren't expecting to find your team and with insurgents closing in we didn't have time to look for anyone else i don't have to tell you how dangerous the first city is but i'd want to be the first to know what you find i'm curious too i'll go check it out just because you haven't found any other outriders yet that doesn't mean they're not still out there the cryopod i found you in was in an old medical lab near the river you should start searching there i still can't get used to seeing your face you're so dead it's good to get the best rolling again she's doing all right is that the tower yes it looks like the cable car is down you might ask those soldiers if there's a way to get them working what the hell was that noise how about they keep the engine warm this goddamn mission is a waste of time and the one-way ticket to nowhere's [Music] filled you
