shouldn't have told you that i know we just met but be careful out there okay you don't need to worry really i think i'll check out that record store nice meeting you ethan oh wow [Music] this place reminds me of the shop cave and i used to go to he'd save up for weeks from his shitty car wash job just to buy us something to listen to [Music] it's crazy here i am years later still waiting for my big brother in the record store [Music] except this time i'm buying the record [Music] no way oh uh [Music] she [Music] citizens of haven springs that was the wednesday with bomb squad up next a very

since forever i'm ryan hi ryan nice to meet you so all the way from portland huh what do you think of haven i've seen some cool things so far like this record store is amazing i didn't expect anything like this here yep it's our cultural landmark for sure so the store is closed but they opened it just for you you must be picking up something pretty important yeah well you could say that an outdoorsman's guide to the calls of common birds wow that's not what i was expecting at all it's a pretty obscure record the national park service gave it five stars so you're a colorado state park ranger it's all coming into focus well bummer the stores closed i was thinking of getting a gift for gabe but i'll figure something else out i don't even know if he still listens to records he does charlotte just got him a record player for his birthday i'm pretty sure he put something on hold so you don't work here steph won't mind him it'll be the easiest sale she's ever made if i could just find the whole list hmm damn i know i saw it before wanna help me look oh yeah any ideas on where to start no idea steph leaves stuff all over the place ninth warden hero of the intergalactic peace wars and friend to lonely children everywhere i could have sworn she said it down over here don't get me wrong steph's great but she can be kind of a mess gabe's record is in here but which one is it [Music] this place has just the right amount of dorkiness perpetual motion looks exhausting how do i get a rich polish clarinetist to buy me things is it wrong that the note makes me want to touch it more [Music] it's been so long since i've played gabe and i used to dream about cutting demos all the time as kids never got there colorado digs it's all rock i see i love that this town has their own radio station i did a report on jane eyre once in high school i'd love to actually read the book one day chores are an excellent way to learn personal responsibility alex emergency guitar in case of sweet jam sesh break glass valkyrie that's one bad ass cat named [Music] i'm detecting an indie pattern okay a seriously obscure indie pattern color me impressed how very small town i could spend hours sitting here maybe i will [Music] standing on stage in front of a crowd of strangers [ __ ] creepy crawlies that's the stuff of nightmares you're not the boss of me poster apparently plants can feel pain but can they cry sing all of melancholy and the infinite sadness in bed i don't think so now there's a radio contest i might actually be able to win [Music] wait is that the hold list [Music] don't freak out i'm just gonna okay just kidding i'm surprised you got out of there with both your hands thing is she's sitting on the hold list we could use her toy to lure her away if we can find it give me a hand any luck finding that cat toy not yet so what's the prediction what do you think gabe listens to these days i think gabe's gotten so emo that he doesn't like instruments anymore just dudes screaming and crying into the microphone dear god let's hope not well there's only one way to find out let's see if we can find that cat toy [Music] you could check the register okay but what if it's three unbroken hours of improvisational jazz flute that he listens to while writing scathing film reviews yeah and sipping a 50 americano alas no toy [Music] looks like a toy could live here what if he exclusively listens to smash mouth wait for it cover bands ugh i disown him damn maybe in the junk box oh and we have a winner good guess [Laughter] be safe out there if i die a horrible cat-related death tell gabe i'm sorry [Music] who's the superior mammal now [Music] all right good idea thanks for a guy who lives in the woods i'm pretty good at this customer service thing

tell me what gabe was like as a kid any ammunition you can give me he acted cool but he was really a big dork like one time he was pretending to stage dive and fell off the bed sprained an ankle it was funny you know you being here is a game changer in the gabe embarrassing department all right you're looking at 20 even [Music] no no way i can't believe you're doing this again come on do you

how [ __ ] cool is that at least i held it together in front of ryan and steph whoa looks like ryan turned my brother into a model citizen i'm really happy for you gabe holy [ __ ] it looks like gabe actually read this gabe brushing up on comics and art really going the extra mile for ethan and charlotte must be ethan's wonder how many times gabe's been forced to play huh i've really changed the art style since i read these charlotte made this kate mentioned she was an artist but i didn't realize he meant like professionally i could never make something so personal what an honor to be the sister of the rubber duck derby second place finisher we didn't even get to finish this song is that a sword no way gabe has this photo too look at our parents mom's healthy dad's only kind of an [ __ ] crazy how much we've changed my journal time to add my latest meltdown so so ugh i'll finish this later no [ __ ] way [Music] well alex you just went nuts and beat the [ __ ] out of somebody in front of your brother so how are you feeling right now so you and your damn surprises gabe being here is too good to be true i'm not gonna let anything mess it up i should go downstairs and set things right with gabe i know i kicked the drywall crack when i see one [Music] but it looks like mr john chin left some miguel county about six months after his arrival yeah is there like a forwarding address on file i'm sorry sir that's not information we retain thanks again for calling the san miguel county clerk's office i have a pleasant afternoon no no no no no hey don't looks like we've both

fits right in ryan just forget it stop that you need to take care of yourself got mac patched up let's take a look at you now yeah it looks pretty nasty right about here so it hurts when you breathe alex you made it charlotte right i'm sorry you had to see that fight what a terrible first impression dad i'm taking gabe to the station we need a first aid kit that doesn't predate the discovery of bacteria it's fine i don't need to go ryan knows what he's doing now you just go with him alex i'll be back soon okay okay now there goes my bartender and my backup bartender i love that it's a falling star yeah or rising depends on the day i guess so what's it doing today wow i don't know today's been a roller coaster so far i can't imagine i heard ethan gave you an issue of his comic he obviously thinks you're really cool but does he think i'm cooler than gabe i'd say you have a shot gabe plays dirty though like he secretly teaches ethan to swear beef pie special watch the gravy jed you didn't have to now ryan said you're skipping dinner no starving artists on my watch i do have to get going i'm making some pizzas for the spring festival and they have to be done tonight sorry i couldn't talk longer that's okay so glad you're here alex i'm looking forward to getting to know you yeah same bye thanks for supper yep so i'm short staffed at the moment gabe tells me you've worked at a restaurant before a couple years experience as a server maybe not as long as that but yeah i've done lots of things you want to work a shift see if you might like it here sure all right so we have a few folks that need checking on ducky and diane over there steph over here there's a table in the back that needs clearing also you can give the food orders to me and i'll handle anyone here at the bar all right got it it's really nice to have you here alex thanks guess i'm a server now let's see how this goes my dad was in the service can i get you to anything miss chan here at last to relieve our suspense hi i am reginald mcallister the third ducky to friends former entrepreneur now retired and this young woman is diane hey there nice to meet you i didn't realize that that we all knew you were coming yes gabe is generous with both friendship and information you're from portland right i moved here from dc six months ago how you finding the small town thing i didn't really know what to expect but it's kind of perfect it feels like a home i know i know i really thought i would hate it and i saw the mountains met some people and now i'm never leaving diane is a geologist recently working as a process manager for typhon mining i'm glad there's another newbie around here too can i get you anything oh yeah we're super hungry i'd love a pie special with fries cheeseburger with mushrooms and my usual to drink jed will know what to do all right i'll go put that order in thanks that's charlotte's dispensary she seems cool hey dad yeah i've got an order from ducky and diane go ahead one cheeseburger with mushrooms uh-huh and one pie special with fries ducky asked for as usual yeah he did yeah he's fond of a particular rye whiskey i keep a personal bottle for him oh that's odd i don't see it oh now wait i bet ducky took that bottle upstairs last night ah he and gabe went on carousing long after closing oh yeah yeah serves him right if you ask me but feel free to go upstairs and look for it i'm sure he'd be grateful oh if you can't find it deputy pike was with them might have some idea he's usually in here around now probably arriving soon there must be something around the black lantern that can help me find ducky's prized whiskey damn boys always fighting time to grow up should have seen gabe go at it with dad he's come a long way wow tetanus anyone i hope brian's got better supplies typhon's not a bad company once you get used to how they operate starting over from scratch like this yeah that's what people keep [ __ ] terrifying is what it is you're telling me the ropes though yeah i guess the way they do things is just so i don't know my extensive wilderness map reading knowledge tells me that there is a whole lot of wilderness around here idiosyncratic sweet jukebox i'll have to check out the song sometime that looks radioactive only 45 bucks for the chance to get mauled by a bear alex right i'm stuff hey just seeing if you need food or anything oh no i'm good think so sorry i couldn't hang out at the record store i've got some time now though if you want to chat is that your shot what is that this is bedazzled kiwi schnapps no one's ever ordered it so gabe's trying to get rid of it with the jukebox game what's a jukebox game it's like a short version of 20 questions where you're trying to guess a song guess wrong you have to take the shot ryan and i were going to play no one takes place dude you're on yes so i'll pick a song you have five yes or no questions before you have to guess it okay [Music] got one jukebox is all yours so what do you want to ask me hmm i should flip through these and see what might be good to ask does the band name have a symbol in it like something that's not just a letter oh yeah it totally does nice are there people on the cover no yeah no is there an animal on the cover art uh no no animals ugh too bad some of these are really cute i know right you've got two questions left [Music] so does the song title have a curse word in it a curse word would that offend you answer the question no curse words in the title ma'am last question yeah all right i know when was the last time you listened to this song so i guess we're breaking the yes or no questions only rule can you handle it when was the last time i heard that song like two days ago gabe was working so char and i put it on and danced like crazy to rub it in that doesn't tell me anything what did you expect that's your five ready to guess yeah let me look through one last time here's what i know the band name does have a symbol in it no curse words in the song title no animals on the cover no people on the cover and it could be a dance song i think that's enough to figure it out we'll see [ __ ] nice one yes i'm drinking [Laughter] oh hey thanks for playing i'm really glad we did me too so you and ryan hang out a lot all the time except when he ditches me for gabe they went to get first aid being a hero again ryan's always doing that it's a lucan family thing have you heard about jed's rescue it was a big deal back when he was a minor he can't imagine alex wants an ear load of haven trivia just now sorry jed he doesn't like to brag but there's stuff about it all over the place if you look interesting is that record store inventory no it's character stats do you know what a larp is i've heard the term before live action role play it's like a tabletop role-playing game but acted out in real life costumes foam weapons beanbag spells is great he was talking about a larp with ethan yeah it's next week they're coming with me it's their first time i'm so excited would you ever want to join us sometime sure i try it if you and gabe both like it it must be super fun awesome i should get back to work okay there must be something around the black lantern that can help me find ducky's prized whiskey i got written up for leaving my phone on it wasn't even on me but i guess it started vibrating in my locker when i was on duty ducky jet thinks you took your whiskey up to gabe's yesterday do you know where you might have left it i remember absolutely nothing of the night

that was the hardest time of my life some days i didn't think i'd make it out but i get the feeling you've been through worse i can tell there's something going on with you something troubling you maybe it's time you open up i want to talk to gabe but what can i even say right now to explain what happened with mac [Music] [Music] there's something off about me i know what other people are feeling i can see these auras around them and if they feel strongly enough if they're angry or sad or afraid i feel it too and then i lose control and this has happened for a long time like mac i felt all that anger like it was my own i think it was pretty clear that mac was angry it's more than that he wasn't just angry at you he's angry at himself he thinks he's gonna lose riley did riley tell you that no no one told me that i just feel it sure it's not just you know it's not just in my head gabe i promise it's not from meds or stress or trauma or whatever it's real can you tell what i'm feeling right now it doesn't work like that it's only when you feel really strong emotions oh i don't expect you to believe me no one does so you can actually feel what other people are feeling yes you're like going inside their heart i guess i am dude you have super powers you're [ __ ] with me right i'm serious did you listen to anything i just said this is terrible okay okay maybe superpowers is a bit strong it's just i have no idea what's going on with people half the time charlotte's teaching me how to improve my emotional intelligence but this this is on another level you can get in there that's that's really special special it's really your take on all this totally i mean it's whatever you make it right but it doesn't matter what's going on i'm here for you don't forget that [Music] so when were you gonna tell me about the guitar oh [ __ ] you found it it was supposed to be a huge surprise surprise well what do you think i love it thank you so much of course [Music] welcome home oh hey dude what's up hey is ethan up here no he was heading home he was but i haven't seen him in a while i told him not to wander off i'll find him gabe wait earlier when i was talking with ethan he told me he was hiking up the mountains to explore the old mine what why didn't you say something i'm sorry if he actually went up there we need to move now okay let's go [Music] [Music] ethan ethan come on pick up pick up alex this way wow been a while since i was up here you don't do your ranger stuff around here private land outside of my jurisdiction dad brought me up here a bunch when i was little though i was his minor in training that was back before mining men blowing the tops off mountains any luck and touch base with the safety team up at the site they're gonna postpone tonight's blast until we find them oh at least we're not racing the clock hey you good charlotte's got to be losing it right now hey she's tough always has been come on let's take a look around this kid can you imagine the [ __ ] we would have caught from dad if we'd done anything like this i should have said something earlier i didn't i mean when he said he was going to the old mine alex it's fine you couldn't have known it's not your fault yeah still though i'm gonna go take a look around let me know if you spot any sign of either sure i can do that how is ethan planning to get into the mine landed a job on my first day maybe this fresh start is still salvageable nope nope nope nope super nope [Music] they were gonna set off charges tonight thank god gabe got a hold of them [Music] how is the rubber zombie the least creepy thing out here [Music] hey bro want to get wasted at the old mine [Music] the real monster here is underage drinking you don't realize until you're up close but mining equipment is super murdery maybe julie mcnamara doesn't need your approval [Music] my joyride in this will have to wait until after we found ethan [Music] probably not as fun to write in as they look [Music] alex why why didn't you no point blaming anyone you just gotta find him fast he's right the only thing that matters now is finding ethan come on ryan everyone is depending on you ryan won't let his fear get in the way i'm glad he's here wow once ethan's safe i'll raise one too [Laughter] imagine being trapped down there or actually don't what happened here massive cave-in bunch of trapped miners all nearly died jed led the whole team back to the surface god yeah that's the day foreman jed became local hero jed and then typhon closed up this site basically bought jed the black lantern huh same logo did ethan base his comic on this place okay okay if the wall is an illusion nothing obvious maybe we should notice anything no [ __ ] i'll be damned the whole story is about ethan's character breaking into a monster stronghold deep underground sounds like the mind of me does it show where he went not sure the comic ends with the monster hunter climbing a watchtower which shows him where to go there the silo i bet that's the tower that's where he went you're a genius yeah great find alex gabe you want to take a crack on unlocking that gate i'm on it we should also be able to get to it through the processing building if we can find a way in let's take a look then okay ethan based his comic on this place maybe i should compare his drawings with other stuff in the area [Music] so if the zombie is here then if ethan really followed the path in his comic finding him just became a lot more doable [Music] come on everyone is depending on you let me know if you find anything yeah ryan seems like he knows what he's doing glad he's here [Music] wait so did ethan oh man [Music] [Laughter] i think there's like a side door back there i don't know i guess there might be give me a hand okay you figured that out from a comic book i'm gonna try to get the lights on you try to figure out where ethan went [Music] ethan must have come through here how did he get out have i got some good news for you [Music] what [Music] go with red it's always red [Music] dang back to the drawing board [Music] wasn't in the comic maybe it's full of twinkies those never go bad right noted [Music] ethan must have gone upstairs pretty sure ethan climbed these stairs [Music] not sure i'm gonna have a look [Music] [Music] wasn't in the comic okay i'll stay out but not because you told me to [Music] we passed caution like an hour ago [Music] not in the comic [Music] the silo we're getting close [Music] so [Music] ethan made the jump from here to the conveyor belt [Music] think i'll find another way through looks like ethan climbed the conveyor belt out to the silo yikes heads up [Music] [Music] you figured out the door yeah turns out you got to open it who knew wonders never cease so this place was a death trap when it was operational too cool cool ugh let's hope omens aren't really a thing nope vayner doesn't battle any bed bugs ugh worse than sleeping on the ground so much stuff just left behind thanks for nothing giant yellow button what took you so long you never forget how to break a lock like riding a bike where two next alex feynor looks out from the watchtower and spots the secret entrance to the stronghold if we can just that's where he's heading that's by the ravine [ __ ] let's go [Music] so we close i think so ethan ethan ethan ethan alex i'm scared ethan i'm coming for you buddy wait hold on ethan you okay don't worry we're gonna get you out of here just hang on [Music] his fear is so strong if i get near it it's no good we're too heavy [ __ ] what about me alex are you sure remember how i taught you how to anchor a belay awesome show me you okay yeah yeah i'm all right you sure it's okay if you're not no i'm good no i actually believe you when you say that alex can you make eye contact with me i'm going to tie this rope around your waist the other end is tied around your brother he'll use that stump as a fulcrum to feed rope your direction follow so far awesome you're doing super good remember slow is steady steady's fast piece cake piece of cake hang on ethan i'm coming you got this alex go back you'll get hurt i'm not gonna get hurt and neither are you what if you're wrong real close just a little further hey ethan i'm here to help okay no get away [ __ ] it's too much i have to get him to chill out ethan i need you to calm down can you breathe for me i should never have come out here i was so stupid okay hey focus talk to me you want to tell me how you got out here i was trying to cross to the other side log fell that's fine that's okay let's talk about what comes next gabe's got us we're not gonna fall he's got the other end of the rope no i can't move if i move you're not gonna fall buddy it doesn't matter he's not making any sense i need him to calm down we can't stay here ethan we have to go see me if i move it'll see me what's gonna see you you don't understand he's right i don't i can't help him if i don't understand what he's afraid of and the only way to understand is to feel what he's feeling oh [ __ ] i can't believe this is happening i can do this i can do this [Music] oh [Music] my god what's happening it's like i'm seeing the world through his eyes i thought i could hurt the monsters i'm not just feeling what ethan feels i'm seeing the world like he sees it [Music] i brought all this stuff this is okay he's not afraid of the fall he's afraid [ __ ] can't let it see me can't let it see me it can't be real oh but it looks pretty [ __ ] real hey i see it too ethan the monster i see it too and i'm just as scared as you are but ethan we're safe you know why it can't see me bangle of vanishing just like 9th warden i thought that was just a story hell some stories are true like monsters so you're gonna hold my hand all right as long as you're touching me you're safe [Music] don't look down okay we'll be done before you know it they're headed back keep tight on the belay gabe not over yet oh god okay one step at a time alex yeah buddy i'm still really scared there's nothing to be afraid of i got you but what if you let go [ __ ] do you think the log will break don't worry i got all the way across before remember it can still break our emotions are connected i need to keep him calm [Music] what they're good man tight grip we're close now that's it come on there you go i got you [Music] uh [Music] ugh [Music] so okay oh huh [Music] i'm not big on speeches i've always believed that the role of the bartender is to shut up and listen and by that measure gabe was the worst bartender i've ever known i never issued a speeding ticket to someone on a bicycle before until he came along he cared so much about my admissions essay even though he probably couldn't spell admissions or essay [Music] he booked my band to play the lantern [Music] all the way from seattle to pretty much right where i'm standing [Music] i can recall 14 specific instances where gabe said something that made me laugh the first was two years ago so long story short instead of a ticket i ended up buying him a beer gabe stood like three feet away grinding like doofus at us i'm sure there were more people [Music] but i only remember him and then he said i know that's why the gay is silent [Laughter] then the fifth time he cared about everyone he was the kind of guy you wanted to be around he was a world-class bullshitter [Music] he was my best friend [Music] all i want to say about gabe is he came into this bar as a stranger but he left at his family guess that's that then what happened to gabe was a senseless tragic accident and i just wish it wasn't an accident son now was not the time gabe called the mine i gave him my sat phone to be sure he could get through they [ __ ] up and now now gabe's dead that was my shift if anyone had called it would have gone through me nobody called you're lying in front of gabe's own [ __ ] sister alex heard the whole thing he's right i was there when gabe made the call i'd like to hear what you have to say about that mac i'm not saying anything just i didn't get a call draw your own conclusions all right folks this is an ongoing investigation how about it we review the sequence of events when i saw you at the record store you seem pretty eager to find gabe remember why hmm another fight with riley maybe no i don't have to take this just saying pretty wild that you come stumbling out of gabe's apartment with your face all [ __ ] up right and just a couple hours later you just so happened to miss the call that would have saved his life i told you there was no call to miss okay maybe the call got dropped or [ __ ] i mean it's not like it's like gabe was mr reliable all the time watch your mouth mac right that's enough now i'm just as eager as you to understand all this son but there was a time [ __ ] dad this little weasel's calling gabe a liar at his own [ __ ] weight no i am just telling you mac i swear if you say there was no call one more [ __ ] stop it now this is not the time or place we're all here for gabe okay ryan sure i'm i'm sorry it's not i'm just i'm not the one who killed him aren't you though what the [ __ ] did you just say ryan back off oh i'm just saying i thought i heard that you were the one you shut the hell up no no go ahead you got something to say mac let's [ __ ] hear it guys don't make me interview all right fine as long as we're tossing around accusations way i hear it you're the guy who cut the rope everyone out alex hey [ __ ] those guys yeah are you okay god no i'm a [ __ ] wreck it's not your job to keep it together thanks do you um it's messy but do you want to come in sure you play guitar sort of it was a gift from gabe cool gabe would try to pop wheelies outside the record store to make me laugh never worked tilly wiped out that was hilarious gabe really wanted to do the larp for ethan but by the end of it he was more jazzed about it than anybody wish i could have seen it we took this a year ago we no way i can't what you actually kept it what a dick sorry i just need a minute yeah uh no problem calm down alex you're fine you're fine whatever that bottle made her think of it really messed her up i wonder if i could help her the same way i helped ethan i need to feel her sadness to figure out how to help her i wonder how she's really holding up foosball champion why would that make her so sad now i can find out what's really going on with staff [Music] dude give it up i already booked a bus ticket wait wait hear me out one more game if i win you have to stay if you win i'll cover the ticket you just lost 50 bucks here's to your new job at the station oh didn't i tell you i'm not taking it i moved to denver next week you

champion gabe chen oh you're the worst can't believe i have to stay in this stupid town i think we both know you could have beat me if you really wanted to so you're welcome [ __ ] i think i know enough to help her now i still can't believe he's gone yeah he's the whole reason i'm still i'm sorry alex don't mind me can i get you a drink or anything no thanks i appreciate the offer though sure that wasn't right want to get a few matches of dino racer in could be a nice distraction no thanks i just need a minute that didn't help how about a quick match did gabe tell you we played yeah and he said he kicked your butt [ __ ] i don't really think it's a great time fine first of five points if you say so so how often did you engage play it was one of our favorite games you must be pretty good then mm-hmm you were in a band right yeah would you play drums how uh how long did you play with them too long gotcha five points that's game yep big shocker oh hey at least you played your best i mean that obviously wasn't my best no i get it i mean this is a tough game requires skill timing and the will to be a champion oh is that how it is wait hold on the crowd is really picking up on my energy we love you alex ah stress okay [ __ ] you i want a rematch you're on i'm actually trying this time so you better focus i am focusing good wouldn't want you to get distracted or anything certainly not greatest northwest band of all time go are you trying to distract me of course not slater kenny if you're wondering i was actually trying that time okay wait let's get serious one more game winner takes title of ultimate foosball champion hmm i don't know come on you know gabe would be all about us playing like this well then it's settled [Music] this is it for all the marbles so many marbles definitely the kind of game you want to focus on no matter what happens totally hey so are you into girls or what i'll date anybody assuming they're my type what's your type i'll let you know when i eat them this is what what [ __ ] i knew it how old are you exactly old enough to know better good game thanks alex i'm really glad you talked me into it it was a lot of fun of course so what are you gonna do now what do you mean that [ __ ] with mac he's clearly lying right i'm not sure what max steele is his story doesn't add up yeah i do know that i need to find out exactly what happened that night for myself and for gabe i've got your back no matter what thank you that means a lot i should head back to work cool bye bye i know gabe made that call but did mac really let the blast go off just to get back at him see i can be a person [Music] it's a start [Music] not much to toast at the moment the kind of person who got that worked up over a college essay could be capable of almost anything what have been fun to see gabe crush some sweet powder or whatever snowboarders say the answer my friend is blowing in the wind we should have gotten so many more sunsets i thought this was going to be the one finally despite all the disappointments i really let myself believe i believed you completely i let myself hope really hope for the first time in years even after i freaked out in front of you and hit you you didn't push me away you sat right there and told me that i wasn't broken that i was special and i belonged then you died then i don't know what to believe now except you're gone again and i'm still here alone i bet gabe could even make golf fun this thing's been up here a while isn't that steph's old band you could stay here too i wouldn't try to stop you yeah good i'll be the only trans person in a town with a population of like four that sounds like a blast for me thanks for not trying to stop me i'm sorry izzy it's not you and it's not the band i [ __ ] love that [ __ ] but i need to try this it's just time for something new i knew it i knew this would happen eventually [ __ ] see you around steph gabe was such a dad gabe really loved this place why look up at the sky when you could look at a sculpture instead [Music] i never got to see bartender gabe in action but he left some pretty big shoes to fill oh hey kid you don't have to do that too late i wanted to apologize for all of us we're all grieving but that's no excuse it was your brother's wake and you both deserve better than listening to a bunch of fools squabble i appreciate it that was pretty rough although it's hard to imagine a good version of your dead brother's wake no there's no good version just all of us trying to get through it together the best we can wasn't the first wake held in this old building i doubt it'll be the last anyway if there's anything i can do just let me know i need to talk to mac i know he's lying i just don't know why any idea where i can find him well he helps out eleanor at the flower shop that'd be the place to start thanks i feel like i should warn you though you might not get the kind of closure you're looking for if you get any at all just don't pin all your hopes on mac loudon thanks for looking out for me but what else am i supposed to do i wish i had an answer for you but if you get a chance before you go all dirty harry swing by the dispensary charlotte wants to see you and one more thing i've been meaning to give you this for the last few days but i didn't want to disturb you up there it'll get you through that door and the one upstairs this is your home now for as long as you'd like as long as i like really i don't want to make any assumptions or put any pressure on you about what to do next but you're always welcome thank you him hell [Music] i i have no idea what to even say to him [Music] you
