them together line i can't finish the healing here my home is just beyond the trees there you will carry him he must not die [Music] good you seem stable and calm for now gray thought this way [Music] that bow's a little big for you isn't it my mother made it for me should i go into it i've never seen you in these woods she must miss you being away from home sheep she's dead we're taking her ashes to the highest peak in the realms ashes it was our last wish boy i'm sorry for your loss we're here you live in a tree not in it below it himalay look it's all right is he friendly boy i promise you he's safe you won't hurt anyone quickly [Music] place him on the stave there keep him still you live alone it's better this way yeah my father doesn't like people either boy well you don't hold him still before he hurts himself good easy rest now i need two more things fresh red root grows just behind the house can you pull a cluster what else i i know you're a god not of this realm but there's no mistaking it he doesn't know does he about your true nature or his own that is none of your concern the gods of these realms don't take kindly to outsiders trust me i know when they find you and they will they'll make things difficult the boy will want answers that will be my problem whatever you're hiding you cannot protect him forever but you're right it doesn't concern me i also need lamb's crafts do you mind it's a white petal flower in my garden just a handful fine lambs chris i like her i mean she lives under a turtle you are too open with her we do not know if she can be trusted she hasn't tried to kill us yet would this help i dropped it when you were chasing the animal what's wrong with me if i if i lost it then you did lose it i'll take better care of it from now on so oh exactly what i need so he's gonna live yes then we are leaving wait not without thanks you want solitude this mark will hide you from those who might make your journey difficult [Music] [Music] there's a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods follow this path down then head towards daylight will we see you again as much or as little as you like now get out of here come boy this underground passage should put you back on your path to the mountain just use the boat wait and take this you can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world it will always steer you towards your goals i see a boat [Music] nightmares mom used to tell me about them didn't think they were actually real yeah they give people nightmares or they are nightmares i don't remember which i wish i could ask here we go isn't that heavy yes doesn't see me do not touch the water why do you know what is under the surface no then do not touch the water [Music] over there now we'll get to the mountain quickly i just can't believe i'm here thank all of us there was a time i thought i'd never leave my woods not even my own beds you were not to blame for your sickness oh i know i guess i'm just saying this is great there's the mountain how close we are we not available look at that it's thor the war god of thunder that's right i never thought you'd listen to mother spoke i someone did did she speak of one who could feel no pain oh that sounds like baldi an ace your god son of odin and frigg and odin is king that's right why do you ask i think i see something just sitting there in the middle of the lake can't quite make it out it reads sacrifice your arms to the center of the water awaken again the cradle of the world what throw our weapons into the water guess that won't be a problem for you are you gonna do it hmm [Music] axe did not return what is this it's the world serpent [Music] stay calm boy [Music] yeah mom said he's friendly what is it saying i don't know [Music] that was amazing wait there's the shipwreck way over there see that and there's a statue of thor except i can see a lot more of him now the water dropped when the serpent rose oh that must be why the beach wasn't there before see and there's the mountain look it that building leads from the foot of the mountain to that golden temple it was all just under the surface except for the statue good thing huh there's even a dock there next to the flag going to the dock first right we'll be the first people to walk on and who knows how long you know of that serpent he's one of the giants he's so big he's wrapped around the whole world an exaggeration i don't know it's pretty big to me oh you think this has been here a very long time is this the way to the mountain it would seem if it isn't the bearded beefer it is sac seed if i got something for you too brock but how did you none of your [ __ ] business now get in here i got something for you and don't go making pig eyes at my spot i saw him first okay what do you think he wants to test our patience when word gets out about my new shop folks will finally come out of hiding they'll be clawing all over each other just to catch a whiff of my wheels you watch you rush around like that everywhere yes catch the pile of rocks there with that key of iggy still you can open a magic door to the branches of the world tree a shortcut between the realms if you ever see him out in the world use it to get back to me quake but it's only one way straight back here and nowhere else and whatever you do never never ever never ever throw yourself over the edge of the path lest you want death yeah i don't see us wanting that let's get to it i'm sure that's a load off your mind best of luck with all the rampaging [Music] uh what is this a horn here's the end can we blow into it without knowing the outcome well we usually push every button pull every lever we see outcomes we can predict no this is something else we must develop your instincts i knew it we are blowing the horns no we are testing your resolve i have resolved a bunch of it focus up boy that tower leads through to the mountain i'm ready i don't know these rings if we find a cipher i bet i could figure it out oh my god not too hard look here another look it's the world serpent he's so much bigger than i imagined oh look he bit thor or will bite him looks like i still can't read these what is that smells awful poison oh [Music] another cipher piece i'll see what i can fit together oh what were those things they smell awful your mother called them scorn poles poison magic she was the one who showed me how to disable them [Music] what it's just funny to think of her teaching you something yes whoa sure is foggy here [Music] another dwarf you should no he is of no consequence uh huh excuse me but um how did you come by that uh axe that is my concern alone and uh while i won't dispute that i i know that blade it was one of ours but uh we didn't make it for you step aside i can't see the woman we made it for i was uh well i am quite fond of her and i would be somewhat displeased if it turns out that you did something to her it was my mother's she left its father before she died face dead i'm very very sorry to hear that she was a fierce warrior and a good woman okay i will make improvements to the axe [Music] but nobody asked you to what it's true but but knowing your mother she would have insisted i repair that act of vandalism perpetrated against her axe by my brother i knew it you are brock's brother the other half of the brand's here the blue one is your brother yes though my talents are vastly superior no boast i swear to freya do not undo his work improve upon it only yeah but can you can you put it down over there that handle is no filthy okay then i'll just i will just oh oh oh oh is that dried blood oh so what were you working on oh that i call it the sky mover just up that mountain awaits a treasure trove of rare resources once i mine it i'll need a way to bring it all down and you know how to fix it not even a little did you really make that axe for my mother oh i'd recognize it anywhere ask me it's one of our best infused with the echoing screens of 20 frost trolls give or take but why her how did you know her she sought us out in the beginning she was a special woman she wanted to protect people i suppose we thought it was a chance to give power to someone who'd use it for good she even spoke our native tongue she'd say mothering some gengor egg and vegem hans gengori that's right that's impressive i see a lot of her in your eyes you know thanks don't touch me what i didn't i won't i'll come back later be careful where you're going there's nobody nice out here anymore since all the people left i mean i hate to generalize but um mostly they just try to kill you good tip um i know it's not my business but if i were you i wash off that symbol painted on your neck we were told it would help protect us was that a lie oh no it's a protection stave all right but you can't render that pigment into paintable texture without blending it with boar urine and is that really better than death maybe a little well well it's your neck three [Music] uh oh [Music] i can't tell are we getting closer to the mountain we are whoa focus up god there she really didn't want anyone stop you uh [Music] yes [Laughter] uh uh [Music] it's locked magically so oh do you think for this last leg up the mountain that maybe i can carry her i told you no why she meant more to me than you anyway what i just meant i spent more time with her you are on hunting it would serve you to stop talking [Music] [ __ ] ah oh [Music] [Applause] father [Music] ready yourself [Music] an ogre here who built this place [Music] [Music] oh go ah system whoa i can see why mom wanted us to bring her here indeed wonder if cindy knows his sky movers tangled with roots up here i doubt it i do not care is that smoke stay back boy what is that you must find another way up the witch wish she was here bet she could get us past this my magic is useless against the black breath and there's no way around it odin saw to that long ago what are you doing here making sure you can finish your journey why would you warn us i was busy saving my friend if you remember the black breath is a corruption of magic even i can't dispel only the pure light of alfheim is strong enough to break through but that road is long what does this goal mean to you it's everything follow me why help us maybe i see more of myself in you than i'm willing to admit maybe maybe by helping you i'll make up for a lifetime of mistakes [Music] or maybe i just like you even though we shot your friend even though you shot my friend yes where must we go to a realm beyond your own we're going to another realm are you coming with us only for a little while only for a little while we'll use this gratha can't send you said it was broken syndra the dwarf at the foot of these hills he was fixing it when we got here no one was there when i passed by perhaps he finished dwarves are awfully resourceful and irritating based on the two we have met that too tears temple is at the center of the lake it is from there we travel to altheim thankfully it's no longer underwater why is that creature in the bay no one knows he just appeared one day soon after thor attacked and their battle could be felt across all the realms ultimately it ended in a stalemate and thor returned to odin empty-handed the serpent stayed and grew so large he now spans all of midgard see told you they've hated each other ever since destined to kill each other come ragnarok you believe in ragnarok i dearly wish i didn't child you know we actually talked to the world serpent you did an exaggeration i'm good with languages even ones i've never heard before but when he talks i can't understand any of it sadly no one can he speaks a dead tongue oh must be longer watch your step just along here are you sure we came through here before and there's no way back thought see is that so let me show you something are you watching what it's solid elven architecture my bowstring was soaked in the light of all time it can now reawaken the magic of the elves wait it won't just disappear will it not as long as the light shines free this way i want one those roots what kind of magic is that it's vanir from vanahan you know of it just stories mother didn't say much about the vanier gods just that they're always at war with the ace here as compared to odin thor they're the good guys there are no good gods boy but i taught you that tears temple built with help from the giants great tear used it to travel the nine realms and keep the peace between them doesn't seem very peaceful everywhere we go we're attacked especially by dead things the risen dead grow ever more numerous once the roads and trails would have been full of people now all have hid or fled save for the reavers savage enough to survive in such a world make a ride at the bottom of these stairs hey another one of those light crystals wait there while i reawaken the light leosta that did it what are we doing exactly mending the disc repair start by lifting that axle good now push it back into place now realign the wheel onto the trap perfect now push the bridge along the track what the whole entire bridge is turning how is the whole entire bridge turning boy you're really strong just keep pushing until the bridge reaches its first position tired yet no he's always been really strong so about the dead we heard someone call them hell walkers but what are they they are poor restless souls denied their judgment and their peace why what did then your magic raise the dead it could once but this is no spell this plague of dead is but a symptom of a world out of balance something or someone has meddled with powerful forces that is all i know for sure that's perfect come back up we're ready now that was impressive you didn't hurt your back did you i did not hurt my back through these doors wait so did the giants or the elves build tears all the races helped with its construction it was the last great act of cooperation between the realms before peace disappeared for good wow your bow string stop glowing its power is now depleted only a few knocks of magic remained in the bowstring and we used them your bow please once you claim the light of all time infuse the bowstring with its power don't forget you talk like you're not coming with us i'll try but measures were taken to keep me trapped in midgard why the gods don't care for me much is this it it's so dark this temple has been asleep underwater for almost 150 winters it needs only the light of the bifrost to reawaken those roots don't look like your magic they aren't these roots are part of the great world tree and make travel between the realms possible approach the table how does it work you will need this a bi-frost to create travel between realms it can capture hold and transfer the light of alpha place the bifrost there what now give it a moment the temple needs time to wake up from its long slumber it is from this room and this room alone that you will be able to cross between realms what you see before you represents the temple in which we stand as well as the realm towers that encircle the lake of nine outside all the realms exist in the same physical space reflections of each other these doors the towers outside and the nine realms are all intertwined and coexisting on the branches of the world tree separated only by the bifrost light of alpheim this place can focus and control that light and is this the world tree only an artistic representation of it no the yggdrasil is much much more than this the tree of life is bound to the fate of the world just as we are bound to it the tree nourishes our soils the dew from its leaves feeds our valleys and rivers the tree's very existence supports all of creation along its bounds it's life energy interwoven into the tapestry of life birth growth death and rebirth every strand transcending time transcending space everything comes back to the tree [Music] so that's how it works but i'm guessing you were looking for a more practical answer yes very well the bridge you pushed outside is currently positioned to lead to the realm of anaheim instead turn the wheel to our actual destination alpheim wait is this moving the big bridge outside yes the wheel turns the bridge and the bridge aligns to the different realm towers on the lake outside wait there's no tower on this one and that's why realm travel to yotenheim is impossible without a tower for the bridge to lock into the sequence can't begin every realm has a travel room that unlocks the bridge to that realm i'm giving you the one for alpine now you can lock in your destination we're ready remember to take the bifrost you don't want to lose that now the realm travel bridge will align and the realm between realms will open see that giant crystal each realm has a corresponding one that focuses and amplifies the power of the bifrost opening the bridge to that realm that's why realm travel is only possible from this room what about that one round town missing from the lake the jottenheim tower disappeared from all realms over a hundred winters ago when the giants vanished from midgar where the tower went and how they moved it remain a mystery it didn't work we're still here follow me the bifrost is dark this trip was its last use there's no going back until it's replenished with the light of alfheim so we are trapped someone of your ability should have little trouble getting back to midgard and we'll be able to make that black breath go away with the captured light of alfheim yes [Music] welcome to alpheim gentlemen think you can spot the light i can barely see it something's wrong see that column of light on the horizon it's housed in the heart of a ring temple we'll find what we need there no no no no damn it not yet what's happening to restore the bifrost magic you must she's not dead she not likely come look at this place stay by me touch nothing okay what is that i think you killed it look up there whoa what's that about not our concern boy focus what does it say hmm something about an eternal war for the light i don't get it if both sides need it why not just share it greed you will find it a common cause for war [Music] they keep murdering the lighthouse it is lost [Music] fired what are they attacking us for we didn't do anything more will come where's this stuff even come from did you say something no oh okay soon we'll be able to translate those behind them at least we're getting closer to the light wait is that cindy i could use a distraction be seeing you let's get to it i probably shouldn't let my brother lay hands on it again but if he does tell him to temper his steel longer he's warping the bit work oh boat street what'd you say i said nothing really okay did your mother speak of this realm not much just that since the elves were always fighting over hawaii they kept them isolated huh again i said nothing wait there's one you said something ah what is it boy oh boy says you don't hear that are you nothing [Music] it's going away now it was screaming lots of voice angry you really didn't hear that no it felt evil [Music] [Music] look should we try talking to them no but maybe they need help they do not stop us so they do not concern us they do not concern us look at that that must be the ring temple [Music] look they have sand bowls and i'll find too [Music] should i read it what does it ask without me or within me death is sure yet within you i am life most pure but i don't see any runes around here we must find it back to the boat it's sad the elves can't work things out i'll find such a beautiful place but war makes it ugly you see with the eyes of a child in war a soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy the rest of him is lost sometimes never to return you know about war don't you wars are fought for two things survival or advantage battles may be won by the better soldier wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory the blue door has got to be the entrance let's go careful boy what are they doing the bridge is gone they covered the crystal with that stuff why to prevent reinforcements up huh maybe we can fix the bridge from down there okay so that did something i think oh [Music] what is their problem with us we do not belong here wait combine together like that they kind of look like a room it doesn't make sense come back to the sand bowl sundry said mother was a warrior was she in a war too of a sort her family was decimated by hostile rivals and she alone survived she walked the warriors path but her war was to live on to brave and unforgiving world alone and that's why she has cindy and brock to make her the axe she had the strength to wield such a weapon and the wisdom to use it for good she found purpose in protecting the weak so she'd help out the elves no father the pillars in ring form an elvish room draw it boy it was the voices again but different voices less angry you're asking for help we are here for the light i do not care who they are nor what they want you never care about anything you have something to say no what's happening whoa look what we found father yes the voices i heard it was hard to make out but way in the back i'm pretty sure i heard mother that is not possible i know what i heard petraeus enough who would i want here look at those horns go [Music] one more to go yes uh oh be ready [Music] hope that was worth it huh uh [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] oh okay tricky very tricky think that side hallway will get us to the temple we will find out hmm oh you were wrong back there i know mother's boy's better than anyone she is gone boy speak no more of this fine huh oh [Music] hold on boy boys uh yes thanks god hmm uh ugh hey you sure the witch is okay i'd hate to think she died helping us she knew what she was doing okay [Applause] ugh more of it if we cut enough away the bridge above us should reappear right expect resistance right huh oh you'll find its weak points oh well there it is watch our backs boy uh you're freezing at first we must find a way up i bet there's more where those came from guess the light makes more than bridges maybe this will spit us out on top look the blue door we made it you know i will never get used to walking on solid light the door there's no seam what we have a problem these doors do not open hello i don't get it i even have a door then hello come we will find another way in more of those bells a nor near chest must be nearby huh [Music] [Music] the dwarf again whoa you killed an ancient yes was it difficult yes is that all you're gonna give me yes how are you here before a store we were told our path was the only one between realms well it may be the only way for you to travel but we dwarves are full of surprises that is not an answer ah hang on to that sense of wonder there's so little mystery once you've amassed the wealth of arcane knowledge that i have where to comb the realms for exotic resources how to craft them into creations that defy imagination to the novice i'm sure it all seems like magic but uh oh all right it's magic are you happy now syndry have you always been so clean huh don't i wish no i was just as unsanitary as the next dwarf until the day a van your witch set me straight she discovered with her magic there are hundreds of thousands of tiny beasties on everything around us oh so small you can't even see them no it's true and if they get inside you they make you sick but the witch told me there's one wood the oak that's a natural deterrent stops the beasties from spreading so now i make all my handles from oak see i think of these things okay back to work so how come brock's blue and you're not why oh it's fine very good question actually you see my brother's not as careful as i am in fact he prefers to work with metals using his own bare hands no gloves says it's the only way he can hear what it wants to be touch enough raw silver and it changes your skin irreparably that means forever i wouldn't bring it up to him though you know how sensitive he can be i guess that makes sense syndry why don't you just make up with your brother already me make up with him because he's an obstinate pig head incapable of change because he says the most terrible things about me just because he's insecure about his own work which let me tell you is sub par because he blames me for for the things that aren't my fault huh like what would you pardon me please i need to collect myself oh what brings you around friends how about you young one where were you even carrying those well um if you don't need it don't buy it [Music] we're inside of course focus up boys oh come on uh i do okay not bad but not good either [Music] [Applause] go wow [Music] oh whoa now that's impressive [Music] [Music] uh so ah look another light up what's he doing oh no why are they killing him he didn't do anything do not assume you are seeing the end of a war boy you do not know what led to this moment but he didn't even defend himself that was his choice we make ourselves yes huh the light is near look for a way inside that did it look more light bridges follow me huh oh [Music] we go he did it you're restoring all the pathways [Music] [Music] ah i don't think we're supposed to be in here quiet did you hear that stay alert and by my side hey when we make it to the light how do you think we get it into the bifrost the witch said to step into it she did when she was ripped away from this realm oh i missed that you are more concerned with her safety than will go quiet i have him your knife that was close do not stray from me boy you don't gotta tell me stay back yes we are near our goal but we must be careful understand god there when it falls be ready we will need to move quickly okay look out here they come stay behind here protect our flank yes sir done [Music] keep shooting one i will clear our path shorten the time between your volleys superior numbers stay focused uh boy are you injured i'm fine wow it's beautiful the light it's making the whole temporary appear it's the source of all of it wait it's it's singing i hear a year i told you i heard her do you think she's in there ah i really hurt i feel like my hand was on fire stay here stay here only use it as a last resort you're giving me your axe i am letting you hold my axe it is not a gift still ah what is this faye [Music] you have to come back you left me here alone atreus along with him he always leaves he's never here he doesn't want me he never will [Music] i don't know him and he doesn't know me doesn't seem to want to i'm strong i'm smart i'm not what he thinks i am i know better he doesn't talk to me doesn't teach me it should have been him do you hear me him not you [Music] except i don't mean that you know i love him i just wish he was better i know he can so if he tries i'll try but if he doesn't please come back i know you're out there somewhere [Music] hmm [Music] wait come back no no what have you done why did you do that i saved you you are trapped in there i waited and i waited but you wouldn't come out so i pulled you out boy i was gone only moments no you've been gone a long long time i didn't know what to do you left me here again why don't you care that's impossible we should go before they come back i hope you got what you needed yes look there's our exit but there's no light to make a bridge we're trapped and the witch's bowstring is useless boy your bow hold it out [Music] on my mark loose your arrow into the stone it worked we can now make our way back come [Music] that stairway's blocked there's a white crystal ahead just laying there maybe it'll help us get out of this stupid place so uh [Music] so so uh ugh [Music] oh huh finally i'll light the crystal if you find me an angle let us make our way back up [Music] uh um [Music] this [Music] oh oh where are you taking that boy over here you gonna carry that everywhere i just might oh look the blue door that's not a door and a sand bowl but how do you expect me to reach it oh maybe instead of looting a sacred temple we could just get out of here if i want your opinion boy i will ask for it [Music] [Music] now where do we go from here uh [Music] you can reach the bowl now uh-huh uh anytime you're ready what does this mean see remember the shape yeah i know go ahead greatest man or tallest tree begins as any more than me yeah let's see stupid so that's a door after all hmm [Music] so [Music] [Music] he will be back [Music] we really gotta go back down here again do you see any other way then [Music] there isn't a way back up from here you know i know all right now i can barely see there's light big [Applause] yes [Music] adapt oh [Music] yeah yeah plan on carrying the crystal everywhere like the last one if need be uh oh [Music] foreign uh [Music] huh boy shoot and know how it works finally you can use the same sample that brought us down the first time i want to get out of here oh yep oh oh god huh no that can't be what did it say that we made a grave mistake did we help the wrong side all right let me guess you're gonna be smug and say you told me we shouldn't get involved that is enough can we go now do you remember the answer yeah boy read this boy what's that only time you want to talk to me is when you meet do you want to tell me something i said the only time you care to talk to me is when you need me to translate for you if mom was if your mother was still alive we would not be here at all atreus forget it fine pushing the leg until our journey is over one of us must remain focused do not mistake my silence for lack of grief more on how you wish leave me to my own i'm sorry i didn't realize no why would you you do not know my ways i know it has not been easy [Music] in the light i felt only moments pass if that is of some comfort to you that's good to know really so should we go back to midgard face the black breath what do you think there's more to see in this realm father you ever know anyone else who heard voices i knew desperate men at sea who when our supplies ran dry would quench their thirst by drinking seawater they swore the sirens evil creatures singing to them from nearby islands were in fact their wives and daughters calling them home they endangered the crew steering us toward the reefs um how did you fix them we threw them overboard oh well good thing i didn't drink any seawater ready yes it is you're back i see you've been busy how observant i am known for my attention to detail there's an abandoned temple in midgard that a fellow dwarf converted to his personal storeroom packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms throughout the realms which ones did he go to what did he collect fafnir was a shall we say aggressive collector of magical artifacts the more he acquired the more he desired there was no realm too dangerous no relic too hazardous he once ventured deep into niflheim for a whetstone of all things huh i bet that was quite the whetstone does this story have a point yes it does i just happen to have an entry stone to fafnir storeroom you might find something useful in there neat thanks andrew you're very welcome oh and uh if you find that whetstone well it sure would be nice of you to bring it to me i'd advise caution if you're heading to the storeroom last i was there all manner of nastiness had taken up residence won't your friend be upset if we steal all the stuff oh no no not at all he's dead i think oh sorry no no need to be sorry these things happen when one travels from realm to realm collecting priceless artifacts that don't belong to you [Music] good good also remember to breathe and what do you have your eye on oh that should tie you over [Music] so just make sure you watch each other's backs in the storeroom wouldn't want to lose my loyal customers father i have a confession tonight all those voices in my head well this wasn't the first time back when we met brock his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees that's why she didn't want to cross she told you well i could just feel what she was feeling what she was afraid of it happens again you tell me understand i promise what now we have the light to midgard it's crazy to think that all the realms exist in the same space one on top of the other it's like this room lets us travel without moving brock we just came back from another realm and we met your brother wait not that over did you let that seed salt put hand to your blade you do know he lost his talent right just jump and left him one day tried taking me down with him did he botch up on her girl quite the opposite hmm you're leaving a blind pig farts up a truffle now and again but you know what really counts consistency and i got that coming out of all of my parts did you do it's better sure i'm open sorry you wasted my time do you remember the way back to the black breath of course we need to walk across the bridge to the vanaheim tower are we going to the black breath or exploring your choice look we wrote past that statue of thor earlier when we left the wishes and what direction is that it's mid morning the sun is over there so that's south southwest good take that another name rojo i told you we should come back with the cipher oh look the witch's magic is still covering those scorn poles saves us some time huh interesting uh i'm feeling creative today you don't need to make excuses to say hello father do you do you think i could carry here now no but i i said no okay so who do you think carved the face in the mountain you would know better than i thanks now watch our step carelessness will only delay us right well there's the black breath again what do we do now we see if the witch was right it's working she was right go let us finish this [Music] [Music] [Music] then we climbed you know others said the giants used to visit the midgard mountains before they disappeared disappeared yeah i guess they just up and left one day no one knows why perhaps they returned to their home herodon maybe i wonder if the face in the mountain was a tribute to some important giant mouth we made it more black breath [Music] giants did come here where are we going the entrance was back there are you in a hurry no but you normally are i'm happy to keep exploring you want to leave already we just got here uh is that idea i don't remember stories of a giant with a deer head wonder who he is the floor boy that doesn't mean anything something's missing i think what does it say no your beast nor fearful throw nor rooted tree that's no my call hmm nothing [Music] ready and wait this place must have been important to the giants it's like they're testing us okay that looks right i can almost make it up is it the answer freedom sure that works go ahead sure we're also what you doing oh i thought maybe there'd be a bridge your giants need to test us further there's a crystal that tortoise should i let it that helps right i guess we have to go down these passages seem too small for giants why do you laugh it's very serious i am always serious i forget mom always said you never took an interest in history giants are just a race like okay in that case giant also means big there's only one yes can we keep moving [Applause] uh uh oh ready [Music] you are more focused hey that could be done [Music] uh this is a lot of bodies ah huh father [Applause] [ __ ] [Music] boy another light crystal just look at this place it feels so dead i was gonna say ancient but it works too uh tell me what you see well they look like men not giants correct but you seeking treasure see the traps oh yeah lucky for us they set them all off be grateful we stay dead the statue we made it across can you read it yes sir one of the four stags of the world tree he's supposed to watch the entrance to yonhap while the giants sleep think he's still there i do not know boys i've seen this language before why would someone hide a library good i think you got it [Music] huh [Music] repeat is still our goal we find a way up wow the highest peak in the realms i think mom knew this to the giants mountain no the request has been more complicated than she could have foreseen it's a name i think bryan's layer it means terror what's that weird there's a candle all tangled up with string and some sort of animal hide some kind of lantern no wick though that is of no use to us the bifrost lights our way hey what do you think like these torches the dead don't need light eyes open hello stop that come on i was just okay whoa what is all this where are we mine and if this claw reaches the summit our goal is near all right how do we use it i think i see how this works the claws on one side and if we get this unstuck oh no i think the rope stuck under that rock that was careless yes sir sorry sir [Music] getting rid of those things i'm ready it is over [Music] well that's not going anywhere you had a way around the black breath all along now don't go thinking i could have gotten you past getting a big sack of meat i got ways around most everything especially up here time was my folk had the run of this joint improved the design of the yodnar traps and built workarounds to boot why you think they're so devious oh they remind me watch out for traps let's do it something for the boy [Music] good stuff always a pleasure now [ __ ] right along how big is this place it is a mountain big [Music] yes [Music] more traps there's a tunnel but you won't fit take it okay the work it is [Music] what you need got something else in mind where were we on that other ah [Music] [Music] [Music] go you okay of course enemies ahead oh [Music] that's the last of them think you can move it looks kind of heavy i can move it and we're card's still attached i see that let's go that's it look another lantern broken leave it what could they be there's something special about them i can feel it good huh [Music] huh [Music] look at all this old stuff if it is not useless leave it alone i know huh [Music] cool so i think it's up ahead [Music] well that looks heavy no way i think we can make the rope wheel work now why give us the way to the top oh [ __ ] do back to the wheel so you know i think the giants now only mine the mountain but actually lived here read it sir that's funny oh so one hand wrote yo nar only and another road and also doors should we add to it no come boys boy so it fits that's perfect wait for us that should hold it so what'd you find out there how do we keep those things down there and don't be letting that spit fister of a brother of mine lay hands again [Music] so job here we go do you think this goes all the way to the top we will see you soon enough something feels strange up there we're heading into danger do not concern yourself with what might be focus on what is and be vigilant yes sir not the top closer wait that one's not broken there's a note but giants pray they're asking their ancestors to watch over them to guide them home wait i think i know how it works [Music] watch [Music] what did you write i asked them to watch your mother [Music] do you think they'll watch over us on the way to the top come boy that is a long way [Music] up stay back the tunnel boy got it be careful more tests boards must have carved these tunnels around the giant's traps good thing too oh good for me anyway oh come on that is not helping see you on the other side built this up boy [Applause] uh another mining lift it may not be as long a way up as we thought i did it still too heavy right oh all right we're moving again hey when we get to the summit how far do you think we'll be able to see the lake the world serpent our house we will see when we get there until then eyes open whoa betray us i'm fine just lost my balance for a moment you know for someone so strong you sure worry a lot it serves me well and how i keep us alive i guess not a terribly fun way to live though oh oh skill continues to grow okay here we go how was that for fun i get it you should worry more is this where we get off no we are stuck think we'll get attacked again definitely oh boy yes now be ready prepare yourself oh oh i know [Music] i think we're safe now it would seem father after we scatter our mother's ashes what then what comes next nothing comes next we go home that's it the adventure is over for now but we will have much to do you were right earlier on the boat after cutting down the last tree you said it felt like something had changed and it has and our home is no longer safe but it will be again and we must continue your training okay we're almost at the summit nothing's gonna stop us calm yourself boy but stay behind me uh [Music] what are you doing be ready oh that was intense hold what was that that looks like a root of the yeager surgery i was aiming for his eyes but i kept losing my footing do you think this was their hunt did they move in after the giants left or are they why the giants left boy the air grows thin here no more questions yes i see do you hear that sounds like someone's screaming wait boy it's injury can you kill something that big if we can catch it off balance i can distract him what are you doing [Music] we have to help him break right find an angle wait for my mark thank you hey oakley over here oh so top oh so [Music] oh [Music] oh oh [Music] oh god be ready to lower the crane on my mark i do not care be ready foreign no [Music] uh wow we actually did it and you ah but but but nobody's killed a dragon for hundreds of years not since the grand calling of the worms and unless i'm mistaken you did all that for me you are mistaken the dragon was simply on our path nothing more you deny it all you want but you saved me and that deserves compensation what are these braided mistletoe arrows straighter than heimdall and perfectly weighted oh thanks oh okay hold on uh oh not that um have you seen my brother again yeah he said you lost your talent oh and that i'm selfish no i'm sure that i value a weapon's look no over its purpose that i'm pretentious no and i'm tight fussy i know what he thinks but he can't hurt me any ah burn that i do not have time for this no no no no no wait wait wait wait wait i have a better idea what i just need a tooth from that dragon so watch where you grab that oh never mind so unclean oh so so unclean oh oh the smell perfect that should do yeah i am not touching that just hold it out now run that along the string of your son's bow just humor me betrays your bow two passes should do it ah gently now [Music] whoa oh sure now you're impressed um oh see figured it out on your own then just never mind i wasn't just explaining the beautiful and complex artistry of my craft or anything no just anything to help you yep so what brings you around friends and what do you have your eye on i'm sure that'll come in handy happy to provide feels like it wasn't that long ago we were hunting deer now we fought dark elves trolls and ogres and a dragon i feel like we could be anything now we win because we are determined disciplined not because we feel ourselves superior sure i know it's just it feels good to be strong you know thanks i know huh uh [Music] [Music] there we go oh i'm gonna like this strange though that one didn't completely blow up that crystal i shot it once it's going again ready yes yep uh monkeys [Applause] look there's a bridge [Music] i will never get tired of shattering things with this right there ah another one here this one's called emea mother tried to tell me this one but i think i was too young are giants coming out of his armpits i think that might be odin stabbing him what's that [Music] boy yes sir this is good to know huh um [Applause] oh it's getting colder we must be near the top not long now mom look the summit we're so close enough your quiver strap broke when we fought the dragon it's all right i can hold it stop the broken quiver will slow your draw pain we endure faulty weaponry we do not this will do for now good good go steady boy mind your footing i'm not ready so there must be some way up you hear those voices too right yes be silent that sounds like the same man who came to our house you said you killed it you've got company this time must be important if the sons of thor deem to grace me with their presence tell me you two still tripping over yourselves to impress daddy the tattooed man tracks show he now travels with a child where would they go next why would i know that you're the smartest man alive aren't you smarter than all the dead ones too you help me i help you tell me where they are and i'll talk to odin your father won't let me go balder and he won't let you kill me you have nothing to offer me so take your questions take your threats take these two worthless wankers and piss off when no one's looking we'll be back for your other eye don't you forget we're everywhere we really are are shut up ah the very topic of conversation a tattooed man traveling with a child boy took their path make sure we're all alone but we just saw them leave do as i say he doesn't know where you are and i would keep it that way who are you me i'm the greatest ambassador to the gods the giants and all the creatures of the nine realms i know every corner of these lands every language spoken every war waged every deal struck they call me mimir smartest man alive and i have the answer to your every question why does the son of odin hunt us okay there are a few gaps in my knowledge bowden's had me in prison here for 109 winters i'm a clever lad i can piece it together promise just given time nobody there just like i said the boy's mother is dead she wished she wanted us to spread her ashes on the highest peak in oh then you've come to the wrong place little brother the highest peak in all the realms is not here in midgard it's in your name realm of the giants no that could not be what she meant take a look [Music] this is the last known bridge to youtube in all the realms see that mountain looks like a giant's finger scraping the sky that's the highest peak in all the realms no here can we just take that bridge we have a bi-frost when the giants destroyed all other british to their realm they locked this one up with a secret rune if it still exists only a giant would know it and all of them left midgard a long time ago true but today the winds of fate have kicked up a strange vortex of coincidence like this there's only one person alive who can get you where you need to go and luckily for you my schedule's wide open [Music] we're going to yodenham right it's your best and only move from a tactical standpoint it's the one place the man who cannot be killed won't follow you what do we do yes first you need to cut off my head wait what odin made sure that no weapon not even thor's hammer could free my body for these bonds but fortunately you don't need my body the trick is we need to find someone who can reanimate my head using the old magic oh magic there's a witch of the woods she knows the old ways and she'll help she might do what a child but if she fails he will be dead he tortures me you know every day brother lordon himself sees it personally and believe me there is no end to his creativity every single day this this isn't living very well oh i can't watch this mother in case you can't resurrect me there's something you know boy the longer you wait to tell him his true nature the more damage you do he will resent you and you may lose him forever there is much about me i would not have him so you value your privacy more than your son i'm going to cut off your head now fair enough [Music] [Applause] [Music] hmm [Music] here now we're going to yonah we're going to find the long-lost realm of the giants that's that's inconvenient yeah that's just what i was going to say do you remember the way to the witch's house yes the woods with the blood red leaves south of the lake i know just where to go i hope she made it back for malphine and can bring my mirror back you seem nice before you cut off his head i can't believe it was balder that came to our house the acer gun balder and you fought him and won yes one of odin's sons thor's brother and now he's hunting us with his nephews why is this happening if we can raise the head you can ask him okay you know it's silly but i secretly hope we find a giant somewhere in that mountain i guess they really did leave midgar except for the serpent he may be the last of us kind are you the last of your kind too is that why you don't like to talk about my kind i mean your family before mother or not where you came from mother a father now is not the time for that yes sir rock rock rock what i'm on a [ __ ] break don't hear me screeching at you whenever you're twiddling your shortened curlies leave him boy no pep well you already soiled my solitude so you may as well join me you're not hungry good it's not what i was offering saw your brother again congratulations and i'm sure you let him go and roger my axe good and plenty again let's see the damage a little tanker throat wouldn't know proper weight and balance if it were dangling off his chute you eating well enough i guess good all better now what the [ __ ] else you want huh times he gets so wrapped up in his work center he has a defense to sip us up and if he does remember good luck getting him to cook his own meat guess i got all the stomach in the family you along with the smarts you miss him what that spitfister what do you know i just mean do you mind trying to concentrate here already on a break from my break what's it gonna be this time that's it hey where's your beast of burden what do you mean i hate her fat bits of her out just a while ago what is wrong with you boy or milk ran your eye she was your friend then she'll be happy i'm so well fed [ __ ] bricks boy you got a real sentimental streak know that don't get yourself confused out there i'm getting back to let's get you squared away then you got a fine deal there here yeah next time boy what is the path back to the witch first we need to find a boat do you remember the way back to the witch from here that way behind the big statue of thorns do we have time for another story huh a short one there is a tailored by the woodsman he asked the trees of the forest for a branch to make a handle for his axe instead the trees gave him a young sapling so they could keep their limbs the woodsman made his axe and then he returned and chopped down the oldest trees in the forest hmm just those trees are old doesn't mean they're smart we could talk about here huh the water dropped and the serpent rose right i knew that i know she's really powerful but you really think the witch can bring a head back to life she seems competent in her craft and we have

freya herself i never would have suggested this freya the goddess freya you didn't know either sorry when word gets out that my mirror is free the wrath of odin won't be far behind you are god leader of the banner once yes but no longer you do not think it's important to tell me are you really going to lecture me about that we are leaving boy now you're welcome why did you do that we cannot trust her because she's a god everybody taught you nothing boy but she's helped us a lot she lied some people value the privacy best not to judge brother when i require your council head i will ask fair enough get me to tears temple in the lake of the nine and i'll get you to rottenheim as promised we know there's something what's there only the last living giant in midgard who better to tell us the way the world serpent wait do you know how to talk to him indeed he speaks an obscure tongue more ancient even than these mountains none are left in midgard who speak it except of course for me who do it's true you wouldn't know it to look at him but jorman gander is a sparkling conversationalist atreus follow me boy over here yes sir oh [Applause] almost there i can't jump over with those wooden boards in the way it is it's another one of those samples wow uh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] so my mirror why did freya spin your face no speak of balder he claims nothing harms him hi balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical boosting of a god everyone has a weakness not him i'm afraid baldur is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical you just said that mimir did i what is the source of this power well as i recall it involved a spell my mirror parts of my brain must still be coming back to life just need a moment to finish waking up i hope he's not broken whoa how do we speak to the serpent there's a horn on a platform at the middle point of the bridge take me to it finally that horn okay what's good i'm sure that's a load off your mind moving on then good i put my lips to the horn [Music] [Music] why is he doing that gordon had that statue made in honor of thor and seeing as the world suffered absolutely abhors the fat dobber he was probably sick of looking at it but doesn't that hurt well he and thor have a bit of an unpleasant history between them no they will anyway i guess waking up to see it was worse than the thought of lumps of solid stone passing through his gullet you want me to ask him no our only concern is your name [Music] all right wish me luck [Music] i've still got it lads he remembers me [Music] [Music] no he knows the pain of your loss curious what is it to be concerned about what is he doing making sure we're headed in the right direction listen closely now we need two things to get us into the land of the giants first we need to learn the travel rune that opens realm travel to jottenheim second we need to carve that rune into the special gateway that one of the people we first met you correct except the giants in their infinite wisdom saw to it that no ordinary chisel would do the job only the tip of a magical chisel opens that gate luckily i know where it is and it's not far he looks kind of mad for a moment there now that he thought i said you were friends of odin you'll forgive me never spoken the ancient tongue sober wait look the water's dropped even further you can see more of the realm towers and statues i haven't seen new places to explore along the shore where is this chisel find me a boat and we'll go from there so so when we get to the boat we can either look for that special chisel now or go exploring for a little while i'm happy with whatever you want to do which way to the chisel keep rolling towards the statues of the oarsmen then thread pass between them ed you are full of stories when will you tell one that entertains i beg your pardon he just insulted you yeah i got that so you want a cook i'm do ya very well my brothers i'll tell you the story of brunia the brawler the real story there was a huge battle right he's shrine had him in the middle fighting off ace here a pretty story but no throwing the air you see was born with neither head nor heart so the giants had to complete him with stone they were strong to be sure but also a perfect simpleton odin met him wandering in midgard one day found him so amusing so harmless so gullible that he invites him back to his powers in asgard there he gets from near his fill of need and guards him into all manner of busts and antics all for the amusement of the court i was there i saw the acl laugh as rooney leapt upon his shield and swore he'd kill us all and take our womenfolk back to jottenheim then thor shows up and does he laugh oh no thor takes one look at the drunken stone buffoon and brings down the owner on his head so hard that he's got chunks of lumiere in his own skull to this day so startled by the face full of rock he doesn't notice from near's body topple right onto him with a sickening crunch and again the roars of laughter echo through the palace halls that's an awful story nothing like the one's mother told me let that be a lesson my son truth is seldom so pretty as myth enlightened should we dock on this beach you who walks among the living my beloved gulving calls to me she yearns for peace yet her remains lie in pieces i beg of you make my gulvig whole again you want us to collect your bones gross goldie's sader magic knows no bounds she can reunite you with those you've lost really how boy i can smell your grief child rest assured her magic is strong enough to create bridges between life and death if only for a short while boy we are leaving they've taken three of sweet gulvik's bones and spread them across the lake bring me her bones child gulvig will reward you good the special chisel is ahead past this gate okay here we go thank you oh this realm suffers without spirit father maybe we should look for those bones why didn't you hear him we could talk to mom again if we keep an eye out you wish boy i will not be distracted by this fool's errand this chisel we seek what is it i'm glad you asked actually i have just the story for you there was a giant once named a very giant giant who despite his mountainous size was without question the greatest stonemason this world have ever seen proud farmhour hoped to one day pass his vast knowledge onto his son a young dream through her at the heart of a warrior perhaps the father had too much fear in him son too little either way a quarrel of the air spiraled out of control and the overworked stone mason struck his son coming through a ran off into the night feeling shame and regret family of chased after his son but in his emotional state soon found himself wandering midgard lost and alone sadly he caught the eye of the one person who didn't want to meet alone that night so far from home and what happened next you'll see he crushed a charming place famed for worshiping the banner of god europe always took credit for planning that one the truth is the sweaty full bag just got lucky muscles up ahead uh we seek a chisel the tip of one yes a very very giant chisel [Music] oh neat trick lot thanks his idea what happened to the survivors oh thamur was a frost giant when he died his final breath froze everyone there he is find the tip of that chisel that's the magic we need enemies [Music] [Music] god oh nightmares i'm not ready [Music] this is the last one tell me [Music] when right here what does it say yes sir to new yord we offer back the sea's bounty ah yes it was believed that new york calmed the winds and seas for the fishermen they loved and washed them here oh that's i did it uh wow get over uh oh how we getting down there i have a plan you do do not act so surprised no offense brother i don't even think thor with mjolnir in hand could get through that much ice then thor is a fool this should be entertaining boy right here we go oh [Music] oh uh [Music] um [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh wow that was uh something that the fight here catch well that was a waste of a perfectly good how were you not seen there is nowhere here to hide oh that it's a little trick my people can pull a special way of not being seen you can be invisible more like i can step into the realm between rounds and your mind doesn't understand what it's seeing so it sees nothing at all that's how we avoid ever having to actually use the weapons we craft it uh it doesn't seem to work on dragons though your brother wanted to know if you're getting enough to eat i guess i could tell you what brock was asking about me there mead on his breath you let him touch this again come on then so that's how brock was in the temple right after the water he stepped between realms okay now shush i need complete silence for this there you go i'm feeling creative today and what do you have your eye on ah what shall it be anything you need young sir done and done i don't suppose you could try keeping that clean fine piece of work if i say so myself i think that's a keeper [Music] oh we can't forget you what did we miss happy to provide [Music] [Music] hey syndra we found something interesting oh really i love something interesting so this plan of yours can you guess it knowing you it doesn't involve standing around here correct but how do we move forward boy armor really liked jewelry didn't he he's invaded his beard with it i happen to think he looks dashing you know for a snow covered corpse careful my shop's right here we heading into that building yes i think there's something inside that'll help us break the ice and get to the chisel tip no i'll keep thinking focus up boys [Music] oh [Music] i'm not ready we are done here come here you knew this place before i came here on a diplomatic mission once trying to broker a piece between asgard and vanaheim i wore so many lives lost what i didn't know was thor had already gone on a killing spree of giants what do the giants have to do with the war between the gods nothing at all word that's the tragedy of it they took no side in that madness but odin's paranoia is surpassed only by thor's lust for blood huh uh huh uh huh hmm huh what now oh we got most of it hey well a stealthy planet is not now we must free the other strap we do ah why are we going up and what we need is all the way down there think well the chisel tip is under thick layers of ice so melting it won't work correct there weren't any shattered crystals nearby for me to shoot so that's not an option correct i just leave smashing the ice we need something ridiculously heavy to oh i get it now how are we going to turn the hammer so it lands near the chiseltooth not possible we cut it free write it down and figure out what comes next after say your plan involves a whole bunch of luck you are welcome to suggest a different one [Music] what now hold tight uh the plan seems ill advised that didn't work it only fell a little ways uh oh no the floors collapsed there's a sand bowl but how do we get to it we cannot boy what does it say when time itself is discerned the forward path is retrograde retrograde it's backwards those symbols the seasons yeah but the order's all jumbled shouldn't it be winter spring summer autumn why start with winter it's from a song mother used to sing don't i know that one winter quiet head doesn't like music either got it do it house house better no that wasn't right [ __ ] yes petraeus that word it means endure try it keep writing head how is this possible my guess temporal magic dangerous stuff the high vanier gods used to play around with the ability to freeze time happened to be a favorite of njord himself in fact used to why did they stop well turns out stop in time keeps the sun and moon from streaking across the sky unfortunately it does not stop the wolves that chase them always looking to sink their teeth in after that they decided it was best to leave time alone i can't get to the ball oh oh [Music] before the floor collapses oh [Music] run let's go energy sorry not ready i'm oh uh we're almost to the top father the ball dropped away jump you did well thanks the boy just having a little fun you big trump well there it is how are we going to get it free a push trust me ready dig in and push with everything yes sir how do we get down we jump really come do not panic yes right you know that good we should keep moving give the man credit he has a talent for destroying things remember that head never leaves my mind well if we find them i'll get the kid right here father not now uh uh those were the guys we saw with balder his nephews hi magni and moody the sons of thor mother always said the acer were the worst of gods and thor was the worst knees here i guess he's a terrible father too they are no longer children they have no excuse will syndra be okay they'll never even see him ah the great dining hall envy of all midgard funny i remember there being a massive candelabrum really livened up the place there oh yes you just can't help but break things can you with memory serve the yard spawn was just on the other side of that wall of ice i think you got it i think we can get through there [Music] children [Music] thank you there's no way to reach it ready anyways adequate oh huh something ahead see what he's fine thought it best to vanish when thor's idiot sons showed up hey sundry could you take a look at this honestly i don't have much else going on right now the travelers oh disgusting smelly covered in god knows how many little beasties but gorgeous armor let's see if i can't make something more sanitary yes once you retrieve the whetstone please take utmost care while handling it it is a priceless relic after all those men what do you know of them first they're not men they're gods well demi-gods anyway let's see thor's their dad different moms sordid story that one balder's their uncle odin dear old grandpa oh and a sister named weapons how do they fight oh of course magni's strong really strong carries a huge sword hardened by cyclonic thunder and modi i'd sooner lick a rat than shake that dung heap's hand his mason shields are just a cheap knock off of my elegant work on their dad's hammer best to follow my lead and avoid but who am i talking to uh yes yes come in and for you and we're back to you what a surprise i'm sure that'll come in handy well if you don't need it don't buy it i always say hey syndra have you met my mirror if you mean the severed head that keeps blinking at me please keep it away there is no possible way that's hygienic oh that's nice lovely to see you too sundry knob why is that a piece of my braided mistletoe arrow adorning your quiver strap oh a little momentum of your good pal syndry i'm so terribly touched [Music] [Music] will you focus i mean hurry brother we may get a piece of the chisel and be gone before they even notice boy surrender the old father demands it no [Music] good this fight is my boy go [Music] and where do you think you're going oh no brother the little freak's got a bow what are we gonna do i'll take them i can't remember the last time stay behind me boy why do you hunt us what does odin want no no no don't care come here shut those skinny yourself oh yes shut it out focus unbelievable you need oh trying [Music] gonna drag your carcass to it over here [Laughter] over here freaky stop it boy stay focused oh betrayal oh [Applause] [Applause] no [Music] how did you you have no idea you son of a [ __ ] sickness fever has returned no it hasn't roy the coffin the blood the boy's sick he needs flare no steady i'll be all right there you go a lot i'm fine see we should keep an eye on him enough should do with that we can carve the travel room to jottenheim get you where you need to go oh incidentally all those magically sealed doors we've seen can now be unlocked like that one round the corner you can get through that door there now that you've got the chisel uh [Music] you killed maggie that he did he was a god but you killed him mine are acr perhaps but i and his father's thor may not at all him this will not go over well in this yard i defended us nothing more i feel no judgment judgment no but if vengeance is any concern since when can you kill a god uh oh what did you go through [Music] once you retrieve the whetstone please take utmost care while handling it it is priceless after all but which way back what speaks to you anything you need young sir what did we miss now there is something else to tell you i don't think the lads doing too well if so then keep up hey i just realized magne didn't come back to life that is interesting it's known the acr find their own way to valhalla no valkyrie escort no processing at the gates of helheim that may be significant oh yes oh ugh [Music] [Music] look back into the giant's hand what what is this place fisherman would bring the day's catch into this port and use that contraption to send some of it directly to the yarl's main kitchen the rest were sorted and sold there is an exit under the thumb find a way across there's an opening i can get it there's a path to the exit on the other side there's a robot here i think that did it ugh hmm back under his palm we're almost there everything we just did climbed around a dead giant wrote a giant falling hammer fought some bad gods what do you think mother would say that you have come a long way thanks there's something over there [Music] here boy another one ah you know this one don't you it's tommy the giant stone base is he building a wall around you man it was to be his masterwork he only wanted to protect his people too bad the first part got burned i'd prefer the last panel was burned such a senseless pity this place it feels like like a prison that would explain the hefty magical lock on the outside but it's more than that i have this feeling like something is waiting for us down here you've a knack for ominous statements lad what kind of something i'm not sure something powerful whatever you feel boy we will handle it we have come this far yes yes father uh a valkyrie imprisoned she actually did it a valkyrie but i thought they were just spirits take caution lads a valkyrie in the flesh i can't think of a more formidable opponent she does not attack does she even know we're here [Music] wow come on [Music] huh uh [Music] jumping oh [Music] you have freed me from my corrupted form you have my eternal gratitude but my sisters remain trapped as i was take my helmet find them free them the fate of the valkyries rest on your shoulders [Music] the fate of the valkyries sounds pretty important that's putting it my opinion what do you know of them a fair question and yet not one easily answered i know more than most but much of their history has veiled in secrecy my own experience with the valkyries ends with my imprisonment you are avoiding the question ahead as i said brother it's complicated i don't know why or how they become such wretched creatures but perhaps if we can free more of them you want us to find more of those things the fate of the valkyries lad a more worthy endeavor there is not it will be dangerous well that hasn't stopped you before right that's the spirit what now then maybe freya hours have a look at the boy no i feel better now i just needed to catch my breath where do we go next well now that we've got the giant's chisel we need to learn the travel so we can carve it into that special gateway atop the peak an open realm travel to the land of the giants you don't know it i'll ask no but the serpent did mention that the giants had entrusted that secret to tear isn't here dead hi what is hidden bolt is very much in reach the doors are beneath his temple submerged in the lake for generations until our snake friend shifted his weight there we shall find the fabled black rune of yonheid oh there got another favor to ask you two what do you want dwarf i got another lead on my old pal on vari meet me at the lawn soother mines there's some fancy dancy loot in it for you another lead but we already found him well found his hand anyways i'll explain it the minds these ones is just south of the river pass now you two want something or you're just gonna stand there all gag scrapped and slack-jawed what'll it be pull the ring off on vari's hand at the vellunder mines fella was always tampering with souls and dark rituals and matters of the night just the see of his hammer flattening metal were enough to stoke my fires all blissful [ __ ] you better clear out before i get all frisky what more you need well next time [Music] follow me adress huh oh tears vault is behind that magical lock [Music] wow i can't believe we're setting foot in tears fault another one of these it's here but the middle panel is missing wait i thought here was a god not a giant ah but he was loved by everyone including the giants other than me he was the only one they gifted with their special sight hey i wonder if the giants left a triptych about me somewhere too go ahead actually come look let me show you how to read this that is not necessary taught me so much let me teach you something andreas come on you already speak it learning to read won't be that hard i know how to read boy just not this tongue you're halfway there already then okay so the rooms represent a lot of different things some gods some animals wait oh am i going too fast sorry not that you smell something yeah i do smells like rain you ruined everything i earned that [ __ ] hammer but now everyone's gonna think i only got it because maggie's gone no one's gonna laugh at me [Music] are you dumb that your father's doing or did you get it from your mum she's stupid and ugly shut up you don't know anything about my mother oh it's true but i'm gonna get to know you really well you're gonna be my new brother right after i finish killing your [ __ ] whoops mostly car broken stay back um this isn't over brother the boys [Music] you have to get into freya quickly there's no other way take the boat freya's isn't far so odin's eye is on you brother especially now that you've taken to killing his kin as forest is a blind spot for him this is our smartest move and if anyone can heal him it's hard what is happening to him i've seen it in mortals that some conflict of the mind expresses itself as an ailment of the body never in a god by god believing himself mortal i can only imagine we're almost there [Music] so somebody just called the serpent the fever burns hotter he is shaking it's serious we must hurry [Music] [Music] it is urgent i'm still a god go away the boy has followed you [Music] this is no ordinary illness the boy's true nature your true nature fights within him [Music] [Music] i did this to [Music] him will you help me [Music] of course there is a rare ingredient found only in helheim the keeper that protects the bridge of the damned i need its heart hell the realm of the dead do you know it note this one it is a land hum and yielding cold fires cannot burn there and no magic in all the nine realms can create a blaze as for the dead your frost axe will be useless you'll need to find something else [Music] then i must return home would stay buried who you were before it doesn't matter this boy is not your past he is your son and he needs his father [Music] this room opens the bridge to hell height when you are there do not under any circumstances cross the bridge of the dam there is no road back understand boy himalay you must hurry through my garden there's a path leading to my boat take it return home dig up your past do whatever you need to do just bring me back the bridge keeper's heart and your son may survive and last we spoke i was no you were right to distrust the word of a god no need to explain not to me not for that i will keep him safe the mother's promise helheim of all places you all right brother i will do what i must leave me be [Music] [Music] [Music] athena get out of my head [Music] [Applause] so [ __ ] [Applause] you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] there's no way you can hide spartan put as much distance between you and the truth as you want it changes nothing pretend to be everything you are not teacher husband father but there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape you cannot change you will always be a monster i know but i am your monster no longer [Music] [Music] all right brother let's see what those blades can do on your back huh now i believe i see a door to the realm between realms over there in your own front yard no less take the shortcut back to the realm travel temple then on to helheim yeah [Music] [Music] well i'm pretty sure you weren't talking to me back there anything you'd like to get off your chest brother i can assure you i'm unsurpassed in keeping confidences well you know where to find me and for the record i'd already guessed you were greek athena dead giveaway what hey eureka foreign magic sweet anna's nethers what are those i've never seen the like that's got to be a family heirloom no nor will it ever be son my brother and me created me all near for the big idiot i know from qualities and them them special where's the little turd he was full of needle no what happened he see her no the fault is mine and my responsibility to make it right now we all got to take responsibility sometime huh say what can i do to help i can do things when i should tag along no your work here is enough all right so where are you off to in such a hurry the realm of the dead hellheim [ __ ] this is serious i'll be keeping my eye on [Music] [Music] don't worry kids are tough when i was his age i cut my own head clean off and i'm not the worst for wear now that freya has given you the travel room to helheim it should be unlocked on the table so and it's done we really are doing this so i'll be watching your back let me take this moment to tell you that what you're about to do is absolutely insane not even odin can survive i hope those blades work is this the bridge freya spoke of no we're still in the realm travel bridge but after the bridge of the damned the dead use it to cross into their permanent home the city of helheim the bridge keeper reminds admission he's the one we want just follow this bridge should lead us straight to him you know i'd really hope never to see this place again oh use the fire of your blades to burn away that hell's bramble blocking the path one of the many reasons we went back for those blades [Applause] huh [Music] uh oh this is all wrong only the newly dead should be here there's too many the gate must be closed and if the gates close then it's true hells flop without the valkyrie to sort and kill them hell is overwhelmed god wow [Music] oh oh huh when we killed the reavers near my home they came here how did they return so quickly time doesn't move the same between all realms especially where the spirit world is concerned like the light of alpha the opposite in fact the lake of souls feels faster than i'll find time but hell is much slower than midgard sorry i'm sure that's confusing if we will be back to my son all the sooner that is good ah aren't you a quick study hmm yes hmm [Music] oh god only the one they did go there the warriors who die in glorious combat hell is for those who die in dishonor criminals hi and those dead of disease mishap age it is dishonorable to grow old well never too late to go out fighting i suppose will killing the bridge keeper help the dead lead midgard i don't expect it will though i don't suppose it will make things any worse either it'll be one less obstacle for the living to reach the inner sanctum of helheim who'd be mad enough to go there huh so the bridge of the damned and there's the keeper making sure the dead are really dead what is that he holds that totem contains a powerful source of magical energy the very power of helheim you want is his heart just take it and we can leave how start some trouble you can do that right okay okay [Music] hmm huh uh hmm good huh now the heart brother you'll have to get your hands danty oh [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] i have the heart i need nothing more you're saying try not to linger here though [Music] kratos so zeus [Music] my father your father was this well that explains a lot what is that place never go there understand how is he here that is not possible it's just an illusion hell's known for torturing its inhabitants with their own past we should focus on getting back to your son huh yeah shh they supposed to be here it's cold real quick give me your blades why yeah i said i'd help you and i aim to come on [Music] my equipment's in mid cars be right back yeah you don't suppose eat necklace do you yeah now they're ready for the winds of hell just target this magical goalie get here with your blades and throw now targets so you're welcome and i believe this place is cold enough to freeze a pair of pigeon eggs i sometimes wonder if there was once some sort of accident in his brain we have been away too long [Music] oh [Music] cool [Applause] sorry brother i'm still stuck in what i heard back there zeus was your father not now we should focus on getting out of hell and with that i cannot argue i'll just contemplate that little nugget in silence then huh [Applause] [Music] huh [Music] huh [Music] god [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh so wow [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hmm [Applause] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh uh ugh you made it better get home to your boy already say hi to the pimple clap for me when he's better we shouldn't delay brother it's straight back to midgard with that heart i finally understand i'm dangling from the hip of the bloody ghost of sparta do not call me that don't mistake me brother from what i have the pantheon had it coming it's still a bit to take in i knew you hate gods but you really can't stay away from them can you you must say nothing to the boy he must never know paul likes brother respectfully he has to know he'll never be whole without the truth look i get it you hate the gods all gods there's no accident that includes yourself and it includes your boy can you see that he feels that he can't help what he is can't begin to help it because you haven't even told him it's all connected man you will tell him nothing very well hey so you know that shortcut between realms well i made it better or i might have broke it we use that i know what you do so i took a few cuts from them winds of hell and made it so it ain't just one way now you can use it to travel to and from if i didn't breaks it then we can take it to freyja there's an idea brother well you gentlemen certainly know how to get around [Music] well this isn't right yeah but close enough he did say they were kinks we must hurry the heart you have it yes [Music] back of your hand [Music] he's too ill [Music] i can break the fever but to heal he must know the truth of what he is yes it is not so simple help me prop him up did i tell you that i have a son too it's been forever since i last saw him at his birth the runes foretold the needless death the babe in my arms was so small so helpless i knew right then i would do anything to protect him [Music] no matter the sacrifice of course everything i did i did for myself i let my needs my fears come before what he needed and i couldn't see his resentment until it was too late don't make the same mistake have faith in him i know the truth isn't simple but nothing is when it involves your child it is a curse the boy has been cursed don't live without me i will not [Music] i'm better now i see that is he well enough to travel for now it won't happen again i promise you see that it does not freya i will not forget this thanks your father did the heavy lifting you should stay recover you have done enough you know my door is always open to you that's venom isn't it you figured that out did you well the window looks like bifrost crystal and i know that's not what's on the other side of the wall and well it makes you sad you are wise for one so young yes this is a window to a home i left long ago but it is only a few the thing that happened to you an alphon you can't leave a guard can you a gift from my former husband upon our separation why would odin trap you in midgard petty cruelty would be reason enough for him but as with all his rash decisions he's driven by fear the van neyer were the greatest threat to the aesir until our marriage broke her to peace many of the vanier now think i betrayed them the fruits of my sacrifice to be hated by my own kind to trap me here is to ensure i can never make it right um someone was wondering why do you live under a turtle he was my first friend here in midgard he offered me shelter and in return i provide him with protection against the evils of the forest holden boar giant turtle you sure have some interesting friends now then before modi so rudely interrupted us we were just about to explore tears vault yes to find the black rune boy do you know the way from here oh i don't know sure you do lad we need a boat i don't know i guess we need a boat okay then uh [Applause] [ __ ] i didn't think anything could get through all that hell ramble huh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] yep so ah see the boat washed ashore someone did call a serpent earlier nope still kinked get in i will pull you are quiet are you not better i guess i know you overheard my talk with freya you think you understand but you do not why'd you say nothing you said i was cursed you think i'm weak because i'm not like you i know i was never what you wanted but after all this i thought maybe things were you different not know everything boy no but at least i know the truth now the truth the truth [Music] i'm a god boy from another land far from here when i came to these shores i chose to live as a man but the truth is i was born a god and so were you boy have you nothing to say um can i turn into an animal can you turn into an animal [Music] no [Music] no i do not think so oh my god mother knew she was a god too no she was mortal but she knew my true nature i'm a god why did you wait so long to tell me i had hoped to spare you being a god it can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy that is the curse what sorts of things can i do can i fly turn invisible i don't feel like god i do not know the reach of your godhood but over time you will learn you sure i can't turn into a wolf you are welcome to surprise me is this why i hear voices sometimes are you sure you've never heard any not as you do that's no surprise every god is unique so maybe i won't get strong like father but i'll have abilities on my own you already do lady your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young time alone will tell what else you'll become capable of so you knew all along i'd get loud but i've known more than my share of gods me too apparently i wonder who else knew i was a god pray it for sure moroccan sentry they do not need to know calder does he know is that why he's after us do you know him from before the day of your mother's funeral was the first i ever saw balder that is the truth hey we don't have to go right back to tears ball really i mean we're gone we can do whatever we want right what do you really feel like doing right now i will show you let's try this again without interruptions here we go again read it death itself i swallow to spring forth life tomorrow oh i like that one i wonder if i wrote it is that the answer there it says earth hmm swallows death brings forth life go yeah i wish i had known i was a god and alphon i wouldn't have felt so bad about killing somebody else well i'm not sure that's the lesson you've done nothing to regret the elves force their affairs upon us no i get it now we had god things today and they were on the way dragging us into their little problems again are we just leaving that there i mean just knowing we're gods makes me feel so much stronger maybe you feel a little too good right now with power comes a big choice lad you can either serve yourself or put your godhood in the service of others like tyr did people really loved him huh i the god of war but one who fought for peace had a reputation for being heroic and lawful using his power and knowledge to stop wars rather than start them so there are good gods once in a moon it's been known to happen yes this one mentions places i've never heard of seems tyr really liked to travel dear believed the mind not might was key to preventing war and chaos and he also knew visiting other cultures would give him perspective staying in one place could not while odin always hoarded knowledge guarding it jealously tyr was open and sharing with his learning and his wisdom for this mortals adored tyr showing their love by bringing him gifts the world over so whatever happened to dear odin came to regard him as a threat to his rule he suspected tyr of collaborating to aid the giants instead of helping to steal their secrets for the asia same thing he accused me of frankly though in tears case i believe he was right you think cheer was helping the giants i do he felt responsible for the suffering visited upon them by odin i suspect he had something to do with helping them cover their tracks they're missing your hometown correct whatever happened to it i believe it could only have been done with tyr and the giants working together [Music] [Music] where is this black wolf oh no i've never been in here the stone that has to be naturally i didn't think it would be that easy no it's kind of hoping though so what now rather a trap for the winds of hell but where do you think the winds are the ones of what oh we forgot to mention that when you were sick we went to hellhound to get your cure you did terrible experience by the by your dad picked up a new trick though with a little help from brock brock was there too i but we'll get back ah a skiing dew from my homeland used to have wonderful one back in the day you should take it boy yes boy take it we might need to butter bread somewhere in our travels this is why no one likes you move it or you may lose it brother well that's unfriendly look small passages on either side perfect for the boy it's too small for father though go i will be fine careful brother there's not here to bring you back oh [Music] wow look at that [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] what'd you find enough distraction do not forget why we are here okay [Music] that's from a great desert land very far from here the gods live there oh my yes many many gods good or bad not as simple as that i'm afraid uh exactly thank you three [Music] um [Music] [Music] what did you see in that vault that set you off it is not important it seemed important to you it was a rash impulse you need not dwell on my failings wow that was almost an apology well i guess you do like to smash pottery look i just want to know the truth now okay i don't care if it hurts me or not i want to learn just because you hate being a god doesn't mean i have to more small passages go i can't watch brother good luck and i thought those saws were scary look it's the wolf giants it's golden hottie that's right the bringers of day and night ragnarok begins when they catch the sun and moon right i don't know like them well enough to cover a massive wall in his vault with them though don't you enjoy it at all being a god on an adventure in some amazing place maybe your mother wanted us to have a little fun everything we've seen and done maybe it was her gift uh oh good keep it up it is over one of these perhaps this isn't about speed at all it's not someplace else the winds can go you know for someone so loved here sure was paranoid ah thanks to odin with good reason look there's the word ah clever huh boy get out of here i'm fine how do we get you up pull chains on the wall what there are three of them what do i do adrease focus you can do this please honey i don't know yet to [ __ ] drown okay thanks hockey's the silver one he hunts them skulls gold and he chases the sun foreign they have to eat them these are out of order good boy so the moon goes on the left side on the right with midgard in the middle but which bar do i pull middle bar the left the right boy in the middle the middle right yes that's something i love you boy you have to stop that chain ow i i do not know [Music] wait i know what to do [Music] [Music] a knife i know but it saved you that was cunning boy the raid's free i think we did it all right let's go see what tears got for us oh no raised protection it rubbed off what should we do we keep going there it is we've got it boy on the day you were born i made two knives mixing metals from my home and from this land one for myself and when you were ready one for you today is that day so i'm a man like you no we are not men we are more than that the responsibility is far greater and you must be better than me understand say it or you will be better the power of this weapon any weapon comes from here but only when tempered by this earth discipline the self-control of the one who wields it that is where the true strength of a warrior lies you must never forget good then come on blank wait the roon did you see it yes are you certain i got it trust me good day aim for the face let's go goodbye [Music] uh [Music] i'm not ready ready father she was big but no match for us gods yeah i'm turned around which way is the sandball back up hmm room huh uh god oh we're so close to the end sit living wine the island of alumnus near the place of my birth lamb knows do a journey's end really smells like rotten eggs is it still good possibly um ugh father why did you leave your home and come here does it have to do with the other gods there it's just you hate the gods so much but tear proves that gods can be good and you're good you only killed those deserving right [Music] yes ah but who's worthy enough to judge quiet head we are we know better ah sounding more like your da by the moment ready ready [Music] boom i think i'm gonna like being a god [Music] we do what we want and now we're gonna go see the giants hi having learned that travel room to youtube we can now head back to the gateway on top of the peak and put that magic chisel to good use nobody's getting our way this time come on hey look who's back up and about didn't i tell you it'd be fine bring those back soon i got plans son let me be shorty i'm sure you'll grow into it what else something for the boy you hitting the road or chewing the fat look don't be mad but i've seen those blades of yours before they were under the house when i was hiding is that why you never let me down there where'd they come from they are my burden from a life that is behind me well they're in my life too and i'd like to hear that story those days are dead to relive them is needless how can i be needless if it's the truth one day you will understand i'll take your word for it so odin wants to go where he can't reach are you saying he's trying to get to your name too hi it ranks among his foremost obsessions but that doesn't make any sense oh when did i stop making sense you're saying baldr tracked us down to find the way to yoda but that was before we knew yodenheim is where we needed to go that's crazy except for one thing you are headed for your night so he was right i'm so confused well then clearly you've been listening petraeus to me okay there sure is a lot to see here wow [Music] uh where to next her we have to save her think before you act are we prepared to face such a powerful foe i'm ready if you are i see him here if that counts for anything not ready oh [Music] uh my my god [Music] [Applause] oh gonna be all right [Music] thank you for releasing my physical form i have only gratitude why are you trapped i am uncertain my mind still fragmented [Music] it is the last thing i remember the what valhalla awaits i must return [Music] [Music] [Music] it's a council chamber of sorts hidden away in midgard the valkyries would often need a place to confer outside of odin's prying eyes they thought themselves properly concealed but the all father sees all so the saying goes where is it we weren't far from it on our way to plummer's chisel the entrance is to the left of the two oarsmen statues you failed to mention this at the time didn't think we'd be hunting down valkyries at the time brother think we'll find out why the valkyries are like this that chamber held a special significance for them we'll find something there i'm certain of it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh okay tell me again how old knew we were going to yoda9 before we did odin is extremely clever you see nearly as clever as he thinks he is and he's a collector of prophecies if it's about the future he adds it to his collection helps him style himself as all-seeing and all-knowing but of course the idea is control control of the future control of his fate he'd control every realm of every land in every world if he could every potential pocket of resistance he seeks to eliminate even if you've never posed a threat before he may think one day you might so you see it's not important how he knew before you did it's important that he was right whoa what's got you all bum-fuzzled over there get going oh almost forgot brock this is our new friend mimir we've met oh why didn't you say so he knows why i know why you know why wyatt no more of this know what i'm sorry i brought it up can't you and cindy just patch things up whatever happened couldn't be all that bad your family now don't be lecturing me about family ain't the one what forgot what her name stood for what we made the weapons we made were legendary across nine realms for more years than i can count you just don't throw that away on account of one bed one bad what you're one bad nothing ain't you got somewhere to be come on in then so much for peace and quiet you hitting the road or chewing the fat oh so i'm gonna tell syndra i'm a god i'm glad to see the look on his face no i may have kept your secret too long but now you will keep our secret huh i still can't read these [Music] [Music] my god right behind you what's the poison [Music] [Applause] aah why should we hide what we are secrets are on his way shouldn't we be open like here tia kept secrets too for good reasons to protect people it is wiser to be discreet that doesn't mean you should lie to your friends or your family i'm sure sundry would understand and do the same lad don't fret so what excited to finally see the land of the giants yeah but also sad the journey is almost over oh what if we get to odenheim and there aren't any giants there either makes a little difference to us fulfilling your mother's wish is what is important ah oh don't go anywhere be with you in two shakes father can i tell him no tell me what did you put this wheel in your mouth oh god i'll vomit i'm not kidding i'll throw up on it it is nothing a family matter oh oh i can tell you a thing or two about family matters let me guess your brother isn't as talented as you and his work is junk um those things are accurate your point it's all you ever talk about over and over do something about it or shut up i see yeah we're sick of hearing about little people's little problems um all right that hurt a little let's have a look at your gear then can't guarantee you'll like my work today [Music] [Music] oh hmm they thought that was gonna stop us okay which way up woof broken again you know i'm starting to question cinder's skill maybe brock was right all along oh [Music] huh why did you speak to the dwarf like that aren't you sick of hearing about him and his brother of course but it serves nothing to make an enemy of him he should know the truth even if it hurts it was needless and unkind truth is more important than kindness your mother would disagree she wasn't a god foreign why don't you let me carry her up from here no no you're almost there you know i can handle it can you after the way you spoke of her i questioned that she wasn't a god she was better than a god you shall not dishonor her fine care yourself [Music] look uh i mean he knew all along that we were gods i come up with a story about odin trying to follow us to your mind before we get there isn't it a lot simpler if they want us dead because we're gods and they think we're a threat i suppose we can't rule attack but odin's ways are subtle his purposes are [Applause] ugh [Applause] is nice draw uh you and mother always said all gods were evil but we're not peter wasn't praying neither the acer gods that's who's evil and you know what odin's right we are a threat because we know what they are and we know we can beat them well not all of them not yet magni did his worst he's dead they're no better than us and they're gonna be sorry they picked this fight blame me me for what you did to magnet my old father called me a cop [Music] looks like he did more than that move it world pick up where he left off i'll kill you no he's beaten not worth killing he should pay for what he said about mother i said no but we're gods we can do whatever we want [Laughter] that's what i said to your mother right before i gave it to her what are you doing this is a much better knife than mothers you killed against my wishes you lost control haven't you been teaching me to kill i've been teaching you to survive we are gods boy and that makes us a target from now until the end of days you are marked so i teach you to kill yes but in defense of yourself never has an indulgence nobody cared about him anyways what's the difference there are consequences to killing a god why how do you know how do you know watch your tone boy whatever uh keep your wits about you boy if modi found us balder cannot i be a few words for him too no you do not you will leave him to me so you can kill him because that's what we do to our enemies right because he'd do the same to us i will do only what is necessary and i'll help now stop to hello oh yeah this room we need a new way up have you forgotten your training oh are you talking to me i thought you didn't like my tongue ugh so wow i can't learn if you won't teach me you do not heed my lessons i've done everything you asked and all i wanted was the truth where did you get your fireballs why did you hide them you said there are consequences to killing the god you use the blades to kill one who else did you kill before maggie how many do you hear me i heard you and these are not subjects for discussion do not push me boy fine come here guess what i know everything i need to know now i have nothing else to learn oh congratulations oh boy yes whatever oh wow [Music] hmm [Music] what does this say it says don't wake him whatever we've killed everything else in this mountain who else wants a taste oh uh see what you get huh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] huh [Music] [Music] cool [Music] brothers be warned the tunnels i'm seeing in the walls up here show signs of recent dragon activity we already killed that dragon ah don't do that look here whatever [Music] whatever come on this will be easy not yet there we go good oh oh whatever so good [Music] foreign [Music] whatever [Music] huh guess i'll stop what i'm busy with now can't guarantee you'll like my work today it's almost like having a thick skin good advice i'm glad my expensive tools and stuff can help oh i'm glad i'm still useful to you it's almost like having a thick skin your arm is strong good advice uh oh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] ugh nope come on youtube the silence is getting unnerving don't worry about it we're focusing uh hmm nearly there now finally boy rooney carve along that [Music] wow yo 9. we made it [Music] beautiful isn't it well i remember once bubba looker miss me get off him turns out the boys no you broke the gate that was the only way to unite stupid [ __ ] [Music] get out of here boy yes by all means junior run away let daddy do all the heavy lifting for you

[Music] oh you know when to give up [Music] from my son what you won't stop me [Music] i will break you [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] who's activated the bridge hey i asked you a question it's locked in and when the bridge opens the full world of ascot will come crashing down on you it's over is it sophia [Applause] no listen to me let me out let go of it now or i will kill him you know i will what did you do [Music] boy i'm here stay still you will listen to me and not speak a word i am your father and you boy are not yourself you are too quick to temper you are rash insubordinate and out of control this will not stand you will honor your mother and abandon this path you have chosen it is not too late this discussion is far from over we are here because of you boy never forget that wow it's cold this is hell not just hell worst place in hell you could have put us i see a ship get us there it only takes us halfway to tears temple but at least it gets us far from here for a thousand mortal lifetimes the bridge keeper kept the living out of this place but now that you've ripped his heart out here we are funny how it all comes around you should pay for what he said boy that wasn't me right ah come on [Music] boy that's what i said to your mother right before i gave it to her it wasn't me i couldn't have done that do not dwell on those thoughts not here we must keep moving yeah [Music] hey what was that not just the old and sick come to helheim so do the criminals hell must not draw a distinction between us and those whom these visions are meant to torture how do we stop it escape hell as soon as possible i'm not gonna let it bother me like you said ramir it was just an illusion i wasn't there no but it is who you have become a plate i know i got us into it but i'll get us out i will get us out you will follow orders but maybe that's not who i am it had better be now let me focus let me think uh god so ugh [Music] hmm no i can't taste i can't smell i can't even feel the temperature of this room [Music] feasting drinking women it's all god you've never got to feel pain again death has no power over you now you would rather die i would rather die yes take it away i can't please please please take it away it doesn't work like that trust me in time come on [Music] i can't fix [Music] come on [Music] ciao i never see you again never what you did to me what you did to me freya is his mother why did you keep this from us head would you believe it slipped my mind i would not uh i'm at a loss ah sure you have no reason to keep such a thing a secret there's the boat we will speak more of this uh uh [Music] such chaos i will have much to do after i we killed hurry oh huh ah robots uh not entirely sure give me space to work you have done enough the stairs just bear in mind this boat can only take us part of the way tears temple is near the top of a tremendous waterfall which sadly we are downstream that means even if we get there intact we'd still need to sail up a waterfall somehow the vineyard built the greatest ship that ever was and it can fly yeah because it was designed to fly this was not nevertheless this is the boat we have and perhaps the biggest iceberg i've ever seen at least the fire's making heat what now i'm trying not to be impatient let your father now the sails are think just watch but how they gonna catch the wind we're floating the heat from the fire we're actually floating and we're stuck again not for long stay with a boat i can't believe it you just made a huge skylander our ships lodged on this bridge sure i can't help i said stay on the boat staying on the boat this dude's stuck on this bridge over here huh oh wait for me there oh [Music] we need to talk brother you do realize it's over don't you even if we make it back to midgard you and balder destroyed the only gate to yottenheim we are out of options and that boy up there nine kinds of pain his head's turned so far around andreas is not your concern well you might become everyone's concern if you don't do something you don't have to be the smartest man in the world to see that petraeus i can help together now we did it we're free we are going to get out of here face me father it is time to end this here's my son it is time no it's that voice again do you know who that is i do not know hold on uh uh they're putting out the fireworks [Music] i will free up [Music] oh [Music] head how long before we reach the temple yeah it's freezing as long as we maintain this speed and those fires don't go out we should be there in no time lad oh uh god uh we're gonna hit that bridge okay yes uh [Music] uh i'm not ready great or those blades [Music] wow yeah uh start again we need to lose that hot glue hmm it is time my son look around at what you have done [Music] [Music] uh come on we gotta go you saw there's no time i have a plan jump [Music] [Music] that was your plan you're both tracked we are leaving this realm now as long as we didn't wrap our way back i think this is where odin brought all his best clues about yodenhan uh what is this place this is odin's i'd recognize his atrocious taste anywhere look at that it's the missing panel about here [Music] only must have stolen but he always has his reasons might i have a look [Music] well this is most unexpected why what does it mean having the foggiest isn't that unexpected good look clearly that's tear traveling somehow perhaps magically but what's that to do with the giants that they should avoid a shrine to it i'm afraid that is none too clear what are those rooms in the corners not ruins symbols from different lands they mean or i how do you this one i know too well oh his eyes they are jewels like yours no doubt signifying the gift of sight the giants granted us give me a closer look [Music] interesting [Music] really interesting what is that secret plans concealed by tears so none could access by him and those few others the giants trusted and right under odin's nose i did promise i'll get you to jungheim what do you mean head you said we were out of options don't you see brother odin never gave up hope and neither should we he knew there was a clue in here but we are the ones who found it these plans are for a key to some chamber tears kept hidden i don't know where it's leading or what we'll find but it's a path how do we make this key i suggest we ask a dwarf that symbol on the temple door it's a bunch of rooms together peace unity hope other things too tears on design he made this door himself boy before when you saw i didn't see anything you did not see me with someone an old man what old man can we go yes very well all right let's get back to midgard and see about making that key where's that dwarf now head why did you not tell us balder is the son of freya he is it's shocking every time i hear it and yet obviously i know it when i think about boulder and fear the mayor yes lad freya how's that brother hey tell me baldur's vulnerability balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical wait what is happening he is bewitched not to speak of what he knows i am i am oh that's it precisely i wonder how long that's been so since she had my head at her mercy but back when i figured out baldur's weakness from here guess what you just said you figured out baldr's weakness did i but balder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical enough this means there is a way if he troubles us again we will find it can you make it is it a weapon armor or likewise an instrument of war of which i'm a master chapin no then forget it even if i wanted to make such an insignificant google i'm liable to cheat my tools working on something so delicate and ladylike then shingle it pattern weld the item with scaps like keep the layers thin alternate the overlay okay smart guy and where do you propose to find a lump of quality scalp slag last time i saw one i could still get ridgid down south shut your mouth is that where did you i had to get my hands dirty [Laughter] well don't just stand there let's do this what you you're fine with working on something that's not a weapon oh hell why not what i can grow too oh what watch the spine keep your wrists loose don't you keep your wrist loose yeah i need more heat here coming up you're gonna temper that steel longer you don't need to i triple quenched it with drago see how inventive and sanitary you clever little beaver never too late to learn a new trick is it no it's not yeah here it is nope don't forget this no quit your grinning it's downright unsettling it's just nice to see you together but now the ruin on your brand looks different impressive reforging something what broke i knew it you two love each other i'll cut it out princess you're gonna get me all wheat i like the new one better don't you we have work to do [Music] no what's got you all bum bum-fuzzled over there get going something else we can do for you no just glad you guys worked it out ah well i could say the same to you i guess i was getting a bit full of myself told him what he needed to hear how's it sounds to me just the same i'm sorry for how i spoke to you sendri you forgive me already have like you said it all worked out now let us get back to work before i get sentimental so what'd you find there [Music] i got plans [Music] [Music] now we just need to figure out what door this key opens it has to be somewhere around the temple tears roon this is it we're inside but what is this place your guess is as good as mine brother the tree we're underneath the realm travel room but why is the floor on the ceiling those realm doors seem to mirror the ones above up there deer use the same magic to protect the black rune the clue we seek may be inside huh right next to the odin door interesting but can we reach it not from here what's behind there well one in our sanctum within another those stabilisers looks like more giant whatever tier did for them must have been big whoa who are they boy this is the room for you tonight that's right and look we're on the other side of the door the upside down door what are you thinking stand back okay it's moving what's moving extraordinary the whole room is built on some kind of axle there's chains on both sides without those we can flip the temple what now oh things are happening [Music] okay i don't think they're attacking boy on the statues [Music] are you quite sure flipping the temple is the only way to reach them whatever it is you said there would be a path the temple can be flipped therefore we've put the temple the logic is understood not sure what happens when we recklessly append a room that's rooted to eight other realms i'm curious of course but it's a leap to imagine it gets us to your night i don't mind a lead well who knows perhaps you and dear are the same kind of mad an army of statues i don't think they're the kind that come to life if that's what you're worried about dear often said that in the world of pc envisioned the only soldiers in need would be statues bless his heart but the bugger did take himself rather seriously didn't he there where the chains meet we must find a way around another one here it says his name is burgom i think mother said he was the king of the giants i that he was and quite a bit more looks like he had a lot of kids that little brother is what we call an understatement he's dead but nobody killed him do giants die from old age they may though it's rare among the legends again with the death traps i'd have thought brother why don't you let the lad carry me for a while and let you miss this no you're enjoying this aren't you good [Applause] time to do what you do brother until gods grow good no they're just waiting for us uh behind okay i'm not ready wow yeah that was tough uh [Music] [Music] here we go go come the other chain waits ah it's the other kind variety is so important oh [Music] i truly i can't believe we're so close i for one never doubted right leave them in peace obviously not referring to us no [Music] uh oh on your side hmm [Music] [Music] almost there oh boy yes sir time to flip the temple yes sir just agreed to stop saying what's the temple it's starting to sound normal brothers i know what i promised but in case this doesn't work just remember tyr had good cause to create these obstacles he's kept jottenheim out of odin's reach but the world is hardly at peace no but it's got hope we're all working together now we have unity that's what the rune on the door to this place was telling us we're on tears lift with your legs brother he knows just trying to be helpful [Music] standing on the day that brute force is the answer i'll be quite happy to be on your side brother and we're not dead that's a plot see that mimir nobody could do all this alone all these obstacles they're just chances to prove are the ones who can beat them we may argue me and father you and freya brock and syndry but when we all work together we do make a good team and that's tears test that's why we're going to make it deodorant do you hear that brother lads found his equilibrium what's that mean it means you speak wisely atreus and that is good to hear i guess the temple was made to be flipped look the tree's upside down or are we i'm not sure anymore boy your knife well what have we got some sort of travel stone let me see great outdoor lazarus that's the unity stone you know it i wasn't sure it existed if tyr possessed this that explains how he could visit all the realms and other lands to boot he held this in the panel at owens library yes yes that's it i understand now it shows tyr walking the realm between realms you know how you must never stray from the path well tear always followed his own path if you catch my meaning the realm between realms so you're saying kirsten show them stepping off the branch of the world and you're thinking to reach the secret path to your non that's what we need to do i am oh dear that is what you're thinking isn't it what's got you all bum fuzzled over there get going sure i'm open yeah boy now we'll shoot something in the face for you anything else for you well see you next time you need something [Music] [Music] oh if you're thinking about hurling us all into the void i hope you're quite sure wasn't your idea find our own path right bollocks this is where tears stepped beyond and the unity stone protected him ready ready well if this is it lads it's been an honor our faith head this is incredible oh how can i be so nauseous without a stomach come on that was great look the tower i knew there was something down here amazing how do you hide something that exists in all realms cast it out of any realm to the space between clever old tear is jodenheim on the other side can't be that it's not like you go through vanaheim to reach the midgard peak but how do we use it i'd suggest we look inside but stay alert tears little challenges are never as simple as they appear i have noticed well this is sparse the pedestal oh no it took the stone tower it's absorbing the stones energy something's happening is it moving it's moving it knows what to do the stone served its purpose we're fulfilling to your spell what happens now no idea brother but after that fall i'm sure we're past the worst of it smells like oh no this is considerably worse not a fan hmm oh wow that's over right side wow [Music] right uh that was tough where do you think it's taking us next i do not know oh no we're back in hell oh dear here they come [ __ ] this up boys surely that's enough of that [Music] this won't be good [Music] okay uh is wow i think it's over hi but where are we [Music] look we're back in midgar there's the bridge we did it the tower's back where it belongs now tears travel room can take us to yotenheim how did you do this odin suspected the giants secretly possessed some remnant of primordial utena creative essence the stuff all realms are made of the unity stone must have been fashioned from that essence to trust an outsider with an even tear tells you just how desperate they were and look now we can finally light all the braziers and see what happens another name another valkyrie that's no coincidence but who'd have etched them on tears braziers uh huh you fellas sure love to make a racquet don't you i don't know what we'll find when we get to your nine but we must cover our tracks odin's ravens will tell him of the towers restoration and we mustn't let our efforts be to his benefit very well so this is it here we go hold on wait a minute this isn't going to work what there's no travel crystal here must have used his own eyes to refract the energy it was his final fail say i've got and i won oh didn't what don't mother i precisely to keep me from traveling sorry lads thought that would work what did odin do with your other eye you'd have kept it in any of a hundred places i'm afraid we've come so far there has to be a way look bit of a long shot but for years i've seen syndra sometimes brought looking around in that mountain when odin came for his visits maybe they know something rocket's injury hey guys question for you anyone know where we can find my mirror's other eye oh yeah that's yeah i'm sorry as a matter of fact odin asked me to hold he wanted me to build a hulk he showed it to me you see and i oh decline sorry will you excuse me well that was useless you know it was about that same time that odin came around looking for me to build a statue with some sort of hidden compartment now that not being a weapon in the acer being a bunch of box speckled cockers i too saw fit to decline but i know we got it built just the same oh what was the statue i said one of thor out there flashing his sack to the lake the statue that the serpent ate sorry about that feeling much better how are we supposed to look inside the snake inside oh we better go see what the world serpent has to say about that well lads i don't know what lies ahead but now would be a good time to make sure your gear is ready for the bust what's more to the horn wow ready [Music] too far is the statue lost to us ah he thinks it might still be in his stomach um and he's open to letting you go into his mouth to look inside ew really by the by he's no wild about it either so are we really doing this letting the serpent swallow us you do not have to come well i'm not gonna miss this oh you sure this is a good idea no well brothers i've been to many strange places but this will be a new one yeah i've never been in this guy's belly either how about you father never one that was not trying to eat me usually should expect that sort of response at this point here we go funny i used to dream about getting eaten dreams are nothing i'm not afraid it just reminded me of a way i used to feel when i was a child let's find that statue ah smells not as bad as i thought it'd be bit like heather ale fermenting rather pleasant actually you're so weird the water kind of burns in here that is water isn't it hi there the hammer hey yeah over there any idea where odin hid your eye no it's not like i can still see through it yep that's an eye maybe you should stick that in my head for safekeeping gently now gently thank you brother you don't miss depth until it's gone uh [Music] how's that feeling well i wouldn't say i'm feeling whole again but it's a right improvement the by frost is intact then we have all we need finally we're going to unite there's no stopping us now laddie have you ever had the town tempting feet so how do we get back out what's going on well that was mildly terrifying maybe our presence is upsetting jorman gander's belly no something is wrong what's happening nothing good glad that's over is he getting it what is that we must hurry couldn't agree more brother hold tight and watch your balance the board shifting i'm getting [Music] so boy boy i'm good i'm getting kind of used to this what happened to him something we did no something else a dead giant why would the serpent leave us here look freya we can still trust her right until we know for certain keep a distance the world serpent what's happened here we hoped you would know you are far from home i'm looking for my son the two of you you helped me see things more clearly you do not know where he is then no but the woods and fields speak his name i know he walks here in midgard when you see him lost long ago before you were even born why are you standing so far from me what's wrong something's happened there [Music] i had a feeling hurting the big snake would bring the two of you out in the open do you have any idea any idea at all what you have cost me my boy mother [Music] i'm here don't run away oh i'm not going anywhere mother i know that you're still angry i know that how you feel hasn't changed but i i want you how i feel how i feel [Music] i've spent the last 100 years dreaming of this moment i rehearsed everything i ever wanted to say to you every word to make you understand exactly what you stole from me but now i realize i don't need you to understand anything i don't need you at all back off kratos this has nothing to do this path you walk vengeance you will find no peace i know you i'll deal with you later but family first [Music] this again stop fighting oh you might want to turn away boy this won't be pretty i won't let you hurt him no boy fine stop no betray us you're bleeding please boy breathe not my blood what is that i can feel this i can feel everything [Music] he's vulnerable now you will not do this what's going on is freya trying to kill us no do you hear the wind we are moving that arrow punch the mistletoe in the quiver strap yes mistletoe harmed him freya said it was wicked he's more than harmed the spell is broken he can be killed i'm certain of it it's all coming back now now he remembers she controlling that thing stay out of it i can reason with him no woman you cannot he needs to kill you you can't stop me no one can where is he i don't care if he kills me i will protect him i will not let him die i'll touch it this will all be over soon you will stop this now ah i feel i feel crazy i'm burning my boys [Music] weak mother [Music] [Music] [Music] up [Music] boy crystal dress a dress i'm doing wonderful i've never felt so alive incredible [Music] ah more more so many more i'll kill you [Music] all right stay away from my son you don't have to do this there stop him [Music] there has been enough pain shut up [Music] [Music] [Music] before you die i want to thank you both of you you've done what even the all father himself could not i've never felt more alive ironic isn't it [Music] me [Music] go uh uh [Music] look i have an idea why well done boy [Music] you will not come to us again you will not touch her i don't need your protection [Music] oh [Music] no matter what what i do or say you it won't stop interfe fury in my life i was just trying to protect you i've made mistakes i know but you're free now you have what you want try to find forgiveness we can build something new [Music] you still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me i have paid i have paid but if that alone will make you whole [Music] if seeing me dead will make things right i won't stop you [Music] in mill [Music] what no father [Music] [Music] why do you even care you could have walked away the psychologist here must be better than this [Music] [Applause] [Music] no no no no no my boy my dear sweet boy [Music] freya he chose this i will rain down every agony every violation imaginable upon you i will parade your cold body from every corner of every realm and feed your soul to the vilest filth in hell that is my promise he saved your life he robbed me of everything everything you are just an animal passing on your cruelty and rage you will never change and you do not know me i know enough does he [Music] boy listen close i'm from a land called sparta i made a deal with the god that cost me my soul i killed many who were deserving and many who were not [Music] i killed my father that was your father in hell is this what it is to be a god is this that it always ends sons killing their mothers their fathers no we will be the gods we choose to be not those who have been who i was is not who you be we must be better [Music] well guess we are the bad guys now in her eyes yes but she could never make that choice we should finish this journey while i still have strength i don't understand i know saving her was the right thing she seemed all evil at the end not evil you killed her son lad her son the death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily but he was gonna kill her she would have died to see him live only a parrot can understand so you'd let me kill you if it meant you would live yes look there was no easy choice for anybody brother but i think we can all agree you did the right thing the world's a better place with freya in it just give her time lads she'll come around back to tears temple then one last time hi yachtenheim awaits odin must have convinced him that following you to yacht 9 would bring his cure lies i'm sure why did mistletoe break the spell bunny of magic is powerful but its rules are slippery and elusive i'm sure it makes sense if you're a witch oh but it's also bloody tragic balder was the greatest gift odin granted freya the one thing she treasured from their marriage she only hoped to spare him pain and spare herself loss but such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions what's got you all bum-fuzzled over there get going here we go i can't believe we're gonna see the giants things work according to the plan go ahead and lock in yachting and we'll be on our way probably boy ahead get ready oh right got it let's hope this doesn't cause you to explode or anything oh i haven't considered that maybe we should talk about this a bit more nah i'm sure you'll be fine ready that's unpleasant now boy we must be close well what are we waiting for think it's far we will see i want please before we continue listen the last thing you two need up there's a decomposing heat ruin in the moment but i'll wait for you here this is between you and the boy true but if someone wants to fight my lady sips soft perfect slushers you done did it sorry we had to see this oh no no no no no no no fine damn it fine watch the head till we return i can do this no no i can't oh okay ready come [Music] so look we're on the giants fingers i can see the highest peak ahead right over there we did it [Music] we did [Music] what are you doing [Music] i have nothing more to hide [Music] can we go now we're so close boy [Music] [Music] carry her [Music] hmm boy it's nothing i just thought i'd hear voices by now hello anybody here what is this place they must have all come through here when they left midgard what was left of them why carve all these faces what if this is all the giants that got out of midgard alive not really many at all odin and thor ruining everything for everybody where are they now the giants came back home so they could survive but i'm not sure they did huh who's the guardian i should feel them but i don't this place is dead what happened though why'd mom send us here one question is answered and two more tickets place wait father something's happening [Music] it's your axe it's mueller look she's arguing with a bunch of giants she new giants [Music] that's us the first time we met the world serpent but how [Music] and our fight was balder but that just happened wait they knew everything that was going to happen [Music] the dragon in the mountain the stone mason all these drawings this is our story no this is your story but what does it all mean that i was not the only parent with secrets you didn't know [Music] she was a giant i'm a giant [Music] why didn't you tell us she sent us here knowing we would find this but why not just tell us the truth mother would have had good reasons walder was never set to find me he was tracking her all along not knowing she was only ashes if she had a plan for us i trusted whatever it is besides [Music] she hasn't been wrong yet come on we're so close to the end now yes yes we are [Music] look it's mother's she was here she saw every step we took before we took it like she was always with us watching over us leading us home let's finish it what's up [Music] father no we do it together son in a minute [Music] why [Music] goodbye fan i love you the giants they really are all gone there's nothing for us here come so i get that mother was a giant which makes me part giant and parkour and foreign right i guess there's just one thing i don't understand my name on the wall the giants called me loki loki what's the name your mother wanted for you when you were born she must have called you that to her people but why the question for another day let us go home [Music] [Music] i guess it all makes sense though why she want to end up here he was very kind but did she know it was gonna be like this here is this what she wanted us to see did she want us to tell the people or keep it a secret i do not know so what should we do i trust you to decide that oh so why do you want to name me atreyus i know it can't be for a god no he was a soldier a spartan a great warrior all spartans are great warriors we trained from birth our lies were discipline duty battle and death life was grim and we greeted it grimly but atreus of sparta was unlike the rest of us he was smile even in the worst of times he was happy he inspired us to hope that though we were machines of war yet there was humanity in us goodness when the day came for him to lay down his life in battle his sacrifice saved countless others and turned the tide in our favor i carried him home on his shield and buried him with all the honors of spartan custom his memory was a comfort in dark times wow you actually told a good story oh you missed it [Music] i understand if you want to go home but i bet there are still some corrupt developers out there that can be set free some other help people maybe helping people as part of our mom sent us out here too i mean older [Music] huh that's a weird name i'm glad we went with yours last am i glad to see you i believe i've reached my limit for dwarven charm what happened they took an uncomfortable number of measurements and then proceeded to bicker about the weather where do you want us to take you how about the warm confines of anywhere bloody else before we return to midgard i should warn you more time has passed than you life to realize the snowfall it began when you slew bowled up it's become something else for the coming of winter not just any winter a great winter to span three summers and when it's done begins ragnarok from snow ah snow lots more snow and then the end of the bloody world in that approximate order another prophecy no brother prophecy doesn't expect this for 100 more winters at least you've changed something prophecy didn't count on you i'm telling you it's thimbleween i can feel it in my stroke this is the big one stop saying that oh you're making me very nervous it was bound to snow sooner or later that ain't just snow when you know it it's the end times how dare you make me the voice of rose guys just discussing the weather bit of a hold snap lately what he means is thimble winter's upon us boys the winner to end all winners i can feel it in my screw yeah we heard so if you're heading home try to keep moving and also to not die or if you're not heading home same advice oh man the tower ate the unity stone didn't it i wanted to fly again yes that's a terrible pity amir what else did the serpent tell you when you spoke kinda sounded important i'm sure it's nothing he just said the boy seemed familiar to him that's impossible don't i quite agree unless perhaps he refers to something yet to be it is said that when yerman gander and thor battle at ragnarok their clash so violently shakes the tree of life that it splinters casting the serpent backward through time even before his own birth what that is madness well i did say not to concern yourself we're finally home feels like a lifetime ago but drafty maybe it's a right improvement over having tree bark in your target time to rest i'm gonna sleep through winter okay this'll do sleep way ahead of you the ball who are you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] betray us are you ready yeah but i had the weirdest dream family winter was ending and thor came for us here at the house it was only a dream but it felt different it felt real it felt like the future then we will worry about it tomorrow today there are still things we can do come [Music] [Music] foreign
