how's it going on I'm good but listen I need to show you something over there on the table recognize him yeah his name is Victor cost he's old school black ops my guess is he's here with the CIA well if he's a mole then you might be able to help us from what I can tell his location is somewhere near the channels you might want to start by looking there all right I'll head over and see what I can dig up this was a good find glad I can help even if I am all dinged up you got a plan for that will you just ship out a lot well sir I don't know that we would even be a target if they came to that that's enough you two can go about you were you doing one here why are you working with Sentinel and don't [ __ ] me I know all about you Oh what is it you think you know I know you're not just here to help set know so what else are you here for I also came to help out an old friend I believe you two already know each other from Bolivia you mean listen I think you're better off talking to our friend I'm just here to help he can fill you in on all the juicy stuff now I can't get any coms off Aurora but this works on the island it'll put the to you in contact and tell you its last position I appreciate the Intel now get moving this whole operation goes to [ __ ] if we're seen together [Music] you said Roger that deep blue now I don't know what you're doing on the roll it's just like Bolivia only it sucks more looks like you still got your mojo glad you haven't run soft since Bolivia yeah you and me both so what's the plan watch my back I need to retrieve some data so what brings the mighty Sam Fisher to a roll I'm after someone called the strategist he's been linked to several kidnappings around the world all military specialists we don't know what he's up to but we know he's here on this island if I can get him in front of Congress they should be able to authorize an invasion of Aurora hmm so they'll finally send in the cavalry right for now it's just us go take a look - tough son-of-a-bitch you really can't survive anything but we won't if we don't get moving setting over nose someone accessed this computer and they'll come looking reminds me of Iraq wake up [ __ ] [Music] get on that turret I'll get us out of here the strategist has you think he's using him for some special project now is Midas involved in this project it's not clear all I know is the strategist is working on some kind of new drones warp weapon look the only thing I care about is getting my just back hoe the strategist is not what I'm after I understand that I'd be the same way if it was one of my guys what do you think the strategist is up to why does he want Midas I wish I knew but you can bet your ass they're putting the screws to huh we need to make that son of a [ __ ] pay and pay hard don't worry you'll pay but first I need him alive and off this island so he can stand tall before the man how do you plan to do that my team tried to come in on choppers and they took us out with a drone swarm nothing gets in around I have an aircraft on standby ready to come in I'll figure out how to get it past that drone and swarm every lock can be picked now the strategist has Midas but I can't take him down alone you help me catch him and I promise he'll lead us to your guy partner up huh and why not worked in Bolivia I got a location on some new Intel need to be sneaky on this one which means you're going to have to master some new tricks s chillon tricks you're ready meet me at the rendezvous point we'll get started from there nomads you ready to earn your pay born ready what's he up according to the data we found there was a power plant near that's just been reassigned and designated as a skel secret project the whole thing is classified and very hush-hush military and tech specialists have been secretly flowing in to work on the project you think the strategist could be involved not only that I think it's our lead to finding - then let's get moving the strategist is careful he uses service with advanced encryption that we'll never be able to get past but if we can knock out the power planning the system will start to pack up the files the backup server has less encryption that's the weak point that's our way in got it you survey the network and I'll take down the power plant we'll split up I'll prep the main facility while you take point on the pumping station and start working once you get the pumps down head to the main facility let's do this [ __ ] notice will come in handy hi this place is really something else what the hell you're talking about well I just heard about Maggie Hanover that famous archaeologist works by the ancient meeting place deep blue.the pumping stations ready Roger that I'm headed to the main facility now get ready for fireworks I found a weakness of the pipes target that managed to take down the whole plant is that gonna give up my position he's a silencer to cover yourself hey how strange is that [Music] okay boys let's get him our plan is down everything set on your rent deep blue this is no Med other files transferring what is anything about Midas [Music] deep blue amen [Music] you sure that thing's not gonna fry your brain Jesus relax you don't have to wear it relax all of our asses are on the line if this plan fails and so far your project hasn't delivered you're a smart man stone but you lack vision Wonderland requires vision starts the test may I present frantic claw [Music] [Music] it's a promising start sure against dummies but it's got to work in the real world it's real targets oh it will so you say I do say and when I speak the world listens though I'm not surprised that someone like you can't understand that perhaps when Klaw is complete you can use it to finally put down the rebel insurrection you can't seem to manage we don't tolerate failure mr. stone is that clear crystal sir good that's enough shut it down what the hell was that the dog I said no guy named stone the man in the wheelchair acted like a superior I bet that's the strategist you find anything about the location of claw the project is massive somebody must know something - got it let's get moving I'll be in touch we're not alone bastards killed his wife no sign of Van Dyke anywhere though when Van Dyke where is he that's what they're calling beehives why did you want to die it's alright I I'm not here to hurt you yes oh this is my fault Rhonda would still be alive if I if I hadn't I'm so stupid I killed her I killed my wife that's not true no listen your wife was protecting you she believed in what you could do Oh God Oh Rhonda my sweet Rhonda there was a lot on the line here and I need you to work with me Stewart for her okay I'll help you she would have wanted that you know something that can take down Claude don't you tell me what you need we can help each other out all my research is stored in a server at the solar power plant but if you can get me there maybe I can wipe it and then they'll be running blind lead the way thank God forsaken company no matter what the project with a Java they wanted an algorithm for their factory travels why they come to you I'm an expert on B behavior know all about swarm psychology how to recognize and influence it you didn't know they were building weapons not until it was too late the situation escalated they attacked me I didn't know what else to do [Music] all my research is in here the alarm will trigger when I start to wipe it you'll need to cover me [Music] [Music] how are you old enough my world is shattered I I just need to keep going to honor her make sure my work doesn't fall into the wrong hands so how were you involved with claw I developed the algorithm the language that made the drones able to behave autonomously I gave them the power to think for themselves there anything I can use against them to stop them the only thing that can stop the algorithm is a virus corrupted the communication and you defeat the swarm this will overload the processors but you'll need to access their relay to make it work thank you No there's a bounty on your head you'll probably be safest with the outcasts I know a few I can call when they hear about Rhonda maybe they'll help me avenge her maybe now you take care of yourself nomads deep-blue I think it might have found a way to destroy Clough it comes after us Kenzie's location nobody intel on her I guess I'll have to figure it out there [Music] [Applause] are you Holly Mackenzie I've already told you I don't know where my daughter is I'm not from Sentinel in case you haven't noticed I'm here to talk about claw how do you know that name who are you I want to be with a strategist I gather you work for him I don't know who he is and I don't care -

Mackenzie are you leaving now Nomad needed elsewhere kid you stay out of trouble and stay out of my comms good luck old timer you know what I kind of feel sorry for Sentinel deep-blue I've got some good news for you dr. Mackenzie worked on the Legion Swan she says she can get you a 10-minute window for your plane you should drop her a line when you can oh just a tip keep an eye on her daughter Ruby whip-smart kids going places [Music] I hope I'm not disturbing your work the work can wait who are you and what are you doing here my name is nomad I have some questions for general Paxton oh great the old geezer went and got himself into trouble with Sentinel this time I'm not from Sentinel but there's some shady stuff going on I just need to see if he's connected to it the old man always grabs his fishing pole and heads out about this time of day he has a watering hole around these parts but he never catches anything I don't think he's much of a fisherman oh yeah where's this fishing hole of his he's pretty secretive about it and it may be snapshots of it in his office though feel free to take a look will do thanks [Music] Delfy sunfish year [Music] seems like somebody's lying about their fishing trips why [Music] stay [Music] you it seems the last of the data was uploaded from the dryer you should have everything you need very good the fun should be in your account as we speak thank you for your service general I look forward to future updates general Paxton you can't sneak up on me like that you almost gave me a heart attack say here you're gonna Feroz guys right I just uploaded this stuff from the drive and just sent it to him I we should be all square you're pathetic who the hell do you think you are I was a four-star general never volunteer information general you carelessly give up the name of your accomplice oh you're a ghost well I did I did for the good of my country right we need new warfare technology to protect America from its enemies but in the process you turned yourself into one of America's enemies you used your position to justify acts of treason listen if you had even the slightest idea what I've sacrificed for America you'd piss yourself well I respect your rank but I don't have to respect you now this this needs to end am I making myself clear good cuz I would hate to come back here wouldn't be pleasant for either of us you [Music] you Stephanie Burgess who are you you don't look like Sentinel names Nomad found your name tied to the claw project and an individual known as the strategist I'm investigating the matter and I have some concerns keep your voice down I don't want people to hear us let's get out of town you find someplace safe where we can talk [Music] [Music] outcasts are you here to stop claw I'm not an outcast blaugh is far too dangerous to stay under sentimos control I'd like to help you but I can't tell you anything they have eyes and ears everywhere anything I say will be traced back to me what can I do to protect your safety I was planning on running away from all of this but in order to do that I need to disappear from senator Mills database if you can erase my entire existence from The Sentinel files I can talk a lot more freely I'm not trying to be powerful it's super important just lead me in the right direction thank you I'll give you a burner phone call me when you're done don't worry it's encrypted where am I headed there are boats on the shore of just west of Liberty City take one you'll be able to reach the naval base that's where my data is being kept okay I'll call you when I'm done [Music] [Music] can you hear me [Music] thank you [Music] yeah any idea where it is all very useful thank you server room Northwest building God duh I wanted to double check the records stop may have cleaned the slate for you you've been scrubbing the system think you can talk freely now thanks looking forward to it [Music] Arisa rendezvous boy Stephanie who are you where are you I'm sorry I won't be joining you I can't wait what why I have no choice I need you to disappear we never met fascinating Stephanie Burgess and I don't like what I'm finding we need to be careful that she's not tipping off the strategist about our activities fella by the name of Carlson Coolidge as part of positi IP security detail he probably knows where she's hiding Jarrell seafood zamak lawless yeah I guess it was Jeff near Carol's camp Gunny until on the sky project sounds good do those Azrael drones are like death personified [Music] [Music] Russian speckle does that ring any bells Bois d'Arc yeah never heard of them you were one of the girls top priorities a while back how were you able to link Carol to that so quickly huh I called up cuz I wanted to see if he took some work but apparently this Carl guy applied from talented nice very effective get this he got rejected for being too laid back now that sounds like somebody I need to meet what the hell happened here you must be the ghost that I've been hearing so much about you Carol's the Coolidge I am yes you know who I am and you know what I do you're being awfully cavalier especially for a wolf I just heard from Stephanie sounds like she gave you some trouble so you two were close huh well I've been through worse but I'm certainly not too keen on her right now listen I can lead you to her I can even make sure she gives you all the info she has on claw but first I need a favor I'm listening the thing of it is I'm looking to disappear defect as it were from the wolves the corpses in the mission schedule it was all falsified as part of my ploy to escape this life was a pretty severe plan that's not even half of it I wanted others to think I was hot on the ghost trail I had plans to stage a whole ghost operation at the dam where I died in a transformer explosion but then you show up and you thought that dying at the hands of an actual ghost was more credible Jess there disagree something like that I'm glad to hear we're on the same page do me a favor place these on the body you'll also find a radio device on the body so that we can communicate once this is all finished I'll tell you anything you need to know about claw and the strategist works for me [Music] [Music] at the radius but you know I was watching from a distance I wouldn't like to do this completely on your own those thing up well someone is on the line I don't want them listening in on us anything else I need to know before we blow this popsicle stand ah stylist hit repeat hostile [Music] so I've helped you out with your problem can you help me out with mine I consulted the classified to SpecOps tactics I'm guessing it involved one of your friends why does it was a difficult time with interrogation quite difficult where can I find him I'll send you the details and everything I know but the strategist strongest however I cannot stress this strongly enough do not attempt to breach the facility without the knowledge of club we know that Stephanie had tire is said to be talk to the violence I'll said you're from a location when you get there I'll make sure she gives you all the Intel she promised looking forward to it deep blue got a minute sure you know Stephanie Burgess I figure you're gonna want to be on line for this these are about to get interesting well you have a good explanation for all of this if they come after us it'll be your fault Carol I understand listen I'm on your side if we can just get to claw nobody will come after you being a gopis is great and all but you have no idea what you're up against look I work for Lomax Farrell the developers behind Klaw one of the founders is Michael Lomax a u.s. senator from the subcommittee of defense he's been using his influence to create mandates and fund his own research and projects like Klaw so he uses taxpayer money to point his claw project and he has mandates to develop it it complicates my job the other co-founder is Lomax's associate pharaoh he's the strategist and he's been using all of that money control and power to further this project seems like some very deep space stuff it is whichever US official it was who sent you after Klaw is thinking several steps ahead either they know about the strategist plans or something else is brewing I wish I could tell you more that should be enough info for you to get started I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun digging through this [ __ ] it's time we go the island is locked down where will you go don't worry about us I know a couple of places that will keep us safe keep close to your radio no I'm sure our paths will cross again deep blue you got all that if you don't mind me asking who sent you this assignment the same way the rest of my assignments take it the timing suspicious it just seems too convenient if someone in the CIA new role is gonna be on lockdown and there's more to this mission than simply capturing the strategist look if they knew about a role new their activities my learn to ghosts that we would intervene for me you are in here the other girls got her hands on Farrow weed leaned on him his friends in the Senate and all their private interests it'd be a bad bad scene stuff of conspirators I know it's hard to believe but you might be working for the wrong side you think about it if slush fund money can control technology like claw and if it's dictating company Andy and there's no telling how deep it runs find anything I found construction blueprints to show a way in you figure out what we need to extract a strategist I leaned on a few of the strategist people they told me what we need to know the blueprints showing emergency escape route we're gonna need to lock the place down first or the strategist my bug hurt I got access codes from one of my friendly little chats I can lock this place down tight good we're also gonna need to take out the SAM launchers before we can call him the Paladin aircraft for exfil well there's an engineer named Holly Mackenzie who's agreed to disable the drone swarm guarding a raw contact her when you're ready to dust off she gave you ten minutes to clear skies after that you're on your own then we're set I can get to the strategist but I'll need a distraction done whatever it takes I don't give a [ __ ] the faster we take them down the faster we get to Midas mmm remember slow is smooth and smooth is fast don't let your emotions walk you into a trap you don't worry about me I'm buttoned up good I'll meet you at the base let's move [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna go check it out pulled off I shut him down swarm wait no man I'll be right back Midas could be in trouble [Music] [Music] [Applause] I still got a few more flights watch this shouldn't take long [Music] you're a relic nomad you belong in a museum the future is here and it's going to kill you [Music] why don't you just die and make way for the true Wonderland [Music] of us even if you dig up the floor you'll never stop the inevitable the future is coming our future Wonderland I want to talk to a government official I know things valuable things let's negotiate what's going on playtime's over you think you can stop me you're the old world I can control an army with just my mind ah that's better can you get authorization for a ground attack now you keep the pressure on here I'll make sure he gets in front of the right people in Washington other than that I've learned not to promise anything you know I'm sure there's some people at echelon who would love to meet us snake eater like you know I'd find out another day you have some unfinished business to take care of right that's what really matters never leave her brother behind [Music] you what the hell waitis [ __ ] Hey look what I found Pope goddamn now it's good

another you with me good is this thing is far from over [Music] you
