looks like i can remove the clamps from here good we will not be stopped by clamps duh sneaky dash bags they scrambled the power circuit so i can't release them i grew tired of these clamps gonna have to reroute the circuits one by one to reset the power grid here i'll get the door for you you should be able to see the grid with your visor yeah that's what i'm looking for [Music] okay visor's up now what you should see power grids along the walls around here find their powered up nodes looking for glowy power notes right when you find them you need to electrify the junction switch in the direction you want the power to flow shoot them with lines electricity back towards the clamps in the middle group use your roots to raise that platform with me on it kind of a root root boost things [Music] he's always helpful [Music] okay i bet i can reroute the power to get myself back out of here solid plan did that do anything not yet you'll have to reroute a couple of them [Music] no hey there anyone else feeling ready to move on i see it now you've got half of it well i think you had it right the first time [Music] you're messing up your own progress quilt huh what did that open [Music] [Music] root's the last one and he's too smart to ever sign up with them scuttles [Music] doors open and i got the power blown through almost qualified to be a junior engineer thanks maybe we should just call cosmo tell him we tried and port the flark out of here it ain't our fault skutt was locked down we will not fail at our mission i mean that sounds great and all but we usually fail in our missions not this time our work here is important gamora can you pry this wall open no i just end up wrecking my blade drax i need a hole here to reach the grid and you will have one [Music] this would go a lot faster if we all have the ability to scan yeah you got any uh priceless lattice next sornavian crystals lying around i'll gladly build you one group need your help buddy root boost please looks like you did it now get into the control room and hit that clamp release i'll re-reinvert the core at the same time and get us moving again you know normally you're not supposed to travel through dimensions without a quarantine and a decompression on the other side should we be concerned just keep an eye out for the warning signs mental degradation paranoia aggressive behavior i feel like that's already an accurate description of our team how will we tell [Music] [Music] the clamps are unclamped slick now get back in here before we leave you behind yeah let's see how far you get without your button pusher now that we know the infected nova are here we can agree that whatever's going on upstairs is really bad right they were furious when we removed their power source must be important to their effort can't wait to smash it whatever it is and then get back to cosmo for our reward all right this is our floor gamora [Music] these doors are sealed tight just look for another way out okay this has potential perhaps the nova killer knows how to redirect these machines she has experience i was an assassin not a saboteur same results either way right would you rather paint with a paintbrush or a mop neither i use explosives somebody else does the mop drax hit that panel where all the wires connect step aside [Music] so is there any chance of quill getting back together with lady law she's no lady come out to the coast we'll get together have a few laughs what's that oh nothing no that they must have flipped the floor great now we're stuck in the ventilation great job quilt dude i know you're peeved and i'm sorry apology accepted really that's it in case you hadn't noticed there's more important things happening right now than quilt saying he's sorry [Music] whoa flock and scott what are these franklin kabooms doing to contraxia what is this thing rocket i don't know looks like it's siphoning something something to do with those kills no no i gotta get a closer look peter quill we have been in this hangar before [Music] this is where the church man's shuttle exploded yeah paul looked a little different now because of the giant machine yes but i assure you peter quill this is where you and the girl almost fell to your death [Music] so what is it i think they're using the ray to fill some kind of battery standard galactic io ports regalian glass mat separators cree cathodes i understood some of those words i ain't never seen nothing like it energy readings are all over the place but i can't tell what kind of energy it is what the dog report item massive device siphoning energy from contracts don't forget the energy cubes the dog report item energy stored in strange cubes we need to check out that giant ring thing can you get us across [Music] dog report item we gotta destroy this thing we don't even know what it is plus we'd probably end up taking out the entire ship and us with it [Music] investigation lead him to believe allah is key to galaxy mystery what is that noise we are compiling an extensive dog report ah flock the report tell him his magic hand almost got us killed [Music] yeah well all the other times i've used it we landed safe and sound there's trouble on the ship big loud trouble gives the city nova core is gone bananas there was a battle but no bodies anywhere oh and there's this giant freaking ray gun have guardian found centurion korea not [Music] any idea why they need so many of these batteries rockets nope but i know it's gonna suck for us dog report item the future may be terrible your experience fighting centurions will be necessary here a woman [Music] nice to meet you i cannot reach the flying trainer you need to cool off [Music] all enemies have a weakness if we can somehow them [Music] as well [Music] what is next [Music] i expected more coordination between them we could use some coordination ourselves [Music] guys [Music] yo muscles you blind or something me i see perfectly well abomination and you two are getting in the way of my victory us you're the one screwing up our fun me and groot stand a better chance of winning this on our own whoa dudes you guys are totally out of two with each other because you're focusing on the wrong thing but it doesn't come from flying solo it comes from shredding them up in perfect harmony together who's with me [Music] you said [Music] knock them to the ground i will finish them better steal the final blow [Music] okay seems to me like this might be ground beer for whatever's happening we gotta find carrail get some real answers do you have any idea where she is i'm thinking we check her office i don't even know how we can get there you know a way out of the hangar yeah drax spotted it on our way in we can use the whole nicki and i fell into when raker shuttle exploded you know we never did talk about why you jumped after her peter because it was the right thing to do we should hurry more zealots could arrive at any moment drax gonna need you to drag this over i will assume you have a plan [Music] we need to stop the batteries from moving peter really thought that might work what am i missing [Music] i can't get over how loud that thing is rocket can you see where that vent leads anything to get out of here we should be prepared in case the beast tries to destroy this machinery there you go yeah thanks keep in mind forever we still need a way through dog report item the rumbling you sure it's continues for us to be around these batteries rocket just like i thought impressive work peter quill just hope it does not cause an explosion all right come on the tunnels just passed here we got lucky no one else showed up [Music] the unifier has detected an intrusion spread out it will be contained by your will there's too many of them in the whole jump still don't get why you jumped after the kid back then top 10 dumbest things i ever saw you do you should have seen how worried he was hey star pants was our ticket with the captain i was worried his death would lead to more jail time it was adorable i hate you all okay group i think i know my way around we just need to get into the tunnels on the other side there pretty sure this is right everything was on fire last time i couldn't make that happen no rocket no ain't that a piece of the unifier's old ship unifier yeah whatever when we were arrested they mentioned raker got caught for the same thing we did not exactly the same he got caught scavenging in the quarantine zone how is that not the same we were not scavenging for the same thing nikki mentioned something about fishing for a god i think what kind of deity inhabits the quarantine zone the kind that should probably stay quarantined so any new ideas on what the oversized vacuum's actually doing to contraxia a few none of them good i did not realize you and the girl fell down so far peter quill i didn't fall i jumped heroically you got this brute wow at least be polite about it gamora any chance you can help us here one more time groot let's go find corel and nikki so we all agree that the captain and her kid are probably dead right corral survived the worst of the war and a relationship with peter still willing to bet they didn't survive this you'd wager on whether or not a mother and child are dead if only one is dead you don't think this is slightly inappropriate given peter's history nikki's one of the most resourceful kids i ever met and carell's a warrior i'd bet on both of them any day of the week don't get cocky quilt just because you won that bet in the quarantine zone yeah thanks for reminding me [Music] be careful down there yeah definitely a lot sparkier than last time uh make sure the kid ain't floating face up somewhere rockets what exhaust all options gamora those pipes look cuttable to you the pipes aren't the problem do something about the electricity and we'll talk that'll work [Music] well definitely no sign of nikki or corral i mean i guess that's good news [Music] [Music] the exit plan is to call cosmo after we get the answers we need answers you need maybe don't suppose you've seen nikki i'm sorry what you feeling okay peter it's one of nicki's robots she gives them names and takes care of them or whatever does not look taken care of to me does not strike me as very safe here peter quill better this than getting shot at yeah speak for yourself you'd rather get shot at more fulfilling to shoot someone i don't like than look for someone i don't care about our leader seems to care and so we should also pretend to care of course you would careful peter quill okay don't remember this green gas being here last time i think you mean deadly green gas this whole ship's a death trap now i'm sure there's a way to unburst these pipes there better be because there's no way i'm walking through that what about your magical ice weapon peter quill or perhaps you enjoy contemplating the intoxicating stench of death glorious more death gas maybe nicki and corral are using it to protect themselves or and hear me out on this maybe they're dead you know what man you're being a real jackass like way more than usual tension is palpable oh can you both please just get over this agreed either resolve your issues or fight to the death hey i ain't the one who keeps sabotaging this team you're the one who quit out of frustration with quill's lack of bleeding-like qualities all i know is i'm not the one who quit the team i quick as i care i care too man okay so maybe we both just have shitty ways of showing we care really shitty yeah maybe [Music] dog report item the rumbling continues poor contraxia are you sure this is the right way it's clearly not i'm investigating you sure this is the right way just keep your eyes open you know peter they're not [Music] did you find a dog report no nothing dog report worthy still no signs of nikki or corral in the face of death's infinite mystery contestions are taught to focus on what is tangible i'll keep that in mind [Music] here this is definitely the right way nikki's secret hideout is just through here i thought we were going to the captain's office we are right after we check here so any new ideas on what the oversized vacuum is actually doing to contraxia a few none of them good try not to break anything this place means a lot to her oh wow did nikki paint all this pretty cool right nikki little one reveal yourself maybe try being a little less scary it's peter the the pirate nikki we do not intend to kill you we need to get into that room nikki's really small right and really clever right so maybe she's got a secret way in [Music] thank you nikki's pass key [Music] careful peter quill in my experience children often booby-trap their toys it's not nikki's it's mine so we're just claiming our stuff now because if we are no i mean it literally used to belong to me uh quill you gotta see this [Music] this kid's obsessed with you wait why does she have your toy it's just something i gave to carell when we were together during the war like a keepsake it doesn't mean anything does this mean anything how old is the child 12. congratulations peter quill you will make a terrible father unless the child is dead in which case does not matter wait is this why you dragged us here clearly the child is 12 and quill was with the child's mother 12 years ago the math is irrefutable did you know i just figured you didn't didn't want to tell us his bewildered silence suggests he did not this doesn't prove anything the dates match up so what that's not how paternity works ah it kinda is was korrell ovulating at the time i don't know we thought we were gonna die can we just focus on if corel and nicky are okay they're clearly not here so let's move on and keep looking anyone else feel weird going through nikki's stuff like this cedar quill is her father it is his duty to pry into her personal life pretty sure she ain't here quill i think he's still processing for all we know maybe this guy's her dad looks like an even bigger deadbeat than you looks like ronin the accuser to me indeed all i'm saying is clearly i'm not the only candidate deadbeat ronin guy also fits the bill still can't get over how good she is with all this tech stuff man i could do better yeah but she's 12. so i'm 15. staring at it ain't gonna change what it says it doesn't say anything it's just some confused kid projecting stuff just some confused kid that is no way to talk about your daughter guess nikki wasn't much of a sprawl fan name someone who is a skrull fan good point [Music] i've seen this before it used to belong to carell so the kid's a thief too or carrell passed it on to her i can confirm that parents often leave things to their spawn it grumbles more incessantly than a catastrone without breakfast we really need to get you something to eat huh not a bad work bench for a kid i'm thinking nicki won't mind if we use this what do you say rocket i say i don't care even if she does mine doing doing okay done where were we congratulating you on being a father should be a way to corral's office through those pipes on the left yeah i see an opening could be there's a latch on the inside allow me star dad i get it guys could we not make light of all this we still don't know if they're okay i am capable of feeling concerned while still laughing at you peter quill [Music] got to admit it quill kids whole setup is pretty impressive the way she rigged her terminal to the emergency power grid i told you she's a smart kid perhaps peter quill did not sire this child after all yeah i could see that she just don't seem dopey enough maybe she gets everything from the mother's side yes she should have exhibited at least some foolishness if i had a kid she or he would definitely be super cool and smart so just like nikki i guess maybe yes yep so definitely gets it from the mother's side [Music] that's the elevator i took with corel and nicki if we're lucky maybe they're on their way down right now when have we ever been lucky death has come [Music] [Music] if being a dad makes him fight better then i'm all for it [Music] anyone hurt what are you gonna start being all fraternal now we're fine peter we know how to fight i know i i just will find them don't worry you said carell's office was up top somewhere yeah just need to make our way up next stop corel's office i just realized something come on just admit it quill you're freaking out right now this whole deadbeat dad thing's got to be eaten at you some need many years to fully comprehend their paternal responsibility none of this changes who i am i'm still cool as a cucumber groot says all the cucumbers he's ever met were terrified on the inside maybe we should just ask someone for directions well that don't look good there was a struggle here uh yeah that's what i'm reacting to i am reacting in my own way this doesn't look good peter all we know is that there was a fight we don't know who won pretty sure i know hello carell nikki looks empty feels empty maybe they're hiding there are always strange writings on the wall i'm gonna try and get in her computer see if i can wipe my criminal history rock it i'm kidding i'm gonna access your logs you want to know what happened here or not fine the rest of us will take a look around maybe they left a clue or something the scribbles are cree this one says mother knows best any luck getting in things pretty well protected i need time all right let me know nikki obvious signs of a struggle peter quill yeah this doesn't look good ah appealing are you seriously focused on food right now mystery makes me hungry hey save me some william the resemblance is uncanny she doesn't look anything like me she's blue besides why wouldn't corello just told me protect her daughter peter quill copulating with you was a capital offense under the cree purity laws that's not a real thing is it the cree are extremely strict about their bloodlines so when carell said we shouldn't be doing this was being literal [Music] this must be karel's first kid i remember she talked about him a lot he was on holler right when the shatari yeah her kid and her husband explains how fearless she was during the war she had nothing to lose what is this some kind of a threat the creek council demands proof of nikki's heritage under the cree purity laws from a legal perspective copulating with you is extremely objectionable from other perspectives too this does not look good for you no for nicki what are the chances the crew are involved in any of this the council of purity isn't cryptic when they punish someone they make sure everyone knows it corel and nicki would be hanging on the wall well this is fancy for valiant heroism against unrelenting tyranny that's the highest commendation given out by the creed how come i never got one of these i did heroic stuff you're not a cree karel had a real artistic side to her she was the only cree i ever knew who painted and played music i used to think it was a sign of weakness but no it's a strength definitely a sign of strength [Music] i wonder if nicki made this some kind of dye machine is it normal for cree to dye their hair not unless they're hiding something nikki's id something seems off though what do you mean off i don't know like it's been flagged or something not sure is the girl's date of birth on those documents does it match with the typical cree gestation period i really wouldn't know okay i'm in but i got bad news lover boy what did you find come here and i'll show you hey quill you interested in seeing this or not [Music] so what am i looking at nothing she's the captain captains keep logs you keep logs i'm trying to tell you they're gone all of them almost like the world mind went out of its way to sever everything have you tried turning it off and on what about backups doesn't every nova ship have a central hub or something a nexus mainframe yeah if there's ghosts anywhere in the system that's where i categorically refuse not literal ghost drax he's talking about data right yes but we'd have to access the nexus directly means going to the bridge we're not leaving until we find out what happened center of operations it is according to the ship's map the bridge should be right through here don't worry karel we'll make sure this gets back to you peter shouldn't we head for the bridge to try to access those logs yeah yeah i just want to be sure we didn't miss anything dog report item it's one of the priests down there ain't it okay so it looks like the church is oh crap uh nuts to this i'm out of here stop moving the warrior does not hesitate peter quill okay let's be careful [Music] buy some [Music] something with skin is infinitely more satisfying it feels like i've been shooting that big butt for hours we need to focus on taking it down [Music] guys i really want my own robot he barely had a guy [Music] don't get destroyed spread out ah the mechanical beast is running out of limbs how is he still standing keep them busy crew look who's flirting with the assassins [Music] [Music] about time says the mutt's not answering keep trying the rest of us can focus on figuring a way out really this is the server room right and servers mean data i can't just plug servers into my skull i still need a central terminal you said the bridge was on the other side of that corridor so we just got to make our way across and then up somehow so how do we get across peter's the one with the visor unless he broke it i didn't break it [Music] i have never understood how so much information can be stored in such a magical way what you mean servers all of it servers computers technology so you basically don't understand anything i do precisely man what i would give to get into some of these servers i thought that was the plan plan is to get to the bridge and hope that maybe someone left the nexus unlocked wouldn't get my hopes up that'll do it well played peter quill how am i supposed to know why the boots ain't picking up keep trying [Music] dog report item we have encountered a formidable new enemy but still no sign of the ghosts he didn't mean literal ghosts ghosts in the system remnants of data let it go just let them think that our ghosts [Music] perhaps we should have interrogated the robot priest okay so according to the map i saw nexus should be just above us [Music] uh shall i throw the rodent no come on all right let's look around maybe we can find something [Music] it's weird right how the world mind seems to have gone completely dark very weird perhaps it is rebooting all the words you could have used there drax that one actually wasn't too bad thank you it was either that or reloaded [Music] [Music] all right [Music] to think all of this could have been avoided had the road to a broken glass there's an open panel up in the corner there pretty sure that's our exit perfect so we just got to jump across a few of these floaty server things seems uh perfectly safe they contain near infinite stores of data pretty sure they can temporarily support our puny mortal frames well mine anyway and yours too yes hey groot any luck getting through to cosmo yet nope still nothing reception will probably be better once we're on the bridge yeah i don't think that's how it works [Music] okay this is it the command center which i guess makes that the next control terminal fingers crossed we find something useful [Music] i'm thinking you should do the honors quilt that does not seem like you he probably thinks the next is booby-trapped ah that would explain it hey i ain't the one that's eager to know what happened let quill see for himself have you found any useful information peter quill uh well it's something what are we waiting for peter yeah yeah just psyching myself up locked i wonder though nikki really didn't want her mom to know about this pass key she gave me no way is some kid's card gonna bypass the name you're kidding well yes guys we're in get to the juicy stuff already channeling your nova force a comprehensive guide to meditation and management your mental health actually i wouldn't mind a copy of that pass let me get this straight she became a teapot that's what my source said amazing i hate you all [Music] well that don't sound good the audio file must be corrupted the audio file and everything else in the galaxy attention away team please ensure your helmet cams are in full operation ahead of this afternoon's away mission into the quarantine zone thank you just like carell everything by the book go to the criminal records quilt we already know your girlfriend works here quill so it might have useful info or something agent of thanos gamora care to explain not really except that it wasn't me check it out nikki's got a file boring i have heard of this one it was a good man except good means skutt when you're dead hey wall then who is running novacore that's a good question she crashed into a leviathan on purpose and is still a better pilot than quill hey what you know it's true it's a list of bucketheads 20 units mine's the biggest they can't be that scary if they share a record i've heard of this guy he's part of a private army called the lethal legion more like the loser legion what is it with you humi's and your stupid names star-lord is not in the same league as dark hawk okay one's the name of the greatest band of all time and the other's a bird so drax's criminal record is pretty big that is what your mother said it's great because his mother's dead i thought there'd be more here barely scratches the surface you a gold dome overmind that body buddy you know for a non-space bearing species us humans sure get around unfortunately hey isn't that the guy we saw when we tried to pay our fine yeah that's him look it's jax's girlfriend lady hellbender is not my girlfriend yet isn't this your friend from the bar yep grand unifier raker wonder what he was looking for in the quarantine zone probably nothing good read it and weep losers there ain't a single scam me and groot haven't pulled off you name it we've done it if you're charged it means you've been caught you realize that right your point wow when cree cops go bad they really go bad actually an accuser is the equivalent of a judge jury and executioner wow your record's a lot bigger than i expected how big were you expecting minuscule another guy from earth i'm telling you quilt c-53 is the trailer park of the galaxy fun fact that bounty hunter put out is how me and groot met quill i'm just glad i talked you out of collecting it says you're dead i am unfamiliar with this cree one of the nameless oh spooky all right let's take a look wow super evident quilt and to think we could still be reading my criminal record please do not i was wondering how they knew about us quill must have tripped the sensors on the way out isn't that the mining rig from the quarantine zone oh great looks like your girlfriend was collecting evidence against us even after the two of you struck a deal i still do not understand how the churchman's ship exploded the nova corps is known for their security protocols it's called stupidity drex something the bucket has got a lot of got to be something in here [Music] hey isn't that the mining ship we explored in the quarantine zone yeah where's the footage from [Music] centurion corral found something hey [Music] she went in after we left [Music] that thing you don't think it is the creature that devoured a monster [Music] could have been a million things i mean it's restricted space for a reason no you're a lotus guy that thing's got nothing to do with us [Music] that jam corel picked up i think it's the same one we shot in the quarantine zone uh we you're the one who shot it fine the gem i shot the point is is that shadow thing came out of it [Music] we did this the quarantine zone's a giant death trap so we released a shadow thing we made it out didn't we your stupid girlfriend probably did too you've been saying the whole time she's probably dead probably alive probably dead whatever important thing is we're all fine carell is tough if anyone made it out it's her i know it [Music] [Music] guardians of the galaxy you misread our intentions no you've made them pretty clear sometimes sacrifices i had to check groot write the stars grand unifier breaker right first let me just say it's really cool that you've heard of us right guys and it's cool that you didn't try to kill us just then especially with your two pals right there it could have totally ripped us apart the moment you walked in which we obviously all appreciate but also we've kind of got a few questions like where are centurion corel and her daughter you came here seeking truth rejoice the matriarch wishes to share it with you [Music] okay that is really not cool what do you mean he's not picking up come on the matriarch awaits [Music] [Music] what's wrong with the passport nothing the poochie picking up we're stuck here hey release the dumpster weapons and demonstrate their lack of fear there's a proven battle tactic cataption warriors often ride into battle completely naked keep your pants on although it could be used as a distraction yeah any other ideas can you froth i can froth can you twitch yeah i'm pretty twitchy all right on my cue you drop froth and twitch while they're all distracted we take off down one of them side hulls what about me you well you know you uh take one for the team i'm not find another plan [Music] you
