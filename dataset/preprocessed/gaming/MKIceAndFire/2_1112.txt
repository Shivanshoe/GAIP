[Music] next time I want my own suit [Music] [Applause] usually I see the danger before it hits even from 20,000 feet but someone got the drop on us it was 3 a.m. when I left pepper at the hospital I had a plan and I knew she wouldn't like it I went home and I woke up the guy who knows my old weapons better than anyone just once just just this once hello old friend [Music] hey boss hey pal where's the party the party's over [Music] right I smell like feet whoa blast from the past it's a Power Core from an old drone you recognize it of course I recognize it I built it huh that's odd there's no

haven't you did you find out where those drones came from yet so serious and yes I mean no I mean I will but I've been thinking you've built a pretty great suit but I think I can make it even better standing on the shoulders of giants of course pal I brought you back to figure brought me back cuz we're in a street fight and you know I don't pull any punches just take a look all right give me the sales pitch so I've analyzed your armor and found places where we can make potential upgrades you can view and customize the equipment in each of these slots by activating their corresponding UI widget go ahead boss select one of the auxilary weapons slots this virtual workstation is where you can choose equipment to build and integrate into your suit you can put together all kinds of gunpowder base goodies here boss let's start with smartness if you want to arm yourself with knowledge as well as hardware the specs on each weapon appear of a politic for now let's go ahead and build these when it comes to this stuff boss I always say the more the merrier equip those smart missiles to your other arm - oh good thinking pal now let's go see what these beauties can do it'd be a tragedy not to boss but feel free to mess around with your suit some more if you want and when you're ready I'll still have you test the smart missiles first cuz well that's how I design module [Music] this armor wants to park you'll have our enemies seeing red in that one hit the boardroom and the skies in this one whoa I almost didn't see this one but I guess that's the point make your enemies feel the sting boss welcome welcome welcome to stark-raving the financial advice podcast the pros finance Bros and CEOs never miss I'm your host Morgan stark the man with the money Jean the name that's synonymous with richness and yes for those of you only just now checking us out because of my robo call ad campaign I am Tony Stark's cousin and Tony isn't the only Stark who knows how to make money so get ready for an intense injection of invaluable insight straight from the Starks mouth let's jump right into it everyone wants to talk about Tony naming Virginia Potts her friends call her pepper because you know I'm I'm not exactly sure why anyway Tony made her the new CEO of Stark Industries stepping aside to focus on the business of being a superhero but don't fret Stark shareholders Tony's still a big part of the company he just doesn't like paperwork meetings the day-to-day grind he grooves on being in his lab inventing stuff that makes us all rich rich rich and pepper is exactly - steady hand we need at the helm we still haven't technically met in person but her emails telling me they're not hiring when I asked on behalf of all my listeners are very economically worded oh and the attack on the stark corporate jet scary sure but that's what happens when a superhero runs a publicly traded company the crazies target him because they know where to find him luckily Tony's also Iron Man and he handled that situation like the boss he is no doubt he's got this situation under control as for pepper she is now safely ensconced in a secret location that I totally know about waited if you're Hydra or somebody I mean I totally don't know about it purely for safety reasons you understand so she is as safe as your money will be when you buy my stark raving rich online seminar now 10% off of you enter the code more Morgan one word here's a little freebie the time to buy stark stock is now welcome could have used a spotter okay I'm not Thor oh it's

dogs the gunsmith ai's brand of help came with a warning label but I was concerned about the night off not the morning after I felt like stumbling back into an old haunt after years away there's no judgement no where have you been just what do you have what's on the menu today sir gunsmith suggested I brush up on the fundamentals oh did he that's a surprise coming from him but encouraging I suppose what would you like to do first let's start with ground pound oh I love this one let me find a good place to test this out [Music] the spot looks good I recommend you manually engage thrusters to focus on ground pound [Music] give me a target and how do you aim it sir I pick a spot and make a fist [Music] another target Queens Friday right I admire your handiwork sir that's not Friday give me nine targets nine sir someone's feeling brash I can hit them all if I do this right [Music] smashing sir what's next smart missiles Oh something gunsmith made sir I was under the impression you brought him back to locate the source of your old drones he's a skilled multitasker just like me indeed sir it's just well I thought we were brushing up on the fundamentals heh that's right Friday and these wrist-mounted beauties put the fun in fundamentals so give me a new target please certainly sir move to position [Music] okay these are auxilary weapons so hands up palms down good try aiming with your left gauntlet paint the target and fire Wow Oh pack-a-punch try aiming with your right gauntlet sir paint all of the targets this time gunsmith is not messing around instead why don't we review your repulses sir sure I know these hands up palms forward your old haunted days I mean I am iron Judith let's test when switching answers palms up hilary's palms death suddenly yellow firmer pulses read for auxiliaries [Music] all right time to take this show on the road sacks [Music] feels like the good old days [Music] what would you like to do now well we've got a lot of fine ingredients let's throw them in the pot together a cooking class sir excellent idea I'll set up the flight course [Music] [Music] all right time to rock and roll [Music] I'll try a three-punch combo left right [Music] alternate hands to pull off the cop mid-wide reached keep going [Music] I'm getting the hang of this [Music] subtracting from the timer [Music] [Music] well done sir care to try again with the goal of under a minute [Music] nope I'm full we'll call it a day [Music] welcome back boss thanks pal Friday what you working on over there I've put together an early warning system to track our friend from the jet have a look when you can hey boss I've added a dock on the right here where you can select which armor to equip and configure your primary or your backup enjoy got it sir I've established a visual of our enemies mo using their recent attacks on your buildings in London and Dubai unfortunately I'm not seeing a pattern that could tell us where they are next I got a boss oh sure just walk right in you're more important using an unclassified wargames simulator i cross-referenced the jet attack with military strategy dating back to 1743 then I ran the results through a chess program developed in the 1980s by a Russian agent known only as Victor the fly now picture was almost certainly insane however bloody points Shanghai that's where our enemy will strike next so that just happened do you think he's right sir when it comes to stuff like this he usually is right in that case let me explain the globe it's an early warning system that displays current threats and can even anticipate new ones grab the rotation ring and swipe it left or right to spin the globe to a mission location got it as you can see Shanghai is currently highlighted select it to proceed going forward when choosing a location you can review the data I've prepared for an upcoming mission when you're ready press the deploy button to depart for Shanghai [Music] back in the day buying a stark weapon meant buying a seat at the high-stakes table my brand put a few countries on the map and wiped a few off it occasionally our tech wound up in the wrong hands but nothing like this streets are deserted the city's under curfew sir it appears our friend from the jet is making a mess of things and start tower is on lockdown let's check it out [Music] [Music] scanning the tower sir I'm getting some confusing readings from the tower I can't locate the source but it's close look out somebody's created a gravity well it's pulling us in that giant seems to defy the laws of physics and the laws of attraction it's an old Stark built meridian mine we didn't build it to do that it's unusual energy signature still present eyes peeled Friday I bet there's more around I've detected a concentration of signals displaying now it sounds like we got somethings attention every time I look into a mine signal it tips away being damaged [Music] [Applause] detecting new signals emerging near the waterfront these mines are way too dangerous in a city we need to get rid of them [Music] so we can't leave active mines above Shanghai hostiles inbound there's at least one mine near by Eastern Shanghai to a minefield why unclear I'm still attempting to access dark towers security system still I don't think there was a hacker alive to keep you up there's another concentration of lines over the South Bridge these mines are keeping us busy opposable cenario sir well it's working we can't just ignore them more hostiles approaching around here somewhere height sniffing approach [Music] your mind acidity all the damage increasing stuff [Music] our block party seems to have moved to new block the enemies do on us away from your building what don't they want me to see so nope they're targeting stop tower that's a defensive formation they're guarding it Friday what do you bet our mystery friends inside as I have no gambling protocol so I suppose I'll wager nothing one of the sustains damaged cell maybe I can lose them in the alleys a few targets remain let's wrap this thing up [Music] [Music] [Music] keep your guard up hostiles with me Vulcan Hansen scheduled my sparring session that was all over guy [Music] in the system yet still look down I suggest you come see yourself [Music] Friday flashback time 14 I accidentally set fire to my dad's laboratory long story anyway he changes the locks on that so I take it as a teachable moment learn a thing or two about breaking and entering just have to remove this panel rip out this wire to disrupt the circuit Open Sesame 14 year old me would be so proud like you said sir the drones were protecting whoever vandalized your office love what they did with the place how did they get in there's no sign of forced entry let's check out the computers this is getting out of hand now I'm locked in my office they were looking for something but I'm not sure what spoke too soon Tim Chung most of my data banks friend of yours Friday you get the feeling we're not alone more than a feelings to switch to near-infrared but keep the visible spectrum [Music] there's someone else in here electromagnetic traces of their presence all around and let's find him I thought I left this thing on [Music] [Music] [Music] it's quiet out there for now whoa [Music] sir someone ate my drunken chicken that's not funny [Music] [Music] [Music] expecting a call Friday our Restless wrong number very wrong indeed [Music] ouch hello you in there you know the gym has showered those unpleasant more than a dozen people are dead after the question so you got a name or should I just call you ghost my name is unimportant it is the others those whose lives your weapons ended they are the names you will know before you die like Tim Chung one of many yeah I got no clue close you will he is with us in this room we all are the silent majority we ought to meet you Tony start it's time James where'd she go she's not showing up on my senses but what incoming surface-to-air missiles you're repulses should be able to destroy those missiles old star cover tanks just like all the heads [Music] but no tax really sir so I'm reading additional tanks on brief to this location get that out of here today like swatting flies kay believe she dug decent director fury had a standing order for two fleets of tanks were fully closed production yeah we miniaturize the turbines to keep the Helicarrier a revolutionary weapon fallen into the wrong hands story [Applause] [Music] nice job - hi gives us more time to shoot down in excellent so defense I'm starting to think I made the missile targeting system they're the last of those tanks Friday for the moment the board is care [Music] where's this the key these are the headquarters affirms your company employed for the manufacturing and distribution of stark weapons most of those guns rockets and bombs result to people you never met to kill people she's transmitting some kind of signal intercepting it's an activation start oh there's must I [Music] parachutes can't save them now can you Friday sir she's overridden the reactors that power those buildings I'm detecting catastrophic coolant system failures we haven't much time get to the reactor sir time is of the essence how is she doing us scanning for suspicious devices undetected electrical wiring not in the reactor schematics let's see where those wires [Music] I think we found one of the devices Friday enhance x-ray images [Music] to disable the device you'll need to extract the process at all [Music] Friday how's that reactor looking the reactor is no longer overheating but a cascade failure has begun we better shut it down fast let's see what we got the correct sequence to shut down the reaction ain't no time for that report you punched it by overcomplicate things two reactors remain in a critical State I'm going as fast as I can that may be unwise I'm detecting more mine signatures number too many react is detected on several rooftops check your display so there are dozens of people trapped in this building show me that's a lot of people nothing compared to the innocence or glasses okay so you keep reminding why are you doing this so there are two gateway devices hacking this reactor display time to cascade failure yes sir more hostiles inbound they'll make disabling the Gateway device is difficult [Music] these lines lead to the devices we need to disable [Music] Korea starving your lackeys are depending on device you try [Music] below optimal but not critical the reactor can now be safely shut down or punished I suppose hey we're in a hurry aren't we [Music] [Music] you are taking entirely too much pleasure I prefer to call it being super heroic now for the last one mindset just gonna have to take our chances don't have much time so you reacted some damage taken sir [Music] but catch me into the building connected this is Iron Man please remain calm less man Friday the wires please he's paying them now how much time not much another hovertank says to come back it seems to be ignoring me familiar standing [Music] [Music] the electrical trace leads the gateway devices find and destroy them I'm reading power spikes in the reactor set pressure [Music] almost done one more device [Music] follow the wires to the gateway devices [Music] pants the reactors will explode if we don't hurry we're ready to take down the reactor that's the last one Steve McNiven wish she's accessing the servers in stark tower show her just how fast we can move Friday tell me no one was in there correct sir all clear interesting the color she chose red and gold Daliah and greed DCU oh here comes another scintillating lecture on social responsibility from a terrorist you're Franco like your former victims in their final moments these victims I don't their behalf we say farewell start Friday get ready on the damage increasing sir [Music] [Music] keep moving [Music] hang in there sir to run them to James eventually since healthy sub up tonight ghost has a lot of friends fired up and assembly line [Music] stay alive for an opening [Music] your armors not rated for combat on this scale sir no memory loss gunsmith stay off this channel boss before you left I packed you a hot lunch I call it me an aide and in true take a memo Friday that's how you wanna fight but it's soaked in it dumb Smith thanks for the stowaway pal there's the shame it's one and done oh ye of little faith I added an ambient power collective you Chesapeake's harvests the energy given off when a drone goes boom so blow up eyes to charge the enemy circle of life [Music] keep it going service to success % boss it's there sustained damage so 90% charge unibeam is recharged by a 12 oz I could get used to this nice work no surprise I'd know what you got any more ghosts maybe you should close up shop for the night sure a well-earned beatdown the confidential files up here how rude does the name Tim Cheung mean anything to anyone nah nah mind Friday record search is negative sir I'll look into it further [Music] you
