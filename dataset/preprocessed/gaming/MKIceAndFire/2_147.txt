see what we it's a got a crypt hidden behind a secret door i assume the secret door was added afterwards to hide his loot well fingers crossed gang's all here jesus dismiss on the left penitent thief guess this on the right jerk thief avery sure had a thing for saint dismiss huh well every fancied himself a good thief right only plundered and murdered the non-british evens guess that's what passed for good back then good enough is this a door looks like a door i don't see a way to open it though what are these star symbols some kind of lamp hey smokey i need your lighter over here you know that hurts my feelings as much as it hurts your lungs thank you father duffy that something the light's coming from the other side of the wall all right let's see here ah i can aim the lights i am loving this hey here we go that looks right oh connect the dots i think you got that one nathan that's it you got it okay let's give this a shot [Music] open sesame wrong treasure josh oh nice view no treasure though no but look you see those crosses oh yeah hey is that a cave right below yeah i think avery's trying to tell us where to go next just one problem though going back that way means we have to go back toward the cathedral and back towards rafe well i keep waiting  they open the gate up there oh good cause that's the way we gotta go i follow my if we don't get lead to you soon i'll go check it oh what the  was that nothing here uh so uh um uh i can't believe he got away apparently she tossed him out of a five-story window and he survived jesus god should count his blessings that auction was fully guarded not by shoreline not by our boys all i'm saying is let's not underestimate these guys let's not make them into something they're not are they okay what was it anything interesting we're all clear sam got it go [Music] and that's how it's done all right let's get out of here before they realize we gave him the slip you holding up i was kind of hoping to find the treasure back there but it was never that easy right it's been my experience plus it was a cool constellation yeah it was cool wow right under that high cross that's where avery wants us well whatever he wants avery gets kid what's your status hey sully we're on the trail but uh treasure's closer to the cathedral than we originally thought oh boy so what do you need me to do i'll just keep those engines warm we'll be back before too long you got it keep me posted will do you of all people should appreciate the downtime nobody wants another port moresby on our heads how about don't talk if you weren't there hey everything's called a massacre nowadays to generate buzz we don't need that kind of press we don't need rival companies stepping into our jobs you know what forget it why'd you bring it up then i said forget it whatever [Applause] uh we're good they don't see us i guess there's no getting away from these guys yeah and there'll only be more as we get closer to the cathedral nathan found a ladder over here okay coming here we go come on i'll boost you up there all right hell i'm too high to reach you hang on a sec hanging see what's by that wooden structure over there hey i got something yep we go all right this thing's heavy what exactly are you doing giving you a way up that'll support even your way ah thank you hey you don't think the monks built this no way some kind of pulley system to lift a whole bunch of treasure to lift something i can't believe i missed this yeah clearly we were meant to find it together oh it's so romantic we can climb this on my way okay maybe this wasn't such a good idea holy  incoming [Laughter] that was amazing save your strength huh you're not done yet just lead the way hope this this holds a good idea especially cliffs tell me about it all right here we go okay yeah like i was just saying yeah yeah yeah and hold on i'll see if there's an oh sam can't get to you from here you got it i can't feel my hands i think my blood thinned out or something after all those years in panama where would you be without me huh uh probably at home drinking hot cocoa what are you five oh tell me you wouldn't go for some hot cocoa right now well i mean yeah exactly here we go no not storms rolling in fast you've been in south sudan too long unlike you reptiles i'm a warm blooded creature uh the way i imagined that nothing okay hey careful it might be unstable after the blast who does excavation with dynamite hey sam help me with this what if it's the only thing holding the tunnel up then i'll apologize all right there see no problem yeah for once huh hey be extra careful on these [Music] oh crap ha remember extra careful thanks okay okay we're good we're good we're about to head into the cave [Applause] yeah might lose contact for a bit don't get too worried all right i'll keep the porch light on for you all right call you soon we made it it's quite the detour let's go see what avery left for us yes please those shoreline were right next to this cave yeah but i think we're the first ones in here come on through here but i didn't need a big breakfast creepy st dismissed statues check carve stairs check nathan i think it's safe to say we're in a pirate cave come here check this out a little slimy there's a handle in here or something well give it up give it a pull what could be a trap you're already in there what's the what's the worst that can happen uh i lose my hand so we'll get you a nice hook give it a pull nice hook all right here we go really hello hello it's pretty interesting decor for those who prove worthy paradise awaits to those who prove false behold your grim fate well i guess avery was a better pirate than a poet this this isn't avery's what do you mean look it's the rhode island pirate thomas two yeah but it can't be him i mean this is clearly his sigil but two died attacking the same treasure fleet as avery yeah well at least that's what the stories tell us if this really is two's mark then that means he's involved in all of this how that's a damn good question so who do you think these guys are those who prove false i guess i think avery or thomas too were just trying to scare us good thing we're jaded treasure hunters that bridge looks about as safe as the others it's okay it's holding come on these bridges are clearly not built to code sure they are the pirate code not bad i don't know i still have rocks in my shoes from the last tense okay okay okay i'm a pro at this by now so did two build this place with avery i can't make sense neither can i if avery's trying to hide his treasure why involve another pirate well maybe he saw him as a part of his crew maybe he sent him one of those saint dismiss crosses yeah maybe two took all the treasure for himself please don't say that well we're gonna find out soon enough we're not going back that way at least we didn't get dropped in a pit or something this is elaborate you could say that i found another switch and i'm just gonna take the hand out jesus it's a pretty elaborate test trial yeah then this guy clearly failed then let's do better there's something on the bottom there it's a bucket huh okay now what ah bucket filled all right pass it up to me i'm gonna put it back in that big wheel thingy all right let's see what these wheels do okay i think i see what's going on here something with the three crosses yeah i'm guessing we're looking at jesus our good thief dismas and the jerk thief guestus i'm gonna figure that white cross is dismiss so the black one is guestus check it out something up there move when you put the bucket on top there's a channel running from the mechanism to the door okay so bucket on top is good keep it there okay that's gotta be it now let's find out let's so you're gonna pull the switch oh no no i'd i'd hate to deprive you of that privilege of course nathan look i think you got it all right see oh shishkenates no nate kabobs today so if that was a test what do you suppose it was testing exactly filling a bucket i had to know about saint dismiss whom i bet avery and all of his crew were intimately familiar with not that hard of a test maybe it's not the only one hey come here i'll boost you up there coming okay i got something for you up here use this to reach those hand holes on the wall over there good call follow me they're sure not making this easy are they i imagine it was easier when all the bridges and walkways weren't i broken we're a couple hundred years late let's see what's in here there's a little ceiling here watch it ow watch my ah can it see some light through here huh anything noteworthy by the dormitories not unless you count some cleverly worded headstones have you finished digging by the chapter house we have ma'am the northwest sites are wide open as well and what about the southern perimeter not yet it'll take us a day to move the crane over there nadine make it happen in the meantime see what you can dig up without it i'll send a couple of men over right away good riff any luck with those manuscripts can we have a minute keep me updated yes ma'am did you hear they found a whole annexed area under the cathedral i did have you seen it no why because there wasn't much left after they'd finished finding it my men have been a bit liberal without like 100 well-armed bulls in a china shop but they've made more progress in two days than we've made in months progress i can't analyze rubble okay okay thank you i let them know they need to give you a heads up before they do anything drastic or you can tell them to sit tight until i analyze the few clues that haven't been blown up no we can't sit around waiting any longer all due respect i think i have a bit more experience with this sort of thing than you do we tried things you away you've been wanting to level this place ever since we got here no i wanted to steal that cross long before it ever even made it to that auction the same auction where i couldn't have my men around to deal with any surprises the auction was the cleanest way but instead of going with my gut i'll listen to you and now we have competition well i didn't think he'd show up or maybe you wanted to draw him out why the hell would i do that because you think you need him and maybe you do point is i'm done trying to do things the clean way if the treasure is here we'll find it and if not well maybe it's time to move on huh hey it's not personal of course i'll let you know if anything turns out let's get moving before they blow that treasure to bits and stop making out wait you think she was right though but what about rafe want to draw you out as long as he doesn't get the upper hand who cares doesn't matter what annexed area you suppose they were talking about there's got to be some side chamber because we're the only ones here don't mind me ugh a little too high to jump up there unless you got a trampoline left it in my backyard hey you have it i wish hang on look at you looks great coming up i thank you good sir we're definitely getting closer to the cathedral gotta say this is far more sophisticated than i was expecting me too must have taken years to build here goes nothing it's a good thing you're not heavier than the crate okay we can hook our ropes up to this that'll work [Music] who needs bridges i don't know i i wouldn't mind bridges per se well can't go through there so how do we get through over here this place wasn't completely falling apart we'd probably be trapped again nathan look around you holy crap this must have been another test but all just crumbled into the ocean well i guess the test now is how the hell do we get to the other side that really safe looking wooden seesaw thing might do the work worth a shot here goes nothing the night to stop you won't make it you're too low i'll weigh it down go made it all right uh now what about me right now just let me look around check out all that machinery you know really makes you appreciate everything that goes into making one of these dead traps don't be glib who's being clipped this is a marvel of human engineering any luck yeah give me a sec okay i found something to weigh down the seesaw heavier than i am i don't know about that yeah yeah there we go hey nice air time oh crap there thanks there's another test down at this point i'd rather take another death trap at this point i hope we're at the end of this thing come on okay getting a bit dramatic with the statues here seriously why decorate a treasure burial site or build elaborate tests and either we're missing something or avery was really really bored i'll never get used to this it's another cross at least this one has some jewels on it right oh don't touch it what why look at it it's the only valuable thing we've seen in this cave right this is another test great yeah lack thereof okay so it's it's gotta be the coins are we sure about this i'm pretty sure pretty sure we'll have to do i just just one now great i got it please don't be a trap [Music] you recognize the shape it's madagascar look star right here it's king's bay yes it is son of a he's screwing with us what are you talking about avery he's screwing with this this was supposed to be it so where's the goddamn treasure huh i mean kings bay great what's next north pole outer space nathan for those who prove worthy paradise awaits was recruiting who was recruiting avery was recruiting recruiting for what ah crap you gentlemen are very very noisy guns on the floor slowly must allow you from last time throw me out a window didn't do it for you rafe reef come in i'm at the graveyard nadine they were here yeah i'm looking at them right now what where are you come back to the cathedral follow the holes i'm on my way and for god's sakes don't shoot him yet not want to hurry then king's bay yeah but uh we're in king's bay you'll need that cross over there to figure it out but there's only two people that can tell you how to use it let me guess you two huh i'm gonna leave it to rafe you're gonna be waiting a long time sorry boys i'm not here to negotiate bring me the crucifix it's not a crucifix what well technically crucifix refers to crossta you know what never mind don't touch it up ah [Music] [Applause] get out of there come on come on what's the plan i'm working on it we gotta go up to get out [Applause] no no no that works one down man we really kicked the hornet snatch didn't we yeah we kicked it punched it and set it on fire nice shot little brother huh god damn it mate i can hear the fireworks from here what the hell's going on long story short version is get us the hell out of here yeah drink it hold tight be there as soon as i can oh nice shot so oh no [Applause] relax why don't you that's it let's keep moving oh sam sniper that cover up there [Applause] i got it oh scaffolding [Applause] yeah set her down one way or another we'll get to you keep running don't stop is this how it always did for you oh kind of yeah yes yes definitely victor saying the weather is lovely this time of year i can't see just keep heading down until we hit the water forget about them gotta get past these guys right okay here we go get ready uh [Music] well that was a close one huh i shot up my goddamn plane nathan we're fine thanks how soon can you get us to madagascar no treasure not yet i don't know what you're talking about look we're rich jesus suppose it's a start you think the rest is in madagascar well there was a chamber back there with a giant map of madagascar on the floor so yeah it's probably there this is beginning to smell a whole lot like wild goose kitten look the treasure was never in scotland okay then what was the point of all that huh of the saint dismissed like i said i think avery was recruiting people the cross was an invitation the caves were just some sort of initiation oh so we all passed huh congrats victor we get eye patches and parrots now i don't get it why the hell would they go to all that bothered just to weed people out to protect himself look avery was the most wanted man in the world at that time he had to enlist people that he could trust in order to keep their treasure secret what do you mean bear treasure i just think about this thomas ii was a successful pirate in his own right what would he possibly stand the game from joining avery i think avery sent out crosses only to the other wealthy pirates like himself what if they pulled and hid all their treasure together that would make the guns way all look like chump change exactly oh holy okay so we're exactly in madagascar are we going king's bay it was an old pirate haven back in uh avery's time i know it well it's a big place anything more specific well that map chamber completely caped in so you know what are you laughing about the people who survived the caves the recruits what's the one thing they would have left with [Music] there's a volcano on this there's a volcano near king's bay which means we need to get a move on [Music] hey hey nate hi honey oh hi i've been trying to get ahold of you are you okay yeah of course what do you mean oh you know the news there's been all that flooding maybe going to malaysia during the monsoon season wasn't such a good idea yeah right right yeah it uh it grounded us for sure you know had some equipment failure but you know no one's hurt or anything well as long as you guys are safe so are you gonna start work tomorrow uh postponed actually uh looks like we're gonna need maybe another ten days or so oh 10 days hey well why don't i just uh go ahead and buy a ticket then oh you know you don't have to do that that's fine i mean you know these guys always overestimate things i'm sure it'll be less time than that okay well you know don't rush make sure that you're safe oh i will i always do uh listen i i'm i'm sorry i gotta go jameson's calling me over okay i love you love you too [Music] what are the satellites saying victor right now not a goddamn thing never lost the signal hey you know what never loses signal paper all right this root right here should take us straight to the volcano might get a little bumpy though get the show on the road okay so what are we looking for out here well the map shows all these structures around the volcano some abandoned outposts a handful of watchtowers watch towers avery was the most wanted man in the world so if he was hiding something out here it makes sense he'd need lookouts one of those towers is right on the volcano with avery's treasure fingers crossed i see some ruins up ahead [Music] this with our luck what are the odds this volcano is going to erupt on us zero it's extinct trust me that's the first thing i looked up when we said we were heading for a volcano that and where to rent the cheapest format wait sully you're telling me that you actually did some research can't let you be the know-it-all every time kid [Music] that bridge there is what you would call rickety ah this looks promising [Music] come on come on baby let's go go go go go made it okay kid just don't drop us okay just keep it slow keep it in the center yeah there's a lot of backseat driving going on we're good everything's good this is crazy onward and upward all right hang on guys there we go [Music] oh jesus oh my spine look tire tracks someone came up this way [Music] hey look up there on the hill got a tower or something now we're talking hey victor what were you arguing with the rental guy about oh your brother insisted on getting a 4x4 with a winch so you sprung for the winch but you couldn't spring for the suspension i got it hey it's important going off-road it might rain might be muddy sorry bump take this slow kid yeah [Music] so nathan you're thinking avery two and some other big shot pirates pulled their treasure and came out here because why exactly who knows maybe for protection british authorities were closing in on him sure maybe uh he helped them disappear i mean the guy clearly had a knack for hiding things and go and no that was a valiant effort let's go check out that tower i'll come with it's in pretty good shape for something several hundred years old yeah that definitely ruins from avery's era sam look that's christopher content's sigil he's uh captain of the fiery dragon operated out of madagascar around avery's time so maybe avery recruits pirate captains to what be his lookouts that don't make any sense no it doesn't well maybe each captain was responsible for a tower along with providing them in for it whatever the case this certainly isn't our final stop on our tour uh got some big plans for this winch there i know to do it oh that looked like thumb steeper than it looks all right ready give it a shot here we go steady steady [Music] see sully winch totally worth it we cleared a hill it hasn't exactly fame for itself well yeah small victories yeah well i'll celebrate the big ones [Music] feast your eyes gentlemen wow spectacular just imagine you've come here a well-to-do pirate far away from your oppressive government oh poor prince pirates all they wanted to do was to murder and pillage in peace no no they wanted to live as free men well if you're gonna pick a place to run away from society you could do a lot worse than here it's taking forever to get to this volcano hey do you know how those pirates got here they had to start in england sailed to brazil then cut back across the atlantic to south africa and they figured all that out with paper charts and by looking at the stars hey you're describing salem to a former squid the point is we got it pretty easy yeah still taking a long time how would you look at that oh stop stop i see him what do we got military types poking around nadine's guys yep son of a yeah looks like they found an old colony outpost but the wrong one right that's the good news that means it's bad news the only route to the volcano is straight through them oh you do have the drop on them what's the play here nathan just follow my lead first hang on on your left side oh we're all set up just waiting on approval [Applause] flex your hair down i'm gonna find you where'd ah reinforcements inbound find that target yep oh nate good work okay i think that's it good damn it rayford and they d must have dozens of guys out here they could just stumble under the treasure through blind luck looks like nadine hasn't given up on excavation by explosions rafe can't be happy about that look another sigil huh adam baldridge he ran kings bay for a while he was a traitor slaver general scoundrel look at you yeah prison a lot of books [Music] hey careful kid jesus these pirates really need to work on their infrastructure now how do we get out of here uh [Applause] come on come on [Applause] one down one to go uh again with the winch sully pretty handy right i wasn't against getting the winch i was against getting ripped off let's not get stuck here sully just how well do you know nadine why i was thinking maybe you can contact her convince her to call off her goons right what if we promise her a bigger cut than rape no that's not how she operates he's more of a money up front kind of mercenary the rape's got the advantage there look shoreline yeah they're definitely going all in aren't they and getting awful close to that volcano singing the same damn thing but they found the treasure already well look they're searching every inch of this place if they'd found it already they wouldn't be searching yeah yeah you're right hey sam you don't mind me asking how'd you pass the time in prison uh you know reading mostly there was this one guard saw me as a charity case i guess you to check out books from the library for me so what'd you read history uh especially anything related to avery and other pirates just in case you know sure but you know besides books push-ups smoking trying to stay out of fights between rival gangs it's a whole lot of thinking that's pretty much it [Music] buckle up everybody sam if you had a guard doing you favors why didn't you use them to get word to us oh i tried i asked them to mail a letter to your p.o box i never got it that'd be because the wardens ah see that smoke oh shoreline slow down right what are you talking about again um oh right that'd be because the warden saw it i got busted up pretty bad and never saw that guard again jesus i got my own back when the warden decided to ruin me with alcazar that didn't turn out how he expected you know come to think of it i actually dealt with alcazar a few decades ago even before i met you two oh how are you still alive well he wasn't quite the man he is today still working his way up the criminal ladder then i sold his boss a few woodcut prints had smuggled out of japan he was into shoguns and such alcazar was the go-between what was he like soft-spoken but intense like you could explode at the slightest provocation well he hasn't changed much then has he i got my money and got the hell out of there let me know when i can open my eyes check it out boys what is it [Music] hey guys there's another tower just over the hill see any shoreline marks can't tell well it would appear we got here first let's uh check the place out and keep moving drawbridge now medieval yeah well you don't put up a drawbridge unless you're trying to keep people out or protect something inside the stairs are busted there's no way up to the crank i'll see if i can find something to stand on oh another sigil so do you recognize this one i do actually and bonnie operated out of the caribbean i thought she died in jail at least it's what the stories tell us right avery must have invited her too huh the shoreline must have been here before find us keepers hey be careful kid [Applause] hey guys there's a massive tower just past the drawbridge biggest one yet bingo same [Music] kid you all right i'm fine you all right yeah you got this you two just relax i got this i mean there's only one prank you know keep up the good work kids no warning shots [Applause] i woke up cranky today  there's more i see him turn around [Applause] let's go before more shorelines show up all right ah let's get that bridge down let's try that again there we go big tower on a volcano looks like the end's in sight huh [Music] i'm not the nitpick but avery spent all that money on towers wouldn't it kill them to put a guard rail up here [Music] gonna take a look around so just how much do you owe alcazar uh half half of what well he only knows about the guns weight heist which is worth 400 million right but if nathan's theory is correct and there's a lot more treasury well you should have told them it was 200 you never tell your partners how much a job is really worth i wasn't exactly expecting to be partners with there we go we're all set here we go slip and slide okay don't panic don't hold on panic kid i got you ah [Applause] come on come on [Applause] you okay i've been better get us out of this kid all right hang on now mary call the grace of the lord as with your pleasure being a woman who blesses the people they warm easy kid easy ah oh that was fun right yeah well i'm definitely sharing this one with my shrink wait you have a shrink no but i will after this come on you guys are overreacting the whole thing under control hold on to something ah that was a nice change of pace yeah i'm almost disappointed almost now let's find our way in let's go claim our treasure boys can't get in that way sam give me a hand with this yeah let's see what we got here huh looks like there's something back here sam yeah let's do this ah damn it's breaked over all right let's look around hey careful with that thing kid heads up jesus i said heads up [Music] hurry up you two and asia sam wait up come on this way he seems excited he's got a lot riding on this whoa magnificent i don't see a treasure though guys coming come check this out saint dismiss we meet again so what do we got more sigils there's our boy avery thomas two and that's uh it's adam baldridge it's uh joseph farrow and that's richard one hmm pirate captains all right so maybe your pirate pool theory wasn't so ridiculous after all all right so uh let's see what do you think the trick is here gotta push a button pull something well maybe maybe one of the arms or give it a shot come on boys whenever you're done fondling poor saint dismiss i think you might want to come take a look at this trapezoid is obviously the volcano the crown that's kings bay we got ourselves a map gentlemen factor you're a goddamn genius hear that nate genius yeah yeah okay so if we're here this tower lines up with avery sigil okay so then the other sigils must be the towers from avery's time well i mean our treasure's got to be in one of them right yeah but which one i count 12 towers hey uh victor huh he didn't start smoking cigarettes by any chance did you looks like we're not the first ones here oh [Music] shut up uh jesus not all of them let's hope so you okay yeah yeah fine sam yeah over here hey what are you doing confirming a suspicion look at this they figured out the towers too locations sigils the works so now what now what now we're screwed okay because there's three of us and there's god knows how many of them and they have a head start yeah but they don't know which tower to go to yet that's great nathan cause neither do we yes we do look it's a little worn down right there that's a match you sure because i mean it could be this one too crap ah but still two beats the hell out of 12. all right i'm gonna take this tower you and sully you take that no no no no no no no rafe's guys are all over these towers by now exactly so if we want to have a chance to catch them then we've got to split up sam just hold up a second will you lady's right these towers are at opposite ends of kings bay ah damn it uh if you run into any of those shoreline clowns you call us okay see you soon come on nate you gotta hurry all right there's our tower you really think all that treasure is gonna be just sitting in the middle of a goddamn market oh yeah that'd be crazy but we've seen crazy before um hey there little guy how you doing hey you like that power it's solid come on it's a lamer come on come say hi it's all right so cute do you what hey hey sully look who's back rabies snakes you know what after this is over and done with i'm gonna get a dog hey we come out of this in one piece i'll buy you the damn dog can i name it victor sure oh man something smells really good that's right it does smell good hey here we go blocked i guess we're gonna have to sneak in discreetly implied by the use of the word sneak hey sully i think we can squeeze through here that'll work jesus long way down you okay back there you keep your pace i'll keep mine yeah yeah well at least you got a great view right yeah okay let's see what we got edward england's sigil just like the map said so what are we looking for good question this is a very tall clock tower yes yes it is hmm now what do you bet

search my towel i i got nothing yeah no we're definitely in the right place make your way over here are you serious okay i'm on the way he's coming good sully way ahead of you whoa hey are those our boys yep henry avery thomas two partners in crime founders the founders of what worst scavenger hunt ever there are avery and two sigils these are a little different though yeah they got those star patterns on them they turn but which way are they supposed to go oh okay should we go look [Music] yeah just a second more pirate symbols adam baldridge and bonnie and uh christopher condont i mean there's there's too many permutations i say we see where that door leads still hoping for some treasure here hey look i was right baldrige bonnie and conden splendid but why are they here in the first

motto all the paradise references i can't really miss it see you two made it out okay way better than okay we found the vitalia liberty clipper what are you libertalia it seems avery founded the legendary pirate colony i was more of a pirate utopia really okay but what about the treasure see as the story goes this place provided a safe haven for hundreds maybe even thousands of pirates and they they shared everything property resources and they kept it all in one common treasury building okay so where is this commie pirate sanctuary right here that island just northeast of kings bay a rafe has a copy of this yeah well by the time ray figures it out we'll be well on our way to libertalia i'm telling you that treasure is as good as ours how's the malaysia job going nate seems like you're a hair off course elaine it's it's not what it looks like really because what it looks like is that you're searching for henry avery's buried treasure and given the shoreline soldiers that are all over town i'd bet you're not the only ones looking for it all right well i i guess it's kind of what it looks like but but i can explain look it's gonna sound crazy join me well for starters um this is uh sam sam drake my brother hi i'm sorry i i thought he had died in a panama jail but i was obviously very wrong he's been stuck in there for 15 years and it's because of me and the guy who broke him out wants a lot of money and the only way we can pay off the debt is avery's treasure but that's the good news we we found it it's it's on an island just off the coast just stop was there ever a malaysia job come on come on wait elena wait i don't get you okay i i wanted to tell you you know what enough no i wanted to but how could i i don't know just say it i had to protect you that is nate you just didn't have the nerve to face me again i knew you would react like this how would you react you lied to me for weeks if you were killed i i wouldn't have even known about it and now you have a brother who are you come on i'm me come on it's me it's different this time oh my god i have to save him i don't even care about the treasure the look on your face when you walked into this room if you're done lying to me then you should stop lying to yourself i got a plane to catch you do what you have to do hey hey what are you doing go after her we're not done here well maybe we should be what are you saying i'm saying maybe there's a smarter way to save sam such as such as we give him a new identity we we put him in hiding somewhere he's been in prison for 15 years he's not going into hiding okay fine you go after your wife sam and i will head off for libertality without me come on you'll get both of you killed really kid i've been doing this for a hell of a long time i think i might be able to hang out you want to be helpful sullivan go keep an eye on her whatever you say you need a hand thing i got it let's go pack your bags nathan yeah land hope [Music] anything about that huh that's pretty cool [Music] take the wheel for a second all this running around surviving by the skin of our teeth i think we've actually taken a moment i need to step back and appreciate just how far we've come pogba's back supervisor yeah [Music] listen little brother she will get over it and we bring back a treasure like that anyone would i don't know maybe i've uh done this one too many times [Music] huh somehow i imagined it bigger yeah well we're definitely in the right place i'll find us a spot to set ashore [Music] you
