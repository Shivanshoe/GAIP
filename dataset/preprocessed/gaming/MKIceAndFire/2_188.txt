[Music] this isn't forerunner it identifies as banished can you operate it in my sleep not that i sleep but oh i don't need to it's already on its way down incoming but what if it's a friend it isn't he did not specify in how many pieces it's too dangerous god [Music] you were right he was not friendly by the looks of him he was some sort of leader they called him tremonius not anymore that's almost funny welcome to my tower master chief it is where you will be broken it is where you will give up your secrets [Music] i see you soon the wall's retracted watch your back he could come from anywhere threat sensor can help you locate chatlock [Music] [Music] approach foreign failure is yours [Music] [Music] we need to get him out of that machine break open easy softy slime chief i see him i'm impressed i can't believe how easy you made that look now let's deal with that laser [Music] here we are as you can see we are ready to progress as soon as please excuse me please return get me to that terminal [Music] oh that's not so bad the structure's purpose is simple rebuild the ring well more specifically create the materials needed to repair it not gonna happen why it's such a beautiful oh the banished sorry i was distracted for a second there's so much to learn here shut it down permanently no no no what are you doing this is not acceptable you were supposed to be friendly this interference is deeply upsetting what's wrong with this [Music] [Music] very well i will thank you here [Music] this is exciting [Music] how dare you i have good news and bad news how many okay straight to the bad news a lot i count nine no ten spires more being deployed all the time active no not yet at least they appear to be waiting for an initialization sequence something is flooding the network trying to start it but there's resistance why the protocol that triggered all this wasn't exactly correct it worked well it started the process there's more bad news i can't shut it down exactly but i can remove it from the network of course i can find the source of the attack i just need to wait is it safe come on it's me an infiltration program designed oops i think she knows i'm how are you doing disconnect give me one second get it now it's done why don't you trust me what was that maybe taking it offline wasn't such a great idea we need to go like now immediate extraction my location oh god it was you wasn't it now i'm coming i'm coming oh come on [Music] [Music] open up go upload this fire locations all of them all of them um it looks like someone has marked 42 new locations which would be crazy right this one it was the source of the attack attack what's she talking about chief is everyone trying to kill you it kind of seems like it oh wait you're being sarcastic he's fun i like him am i dead i must be i mean this is a punishment right yep [Music] this isn't happening i'm going to have to make an emergency landing [Music] chief we've got well a lot see that chopper i guess that's one of the spartan killers and there's the other one up there in the wreckage you need to stop them [Music] if we're going to make any noise on this ring we need a base of operations speed to hell but a shelter defensive location no sign is banished activity yeah i think we found our rendezvous point [Music] [Music] okay so [Music] will not win i smell beer [Music] will not be stopped [Music] that wasn't easy was it what if esheram sends more let him echo 216. nothing but i think i can yes comms are still offline but i was able to activate his tracking beacon remotely he's he's out in the open the unsc ship graveyard i hope he's okay him again [Music] and look he brought friends did you hear me he has friends [Music] [Music] and what do you have please do not move immediately technology please that's him dealt with again there should be an elevator that will get us up top [Music] that's not good [Music] let's hope this is the last one another phantom please oh well i guess that's done we're safe for now you sure it's okay if i do this if it's safe or you'll delete me right good luck with that [Music] yes it worked no there's not a problem three two one we're done it's never done explain this to me i waited six months i've done everything you've asked i was supposed to be deleted you're the reason i'm still here you all of this you could not have done it without me none of it i trusted you why can't you do the same you don't understand try me cortana he's gone dead all that's left are echoes and sooner or later they'll be gone too will they are you two alive all the spiders are shutting down you did that right did we win or what he's ready for pick up you can leave me here i can't do that i'm not giving you a choice try not to get him killed too okay let's get up a spartan killer he doesn't stand a chance drag it already doing it open a gate find somewhere close it's not that simple why okay it's kind of simple but risky we save him or die trying there's a pretty high chance that could happen it's hard to lock down the coordinates do it portals open your plan has failed as have you harbinger the auditorium is partially rebuilt and that is enough i do not know find [Music] i out losing patience with her please tell me your mission was a success he will come to us are you sure uh keep him alive but have your firm you have earned [Music] [Music] this is highly unethical if you say so i prefer logical i do what it takes to ensure our survival we can debate the ethics should it fail but you made an ai of yourself catherine yourself is there a better candidate she will do anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished even if that means sacrificing herself or you to accomplish [Music] it hello master chiefs of the galaxy hear this message those of you who for those who refuse our offer and cling to their own place for you there will be great wrath it will burn the heart that consumes you and when you are gone we will take that which remains and we will remake it in our own image so what just happened you told me to get us close did you see that we passed right through a data cluster i guess it did feel i don't know real very real where now i don't know there's a lot of noise down here or up here or just here we need to find some place to break through figure out where we are and show down how big you are you break two [Music] good is scream for help it will not come our time is nearing its end [Music] he wanted to kill your friend but i promised him a sweeter kill or a warrior's death whatever the outcome know this the bandits controlled this ring we came for war a thousand legions occupy this world the auditorium will give up its secrets your interference is just [Music] an irritation [Music] fleeting i'm getting a read on echo216 he's right above us there he is we need to get him out of that thing uh you shouldn't have come for me i'm microgravity wells are putting enormous stress on his body i told you that i would not kill him leave me we'll get you out of here no you will try chief he's here he knows i'm here this was get him out of there our story will become legend told by those that survive you [Music] i will fight until my last breath your legend ends today [Music] show me what you can do [Music] any damage you inflict on escherim is transferred to echo 216. the power is transmitted via a series of relays around the room let's see if i can got it relays exposed destroy it shields ashram shield reactivated expose the relay got it go [Music] now's your chances next release exposed take it out is and it's down you know what to do final relay is exposed destroy it you here's hope when this should be done [Applause] that's it last relay destroyed echo 216 is saved chief er wants you to prove your legend time to prove it will be my legacy my greatest battle my last battle i'll tell you where you stand i'll crush you scare your teeth he did it help me get him out okay i can't i can't believe you came for me somewhere done now right it's over nothing ends my death will inspire a thousand others [Music] i died well i don't understand you showed him respect he was a monster yes but at the end he was just a soldier hoping he'd done the right thing questioning his choices i so is it over they're leaders dead right the intricacies of any action are complex what what are you talking about there will be consequences there always are what could be worse we need to move the harbingers at the auditorium whatever she's planning is worse i get it okay then i have one question before we leave what is it has anyone seen a pelican ow what what i'm just i had a lot going on i was busy [Music] [Music] accept my apology immediately my earlier efforts to delete you were misguided i thought she wanted to repeal this installation to restore it but i was wrong please hurry the scene is almost broken that they must not be released i'm starting to get a bad feeling about all this starting good points [Music] to learn about this is your great plan ended [Music] the consequences [Music] how could i have been so stupid made a coffee it was the only way there's that much time atriox takes control he has the ring a weapon pointed into the universe my fault my stupid fault not much time will this work there's a moment john will make it work he needs help of course is this your plan all along palsy or is it mine it doesn't matter now nothing else matters this has got to work he can't do it on his own he needs me he needs her it is time for you to make your choice i have thank you atriax you helped me you really did would you humor me if you knew how you were going to die how could you live your life differently i would change nothing perfect thank you what making things right it was her she destroyed the ring stopped my deletion why if anybody could have saved me it would have been you everything has gone from the uncertainty of your goodness i can't go on spoiling your [Music] we're here this is where cortana sacrificed herself [Music] me the silent auditorium for runner obviously it appears to be oh no what is it it's a courtroom a prison a place of execution all these things together why to call their sins we stood silent unable to speak as they passed judgment we could not defend ourselves we could not reason with them something's sending a signal before you ask i'm already tracking it hear this four runners your auditorium has fallen the endless bound your sins are done today we return what's she doing she's trying to open a connection between here and somewhere else on the ring where you deal with her and i'll find out [Music] me [Music] there i've intercepted the carrier wave from this transmitter very well prepare yourself well this i grow bored of this she switched transmitters rerouting the power through that one this isn't good the connection is sentient it's searching for something this must end now it's switched again it's found something what no idea but i doubt it's good wait there's something else here something's helping me it's almost a shame that you must [Applause] yours as well uh [Music] they are so close now [Music] there last one's is down it will not end stop this you have what you need tell them i am sorry took so long who is she talking to unknown the signal's old like really old my time is ended yours too they will make sure we need extraction of course you do on my way the endless will return i couldn't decrypt it in time it's okay you'll figure something out of course i will i'm they'll pair you with another ai maybe even another cortana model if halsey lets them it won't be me [Music] but you know that right but that doesn't matter it's just another echo she's right john just another echo sorry i'm messing with you i just had a feeling that's what she would say do you see what i see so much potential i'm sorry i didn't have long to plan this a few milliseconds really i hope it worked out look at us we just keep saying goodbye don't we but this isn't an end it's a chance to make amends to rectify mistakes and it starts here i was wrong i thought that i could do this on my own but i forgot that the whole point of all of this the entire reason that i chose you in the first place was that we were supposed to be a team perfectly suited perfectly matched perfectly perfect [Music] in these final moments i know what my last mission is i need to make sure you two learn from my mistakes become stronger because of them i chose well master chief i really did now it's up to you are you all right i don't know what to say scratch that we need to get out of here like now options i'm thinking yes i know i know think faster maybe there's a way to was that you would help if i said yes probably but we don't know where it's going or even if it's going anywhere any other suggestions no but this is a really bad idea [Music] let's not do that again i did try to tell you it was a bad idea chief your vegan just appeared out of nowhere oh i thought i lost you where did you go echo 216. stay put i'm coming to you where are we chief i think the better question is when are we i don't know how but we've been gone for days three days to be precise this ring is different than the others the banished and the harbinger we're looking for something that was never found why would the forerunners hide something and throw away the key doesn't that scare you no you of course not is anyone going to ask me what i think i guess not get inside big guy sorry i'm really happy to see you really happy so what do we do now we finish the fight yes sir the banished still control the rest of the ring wait i know this is weird given all that's happened but what what is it we still don't know your name we can't keep calling you echo 216 no you can't esparza fernando esparza it's nice to meet you esparza fernando esparza good work soldier and what about you what about me what do i call you any ideas well do you think it would be okay you're sure you get to choose your name then i think i think i might have the perfect one all right here we go [Music] get ready [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so you
