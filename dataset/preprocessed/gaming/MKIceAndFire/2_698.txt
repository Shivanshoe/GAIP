skunk car's outside so what giving up in your story i won't learn anything about maelstrom's music got lots of footage i need to look through it see what i can patch together okay come on just hope the car is still where i parked it brick was the safe option really should have talked to the asses from tinnitus you got some sort of in with them brick invited me to one of their gigs problem is the lineup changes every time [Music] oh for [ __ ] sake could have been worse this is what you got to see in here [ __ ] souvenirs i'm headed straight back to the editing room wanna talk gotta come with me conquer like this hope it gets us there in one piece all right so what's carrie want wants to bring back samurai one gig one night there is no samurai without silverhand gonna be a gig in silverhand's honor let's get into kerry all of a sudden thought he got over this ages ago well guess it doesn't really matter what's in it for me a reunion with some old friends ah come on carrie and johnny were friends that's it we just floated around sometimes got in their way so what do you want an interview with kerry i could write that myself straight out of my ass i'd want access to all his industry contacts associates not a problem not as far as i can see [Music] we're here hop out all right so the concert tell carrie i'll put it together be in touch okay thanks went pretty damn well now call mix it carrie hey so how'd it go talk to nance yep she agreed even said she'd organize the cake still a control freak awesome ran into a few hiccups with a good folk from maelstrom [ __ ] yeah listen i caught henry dragged him out of rehab great story actually henry didn't know denny's been in night city all this time on his way over to see her now gonna be a surprise we're all gonna meet over at dennis what me too why can't him play with us aren't you gonna meet the others send you the address [Music] [Music] hmm see those [Music] she must have been renovating henry must have borrowed the truck gonk always was good at improvising maybe they're home try the intercom right then guess we keep looking so see kerry beat us here you [ __ ] got pooh boy daddy sounds sadly what are you doing here this is raining your house ah good you're here we got your [ __ ] pool you're gonna pay for this you pieces this is supposed to be henry's surprise you bet i will yeah i just so i can come back again looks like maybe then you'll tell me why the hell you left me so he flooded the pool with concrete left henry did often get emotional oh i wish you would [ __ ] die you know what happened between them from what i've come to understand one day then he disappeared without a word then hid from henry imagine that wasn't too hard in his state of mind either out of it or in rehab introduced me to the faith that is till i gave henry anywhere near them and you're dead what about the concert i can't i've got a chance to i'm a whack then [ __ ] head off doesn't look good though v talk to them what carrie will just make i don't know uh not really my business but i lost years of my life carrie didn't piss all over himself out of joy when he saw me either is that how you remember it remember a hell of a lot more than you this your backup case you forgot why the hell you came here in the first place carrie sent me it's about the concert what concert why isn't he here talking to me look it's awkward carrie considers you both friends what a sensitive guy [ __ ] given he's the one who set this flaming turd bag on my doorstep we're bringing back samurai one night only that's what he wants to get the crew together for sweet but no [ __ ] way not about to play with this [ __ ] steve danny no no way either him or me choose then he digs in her heels we're done how's it going like [ __ ] man danny wants me out of the gig and we already agreed on everything what kerry's paying you that's what this is about [ __ ] it's all [ __ ] great so you get him away from me and get the [ __ ] off my lawn don't make me choose maybe someone would tell me what happened are you blind [ __ ] filled my pool with cement maybe he had a good reason really a reason you out of your [ __ ] mind with the pool you knew carrie wanted to get danny to play with us just wanted to clear the air [ __ ] preem you gotta go without one or the other uh yeah not a problem should be able to borrow someone else from one gig won't be the same though it won't ever be the same kerry pretty sure it's your call [ __ ] really pisses me off then he's on a control kick setting conditions on the other hand henry's got scop for brains can't trust him thanks real helpful uh if we gotta choose let's play with danny [ __ ] kerry seriously she's the one making a big deal out of this not me listen i'll get you you know what carrie [ __ ] you good thing silverhand isn't here to see this you done get out all right what about nancy we made contact she's gonna set it all up and let us know see at the show [ __ ] now i gotta find someone to clean this up okay about all we can do for now except wait for nancy to call everything okay no just the sight of that douche wad reminded me how not okay it is don't worry though i'll be past it by showtime wonder what henry did to her so his fault after all well normally denny's not a raging [ __ ] we're pretty sure she knew henry wanted this concert hmm doubt she really gave a [ __ ] about the pool hey giggs all set up super sweet like tonight at the red dirt talk to carrie didn't change his mind or anything no no not at all he's pretty stoked in fact haven't seen him like this since the silver hand days what about henry still not on board didn't even try not wasting my breath on that dick tip well so see you tonight and don't worry about your axe got the gear all rounded up hey v v got something for you to know if you know but once upon a time this was silver hands [ __ ] nancy just gets [ __ ] done should just whisper mikoshi in her ear we'll be all set the loose orpheum remember that samurai graffiti in haywood where the bakery used to be uh-huh got painted over a while ago but yeah johnny was holding the orphy in there nice one where'd you find it it's like fresh off the shelf bought it private collection always like to have everything down to the last detail gets too obsessed at times but gotta respect her hustle how about you tell me what happened with henry ancient history but falling into all sorts of crap then i'd have to dig him out you got tired of getting your hands dirty all the time all wrong managed to get him a gig with a decent band henry quit using got his [ __ ] together things were going great so he booted me out of his life [Applause] what happened next you get off on this sort of drama he ditched me partied with his new pals for a month then they tossed him out because he started acting up again ran into him on the street total mess gonk even fainted for effect what did you do left him right there and made damn sure he couldn't find me again how are you feeling ahead of the show weird like i'm about to pretend to be myself plus johnny's out never thought i'd say i missed the bastard but damn well do hey thanks for putting the gig together please carrie couldn't twiddle his own [ __ ] without my help silver hand was probably the same worse at least carrie did what i told him to do kept out of my hair where's carrie should be here any minute told me you play really well better be true because there won't be a dress rehearsal right can't let that full house down honestly i got no idea who these people are just strays carrie didn't want word to get around yeah well we'll see about that you think the media caught wind of this for sure hyenas i'd worry more about henry's replacement carrie got drouson from cutthroat to join us i know him seen him play man he ain't good he's fine just fine you're the mystery dish here pill time just be discreet and if i start puking blood again don't go making a scene this is carrie's big nut got a feeling nancy doesn't think i can keep up with him well she's right ready to thrash i don't know maybe this isn't such a good idea now you mention it it's getting worse maybe this gig isn't worth it fine go out and play i'll just sit back tend to my bleeding ears okay fine you got me have fun uh let's motor there you are this is drowsy from cutthroat hey big fan huge fan you two got all their albums i mean i never dreamed he's in the same boat as you want to talk to a star talk to me and get that shaking under control i think my shakes are the same or worse crowd got you stressed or is it me [ __ ] you and missed you too [Music] all right let's do this [Applause] hello [Applause] freedom is slavery [Applause] pay for pasta [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] supreme [Applause] [Music] [Applause] shut down [Applause] [Applause] this is [ __ ] up what is 40s actually got pretty nervous for this thing felt like i had something to prove to myself to you and whoever the [ __ ] but all i did was have a good time that's it wanna do it again huh no that was enough in that case here take it as a souvenir you sure won't play without you just wouldn't be the same see what you're doing here but i still plan on playing he's gone isn't he yeah yeah but he can still hear you thanks but not in the mood for hovering tables and voices from beyond the grave right now you should hang on to this actually how's the gig hella free samurais found its new growth damn shame i had to miss it yeah you can still come to my show you shouldn't have really the very gun i tried to shoot johnny with when he broke into my house meaning you tried to shoot me yeah and early then i might cool i feel like i fell asleep woke up 50 years later back to work then take care of me i'll be in touch well it wasn't so bad was it too bad care's gone off guess he had somewhere to be badly probably writing a new song as we speak isn't that what you wanted to make him feel better better but not that good johnny don't ever leave me again i can't live without you a little of that could go a long way hope that's it for last requests maybe now you get a chance to do what you will gotta go talk to hanako fast okay your choice let's go [Music] lizzy what in the [ __ ] now i get the rush me i i i was angry i i pushed him these [ __ ] arms these hands oh my god you ever wake up in the middle of the night [ __ ] and not know who you were for a second or i mean you ever feel like you weren't really you i that's how i feel all the time every moment this emptiness this helplessness i stopped seeing creating just now i i i just wanted to break up with him you know tell him i wanted him out of my life but i i don't even know how when i i you strangled him lizzy slowly you crushed his spine i i was angry i must have lost control so liam really did have a reason to be afraid of you i didn't mean to understand i didn't mean to sure maybe it's all the same to him though so this is about the body right that's why you called yes i the media can't hear about this got it that would be huh the world would eat it up a tale of the temptation to control another's memory a grim reminder that a person is merely a collection of bites that can be copied reproduced copied reproduced lizzy snapped the [ __ ] out of it what about the body i don't know do whatever take it somewhere burn it i'll pay you no not doing it something's something's not right lizzy no quite the contrary everything's finally falling into place govi and shut

be fireworks [Applause] what's your rush hello oh hey v you calling about something or just wanted to catch up the former found your job posting about swedenborg riviera on the net oh that wow i completely forgot about that whole thing so um is it uh is it still going i mean i still want to scroll a segment about it so if you can find anything at all on swedenborg i'll pay you back in black caviar and champagne but i doubt you'll find anything new what have you managed to dig up so far short story [ __ ] all and the long story well it looks like swedenborg riviera isn't just a radical philosopher an economist but a damn good net runner too jack of all trades could you tell me more i could but it'd be a waste of your time i'm telling you the guy's a ghost i can't hear to try right well aren't you just bursting with a can-do attitude have it your way then i've started looking into all this about a year ago right after one of swedenborg's followers lobbed a molotov into the helvetia branch tried finding some way to reach the guy came up blank total brick wall hired a private eye also came up with squat in the ip link to the account he would have used cloaking demons but there's always a mark a trace well well i didn't know i was dealing with such a pro here guess what i tried that i managed to pinpoint the sig to santo domingo but linking it to any specific address was a non-starter districts jam-packed with units as i'm sure you know at some locals if anyone saw or heard anything cash in hand zilch nada dried up all my leads got it listen send me the coordinates to the last data term that relayed the signal okay i'll take a look worst case i'll lose an hour of my life best case well who knows hey if you're offering why not but seriously v i wouldn't get my hopes up happy hunting i'm sending the coordinates the vehicle that went dark near to where you are now thanks i'll try to find it and reset [Music] [Music] [Applause] why this obsession with sweden [ __ ] hoping once you find him he'll spill the meaning of life here i'll save you the trouble life makes no sense with you in my head agreed now how about some quiet time i can't think you stopped thinking long before i got here but sure blame it all on the guy in your head wait wait wait i need to look around okay what do you want ugh hmm pirate router think this is our swedes doing only one way to find out sig's a match with what nancy was tracking and goes further out to the badlands like a server proxy don't tell me that's where we're at why shouldn't i because this is all one big waste of time the [ __ ] do you care about a borg [ __ ] swede he rubs out sayings like a randy teenager and the whole world's guzzling it up the three branches of government is a lobotomy on the people's autonomy i mean what the [ __ ] oh i i get what's going on here you're jealous jealous about this [ __ ] swede you out of your [ __ ] mind because he's the one all the anarchists and fist bumpers are quoting while you played in piss-soaked dives for a bunch of stoned zit faces don't talk [ __ ] about what you don't know happy [ __ ] trails ugh well v there's just techie big pete he just made an appearance in the badlands only i'd rather he had it catch my meaning i'm sending some info on the static scum your way seriously making me look for you come on [Music] no [ __ ] mercy new magazine detected message to user thanks please come on oh so mature discharge i'm sorry [Music] you're tough as nails v a warrior without mercy consider the contract fulfilled well done [Music] here appears again oh yeah where could it be maybe over by that truck [Music] damn another router sounds like this sweetboard really values his privacy oh i moved on top i was but it's not like i got anyone else to talk to i'd go through your memories but i don't want to puke all over your hip and canvas well hack away or whatever it is you were gonna do please something happened so [Music] ha i've got a feeling someone's messing with you fee you'll follow this breadcrumb trail and when you connect the dots all you'll see is a dick i'm sure you would love that wouldn't it [ __ ] ai would that [ __ ] would be the first thing swedenborg did that actually made any sense except he'd probably give it some pretentious name like patriarchal phallus upholding toxic masculinity what do you think i think it's time we moved on oh so [Applause] [Music] ah christ finally look get far enough from the smell even night city could be beautiful [ __ ] let me guess another router my dick theory starting to seem like a real possibility [Music] and signal leads to another place yep hey maybe this is all part of swedenborg's message life is movement [ __ ] the destination it's how you get there that counts sounds like straight up [ __ ] to me finally something we agree on so where's this next lead get us a yoga class a tibetan monastery no to uh to an amusement park oh the plot thickens oh [Music] i'm trying to make it is is [Music] um [Applause] trail cuts off here so what [ __ ] hiding here someplace maybe or maybe we get to another terminal have to see funny area this kind of compliments our guy's style doesn't how this theme park another parody of capitalism run amok cheap entertainment for brain dead gonks that's how capital is the blood of the global system of oppression money is a tool used by the colonial oppressors of our minds class division is the breeding ground wait what the hell is this what it looks like swedenborg riviera come one come all for the prophet of night city ha oh that's too good a wind-up philosopher in a box hand me a couple of eddies see what he cranks out next how how's this even possible not a [ __ ] clue but jesus me how beautiful is this half the nets getting tweaked on wisdom from a puppet in a glass case hairs are being split is flying over interpretation oh man let me tell you 50 years of soul prison was worth it for this moment right here the means of production should belong to the collective unconscious your luck shall turn around when the means of production will flow on an endless stream of endorphins you scroll in this well we need to save these for posterity's sake capital is the blood of the global system of oppression somebody must have tampered with this thing seriously what you think you're gonna find a jack in a box who wants to become a real boy look someone hooked swedenborg up to the net what are you waiting for let's see what secrets are flowing in those cables [Music] foreign okay so if i'm getting this right someone hacked into this fortune teller bot reject its algorithm to spew out anti-establishment aphorisms instead of profit and then hooked it up to the net through a system of routers that masks the signal origin pure [ __ ] genius can we find whoever did this i need to shake their hand unlikely for two reasons first they didn't leave a trace second you're dead johnny oh right when i get in a good mood i forget that hey v don't turn it off huh don't worry johnny i'm not going to take away night city's philosopher of the people huh well then the swedenborg riviera longman [Music] [Applause] hold on i got a better idea while accompanied to a joyful accordion what the huh what all his fans think oh man i know you and i don't always click but i've got to say you've got your purse cops are gathering data from the fest of the financial merry-go-round become the obese narwhal in heat amidst the blazing ice success is the delusion of the souls no i i meant the royal wii so about swedenborg it's all a big hoax say what now it's an automated fortune teller strings words into deep sounding this this this story is even better than i thought i'll take it from here oh you're uh your eddies on their way now thanks the object of their passion hi there v how's it going it depends on what the it is and what you want to hear oh you know yuge i longed phoebe oh i see you've already played out this conversation all on your own force of habit pan am i did though i missed you how's it going with rogue it's going knock on wood so things are settled for now we're good at avoiding each other and that's fine with me no complications with kang tao so far so good they sent another patrol around the station but they're dead set that it was raffin that downed their av and attacked helmand's guards station's proprietors stick into that version so we're covered for now hear about santiago used to be a nomad long time ago ever heard of our lord and savior jesus christ why is folk suddenly recollecting santiago a friend of mine did a job with once that's one old friend you got he's a legend all right wouldn't say he was my role model but well he was the man for his time and place you don't think he was all he was cracked up to be they say it was a big city nomad best of both worlds except there ain't no such thing you're either loyal to your family or you ain't doesn't loyalty to your friends count for something maybe it does but then you end up like santiago he snuffed it custom lunatic wanted to blow arasaka to smithereens what a friend hmm how's jake holding up not so great we managed to stem the bleeding but without that implant what's going on jake got hit badly he needs a new kidney as of this minute only problem is he's got sickle cell anemia he'll need a specially customized kidney implant as you can imagine that kind of thing isn't easy to come by out here in the badlands raph and shiv were they the ones behind this we pulled through this turn barely shrapnel cart jake half an inch below his flat jacket that's a tough break it still isn't too late to save him but time's running out you can find an implant like that in night city no questions asked right dakota called up her contact at one of the hospitals was told they could work something out but but that means getting to the city and you see the state the camp's in raph and shiv could come back at any moment it's all hands on deck you know where this is going v i won't beat around the bush can you help us you can count on me i know v dakota's contact works at a hospital in little china all you have to do is pick up the implant the money will take a more secure route got you see you later then [Music] you
