eddie eddie brock listen to me eddie this this isn't you no josh eddie you're not a killer anymore don't you get it you're not in your right mind oh radiation not boarding this train eddie you're not the engineer driving it right now hang on parker just hold him off another few seconds i'm almost there oh my god you had no reason i didn't need a reason other than to make it easier to kill you o'hara it looks like you called him [Music] parker parker are you there peter peter [Music] [Music] i keep trying to tell myself that i'm just jealous of walker sloane's progress it was only five years ago that he first showed up at alcomax talking about harnessing energy from the fourth dimension now he won't stop until he's running the place i know his type he's thinking beyond alcamax aiming towards who knows what he's the exact type of corporate monster i've sworn to reign in especially if he's mucking with time travel the year 2099 might not be much but it's all mine and he's not going to change it [Music] he's been siphoning alcamac's resources into converting the gateway in the old virtual unreality lab into something else something dangerous i've tried talking to him but he's got no time for miguel o'hara but people make time for spiderman just use the convenient access to the ventilation system to get inside and then walker and i can have a little chat whatever sloan's up to i've got to shut it down before he gets in over his head and drags everyone and everything down with him [Music] i see they've been keeping busy in the cybernetics division that's a lot of shocking robots down there during the day as miguel o'hara alchemax i could have walked right in but at night the security protocols kick in [Music] the genetics lab without that department i wouldn't be the man i am today [Music] sloan's gotta be around here somewhere i just know it [Music] you'd think the largest tech developer in the world could afford to cover their air ducts for extra comfort so there you are holographic assistant online how may i serve you mr sloan hello joseph run a final check and initiate security bioscans preparing systems this won't take long bioscan sequence initiated access to time research down miguel take your time don't want to get caught here i'll come next should be thanking me star fujikawa industries is going to take over this entire corporation unless someone steps up you're the only one who thinks outside the box enough to do it yes joseph i know [Music] i knew he was up to something [Music] i'm almost embarrassed it took me so long to come up with it i simply go back in time and launch alchemix years before it was originally founded not only can i remake altimax in my image but you can dismantle stark fujikawa before it gets started you're a genius sir i programmed you well joseph oh no you don't get away from me that easily of course the ceo will want me to have that degree of power he's all about power but he won't have anything to say about it by the time i'm done [Music] security scan sequence initiated [Music] [Music] yep he's heading for his time research lab all right there's an access point near the generator um [Music] ugh no way this thing's almost fully charged and i don't have a clue how to shut it down only chance is to get to the lab before it's too late if i don't get there in time he could actually pull this off go into the past and tamper with who knows what my huh almost at walker's lap [Music] huh uh [Music] get back here oh [Music] [Music] it's changed everything's changed but it didn't start here it started back then back around peter parker's time he can't fix it because he's gonna be dead it's an abomination is what it is am i the only newspaper man in the city that realizes what a menace that webhead is oh jonah um indoor voice okay i'm trying to get mary jane on the phone people lionizing that freak next thing you know there'll be a musical about him with a chorus line of dancing spiderman i'd pay to see that oh mary jane hi [Music] go see a show uh mj i would love to but i'm working with dr octavius in the genetics lab on a dna project i had a download a sample of my own dna into the permanent alkamax genetic files i'm still waiting for some test results permanent files huh great so 100 years from now we can clone you yeah i don't think so well how about i come there and we grab a late dinner afterward okay tiger sure it's okay anything for you babe and i love when you call me tiger it's like a blast from the past he did it that lunatic actually did it and i saw it all intruder in time research lab maximum force can be used [Music] get the shock out of my way they're great robot sentries not sure i can take them right now maybe i can draw him off move fast enough to distract him with some decoys [Music] [Music] you shouldn't be fighting me [Music] who taught you you're not even slowing me down [Music] communications [Music] [Music] peter peter parker who's that who's talking miguel o'hara the spider-man from 2099. are the other me's in my head too no it's just me and you old-timer i threw together a coronal link program using a sample of your dna it's allowing me to communicate with you at the point in time it was taken i just wish it was from earlier on we have almost no time time until what until you're killed and until i'm white now cause it kind of sounded like you said kill listen a lunatic named walker sloane from 2099 created a time gateway it was a one-way trip that dumped him sometime in the 1970s he then used his advanced knowledge to build alchemax years before it was supposed to be established transforming your world and mine but i work for alcomax you're saying that somehow wrong completely at this point in time you earn a living taking news pictures for jay jonah jameson the late night ranting tv news guy forget it you can't forget it where does this so-called death happen sloan's building another gateway on the 66th floor so he can finally travel back and forth i saw you being killed right there by who i couldn't make it out it doesn't matter get out of the building so a crazed killer can wander around the building without me to stop him no way besides if i find this guy somewhere else then i'm invincible because i can only die at the gateway right it's not an exact science parker meaning what you want to spend an hour getting a crash course on temporal physics no then do what i say you've got a lot to learn about priorities pal i'm gonna do what i think is right and that means going after bad guys you want a spider-man who'll do whatever you want go play a video game what was that spider-sense save yourself from me eddie brock anti-venom he's the one gunning for me but he's reformed [Music] i've got the intruder cited now they're teleporting guards that's spiffy new tech all employees thank you wait what did you say i can't hear you we need to work out the kinks of this time travel communications thing if it's gonna have any hope of catching on parker focus on what's important i am which is why i'm heading up to the 66th floor if that's where we're supposed to butt heads maybe i could draw him out in route i'm gonna go look for an elevator do you want to die of course not i want to run away even less [Music] people come and go so quickly [Music] for crying out loud you're not a killer anymore [Music] hmm [Music] [Applause] [Music] warn you what the shock what happened the elevator i'm in just changed into a closet huh rock just tried to kill me with an elevator weird coincidence maybe not wait wait wait wait what something i did here had an effect on you in 2099 that's impossible well theoretically it's not the idea is called quantum causality the two gateways created a link between our times like a wormhole through the fourth dimension right normally changing the past just creates an alternate timeline but thanks to the wormhole what you do there affects my time and vice versa so i can change things here now that can immediately change things in the future that's amazing spectacular even so the security system has all the entrances blocked i gotta come back here after i take out the security mainframe parker my path to the 66th floor is blocked by some kind of force field welcome to my world huh hi um is it okay with you if i destroy that security mainframe behind the glass protect security mainframe it's worth a shot do come again [Music] i'm about to destroy the security mainframe how you doing oh you still stuck yeah so listen and learn newbie [Music] that solved both our problems right my force field just changed in the centuries robot guards this whole quantum causality thing is a real wild card i can't control if it makes things better or worse well at least i can get through the door now [Music] [Music] so this quantum causality could it run both ways affecting my time as well as yours because it's happening all the bad guys just froze and by that i mean it's possible [Music] [Music] wow okay now to get back to that sealed door through the elevator shaft the force field should be down by now uh as it is only for your protection anyone working after hours will not be eligible for workload compensation if wounded or killed the real land down under demolishing uh oh [Music] [Music] uh oh [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] foreign you're holding back eddie you realize this time travel story of yours is gonna cost me my job it's not your job it's not even your reality yeah that's what you keep saying but how do you know because i do and deep down so do you now let me concentrate hide my own problems right now yeah well i can't help you with that maybe you can parker you're making this harder for me not easier i told you trying to control this quantum causality thing was a stupid idea they said penicillin was stupid too we're talking about the fabric of reality not breadville just get ready to help me bread mold sheesh i cannot believe his crust [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh [Music] uh there the elevator i need is right at the end of this hallway parker i'm in a jam and you put me there hey i was having a quiet evening until you started talking inside my head don't blame me for this all right fine what do you need me to do o'hara great he's gone [Music] parker stop screwing around and get me out of this okay i'm not a time travel expert how do i wait wait wait wait what if i just trash the robotic research facility is that worth a try anything's worth a try stop yelling at me i'm just learning about this whole quantum causality thing learn faster okay i'm there i'll destroy the prototype parts and we'll see what happens at least one of us will [Music] ah [Music] [Music] i can't believe a man's life is depending on a theory still with me o'hara faster faster would be better i'm doing my best best not good enough no o'hara hang on o'hara there's nothing left in the trash you're still there yeah for the most part did they turn into something else like i don't know kittens yeah small metal robotic killer kittens thanks for getting me out of there kind of proves the quantum causality theory now just tell me who wins the next ten world series and we'll call it either the world what you're killing me i'm not but you will if you go to the 66th floor 66th floor i know and we both know i'll do what i have okay fine if plan a keeping you out of danger isn't working then we'll go for plan b i'll get down to my own 66 board see if we can solve this i'll try not to die [Music] uh uh [Music] uh [Music] wow alcomax isn't kidding around [Music] [Music] huh um [Music] i need a security pass for that door and i'm hemorrhaging time especially if parker arrives before i do if only he had listened to me wait please [Music] ugh [Music] hey scrappy i need your built-in pass key end it over have to get back to that locked door fast [Music] [Music] parker slow down wait for me to get to my 66th floor instead of my slowing how about you hurt figures [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] hello [Music] [Music] huh [Music] huh ah parker a hallway here just changed it wasn't me maybe brock smashed the wall or something i'm just trying to stay alive if you were you'd clear out but you have to prove your bravery bravery dude there is nothing i would like better than to just hightail it out of here then why the shock don't you because what i do here matters okay beyond changing hallways into elevators it matters and that's just something i have to live with even if it means i die with it you get it o'hara another locked door every door in here is sealed so little trust in the world these days i just need to find the right sentry robot [Music] attention intruder security forces please remember that you can be disposed of with minimal pain [Music] so where are you nearly where you don't want me to be slow down would you how about you speed up yeah i'll get right on that only way to move fast enough is to go free fall in the elevator shaft shortest distance between two points is a straight line on my way parker parker [Music] huh [Music] uh [Music] yes shot huh [Music] parker it happened again oh crying out loud it wasn't me oh great shock it gotta get back up there fast before parker reaches his own 66 floor ahead of me parker you're hanging in there oh sure hanging crawling leaping all part of the service and you can stop worrying about me mommy especially since i'm the one who keeps having to bail you out i'll keep worrying until this is done how close are you to the 66th floor parker shut up i just spotted rock i'll be in touch parker parker are you great gotta wrap this thing up before it turns into an even bigger disaster than it already is [Music] at least there's an alternate route it'll slow me but i can still get to the 66th floor as required you shouldn't be fighting me [Music] another time shift it looks like the only way up to the 66th floor is through the ventilation [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] get the shock out of my winds [Music] who taught you what a fight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is nuts old nuclear plants had less protection than this [Music] [Music] [Music] finally made it back to where i was [Music] parker i made it to the 66th floor where are you is this anti-venom still hiding i'm face to pasty face with anti-venom eddie you're responsible for the explosions trying to blow you up you were really trying you'd [Music] [Applause] what's happening there parker anti-venom's fighting himself more than he is me some cuteness control chips would do the job how dangerous is this guy he drains my powers on contact and he's invisible to my spider sense terrific well where are you now and can you avoid anti-venom 66th floor and yeah maybe i could avoid him plus if his explosions bring the building down people for blocks around will be killed ah [Music] gotta find a way to get eddie brock free of whatever's controlling him there you are eddie you're being controlled fight it fight you instead can't quit now he took off again yeah if only you'd do the same o'hara if you don't get that i can't turn my back on danger no matter what the cost then you've got no business calling yourself spider-man wow i'm hurt guess what else i am still alive let's hope you get to keep saying the same thing i'm sure the switch for that door is around here somewhere yes security has been activated [Music] [Applause] ah that almost cut me in half we've been a lot of things to each other eddie but you've never been anyone's patsy oh good stand there and call them names shouldn't get myself scarce eddie listen you've got a chip inside you that's making you do this just making it easier the longer that thing's in you the more it's rewiring your thinking no no it can't [Music] parker what are you doing because it's causing major problems here i've got to get the atomic energy regulators out of the way so they're not destroyed so i'm in danger of frying from radiation because of explosions on your end hey you're the one who told me about quantum causality yeah well now i'm telling you to fix this sheesh okay o'hara the first regulator's safe the radiation level is dropping but my costume's providing me some protection from it but it's not gonna last forever and just give me a minute to take care of the other two regulators i mean it's about all i have [Music] i've gotten the second regulator to safety is it still affecting things on your end yeah it's still dropping but a cumulative effect if it's not stopped entirely that body parts started falling off yet no i'm still in one what do you mean yet are you planning to make this go away or not you know you gotta learn to lighten up i'll take care of the last one everything will be fine you're not the one who could end up as a human nightlife [Music] uh-oh what do you mean uh-oh this door should do the job o'hara tell me you're okay better than okay i'm back up to full strength i hate to admit it but this quantum causality thing of yours is actually pretty effective no glad you approved you know for something that makes no freaking sense at all dead end no wait there's an air duct i can get to brock that way it doesn't look like an automatic door it's a two-man operation but i can move fast enough after i hit that switch to get through i just need a breather [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] okay [Music] attention security immediately [Music] pull it together spidey attention security intruder must be neutralized uh what the heck are these it looks like they escaped from the museum of unnatural history now [Music] speed uh [Music] back off eddie you're a puppet fight the puppet master not me difficult for me you don't know what you're doing i know enough you have to die or we both can live you think you're so much better than i am acting like you're so worried about me i'm worried about what you'll do to other people and yeah to me but if you can fight it he can't trust me oh yeah i always trust people who are trying to kill me so you're the head lunatic well we haven't been properly introduced i'm the guy who's gonna stop your plans good luck with that anti-venom finish him can't i can't impressive resistance but activating all the control chips releasing your more beastial side should do the trick [Music] how do we do this you anymore great self-healing nothing's ever easy what's going on i'm taking care of brock that's the last thing you want to do if you i lose kill you myself this is one of your last mornings oh um hello eddie we all done here huh how about that miguel good news turns out you were wrong i hope that doesn't wound your ego what you think if you die i'll be happy to be right i don't think you're happy to be wrong well then you know as little about me as you think i know about you what i know is that brock looks to be down for the count better make sure though so can we call this one a wrap eddie maybe go grab some coffee laugh about it okay guess i can go back now and take out sloan once and for all oh great no spider-sense no no trying to cure you go cure yourself nice try didn't work yes it did now to finish the job [Music] stay back brock stay back [Music] the chip they stuck in you is messing with your power fight it eddie you're about to die eddie don't you get it this is your chance to take back your mind you can end this now yes and this good uh o'hara you might get to be right after all believe me that's the last thing i want [Music] hey [Music] uh [Music] you should be fighting me [Music] i'm about to reach the gateway room and when you get there then what don't worry yeah why would i you've got to be kidding me parker it's another time distortion blocking my way don't blame me i'm not blaming anyone i need to find another way to the gateway room i better avoid whatever that stuff is [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] um oh era you might want to get a move just hold on a little longer are you kidding me if brock wasn't busy fighting what's controlling him i'd be a blue and red squatch by now point taken i'll hurry [Music] huh [Music] [Music] house [Music] fantastic ugh [Music] so [Music] it's getting kind of complicated on my end but i'm almost there you still haven't told me what happens once you get there the only thing i can think of is to go back to your time swell we'll do lunch [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] parker you still with us not for much longer if brock has anything to say about it o'hara maybe i would have listened to you he didn't keep saying shock all the time no you did listen you just did what you had to do i didn't think i'd have to die for it no you won't trust me get you through this almost that makes two of us um foreign and but i've had 100 years to plan this keep your friends close and your enemies closer i kept you close to keep an eye on you make use of you but now you're done and i'm done with you o'hara a little help o'hara if you're there i got nothing left no power no no nothing you tried to warn me i was an idiot stop talking about yourself in the past tense this isn't over spoken like someone who's in here i will be just hold on [Music] i'm doing what i can come on parker where's that never say die attitude i don't need to say it do it and i'm out of jokes oh that was close over no way no shocking way are you giving me brave last words i'm losing my patience [Music] uh [Music] [Music] you shouldn't be fighting me [Music] huh [Music] oh [Music] come on spidey hold it together just another few seconds let's get your straight back no not this time why the shock didn't he listen to me i should have found a way to get him to listen so [Music] [Music] so what have you got me into the middle of walker i'm just a scientist for the love of octavius you knew i was out to change the future i didn't know the future was going to start fighting back the forces were unleashing with this quantum tunnel under control it's out of control and spider-man is still alive to stop it we'll just send anti-venom after him the gateway just needs a minute to recharge if it's going to send him through safely this has to work it has to [Music] oh gateway's powering up oh no you don't bring it on you pasty-faced patsy what the hell the place is crawling with spider-men don't worry anti-venom will step on this one i don't understand why aren't anti-venom's powers draining his because mine are radiation-based if you have to know didn't know don't care nice try i've got my own boobs this works for the first sweater new spiderman in town whatever [Applause] that's what's controlling antivirus his regenerating must have brought up to the surface so uh [Music] oh so [Applause] um [Applause] [Music] some kind of monsters breaking in where'd they come from just keep calm they're probably mutation experiments from all the generation eggs in that lab most likely they'll want to eat you for raw materials good thing you told me to stay calm that makes it all better i'll change things here to fix things there here there wait am i in 2099 yeah but if i destroy the regeneration eggs here it'll eliminate the experiments there parker you still with me parker oh i'm sorry sitting in this egg my mine's a little scrambled peter i'm here okay just parker tell me you're safe dude just because i'm stuck in an egg doesn't mean i go over easy oh boy i'm going after anti-venom you're trying not to get killed again [Applause] good try amy pull it together [Music] won't do to me first [Applause] that's all you do check your breath okay to me your history [Applause] you did it to me planted that chip in me controlled me i didn't control you brock i freed you we both know you wanted spider-man dead you should be thanking me let me show you just how grateful i am no give back one side you fool [Music] spinning i can barely stand [Music] where am i you're in 2099 parker the cellular regenerator healed you i i hope my medical insurance covers that look focus parker we have to test the gateway toss something small into it ah oh come on o'hara that wasn't coming back from the dead entitle me to a breather we need to see if the gateway is reestablished and every second okay okay okay fine i'm on it house now i'ma toss a piece of junk to see if the gates work in one way incoming it came through perfect plus i'm feeling like my old self strengthen everything yeah well it's a good thing the cellular regenerator had your dna on record good stand back uh what do you mean i'm coming through the gateway wait the return circuits are fried i won't be able to come through even if you set it up on that end i'll be stuck here so fix it i can't the technology doesn't exist here yet you need to find the repair parts on your side and then send them through i'll guide you to where they are oh what the heck is that what happened i'm looking at a tentacle the size of a buick yeah something like that came at me when the gateway first got overloaded it looked like one of those mechanical tentacles that otto octavius uses in his research really messed up look just watch out for them there may be more oh believe me whatever's trying to kill me at any time there's always more so where to get to the hydroponic jungle you'll find what you need there these freaking tentacles keep showing up well that's interesting i am so glad you can maintain your scientific attachment and why are time gateway repair parts in a jungle just trust me okay trust me says the voice in my head you know this is how serial killers get started the client of the tentacle where the joints are that's probably the weak point [Music] [Music] some webbing should take care of that turret when you acquire the parts keep them separated otherwise you can wind up with a sort of energy feedback okay what sort do you mean the explosive sword oh fantastic by the way thanks for bringing me back from the dead now i know how captain america feels and jean grey and colossus and just don't die again and we'll call it even ugh o'hara what just happened what is that what are you talking about i have a nice easy path in front of me and it just became an obstacle course welcome to my world literally you're seeing quantum causality in action weird so you can help me from the present which president you're in my present you mean your past present or my present future i hate you ugh [Music] uh reset's over with uh [Music] [Music] okay i'm almost there now what okay there are three rooms in the hydro jungle you'll find an energy regulator in each one take the part that looks like an atomic battery atomic it'll be fine as long as you remember that they're fragile and if they touch you and if they touch each other i'm screwed i get it big guns the part you need should be in the middle of the room you can take it without risk after you deactivate three consoles around the room why are these things always in threes i have no idea you know that's just gonna bug me now for the rest of the day i just need a breather you take more than that people come and go so quickly here pull it together spidey [Music] god [Music] okay o'hara i got the part just keep going hurry up yeah i'm going i'm going security lasers again hit the switches to open the door it's easy enough she says you oh and by the way thanks for putting me in this fix we're both in yeah but i'm the we dodging lasers that almost cut me in half okay got it i'm all done right but yeah as soon as you get similar parts from the other room uh figures huh [Music] uh uh [Music] whoa almost forgot o'hara's warning about making sure they don't touch that was close o'hara i got all three i'm good to go then do it head back to the gateway room on my way hey o'hara those parts must have been pretty important the jungle's starting to look like the sahara that can be helped the parts are rare and we need them more than a bunch of plants oh damn o'hara the suicide switched back and it just annihilated my way out or maybe not it looks like it just opened up a different path i hope you're being careful with the parts uh uh o'hara remember you said to keep those parts separate but let's just say for the sake of argument that didn't work out just how big a bang are we talking about the crater the city why are you asking don't tell me is there any way to reverse it not for you there isn't get them to the gateway as fast as you can more tentacles i can't get past them in time that sounds like a sewer in here better keep [Music] the moving such an active little spider brings back so many memories you aren't supposed to be here you know that voice that voice sounds like ah it could be [Music] [Music] old times it must be the speaker's distorting by the way who built speakers into sewers anyway what's up with that [Music] [Music] oh [Music] i'm in the gateway room all right throw the parts through one at a time passing them through the energy stream should reverse the energy buildup but if you toss them in all together it'll trigger the okay okay i get it we got any clue why otto's tentacles keep coming out of nowhere he may still be alive trying to get out or drag us in wish i knew how to get rid of these shotgun tentacles have you got the new parts in place yeah i just have to activate the breakers good plan without getting killed oh better plan i'm losing my patience what are you doing i'm activating the breakers just hold on pull you should be fighting me [Applause] who taught you what a fight huh [Applause] don't hurry i'm thinking of staying here good are you out of your okay let me just finish this and we'll talk [Music] uh ugh ugh uh [Applause] [Music] i'm not getting a steady power flow i need to find the schematics to figure out why if the archives room here is in the same place it is in my time it should be accessible through a vertical tunnel you stay put i've been thinking maybe staying put isn't such a bad idea meaning what come on o'hara it's not like anti-venom was a fluke someone's always trying to kill me and there's always a chance of my loved ones being caught in the crossfire if i stay here no one i love will suffer or die because of me what about all the good you've done and will do the people you'll inspire including me you're saying the lives of a billion strangers are more important than my loved ones i'm not saying that history says that yeah well history doesn't have to wrestle with guilt or tentacles they're at it again all right stay clear of them i'll get it figured out on my end huh [Music] tight there has to be a way to reopen it uh [Music] i'm not even slowing me down foreign you're through i you're making this too easy [Music] [Music] [Music] please give me an update o'hara it's all i can do to stay ahead of these tentacles yeah this is just taking a little longer than expected well move it i already died enough for one day uh uh oh thank huh you hanging in there parker those mutant tentacles are getting way too close don't worry it's almost over it better be huh huh huh [Music] uh closed door again with any luck the switches nearby this time too oh you've got to be kidding where's that pass you're nothing but a stooge nice block huh [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] o'hara if you're working with the tentacles to convince me that 2099 sucks then mission accomplished anxious to come home well so am i [Applause] do ugh huh [Music] uh [Music] [Music] um [Music] what's the story i'm almost to the archives i almost won't stop these freaking tentacles reboot the gateway would you please working on it [Music] yeah terrific a voice-coded door uh miguel o'hara five two four nine axis denied figures parker changing plan cause of these i can't access the archives on this end but you can on yours i'll guide you to the archive room and you can give me the information i need the archives room that would be handy i could look up the people i love and keep them out of danger don't you dare poke around in there parker you've already seen the dangers of screwing with the past learn from the mistakes instead of repeating them fine fine attention security intruder must be neutralized approach oh you'll need [Music] o'hara the walls are closing and there's no way out now would be a good time to pull that quantum causality thing yeah i don't know what to do you're in a better position than i am if i can find the architectural plans make some changes but i'll need a computer for that then find one not even close you're just a corporate tool [Music] yeah but it's getting to be crunch time don't panic i never panic there looks to be an electrical panel up there maybe i could short circuit this thing see if there's any way to slow get the shock out of my way uh o'hara remember that hole i never panic thing that's more of a guideline than a rule parker did it work i made it worse the incinerator started up can you shut it down from your end i sure hope so go take a coffee break oh no i need to find a computer why is this shocking happening [Music] great i either get fried or flat now i know how an egg feels where's that computer [Music] hey remember when you were telling me to hurry up right back right now i'm doing my best to find that computer so i can bail you out [Music] keep going [Music] catch you later [Music] [Music] can't stop to rest that was close [Music] hang on i've almost got it [Music] parker are you there say something glad i'm out of there place smelled like a rhino in july oh they have enough security in here to keep out an army of spider-man any ideas i'm trying something here did it work yeah mostly i can deal with the rest thanks o'hara that almost cut me in half come on spider speed moving on to the next item on our agenda good now focus get the schematics we need if you run into trouble i can make modifications from here to simplify your path yeah i'm stuck again i'm blocked by a security field can you do anything for me it looks like the security matrix is in the adjacent room i'm rerouting a vent to you so you can destroy it thanks i'm on my way to the archives i'm sure i'll be fine from here on out just hurry these shocking tentacles are getting nastier by the minute on my way another security matrix great okay there's got to be a door switch somewhere around here [Music] oh huh ugh uh [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] okay the force field should be down by now you must be starting to feel silly [Music] reset's over with [Music] better go back little bug before you get squashed bet you can't handle this oh again please let me be wrong about who this is o'hara there's too many for me to handle are you asking for help look i don't need you rubbing my nose and then yes i need help okay give me a few minutes seconds would be better okay listen there's a power conduit right next to the room you're in i'm getting access to just tell me when and where i'm trying to be alive when you're finished did it work i got nothing on my hand except things are trying to kill me [Music] how about now nothing wait hold on are you near the archives not yet how's it going i'm making a souffle how do you think it's going just tell me when you're on your way to the archives yep at least the play still looks the same well the same but you know different [Music] this is screwy people come and go so quickly here miguel i'm in the archives i need access to the other floor so i can get all the keys i need for the classified database i'll do what i can but these tentacles are making life pretty shocking difficult okay how's that it's a start i can get to the second floor i'll let you know when i meet the others [Music] every time i turn around [Music] this is getting absurd miguel i need access to those other floors now no of course your highness i'll get right on that just hold your webs a sec okay [Music] and voila now get that key and access the computer sir yes nail [Music] i'm not gonna miss that guy oh someone's involved okay i'm here so how do i access it enter my password lila l-y-l-a access denied oh great you got any other ideas let me think i wish i could just say open sesame or grant me access or request acknowledged access granted that was weird okay let's go over the startup procedures slow down parker it's not that simple did you fire up the quark enhancers activate the tachyon relays yes yes i did all that no you just uncouple the heisenberg compensators yes of course i oh shucking no i didn't i was right wow i oh no what's wrong it's mary jane she dies tonight right there at alcomax how do you know for shock's sake parker what part of don't poke around in the archives was unclear fine i'm a nosy parker but now that i've found out it's it's what my job to save her i've got enough to deal with you can't mean that you can't just ignore that she's in danger hey i'm trying to focus on what's important what's important is not standing by and allowing someone to suffer or die because you do nothing if you don't get that then you don't get the first thing about being spider-man you're the one who doesn't get it parker the future depends on my future is meaningless without her this is gonna be a huge mistake i owe you miguel big time shocking right you do but well maybe this will help even the score for everything the world owes you thank you i mean that man i must have been crazy to think about staying here if people i love are going to be in danger then i need to be there to help them [Music] and what's mary jane look like anyway tall redhead immortal danger i'm sure you can find her what's she doing in alcamax does she work here i know she was just meeting up with me we were going out together this is all my fault calm down i said i'll take care of it shouldn't be hard to find um parker i see her and she's looking for you it's my fault she's there is she say well she's not dead but the tentacles have other ideas help her for crying out loud [Music] she went down a corridor on the second floor [Music] huh [Music] out of the way i've got no time to play around you shouldn't be fighting me pull it together [Music] who taught you what a fight kicking my butt right now so move [Music] mary jane head toward the sound of my voice aj who are you i don't care just help me hey jane oh shuck be a good boy [Music] huh [Music] i'll give you a treat [Music] must have gone down that hallway on the third floor [Music] [Music] get the shock out of my way she's dead isn't she hurry o'hara i'm doing my best i've got my own problems don't talk to me about problems calm down no why seconds ago the computer said she was crushed by some kind of falling debris now it says she dies it no wait it's changing again it's the quantum causality peter there's so much happening that it's going haywire now calm down i have not to deal with without you freaking out in my head okay okay [Music] what is this what's going on peter [Music] i'm trying to keep it together miguel just tell me something i'm trying to find her temporal rifts are opening all over it's like the fabric of space time is being stretched thinner and thinner it may reach a point where it's a repairable i'm losing my patience you're not even slowing me down i hope the universe doesn't end while i'm trying to save one person mary jane over here [Music] that woman needs her shock and hearing check and if i stop to fight these things there may not be anything ever left to save [Music] help oh you again at first i thought you were but you sound different move different peter sent me he did huh [Music] [Music] [Music] no shock hang on hang on what's happening nothing good what's it say on your head that she dies in an elevator not gonna happen huh here we go no change that's because i haven't gotten to her yet i know you really didn't want to do this but please peter i swear to you i wouldn't be doing this if i wasn't sure i could save her steady shot [Music] [Music] miguel it's changing again what does it say actually nothing what does that mean honestly that means she wasn't important enough to be remembered hmm [Music] help me i got her she's okay thanks thank you for real this means a lot to me no problem peter come on let's get you out of here now you're talking to peter right now you got some sort of cell phone under that mask a cell what i mean uh sure that's it can i you'll have plenty of time to talk to him after all this is over you'll have your whole lives together look i just want to say thank you you're as brave and unselfish as another guy who goes by the handle spiderman you're a worthy successor to the name thanks i mean that thanks thanks again miguel enough with the thanks you ready come home you bet and leave me again [Music] how much rejection is a girl supposed to take black cat i was praying i was wrong felicia what if they help me spider they they gave me an anti-aging drug for decades made me over spider scent's going nuts you're lying the real felicia she would have never let them never let them what turn me into this you destroyed me spider after what you did i didn't care what happened to me i don't know what you're talking about either i haven't done yet what you claim i did or you're making this up to mess with my head and you get to guess which one is it fun not remotely you used to have a sense of humor dying tends to get you serious and hurt then you're about to get deadly serious [Music] i'm sorry for it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] felicia i'm so sorry oh so sorry help me spider-poor me you actually fell for that what we ever see in him felicia this creature isn't you you don't get to lecture us on who we are spider not anymore okay peter i'm almost to the gate energy is limited so we'll have to jump through at the same time don't worry i'll be there [Music] [Music] oh i'm interrupting the gateway room tell me when you're there as well we have to time this right you got it miguel oh how nice you and your counterpart are on a first name basis now it's good to know you've bonded who are you i'm the ceo of alcomax the real question is who are you old friend old friend so this is where you make the big reveal and i say holy cow norman osborne or the kingpin jony jameson come on please be jameson all of them long dead i fear too bad they didn't have access to the anti-aging drug we developed does wonders for you and i do mean you no it can't be can't be yes why do people always say that good thing your future counterpart's safe to say otherwise we couldn't be this i i become the evil mastermind oh don't be melodramatic with great power comes great responsibility and great opportunity and the only way to live up to all that responsibility is to use every opportunity to get all the power i learned that the day i lost everyone i loved and didn't have the power to stop it what do you mean everyone you'll find out except once i've fixed reality you actually won't find out consider yourself lucky peter it's up and running but it's not tremendously stable where are you i think i think i'm in hell the ceo it's me what that's that's insane how can that be holy shock peter now let me explain it all to you explain it to my rapidly retreating backside peter get a move on i'm going as fast as i can i can't let it let me end up this way this is no time for us to look peter i'm barely holding the gateway together i'm barely holding myself together access granted mr parker [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ugh oh what now huh this is weird i can't let this happen i have to get home and do something about it [Music] oh wow [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh no wait [Music] ah that almost cut me in half [Music] oh pull it together spidey oh sometimes quantum causality is not my friend i told you the gateway is getting increasingly unstable you're dealing with pure chaos kind of like my love life as soon as we destroy the gateway it'll go back to normal awesome [Music] [Music] [Music] wow i can't slow down now [Music] on spider speed [Music] just keep going [Music] chief [Music] uh [Music] is this what you're looking for you know it is well then come and get it peter are you on your way yeah uh slight setback what kind my ex wants to play cat and mouse this is serious well it wasn't my idea just do what you have to do and get to the gateway [Laughter] now where'd she go you're getting warmer spider come find me you know i'm gonna make you work for it you're slipping stuff no huh really gonna do this felicia it ends here yes [Music] uh don't think i'm done with you i'm planning a new date together so we can have lots more fun just what we needed more quality time yes yes [Music] [Music] huh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i was like old times wasn't it peter and i know i know it wasn't my old times not really but it was as close as i was ever going to get be honest was i yeah good you were great better than the original [Music] uh [Music] great back to the sewers again these tentacles are getting on my last nerf two oh those freaking tentacles are getting worse probably has to do with that whole pure chaos thing hearts racing need a timeout gotta rest up come on parker regroup [Music] oh [Music] huh you still with me oh ready good to go on three one two three peter did you make it through yeah something came through with me oh my god what's wrong those tentacles they were coming from some kind of i don't know what this atrocity is in fact that's what i'm going to call it atrocity because big scary tentacle monster thingy takes way too long to say oh that and thing thing was taken peter again focus the quantum bridge is building on itself like a hurricane it's a massive time storm and if we can't get it under control it's gonna wipe out everything you know how to solve this right the time storm and this atrocity that followed me out this is a little out of my field okay the pair of science boys would be better hey that's it the parasites research lab best bet for all the answers i'll go there the time storm is starting to tear everything apart ditto here not to mention i'm playing tag with this crazy octo monster i don't believe it a transitional einstein rosen bridge you mean a wormhole yeah the crazy as it sounds i can use it to get to the parasites research lab faster me peter what's your step the causality's out of control was it ever in control the point is if you breathe wrong it could have unexpected consequences so watch it i'll do my best to watch my step while i'm fighting for my life are you shocking kidding me what did i just tell it's not my fault the atrocity took out a wall with his tentacles okay well be careful i'm being careful tell him to be careful [Music] foreign [Music] power's out there has to be a backup generator somewhere looks like an old dna card i wonder if i can get it to work by locking it into this station muted dna samples ready shock they never really shut it down there are living test subjects here looks like they feed on energy these failed experiments can destroy the data box [Music] [Applause] [Music] um [Applause] who taught you what a fight [Music] [Music] dna samples created transportation in progress [Music] throat [Music] you're not even slowing me down [Music] [Music] ah [Applause] oh that was close [Music] dna samples ready opening cybernetic this atrocity thing isn't slowing down anytime soon what's going on with you i just need to get two more data boxes i have no idea what you're talking about just do it fast [Music] there's a switch somewhere that will unlock the data box [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] dna samples created transportation in progress you're making this too easy [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] uh on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] cybernetic subjects dna samples ready opening symbiotic [Music] i'll lose my very more things change [Music] [Music] dna samples created transportation in progress [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] just need to power [Music] symbiote subjects dna samples ready all samples locked and ready for upload and now we wait peter i have all four data boxes as soon as i've activated them we'll know what's going on maybe a nice change of pace sure meets dying again true i just need to activate each data box [Music] 30 percent fifty percent [Music] [Music] 75 percent randomized enemies terrific [Applause] better hurry and get the information so i can shut this insanity down peter i think that atrocity is connected to the time storm somehow what i really need is some of its dna to complete the analysis the how it's on this end grab a dna recorder and acquire a sample download it into a computer there and it'll show up here but if it's not already there doesn't that mean i've failed you want a two-hour lecture on the laws of quantum dynamics no then trust me it won't be visible here until you do it there time travel makes my head hurt so i've gotta grab a dna recorder from the genetics lab it's not a rare item you shouldn't have too much trouble finding one i've got tentacle boy after this nothing's a walk in the park right now pointing looks practically right next door that's probably it over there easy peasy talk about urban renewal oh [Music] ugh ugh huh yeah i probably should have seen that coming and who the heck are you supposed to be the one who's gonna kill oh welcome to the club they're having jackets made what are you uh septuple xl you must be starting to feel silly uh i didn't order another enemy [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] hey guys uh you haven't seen a dna recorder anywhere around have you stopper thanks for the help uh [Music] uh huh [Music] [Music] uh ugh [Music] okay okay if i were a dna recorder where would i be hiding look as long as you're there would you mind giving him a quick wash i'm betting he can't get through those panels if i can just shut them sorry name's not on the list can't let you in oh foreign just so you know the cost of those windows is coming out of your salary [Music] can't quit now [Music] seems to be easier two fists no waiting ugh how you doing there aside from not having a dna recorder and being chased by berserk sushi just swell well get it in gear because at this time you're gonna have a ringside seat for a brand new big bang i'll get the dna thing i'm moving as fast as i can we'll move faster i hate it when he says that [Applause] at least that's over with talk about your corporate glass ceilings i hope this one holds up that air duct looks like the only way out gotta go thank god it held up that thing had broken through when i had me [Music] first the windows now the air duct what's next [Music] what's happening talk to me peter miguel are you okay what happened oh yeah i managed to tear free left half my costume behind but it was worth it found a room to hide in passed out where are you now i'm not sure let me check oh finally miguel i found it the dna recorder yes but don't stand around telling me about it use it on the atrocities of this place gotta maneuver him into the gas chamber fastest my fat deer monster come on monster come into the gas chamber and if you don't breathe then start now once i get the dna we have a shot at ending this mission accomplished good going now get it to the dna stations we can read it so once i've downloaded it we're done that's the hope yeah because everything's been working out great so far it came through but the strands are in pieces can you get another sample sure wait what this thing teleports now what do you mean crack a dictionary huh well i'm still having trouble connecting the dna strands i've never seen anything like this try giving me one more sample if we ever meet face to face on it now this is okay [Music] dna strains integrated no wonder i couldn't get a reed that thing's a combination of sloan octavius and anti-venom they must have mutated into that thing when they were shoved through my god any weaknesses and a guess high voltage right now they're supercharged with quantum particles if we can reverse the polarity of the gateway and shove it back through the quantum feedback could reverse the time storm why reverse it miguel when we can use it you know who i of course he knows so i know miguel you're on the wrong side of this i'm not the villain here i'm the guy who's trying to make everything right don't you get it uh apparently i don't when the storm is fully unleashed i'm going to harness the quantum energy it will give me complete control over the time stream what are you trying to play god the first creation of the universe wasn't bad for a first draft i'm just going to provide a much needed rewrite i can make up for my original sin by saving uncle ben not to mention gwen stacy her dad countless others what kind of villain fixes it so that everyone gets to live happily ever after you're talking about power no human should have you'll end up destroying yourself but not before you've annihilated everything else well then i guess we'll just have to agree to disagree this discussion is over it's over when i said [Music] trippy hmm steady tired not good no way it ends here the ceo and i have some unfinished business this thing has a gravity reversal system to separate out precious metals i can use that to get the shock back up there excellent oh not excellent i'm gonna have to reroute more power and overload it to get the upward boost i need now there must be some reserved power banks around here somewhere climb the debris to get higher stage [Music] still sucking air would have thought [Music] [Music] okay that's a start but it's gonna take more power to make it affect non-metal objects like me [Music] i could web zip on the debris to get higher [Music] [Music] final disposal stage [Music] [Music] good so move ah [Music] [Music] [Music] all right now to trigger a disposal cycle that'll reverse the gravity and get me up to the next level i could web zip on the debris to get higher danger engaging final disposal stage [Music] stop to rest uh can't sit around talking to myself [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you you shouldn't be fighting me uh that should do it now to activate a cycle and go for a ride [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] no time to take a nap this is a bad idea it'll be the last i ever have okay you raping megalomaniac here i come get ready for round two time [Music] huh wow i'm still here outstanding who taught you what a you're not even fight me down [Applause] [Applause] you're through i know peter overwhelming forces here the alchemics of your time should have a failure if you can destroy it the quantum causality should wipe out any trace of these experimental freaks i'm right near the failed experiments lab mikael don't worry i'm all over this [Music] peter these failed drinks are piling on you sure you can do this i'm almost to the lab piece of cake this is no time for pastries all units converge [Music] okay i took out a bunch of them any improvement on your end some yeah keep it going no problem i'll get a move on destroying these pods [Music] all better now i'll take that as a no can't quit fantastic i'll take it from here good because i got my own problems the atrocities back get him to the gateway room you got it that's where it began that's where we'll end it we're thinking alike it took long enough [Music] that did the trick miguel i'm in the time research lab it's probably in lockdown mode yep that would be the old parker luck yep locked perfect need a pass key if i'm gonna get through that door to the gateway hey home monitor give me a pass oh you gotta be kidding now i gotta what go in after him i think i found some sort of prototype of a non-working model the guards are real enough uh miguel any chance that prototype is functional no shock what i know well you're mr future knowledge and everything i figured maybe you'd know why a guy just disappeared into it with the pass i need no less disappeared huh it might be another operational gateway or it might be a simple matter transmitter device simple a toaster is simple a matter transmitter is a little more complicated if you say so what's a toaster what's it oh never mind [Music] [Music] miguel you still there no i'm in venezuela you're right it was a teleporter how do you know because i teleported off all the why did you risk it i needed the guards pass we'll get it stop screwing around head to the gateway room and try not to teleport yourself to mars while you're at it you really need to work on your people skills all right i got the key let's get to that gate room people come and go so quickly victory [Music] every time it's around i hope this sends me back where i came from one [Music] this is getting absurd i'm not gonna miss that guy [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] oh crap the baby's awake and junior's right on my tail keep moving i have to head off the ceo before he starts draining quantum energy or who knows what could happen all right here it is the ceo's tower i'm coming for you boss [Music] it's quiet too shocking quiet alert engaging counter measure level one get the shock out of my way [Music] um i'm losing my patience [Music] [Music] hey pull it together [Music] i hate this place it's a move uh [Music] um [Music] [Music] uh ah [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] uh [Music] foreign huh miguel i've been thinking about the ceo yeah me too okay listen don't even bother trying to get at him from behind his spider sense gives him the edge but captain america once told me that i put too much into my combo attacks and leave myself open for a few moments after that i know i shouldn't but i do thanks i'll do that oh well just don't let the bad guys know still hiding behind your metal bodyguards you've gone soft after all these deadbeats face it you're a gutless coward peter parker excuse me dude what the hell i didn't mean you i i meant future you it was nothing personal uh it kind of was i mean yeah take him down try not to piss off the superpowered corporate lunatic more than you have to you know fair enough [Music] i really didn't want it to come to this because it was inevitable though i mean talk about your boss fights right what happened to you parker you used to be the greatest of them all still i am sport the one the only spider-man except no substitutes you have to listen to reason no i really don't that's one of the joys of being in charge so if you want to make this personal you can join me in the gateway room i'm about to end this the older you is some piece of work why what happened meeting up in the gateway room i'm really starting to hate that place but like you said it began there and it's gonna end there so [Music] miguel i'm getting ready to reverse the polarity but uh just in case i blow up the universe i just want to tell you it's been fun have faith [Music] i just need a breather gotta use my webbing to hog tie those tentacles seismic wait we can do that or to try seismic activity detected security override initiated dale seismic activity detected security override initiated [Music] somehow i got to electrocute what's happening i'm about to reach the gateway room i believe i had an appointment luckily i cleared my schedule for you i'm sorry it's come to this but obviously you're part of the problem not the solution i was watching the space-time continuum collapse any kind of solution idiot i'm absorbing all the wonder particles being unleashed i'll reshape the timeline any way i wish long before it collapses think of it as playing dice with the universe einstein would have approved einstein's not here so i guess i'll have to do one you know looks like your future self took a page from iron man's old playbook i'm squaring off against some kind of iron spider outfit that sounds like a crutch to me if he really had confidence in his own speed and agility he wouldn't be making with the heavy metal what the friends of yours um yeah i'm just full of surprises he doesn't know about atrocities you can use that especially the antivenom [Music] uh pull it together i don't understand this how are those things training my powers as quickly as possible that's how why are you on the wrong side fighting me really this is really a shame but so move had to come down to this [Music] this is just ridiculous you can't wait oh we would have made a great team [Music] you should be fighting me okay not bad the gameplay is going totally nuts what's happening on your side oh no worries just time collapsing nothing that needs you to hurry the shock up okay i get it i'm zapping the squid and de-tentacling it as fast as i can de-tentacling don't use made-up words right what the shock was i'm thinking peter hold up he destroys everything let's hope it's one more than we need i'd rather not bring our deadline right up against the edge of time now get the atrocity in the gateway i can't do it until i finish depending on him oh come on you think too small everything i say is to annoy you [Music] so [Music] somehow he recommends electro shock tree [Music] catch you later spider-man 29. uh now you're starting to annoy me i invented them this is just ridiculous it had to come down to this you can't win you know it can only end this one [Music] i hate the thought of just punching you in the face there's no imagination no elegance no oh more fun for me than you do just a breather [Music] don't see any fat lady singing though miguel it's still out of control you need to lock it down on your end and if you do actually i don't know what happens if you do then the backlash should collapse the quantum bridge and overwrite all of this wiping it from existence and don't say if i can still take the ceo his arm is starting to overheat he can't control the energy just as i think this perfect the time storm has reached the ideal level for harvesting quantum particles there's no way you can pull this off you're popping parker uh i am not you parker the other parker keep telling why are you on the wrong side focused using weapons powered by quantum energy the first thing i'm going to do in my control time is wipe this entire fight out of existence retroactive the only thing that's going to be white is the floor with you need to put the finishing touches on we'll overhang set this right this thing is almost i but yourself maybe the most merciful thing to do is just wipe you out of existence [Music] it's it's all back to normal same here okay but if the timeline snap back to normal if none of it happened how do you and i remember it i mean we've got two different sets of memories in our brains shouldn't that be making us i don't know crazy crazy we already dress in skin-tight costumes and fight bad guys for free okay crazy er you really want a five-hour lecture on temporal paradoxes sure why not as it turns out looks like i have all the time in the world [Music] you
