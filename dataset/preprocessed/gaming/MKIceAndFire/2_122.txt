i said we're good aloy oh you go on ahead what are you standing around will be in my stash when i need it huh i can't avoid that machine but i could learn if there's a card [Music] some ruin from the old world i could find something interesting inside okay what do we have in here's acid on it [Music] glad i can help [Music] mighty thankful to you savior just a loy is fine aaron mentioned you're not one for fancy titles you're a vanguard well here to escort bodies the delicate behind to the embassy if we can get rid of these bristle backs captain said to keep an eye on chain scrape then these ugly lugs showed up gave the first one a good beating but didn't quite have time to roll out of the way when it fell told you it wasn't a good idea to eat that much before heading out i should probably get going now if you see any more of these bristlebacks i'll make sure to roll out of their way might want to take some of these with you as well they're handy in a pinch thanks stay safe i think that metal tower is giving off the signal i could head over there check it out i'll stash this away for later [Music] an image from the image is incomplete but maybe if i line it up exactly with where it was taken my focus can fill in the rest there's the quarry thoroughly mentioned and it's full of bristlebacks [Music] so one less machine those asset spitters brought friends you're coming another one down one less machine [Music] [Applause] another one down my ah look at that thing there cory's safe stranger come on over here we gotta talk over here i don't know what a nora is doing out here but consider yourself oh we tried to hold off and wait for the vanguard but one of them bristlebacks charged us next thing you know was a full-fledged fracas is everyone okay we lost some good people but we would have lost the whole quarry without you at least it's quiet now your ears ought to be ringing with a quarry at work but chain scrapes whistle ain't blowing so we're stuck picking up the pieces do you need the whistle to get back to work me and my crew were just little cogs out here can't lift a hammer until oven blows that thing because if we work without his say-so he'll ban us and my people have been through enough elven holds that much power he's got the money and connections to snuff our fires for good almost feels like we stood a better chance with the bristlebacks what are you and your crew working on we're supposed to be working alvin's claim digging out stone to show our barren light but the work stoppage and the bristlebacks cut us short never seen those blasted things in a dawn before where in forge fire did they come from i'm not sure at least not yet i need to get going stay safe thanks to you that might actually be possible today i think i've cleared out most of the bristlebacks chainscrape can get back to work now i'll go give alvin the good news what is two then maybe this embassy can finally happen i can get it for my stash later [Music] image it looks like the building in the image might have been near a river maybe there used to be a bridge ruins of a bridge maybe it's the same one from the image i could try to line it up around there it is completing the image and locked a data file it looks like these vista points were made by miriam technologies that was elizabeth's company i wonder if i can find more of them out in the wild [Music] so ruined from the old world i could find something interesting inside okay what do we have in here looks like this door needs some kind of key module maybe there's one on the ruin some data survived there's a code for the locked door in this data but i still need to find a key module [Music] great it's not hugging onto that [Music] huh [Music] okay gotta find a key for the door [Music] [Music] there's more of the ruin down here where to now um packs full but my stash has room [Music] oh i can't reach the ledge above now i guess i'll have to find another way up a little more light down here uh yep there it goes okay now where is this lead [Music] [Music] the key module [Music] [Music] huh old world relic how do i get in there to get it okay let's see if this key fits there um looks like this needs a code too i think some of the data i picked up might help [Music] what is this thing oh hold on to it for now [Music] send this to my stash so so cauldrons could teach me how to liberate these shoes [Music] yes uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] time to get alvin to blow the whistle then what east to barrette if i'm drunk you look at her as sharp as ever you know proper surveillance still here i see i cleared out all the bristlebacks oh you did now that you've recovered from your shock time to blow the whistle over there not so fast i'll have to send someone out to confirm the kills make sure the valley is safe again it shouldn't take more than a day or two no you blow the whistle now these are innocent awesome lives we're talking about here surely the delay either you do it now or i will ah i knew you could do it friends gather round the savior of meridian has done it again the bristlebacks are defeated you what sound the whistle chain scrape is open for business yay and alvin has agreed to personally pay every worker their lost wages yeah that's where i like it yeah yeah don't you have an embassy to get to yeah i guess i don't waiting for you care finish that fascinating throw the chain scrapes back to work merchants should be open to trade i should see if they have anything useful before i send what ease off to baron light better see what that carja magistrate wanted i bet he's in the tavern brought out only the good stuff for you red see it as you got that whistle blowing hey i've been waiting to get my lucky hammer fixed for days you haven't done anything useful like getting rid of any bristle backs though have you take your time i promise you won't be disappointed [Music] [Music] come back anytime now can i get this fixed i can fix your tools afraid there's no fixing you you look like someone in need the way to baron light is clear get moving you're not aaron vanguardsman i will move only when the captain said cleared out all the bristlebacks which i have captain's orders so they're okay banged up but breathing and waiting up ahead for you but but i i was supposed to have three escorts i'm off to baron light buddies like eloy said captain's orders you can stay here abandoned to the riffraff i think not guess you're coming with me then see you there eloy [Music] [Music] well now that that's done the embassy can finally get underway if i can get through it i'll be able to track down silence hades maybe even a guy at backup guess i could head straight for baron light or a poker on the dance something first and maybe take petra up on that drink [Music] is savior thank you for taking the time and my condolences that you had to endure alvin's bloviating i've dealt with worse that sounds like he's really trying to put you over the barrel the idea that the karja purposely led bristlebacks into the dawn it's completely absurd but the louder and longer he says it the more support he'll get for his damned concession decree how did the bristlebacks get into the daunt no one knows for sure the first report of them came from west of the quarry but unless they have wings i don't know about i don't see how they could have come over the mountains no other way the only way i know about is baron light look if you can get to the bottom of this i can offer a considerable bounty in return help me shut alvin up what is this concession decree that alvin wants he wants the sundom to designate portions of the daunt as asaram holdings only the portions mind you that produce any value let me guess because he stands to profit somehow exactly with the daunt under assaram law he could secure more investment for their numerous ventures he can't get those investments without the concession no not while there's a chance the sundom could revoke their access hence why the concession is so important to him and why blaming the carja for the bristlebacks no matter how absurd works in his favor how did you get stuck out here i asked for the posting believe it or not overseeing the entire valley on behalf of the sun king it was an honor is an honor i mean but your job would be a lot easier without someone like alvin blasting hot air all the time elven's not going anywhere he's been around longer than i have even fancies himself the founder of chain scraped now i'll find a way to live with him i have to how does blaming the carja for the bristlebacks help alvin get his concession look around this may be the sundom but chain scrape is all gears and rust and bad ale claiming that the karja loosed the bristlebacks in order to intimidate asuram laborers into obedience well let's just say no one here has forgotten the atrocities of the mad sun king even with the valley working again alvin hopes he can stir up enough resentment against the carja to call for a strike and if the assaram refused to work unless the concession is signed you won't have a choice correct the reconstruction of baron light must continue you said the bristlebacks were first spotted west of the quarry yes according to one terrified laborer said the ground trembled before they came charging down the hillside he took off and ran all the way here good place to start looking then if you learn the truth maybe ovent will stop blaming the karja for every problem under the sun and maybe then he'll actually focus on rebuilding barren light instead change your mind fancy a game of strike come to revel in some strike sister let me set the board i was just passing by i um first-timer huh don't worry about it i'll go easy on you you got any pieces uh no well aren't you in luck then i got an extra set a tanakh original straight out of the forbidden west sit since i said i'll run you through it in a hot spark i'll give you something special if you wanted all my boards too all right let's start off simple the tanakhs like to say that machine strike is a game of pure strategy we each get a set of pieces each piece represents a kind of machine and each machine is worth a different number of victory points to win the game you'll need to gain seven victory points by destroying the opponent's machines it can be tricky remembering the details of every machine so we use these notes to keep track of them you see that number on the top right corner that notes also tell you how far a piece can move how powerful their attacks are the distance they can strike from and of course their health okay that's enough for now let's just play i'll explain the rest as we go i own the board so i get to choose who goes first since this is your first time i'll let you go usually you get to choose which pieces to set on the board but this will do for now pick up that machine piece to your right and move it forward so remember each machine can only move a certain distance take a look at your notes if you need a reminder easy enough huh now you get to move two machines each round so go ahead and pick a second machine perfect there's not much else to do for now so just end your turn we're forging onwards let me move my pieces here and we're back to you this time why don't you try attacking one of my pieces try with that machine on your right first now move the piece when performing an attack you'll be testing your machine's combat power against the opponents a machine's combat power is a combination of the terrain your machine is standing on and its own attack power this board only has grassland terrain which has no effect on a machine's combat power and your current machine has two points of attack power so in total your machine's combat power equals two points since my machine isn't the one attacking it has zero points of attack power and just like your machine it's not affected by grassland terrain so right now the difference in combat power between the two machines is two points this means your machine can do two points of damage to my machine did you get all that knew you were a smart one finish up by attacking my machine not pulling any punches huh now grab that second machine see how your machine can't move close enough to attack mine you can make your machine sprint that lets it move one space further try it out downside to sprinting is that your machine can no longer attack now some players like to take a risk and overcharge their machine in cases like this overcharging lets you attack after a sprint but it will damage your machine's health by two points so use at your own discretion let's try doing that now so you can see what i mean that's about it for your turn then now i'll let you in on a neat trick that machine of yours the one closest to me grab a hold of it same as in the wilds machines have both armored points and weak points you can see them marked on the pieces blue shows where their armor is thickest hit them there and you'll do some damage but not a lot now red shows the machine's weak points hit those and you'll deal a mighty blow here let me show you rotate that piece so your machine faces mine now let that machine have it off the board she goes and there's your first victory points you don't have seven of them yet so let's keep going your machine attacked mine but hasn't moved yet go ahead and move downwards towards my remaining piece you've already attacked a machine and moved your piece but if you overcharge your machine you can attack a second time and by the look of your machine's health you'd be sacrificing your piece to defeat mine but sometimes that can overcharge your machine to attack mine a second time and i'll show you what i mean ain't that a thrill now because your machine was knocked out at the same time as mine we both get the victory points our machines are worth good news is since you're the one attacking you're gonna receive your victory points before i do which means you can reach the coveted seven victory points first that's why sometimes losing a piece can be the best way to end the game in your favor now you'll notice you didn't get quite up to seven victory points this time but you did destroy all my pieces that means you're the winner that wasn't so hard was it just remember to always check for the best terrain to attack from you'd be surprised the advantage you can gain over an opponent like that i know it saved my behind in a game or two i'll try and remember that oh before i forget these are all my spare pieces i want the savior of meridian to have them it's a small set to be sure but it should be enough to get you in on any strike games you find out there you might even fancy looking out for them strike carvers they've got all kinds of unique pieces that can turn a game in your favor though they'll need the right materials to craft you one or you might find them in the wilds if you're lucky i know i've lost my fair share of pieces after night of machine hunting or brew hopping oh no need to thank me always a pleasure to help out new strike players now if you feel like playing a real game i've got plenty of other boards i could even teach you a few more tricks if you're up for it thanks oh think about it [Music] i'll see you later aloy come for that beer after all eh here sit down get a pint in her hand wasn't expecting you to swing by since when do i do what's expected there's that spark fire and spit uh fire and spit that's a blast from the bellows won't fix the forge but at least i can forget about my troubles for a while like what well things aren't as bad since you got this place running again but we still got oven grating the gears about his concession decree if you don't put that down i'll come over there and show you how that game ends anyway right now i'm just worried about those refugees out from sunfall to come all this way and during forge knows what shadow card your refugees what are they doing in the daunt looking for a new home i gather they're camped out by an old trailhead southwest to here and therein lies the problem a storm bird crashed up on the cliffs last week and tallinn clean brokers had his eye on the salvage ever since but the refugees have barred entrance mustn't interrupt their sun-scorched ritual something about finding a twilight path huh i've never heard them talk about that before yeah well these particular shadow carja are an odd bunch but overall they're peaceful folk not that it matters to tolland he'll crack some heads to get to that salvage maybe you could swing by convince him to set up camp somewhere else so the bristlebacks in the daunt [Music] where did they come from that's the thing no one rightly knows they just showed up one day rampaging around the valley like they exploded out of a forge lost some good people but bless the bellows you cleared them out and got this place working again that put a dent in alvin's plans now if only there was some way to smash them all together and run them out of town but how could bristlebacks and the daunt help alvin two words concession decree since no one knows where the bristlebacks came from ulvind has taken to blaming the karja forum he's hoping to dig up enough old resentments to get a strike going until the concession signed this is just his latest attempt he's been trying to rile up the worker since the day he rolled into town and people actually believe him lots of folks suffered at the hands of the mad king during the red raids give them half a reason they'll blame the carja for anything ah damn clergy slavers i thought you'd be back in free heap well after the big battle at meridian i went back but realized it was running smooth didn't need me heard about the rebuilding out at baron light figured they could use another hammer been scraping by ever since you could always leave and go back east nah i ain't one to label it forge besides someone's got to be a squeaky wheel for the workers around here what else can you tell me about the shadow karja refugees well they don't call themselves shadow cargo for one at least not anymore they're some other brand of sun crazed but whatever side of the sun they're on they're peaceful through and through don't seem to want for nothing except a place to live prey and just enough food to keep from starving so they're just camped outside by a trail blocking entry to a wrecked storm bird waiting for what exactly don't rightly know but i'll tell you this should they ever wise up and salvage it a storm bird heart is worth a lot and if they get there first then by us from law it's theirs not that tolling clean brokers ever lost sleep over any law breaking who is this tall and clean broker just some chuff huffing pondsman gotta shop here in town lived in chain scrapes since there was a chain scrape he and alvin go back a ways like a pair of coals and a campfire those two so tolland works for alvin alvin might think so but tallinn scrapes up his own scams and he ain't the type to let a few refugees get between him and stormbird salvage so about alvin around here everything's about alvin how'd he end up in charge he got here early like a squirrel smelling a fat nut he knew rebuilding baron light would need stone and timber so he jangled purses all over main spring getting investors to front claims on anything in the dawn that might be worth a damn thing is all the bankers back home know that this is karja land and the sun king can revoke those claims at any time that's why he's desperate for the magistrate to sign off on a concession decree well if i'm up that way i'll talk to the refugees try to convince them to move much appreciated they have it rough don't need pollen making it rougher petra said holland has a shop here in chain scrape i could have a word with him first [Applause] that's you the machine hunter that bailed out the karja never heard it put that way before what do you want heard you've been hassling refugees up by the cliffs yeah well you heard wrong there's salvage up there a storm bird to myself with a harpoon here in town not an easy shot if i do say so myself it clipped its wing and it crashed into the old tower up there killed it quick so if anyone's hassling anyone it's the shadow karja filth that's blocking the way up to my claim and you're ready to crack some skulls to get to it no need it's a raggedy bunch probably all starved before i have to lift a finger we'll see about that oh yeah we will won't we now shops closed the cargo lovers on your blasted way didn't expect to see you up and about squat looking sharp as ever i i'm sorry i'll be right with you uh okay i'm not saying it's a bad idea i'm saying it's overkill it's a weapon kill is the point not if it blows the user's arm off just stop talking where are we go so uh you you look like someone who's always searching for a new weapon am i right actually i but you're just nuts i'm with a customer i i'm not a customer i got it triple the powder it'll blow a strider sky high boom one shot kill guaranteed uh maybe i am then you are in the right place at the right time red how would you like to be the proud owner of the world's first machine enhanced explosive done in one machine wrecking yet perfectly safe javelin thrower are you two from around here nah the claim dad sent us out west in search of some unknown opportunity said we'll know when we see it sounds like you had other ideas let's just say that opening another trading post for my parents isn't how i want to make my mark in this world i imagine traveling alone must be nice so she's your partner my apprentice and my sister she's why we're out here it was an incident another incident involving explosives and dad's precious home brew he shipped us out the next day huh tell me more about this weapon of yours i saw a scroll when i was a kid by some karsha scholar who wandered out west had a scary drawing of a tanakh warrior hunting with a kind of javelin thrower effective yes basic undoubtedly but coming out here made me remember it and i'm on the brink of vastly improving the tool's archaic design whereas i will perfect it i can use machine parts to enhance the user's throw increase the projectile's velocity while boomer here is admin then enhancing the projectile is better namely with explosive tips boomsticks why not both that could work there's one small snag i need the parts to meet the first working model well for starters i'll need charger horns intact yeah that just be sure to shoot them off before the machine goes down otherwise they break but the real innovation and keep it to yourself is a fang horn rib there's a mean one east of here blow it sky high boomer you get em for me it's yours my treat you have a deal i could get around faster if i find a charger to override i can override one of these chargers i have to go on quiet so i don't spook the herd [Music] need to get data from the cauldron oh oh um sure going to come in handy i should have enough charger ones for della and boomer now you just need a rib from that fang horn you were talking about [Music] okay my stash [Music] ah [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so i can turn this around [Music] [Music] [Music] all right i should find whoever's in charge here first i could resupply my stash i'd be worth taking a look around too is that the savior of meridian can we have a word ah savior tell me are you seeking passage into no man's land by any chance maybe why do you ask ah well to hammer it plain there's treasure out west unclaimed scrap and ancient metal and i've got a sturdy band of salvagers that knows the lay of the land you're not afraid of the tanakh terrified but i carry out most of my business in no man's land a neutral territory and all that baron light is our port of entry when its doors aren't closed for an embassy i was hoping your arrival meant they might be opening soon i've got a business to run after all i want that embassy to happen as much as you do believe me i'm working on it [Music] good to know and keep us in mind if you do manage to open the way our main camp will be just past baron light we'll buy any scrap you've got on you and if you're looking for machine parts we've got the best in the west guaranteed all right maybe later then if you can get those blasted gates open [Music] i guess i'm not the only one who wants to get those gates open no one wants to play some strike anyone [Applause] declined [Music] let's play some machines [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] step carefully savior erin looks like he's had a few gentlemen ah that's our cue taking the edge off well at the end of the world's coming i don't be sober [Music] now let me guess you're in a rush right so whatever you need ask away how have things been since your silent departure they're not bad vanguard's going strong help devote pick up the pieces after the battle with the eclipse i took a month to bury ursa in the clay [Music] when i got back i got the assignment to babysit vuadis on his way to the embassy i thought that'd be a cakewalk so of course things went sideways you got blindsided it wasn't your fault a couple more of these maybe i'll believe you [Music] i was um wondering if you were able to lay ursa to rest like you wanted uh yeah yeah we did just seen the crowd to shut up to pay their respects half of the motor of favor and the other half got a half vote of their lives [Music] and everybody drank you know has a route his funeral sense of what since ever feels like she would have liked that yeah damn straight damn straight she would have put them all under the table what do you know about the embassy i know not much only that avad really wants it to happen he said i'm making peace with these tanakh but from what i hear they're not too big on the whole diplomacy thing they do most are talking with blades and arrows so if you're heading their way be prepared things might get ugly real fast i'll keep that in mind [Music] what do you know about this place well nothing good it's where the carja dragged all the captives they took from the forbidden west during the red raids lucky ones became slave labor the rest will hauled after the summering in meridian your sacrifice you got it tanakh made sure to wreck the place before they chase the carja out of the west i can't say i blame them and now i've odds paying the ozram to rebuild it no matter how much new stone they put up they'll still be standing blood [Music] i better get going right you know i'll have to do complicated aloy things maybe just don't disappear completely this time no promises i i guess what i'm really trying to say is if you ever do need me i know where to find you hopefully sober next time not don't count it be careful out there [Music] lighten up you've got a thick wall of stone between you and the tanakh out there yes sir are you in charge around here ah apologies no that would be commander nozar i'm lawan the second in command so what brings aloy of the nora to baron light i'm here for the embassy i need it to happen so i can head west and maybe now that studious juarez is here we can finally get things underway ah yes the sun priest walked in practically kicking and screaming behind his escort really seems to like his scrolls but the embassy remains delayed commander nozar has signaled our readiness but the tanakh marshals have yet to sound their horn [Music] all right fine let me through the gates then i have my own business with them i'm sure you do but i'm afraid i can't commander's orders normally the gates are open for any who dare to venture out asaram salvagers a few especially brazen karja but no one's allowed in or out before an embassy now we're open once the tanakh thumb left [Music] you said something about to knock the marshals who are they they're the tribe's elite warriors before every embassy they arrive with the contingent of soldiers from each of their three clans then during the proceedings they negotiate on behalf of their leader and by negotiate i mean stare down our sun priest until they concede paive over here came face to face with him for the first time at the last embassy came back drenched in his own sweat it was hot that day sir it was indeed so what happens at these embassies exactly mostly trade and negotiation the karja offered tribute of food spices and gear in exchange the tanaf return personal effects taken from cars or soldiers that fell during the red raids this particular embassy however is a special case because the tanakh they're handing over some sort of prisoner right a soldier named feshav ah so you've heard exchange has got everyone on edge you never know if an embassy is going to go well until it's practically over where is this commander nozar then if he's the one keeping the gates shut i'll convince him to open them for me i'll take you to him but i have to warn you the commander isn't one to break protocol especially when he's already high strung we'll see about that this way there's a lot of activity going on around here the tanakh tore down this place during the red raids two years of labor and we still have a long way to go the work stoppage and chain scrape nearly halted our rebuilding efforts but i hear a certain nora got them back to work i was just helping out yes well i'm sure alvin was thrilled stand aside soldier sir there's the commander brace yourself and good luck agreed how are we to hold an embassy with a tribe that can't even govern their own people much more can you expect from barbarians um ah a lawyer was it yes the one who cleared the valley for you without eloy we appreciate your service at least we are ready for the embassy to begin didn't you just give the signal both sides must signal readiness until the tanakh sound their horn we wait yay for as the first shall be shut up why the delay the tanakh are tribe composed of three clans how many banners do you see [Music] you're just gonna wait go find out what's wrong oh this isn't some forgotten corner of the east where you come from it's a forbidden west if you don't like it run back to meridian file a complaint the meridian i saved you mean that's right nobody walks to the gate until the third clan arrives and the tanakh horn has sounded not even the savior of meridian [Music] well thanks but i've waited long enough it's time to go absolutely not this embassy depends on diligent adherence to you shall not keep telling yourself [Music] open the gates please do not let her through that gate that is a direct order sorry can't do it [Music] hey barbara hi erin uh what's happening you know the usual aloy wants something people trying to stand in their way it's not gonna work that's it arrest her i'd like to see you try [Music] supporting fire yeah i'm locked and loaded hey nose off you stupid bass you think you got the authority to keep that door shut in the savior of meridian's face what do you think son king of odd is going to do when he hears what you did promotes you huh [Music] and it through boys saving the world forget something back in meridian look bro it doesn't matter i made it just in time so this tribe that murad told us about the tanakh we need their permission to go west yeah well i figured it'd be nice if they weren't trying to kill me the whole time but this embassy hasn't started yet we're just gonna barge in no more politics no more delays oh well now at least you have some backup i guess i do we'll see how it goes [Music] that is the line between east and west cross it and die hold on now let's take it easy none may walk this valley until our signal sounds that was our accord with the karja i'm not carja i came here on my own to ask for right of passage but they opened the gate for you did they not what is the meaning of this violation why send a child do they want to parlay or not the cartel can't be trusted this is known i forget the karja this has nothing to do with them i need to go west to save lives maybe even yours the only lives you can save are your own by turning back now hold she's telling the truth about one thing she's not karja she's a nora from the savage east and if she seeks to save lives should we not listen let me speak to him one last favor for a fellow marshal before he's taken away a fearless red-headed nora you must be the so-called savior of meridian just hey i am unyielding for shove once of the karja high command last of the army of the setting sun you're fashav ivad gave me a message for you that he waits for you in meridian where you belong hmm a lot always was polite now i'm even more curious about you knowing that you have the confidence of the sun king but such an association with the carjack could work against you as it often has with me as you can see [Music] tensions are high this embassy is a delicate affair they're about to return me to the sundom a gesture that might help soothe painful grievances and now you arrive unheralded i'm not here to cause trouble i just need to go west so you say i might be able to help but i need to know why along with some assurance that i won't regret it how did you come to be among the tanks it's quite a story but not a quick one though i suppose neither of us is going anywhere before the embassy begins are you sure you want to hear it i guess we have time very well i marched with sun king jiran's raiders when they came west hoping to moderate their worst impulses i've failed of course they committed unspeakable atrocities stirring the to knock them to action when the clans overran our forward encampment at cinema sands i stayed behind to help the last stragglers evacuate i was taken prisoner i didn't make it easy for my captors mind you and they paid me back and kind on the journey to their capital i lost so much blood on the way that i was white as a course when they threw me before chief akaro i thought i was dead for sure so i resorted to desperate measures so when you met the tanakh's chief you did something desperate i'd kept my ears open as the tanakhs dragged me along and i heard mutterings about a kind of trial by combat that they revere so when they flung me at hacaro's feet i demanded this right called the kurut thinking that by winning i could request a boom my life or even my freedom the other two knocked howled but hikaro stared them down and then his gaze fell upon me evidently he appreciated my ingenuity he allowed me to participate in the cool route little did i know what i was in for you said the cool route is at knox trial by combat yes but it is no ordinary trial it doesn't pit men against each other at least not directly instead the combatants fight machines in a great arena and only the strongest survive believe me it is no easy thing to stare down a charging machine while hundreds around you scream for blood i know more about that than you might think do you well then you have my respect like you i lived through it to claim my prize i had hopes for freedom but well that wasn't on offer only service to the chief you wound up serving that's not the chief the winners of the cool route must serve the chief as his marshals you mentioned that word before what does it mean the word itself refers to a kind of protective spirit from the ancient past in practice marshalls are hikaru's roving lawgivers part magistrate part judge part executioner i won my place among their ranks and served as honor demanded but many to not still spat on the ground when i walked by but they did until i started forcing them to the ground to grind their faces in it i guess that's one way to deal with it as you may have noticed violence is the native tongue of the tanath to survive one must master it the truth is though the cars just speak it too more than they should i can't blame the tanakh for hating them so then are you still karja part of me yes always there is much to admire about the tanakh especially their chief i've heard stories about what it was like before his reign three clans always at war constantly slitting each other's throats akaru and the marshals have crafted a delicate piece and now he looks to the future who knows maybe that future will include cooperation with the car joe the carja talk about hikaru as if he's a monster the carja feel compelled to demonize him if only because he swept them from the field it is true that he is fearsome when i was first taken before him i thought he would flame me alive but he is no bloodthirsty tyrant like the mad sun king was i think that if you were fortunate enough to meet him as i was you would find that he only wants the best for his people i hope you do speak to him i'm sure you'd interest him so that's my story you're the first easterner to hear it but not the last the cards you need to know what i have learned yeah the way you talk about the tanakh is a lot different than how they do i've never seen markings like those on a carja before the car just see ink is decoration for the tanakh it is much more a litany of deeds a record of vanquished enemies looks like you vanquished quite a few i've fought my share of battles but i feel that my life like my markings is only half complete this side shows my marshall deeds before i die i'd like to see the other half marked with the laurels of peace are you glad to be going back to meridian oh i'll admit that i wouldn't mind sleeping in a feather bed or sipping wine from the southern vineyards but i have another goal in mind as someone who knows the tanakh then the karja i'm in a unique position to advocate for both if sun king of odd is amenable my hope is to establish a lasting peace the tanakhs don't seem that peaceful they're not as a rule but these are difficult times chief akaro knows that survival often requires change even if that change means putting aside centuries of war [Music] you asked why i need rite of passage i'll tell you but you won't like my answer six months ago the world almost ended in meridian that threat still exists it's getting worse every day much worse calling down storms poisoning the water enraging the machines the source of it all has gone west and i'm the only one who can stop it i've seen the signs and i've heard tales of incredible occurrences of meridian an army of demons vanquished by a red-haired champion so i'm inclined to believe you the burden of your task is written across your face clearer than any mark of mine i'll grant you this to serve as proof of your right to travel into tanakh lands a task so important and it's just the two of you take it from one who aspires to be a diplomat allies are essential chief akaro knows the west better than anyone he may be able to help you he can be intimidating to others but don't let that deceive you he is a man of his word maybe if i need him your choice [Music] you can find him at his palace pass the mountains to the southwest tell him i sent you and he'll listen look the sky clans banner marshals it wasn't easy but i brought the skyclan with me and the commander uh no i could only convince a few he isn't yet aware we left we have banners from all three clans if there are fewer from the sky clan it can't be helped he's right sound the horn [Music] what's going on not all tanakh can stomach the idea of parlay with the but enough have come for us to begin then i'll be on my way no one the other marshals will not permit it you wanted safe passage you have it after the embassy the carja have opened the gates [Music] as the sun rises over a land at war so too can it set over a land at peace today is such hear me marshalls you have forgotten that our people were born in blood the blood of the karja instead you pledge your fears to achieve who conspires with the enemy picaro has betrayed us the embassy is proof and all of you marshals are his accomplices for this i condemn you to death you'll need more than toothless threats to intimidate us exile lancers pull him up [Music] the riding machines where'd they learn to do that sounds vashov come with us now oh not at all archer light them up get the cover archers keep them back run them down [Music] i'm not gonna make it [Applause] open the gates open again stand your ground [Music] fire on will i don't have a shot [Music] oh my god what happened can you see it's just us now hey calm down and fight fair lancers take the center get ready stick to cover arches on the ridge here they come oh here we go get back they don't stand a down she died i'm back [Music] just you and me now we've survived worse down this machine take him out [Music] oh oh enough you outlanders i'll skin you both chief grant me the honor of this challenge [Music] granted [Music] [Music] [Applause] you're next girl i never see a shield like that better scan it [Music] [Music] there now's my chance regenerated cool [Music] you're not stopping me he's vulnerable your turn come down here and face me no it was an honorable challenge you've earned your life comrades mark this day today you have decimated the marshals slaughtered the karja so begins our war honeycomb [Music] [Music] you're gonna make it you're going on without me aren't you i guess i'm stuck with aaron for now come on i'll take you back to the fort [Music] i got you it's salvage time boys [Music] i don't think it can take a hit i should be able to use it to collide hey lloyd we're still trying to sort out this mess seems like the tanakh have a civil war in their hands that sounds about right the marshals weren't expecting regala to attack and the entire karja delegation was slain nozar vladis pashav a massacre what will you do now i have to head west hopefully this rite of passage is still good for what i'm after i'll cross all of tanaka's territory if i have to then you have a long road ahead of you this is only the threshold of the forbidden west the tanakh's true domain lies over the mountains that border plain song home of the uttaru tribe this isn't tanakh's territory all that out there that's no man's land it was supposed to be neutral ground though obviously this regala ignored that her rebels approached from the north with all those machines they were riding they must have made camp up that way the rebels were riding bristlebacks and there were bristlebacks in the daunt are you saying that rebels left them into the dawn how would that even be possible i don't know but it's worth looking into while you're at it there were a number of karja and asaram who went out there before the gates were shut for the embassy maybe you could check in on them see if they're all right they can keep an eye out is there a tallneck somewhere nearby a tall neck there's that one over there near the utara border but why it's uh it's hard to explain it'll help me get the lay of the land if you say so is there anything else i can tell you before you go [Music] this area is no man's land that it is the tanakh used to attack anyone past baron light on site but after avod overthrew the mad sun king he reached out to the other tribes to offer reconciliation that's an act agreed to a neutral border zone as part of the peace talks karja and asaram have been striking out into the area ever since but now it seems like regala and her rebel army have moved in well i'd never call no man's land safe even in the best of times the ancient ruins of the southwest are a testament to that remnants of some forgotten war a rival someone that's knocked chief should have killed yeah i reckon he should have she's obviously a huge threat her attack was coordinated and precise until you got in her way that is they knew the lay of the land and they knew feshav was going to be handed over at the embassy if the tanakh weren't expecting her she must have spent months gathering an army in secret they had to have made camp nearby somewhere they could lie low until the perfect moment to strike do you think the carjo will take action against regala seems like you'd have common ground with the tnox an expedition of the karja army into the west could be taken at the start of another invasion sun king of odd won't risk it that said we can't allow ourselves to be caught unaware by an attack like that again about vashov uh the man was taken captive by the tanakh survive for years out in the west only to die just short of the sundom it's a cruel end for a good soldier there was more he wanted to do he spoke of advocating for lasting peace between the carja and tanox too late for that now what will happen to him his body will be carried back to meridian as the cousin of the sun king he will be accorded official rights and buried with honor no soldier could ask for more it's too bad about nazar and 40s at least nozar went down fighting as for the sun priest well no one deserves to go out that way i'll make sure they're given proper funeral rights it's the least i can do you mentioned the utara tribe their lands are between here and the tanakh further west that's right plain song is their home they're a peaceful bunch at least compared to the tanakh more taken to farming than fighting it's hard to imagine a bunch of farmers surviving in the forbidden west make no mistake they have a fierceness all their own when the karja were pushed back during the red raids their warriors chased ours through the burning fields of plain song the sun king has made several overtures of peace to them as well but so far they've declined if they're so peaceful why decline don't know i heard they have their own troubles to deal with something about a food shortage you'd think that make them open to trade but no they just want to be left alone you said that knox lands are far to the west what can i expect to find between here and there well as i mentioned you've got a stretch of wilderness known as no man's land and then new taru farmlands past that are the tanakh their territory is split into three clans desert low land and sky right i saw their banners at the embassy the desert clan is closest oh vicious lot where everyone else sees an inhospitable wasteland they see a challenge to dominate somewhere beyond the desert is the tribe's capital and the territories of the other two clans you don't sound certain i've only heard the stories during the red raids the karja army tried to push into tanakh territory but the united clans rose up against them forced them all the way back to the dart so no one except that tanox really know what's beyond the desert maybe the scholars do back in meridian although scrolls have to be filled with something right you said there were others who went out when the gates were open before like who well in addition to the salvagers it just went through there were a couple of other parties of osirim delvers even saw two karjar scholars trekking southwest with an awesome crew not sure if they're exceptionally brave or just foolhardy i need to be on my way then i wish you luck the gates will always be open to you should you wish to return and don't worry about your friends we'll get them patched up [Music] i appreciate it sun watch over you eloi i hope you find what you're looking for i can grab this from my stash later so this is the forbidden west a whole new frontier to explore the coordinates from the spire should lead to silence in hades and just maybe a backup of god it won't be easy out there the blight the storms regal as machine learners but i'll have to push through it all find a way to fix the world like a wizard the woman who left the ambush of the gala had a lot of machines under her command there's only one other person who has that kind of knowledge silence what's his angle my help to knock the rebels so [Music] stuff for the stash [Music] it worked wow okay i guess i can leap off just about any cliff now this must be the salvagers i met in baron light looks like something's going on [Music] so [Music] if it isn't the savior of meridian and of my very own operation laryn say hello hello nice to meet you you know if it weren't for this one i probably wouldn't be standing here right now oh nasty business what the tanakh did back at the embassy but everyone in baron light is thankful you drove him off so this is your salvage operation you won't find a better place to trade machine parts in the west and soon we'll be trading in more than just that for too long the west has been well forbidden dangerous but what if i told you we could make an armor so tough so infallible that you'd never have to worry about survival out here again i'd be curious to take a look at it of course you would and that's why i've asked my most talented salvagers to find what they need to make that armor each of them will present their work to me the best protection will go on sale to hunters just like you lucky me now if you'll excuse me i have some business to attend to back in chain scrape larynd can take care of you while i'm gone can't wait to see what you come up with my boy leave it to me it'll blow all the others out of the forge you have got to help me what are you talking about the armor i made a dozen versions of it but none of them were good enough and there are other crews further west if they make better armor than mine i can kiss that keg full of shards goodbye so you get a prize if tariff picks your armor a big one and i finally have the perfect design i just need the right parts and fast so maybe you'd be willing to pick up a contract and get them for me what would i be looking for shell walker containers their plating's made to withstand a lot of damage it'll make the perfect armor i know it i think i can handle that ah thank the forge all right we scouted out of her near here here's the contract it'll tell you everything you need to know you take the machines down my people will pick up the containers i'll give this a closer look later thanks [Music] you
