you're back again and and i'm super naked and there's blood and stuff everywhere i mean what the [ __ ] happened i was kind of hoping you could tell me what happened i feel like i remember bits and pieces but none of it makes any sense yeah same i feel like were we drugged i feel like maybe we were drugged by a cop do they do that who does this guy think he is well sheriff of north kill apparently north kale yeah max what did you even look at the map hack its quarry in north kill that's the town oh and it gets better i gotta look at his name badge and get dressed what's he giving you

get out the [ __ ] is that supposed to mean hey what the [ __ ] is that supposed to mean [ __ ] hey you can't just leave us in here hey come back [ __ ] are you okay it's just a foot it'll heal i meant the interrogation oh yeah can't break old max many have tried many have failed i'm being serious max he uh he just asked a lot of questions a lot of weirdly specific questions about us and where we're going and why and how i was feeling this morning and i don't know nothing i said made him seem any less annoyed he asked how you were feeling yeah well he didn't ask you no huh rude oh hey did you get a look at his name badge you mean it's not really detective dick whippet it's hackett sheriff hackett you think he's related to chris hackett oh my god like the chris hackett yeah who's the chris hackett as in camp leader mr hackett of hackett's quarry remember man last night feels like a lifetime ago the [ __ ] does that mean though you know where we set up maybe it's some kind of crazy camp counselor kidnapping ring that's i mean what like some kind of setup a trap i don't know chris hackett and sheriff hackett there's no way that's a coincidence okay they must be related well what does that prove they knew we were coming maybe it's some kind of kidnapping extortion conspiracy that's a pretty big jump i'm just trying to get us out of here and i can't get us out of here until i have some clue of why the [ __ ] we're in here i don't know what if we can't make sense of it what well you have to sometimes things just don't make sense what then we're just stuck in a backwater jail cell for the rest of our lives this isn't forever max he can't just hold us here forever he didn't seem too convinced of that you gotta stay positive you can't think like that why not might as well just accept it right no [ __ ] that think about the rest of the summer max and school i mean i've been dreaming about becoming a vet since i was five years old i'm not gonna let this fleabag [ __ ] stop me we're gonna get out of here i'm gonna study to be a vet and you're gonna um why i'm gonna why i saw the letter max what are you talking about the rejection letter for college i found it in your bag you were poking around on my stuff i can't believe you didn't tell me i i was embarrassed but your grades were good and you wrote a great essay apparently not good enough [ __ ] you been making plans max what the [ __ ] i don't know what do you want me to say i'm sorry max this this really sucks hey it's not the worst thing to happen this summer i'm sorry i shouldn't have kept it from you you know you can talk to me about anything right yeah yeah i do okay let's just focus on getting out of here for now great sign me up we need to go over it from the beginning like from when we left home like from when we ran into the cop so after we ran into the whatever we ran into yeah actually yeah that's when [ __ ] started getting weird the dude acted super weird when we said we almost hit an animal you remember that it was like he already knew or something yeah yeah that was really sketchy what if he's not even a real cop he's got to be dirty but i mean i think he's a real cop we're in a police station i mean yeah but there's like nobody else around yeah that is concerning especially the whole hacking hackett thing let's just go with the idea that they're both in on it okay so we're supposed to meet chris hackett at the camp and instead there's nobody there and we get attacked by something and then the cop shows up that part's all fuzzy for me like i remember the steps and a smell like wet fur and a a dog collar with the name ian on it ian ian i don't think it was a dog that attacked us whatever it was was big like person sized big yeah it really did a number on you like i'm surprised you're not more messed up like i vividly remember the things teeth ripping into you what is messed up about that is laura i don't have a scratch on me what hey okay so weird question do you remember before we got lost you got lost well yeah but before that i was all like whoa look at the moon it's so big so cool to see a full moon in the middle of the woods and you were all like yeah no [ __ ] max it happens once a month yeah so right so you know full moon what if uh okay no stop i'm just saying you know maybe there's a slight chance it was a werewolf are you out of god damn mine werewolves seriously what the [ __ ] what what what what's so funny i said literally the exact same thing okay do you you got anything better i mean like zombies aliens time hopping draculas ryan right yeah shut the [ __ ] up you let her finish man would it really be so crazy with all the [ __ ] that we've been seeing with nick with the thing on the roof okay we really start to explain a lot of stuff dylan i'm just trying to keep an open mind okay this is like your ghost stories how is it so different from your goals those are those are just campfire stories like there has to be a rational explanation for everything for all of this okay you were not talking so rational when you separated my hand from the rest of my body you told me to and if it's bite with which your face to cleave limb from torso with great haste what you did the right thing see she's got a whole poem about it there's more to all this than you think just let me finish and you can decide for yourself if you believe me or not i don't care but i think you should hear all of it the next few weeks were long the cop kept us fed and let us take showers but aside from that we barely saw him max and i we talked a lot as much as we could about what happened that night it was like trading conspiracy theories we talked about the cop the camp the accident the woods the thing in the basement what happened to max we just kept going over it all again and again and nothing was making sense all we knew is that we needed to get out of there i can't take this anymore it's not that bad they're probably in the same crap at camp no i can't take being in here anymore oh yeah well that part's pretty tough we've got to do something we've got to get out of here we need a plan we keep saying that but it's been weeks so you know let me know if you have one that's really not very helpful max you are forgetting something what just the e.t.b.t tiny detail that i may or may not be a [ __ ] werewolf laura so what what can we do really we run off into the sunset only to be stopped when i turn into a nasty ass monster and kill you and eat you and then i run off alone into the sunset with little bits of you stuck in my teeth okay okay stop just one problem at a time all right we don't even know if that's what's really going on and we won't until we get the hell out of here okay well it seems to me that we only have two real options we can play nice and try to get this guy on our side but so he'll let us go or we try to catch him off guard and make our escape i'm not gonna be nice to this [ __ ] one second longer than i have to we've got to escape cool okay so how i don't know knock him out not laura you know that's kind of a movie thing only right i mean you bank someone on the head you're more likely to kill them or leave them with permanent brain damage not just knock them out well what can you do right prison break it is can we have code names if we're doing code names i have dibs on gold and thunder no seriously max we're doing this okay i'm with you okay here's how it's going to go down next time he opens your cell to take you to get washed up you jump him you tackle him down and take the keys from his belt drag him into your cell lock him in there unlock my cell and then we'll steal his car and just drive right the [ __ ] out of dodge right okay that's not really a plan though you know that's just kind of saying let's escape but with a whole lot more words no he won't be expecting it we're in every teen now we'll catch him in the back foot hmm [Music] come on careful really careful really genius but what about my shower [ __ ] i said take your [ __ ] clothes off [ __ ] off get back that's what's going get the on away from him [Music] come here get off of me shut up have a seat quit squirming said you want to be a vet right call us an internship let me go you're not going to believe it until you see it for yourself just [ __ ] ask next time then dude geez don't get too close come in put your position over just wrapping things up here down to 20. over what's gonna happen well i'll tell you it's not gonna be pretty but don't worry i'll be back at dawn you're really gonna leave me here you'll be fine just don't get too close uh don't worry max i'm here yeah yeah right are you all right uh yeah i don't know i just don't feel so good um what do you need what can i do to help oh it's just hot are you hot i'm kind of stuck next to this big-ass pipe so i'm not exactly cool just stay back okay you shouldn't be this close there's not a lot i can do about that right now max max tommy what's going on yes oh [Music] [ __ ] so much for depth perception let's see what that bastard cop's hiding wow [Music] what's he hiding [Music] what are you hiding travis uh um so hello [Music] not so much a hint as a slap in the face ann radcliffe and edward benson wonder who they are [ __ ] i'm gonna need to rest soon ha mama's boy 56 that means he was born in 1965 this must be what he used to knock me out i can hide this in my cell july 7th i need to lie down [Music] locked figures but i guess i can't leave max better keep snooping or i could go back to my cell and wait i guess [Music] [ __ ] yeah weren't hikers at all but ghost hunters who went in search of answers fell victim to the mercy of the hag of hackett's quarry never to be seen again like us except for the fell victim to the mercy of the part we're we're more like um ghost investigators specter sleuths sure so what happened next well according to reports from the local paper the north kill gazette some hay bales caught fire during the opening night and that spread pretty quickly before they knew it the whole place was up in smoke including the show's leading lady and her alleged baby foreign so i have exhausted this and myself i need to sleep so while the town of north carolina's sleeping the hag in the woods started weeping as the bodies decay the wolves hunt their prey and the sheriff continues his creeping so so so you want to tell me what happened i could ask you the same thing why didn't you run i won't leave max this doesn't mean i trust you i don't care i just want to help him turn around hands against the wall seriously i am too tired to argue me too happy i'll grew some coffee what's this an education watch nice job cleaning up the eye i mean it's harder than they make out in the textbooks especially when nobody's helping you you're the doctor uh animal doctor and no i'm not and i probably never will be stuck in here forever you know just cause you know doesn't mean you know you know uh what i'm not this isn't what it seems to be you're gonna have to be more specific you and max are in just as much trouble as i am my family we didn't mean to hurt anybody we're just trying to survive like everybody else do you understand not really we're gonna end this thing once and for all we so how is your family involved my family is down at the bottom of a well what family is the most important thing in the world but if your whole family you know like every last one of them decided to jump down the bottom of a well and they're all just hanging on the end of a rope how can one person be expected to pull them all back out you can't if you pull on that rope i'm just gonna fall right down at the bottom of the well with the rest of them and what's the point of that right so you you're the one at the top of the well with a rope and yes i thought that was obvious yeah okay yeah i got it forget it let's see how smart you really are what is this information well what does it mean read it when full the moon above shines first the beast internal shall outward burst one by one leads lambs to slaughter it stalks your breath but shuns clear water and should you yourself be cursed armed with silver and the first when moon is full before its wane rend the beast that cursed you slain no longer shall you face your blight or fear the dread of full moon's light yeah keep reading and if it's a bite with which you're faced cleave limb from torso with great haste perchance you'll save your cursed soul before infection takes its toll starting to get the picture it's not a lot to go on and frankly it's [ __ ] why do they have to make it rhyme i don't know but it's all we have to go on kill the werewolf that bit you and you'll be cured it has to be silver has to be full moon seems pretty straightforward to me if you can kill the werewolf and that's a big f i just want to cure max it's not as straightforward as you think if you knew all this why didn't you just kill it in the storm shelter when you had the chance it's not so i'm i they're not too easy to hit i was trying to protect you too [Music] so what's the plan well that's from hoping you come in me yeah cause your studies i haven't even started well you're the best option i got i've been hunting this damn white wolf under the full moon so long i start to think it doesn't exist you know maybe it doesn't matter because maybe there's another way whatever you believe there's got to be some science and you do science look take some time to think about all this i'll be back in the morning seen enough i don't think i'd believe a word he just said if i hadn't so i hadn't seen that i believe him you can't tell me you really trust that guy now i didn't say that i said i believe him about the werewolf stuff not the science bit i don't know what he wants he's a dirty lion kidnapping cop laura we should be careful of anything that [ __ ] says well [ __ ] him he's had his chance to fix this we're getting out of here and we're gonna fix it on our own hey laura yeah i saw what happened what i did to your eye yeah is it bad yeah it's pretty bad i'm so sorry it wasn't you i know it wasn't you i know but it was we're gonna fix you max promise i promise he said let me in there chris i know they're in there oh the counselors that didn't show up how'd you find out bobby told me said you scrapped an abandoned car a while back i worked out the rest [ __ ] why why'd you think chris jesus travis you're still here that's [ __ ] up [ __ ] bet one of them chris was i supposed to do what was that nothing what's your plan can't keep him here forever i am handling it maybe if you've done your job they wouldn't been at the camp that night you ever think of that i'd have done my job you'd all be in prison you were thinking that was all bobby and caleb you know those hikers that that that [ __ ] journalist damn it travis what are we gonna do now whatever happened to we're all in this together shh man let's go to my office we shouldn't talk here max uh max ah what is it travis was just in the hall talking the cop so with chris hackett was he here to let us out no he's the werewolf max chris hackett is the one that bit you down on the storm shelter holy [ __ ] that's who would have guessed i mean i guess thinking about it i could have and yet you didn't it all makes sense that's why chris's car was at the lodge that night travis was protecting him that's why he followed us and that's why he didn't kill the werewolf in the storm shelter because it was his [ __ ] brother god it's so obvious if if chris was the one that bit me then yeah then that's our cure that's how we fix you jesus laura are we thinking the same thing tomorrow we're getting out of here i'm gonna get travis's gun and kill chris hackett hey hey help her lord needs help laura laura are you okay god damn it [Music] what the hell is going on laura oh [ __ ] [Music] uh okay starting to think you were really sick well maybe i should consider acting as my major i wouldn't go that far we should go before he wakes up [Music] we should grab our staff we need silver ammo he must have some around here what is it i thought i heard someone no i still can it's coming from behind that door thank you to us there's nobody in here what the [ __ ] he makes them what is it shotgun shells he loads him with silver that's where he was last month hunting well i guess he won't be needing this anymore hey i just realized something you're free no max we're not free until chris hackett is dead and it doesn't look like we've got much time i know you're right but let's just take the win for now huh we'll celebrate when it's over we're going straight to hackett's quarry and we're ending this tonight [Applause] and i made my way here to camp left max at the island seemed like the best place for him surrounded by water and all that's it that's the story and i'll jump in at the same time wait the island like like our island like the one in the lake yeah why because jacob he went back there looking for emma and he hasn't come back yet neither of them has oh [ __ ] well if they were there they're not there now what's that supposed to mean don't make me spell it out for you i've just come back from there and there's one werewolf and no people oh [ __ ] all i know is i have to do this i have to kill chris hackett before it's too late after you saw me at the pool after i shot chris i went back to the island expecting max to be back to normal but what's up max max max hello what yes so the werewolf i killed can't have been chris that wasn't a werewolf it was haley hackett chris's daughter whatever i shot that was no girl unless i i guess it turned back after i shot it when i went to the island wait so how come max didn't kill you then he tried i got away i need to end this we don't have much time up [Music] so this is our new guest smell good donuts [Music] go on say goodbye dumb [ __ ] animal let me go let me [ __ ] go get your hands off me please let me go okay i need to be ready to happen please please oh my god why aren't you answering me oh oh oh is it is your money that

you've brought me this time shall we the chariot at the reins of a chariot we would all feel safer taking control relying on determination to make our choices valiant but in some cases foolish many seek refuge and chariots but perhaps in some cases they're not as safe as we think they are and the same question as always will you let me show you more [Music] you'll be seeing me a few more times before the night's over i look forward to that as long as you follow the right path of course [Music] you
