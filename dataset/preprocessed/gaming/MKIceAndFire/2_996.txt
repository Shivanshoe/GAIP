so how'd you like that daring rescue in the nick of time you fishing for a compliment tony meet me on the command deck all right we have a short window to make our next move while aim's still on the back foot right right pleasantries later got it it's been years i just can't get rid of you can i hmm who do i want to be today hello my lovelies did you miss me a little higher [Music] a little more hold steady got it you're doing great all right gotta head to the command deck [Music] maybe we can pick up where they left off here's the info we have hopefully it's enough good work keep this up and i might start sleeping again copy data added to the war table we'll send help as soon as we can how's progress on the consoles it's a rudimentary setup nice work we could really use you right now cap okay tony we need to show the world what ames been up to and i've got the perfect opportunity the aim experience in manhattan the media launch for tarleton's new adaptoids every network will be there i think it would be a perfect place for a few dozen missing inhumans to suddenly reappear we have to be careful though aim will bury the truth and kill any remaining prisoners rather than risk exposure we'll need the location of their lab so we can lock it down good thing you captured tarleton second in command if someone can get her to slip it'll be bruce he's already volunteered not bad tony head on down to the interrogation room i'll let bruce know he's on deck miss romanov dr pym would like a word with you at the war table at your earliest convenience looks like you picked up some old friends oh you mean all these ex-shield guys yeah maria's putting her own band back together she lent us some to run the critical systems glad to hear commander hill still fighting the good fight greetings from the anthill natasha thanks for helping save the day back at ames prison and for everything you did as tiny dancer i wonder who our mysterious guardian angel was anytime hank sometimes dirty hands do the best work true and how the hell did you folks get the chimera online let alone airborne without territory the chimera has the same standard engines as older helicarriers which is kind of like a hybrid car but you know cool something tells me this isn't just a thank you call doctor guilty as charged we did a little digging in the data you sent me from the prison aim was able to successfully transport most of the inhumans i've tracked the ship but we'll need someone to go in after it we'll do whatever we can thanks i've already uploaded some mission details to your war table hello miss romanov welcome back to the chimera i have intel on the potential aim defectors that you transmitted to me during your time as tiny dancer i've marked a location on the war table that should be of interest to you thanks jarvis it's good to have you handling mission details coming again just like old times as they say so sound check one two three are we are we on can you hear me okay okay hold on a buzz of excitement has settled over new jersey and heroes park as we count down the hours to the aim experience ceo dr george tarleton has promised nothing short of a revolutionary announcement as the organization prepares to unveil their latest suite of technology including their cutting edge adaptoid ai after five years aim shows no sign of slowing down if i can editorialize for a moment as one who covered the emergence of the age of heroes and the sense of hope and excitement that followed this feels similar but even more inspiring because it's normal human ingenuity creating the technological renaissance that continues to change the way we live it's hard to believe that five years ago the nation mourned one of its shining cities we've come a long way and in this reporter's opinion it's an exciting time to be alive hang in there all right i'm trying it's hard not to feel helpless right now we have to get back and aim for what they've done we will i promise good i'm ready to fight just say when good day adventure come peruse my wares thanks again for well everything you've helped me more than you know kamala hey you've been hanging out with bruce for a while now you think he's up for this little chit chat with monica he's a little freaked out but i've got faith in him all the same i think i'll give him a little pep talk yeah good idea that would

yes ma'am initiating airlock override protocol you've worked with monica for a long time she's changed hasn't she no you see i don't honestly believe she ever had any true feelings for you but if i'm
