[Music] baby what are you doing neighbors are gonna see this you're always at that horse you know i've got a competition coming up look can we talk about this inside but you don't see driving born yesterday who plays golf at midnight that's it walk away like you always do hey you listen can you give me a ride my wife's gone crazy i'll throw some dollars your way ha ha been there done that got the t-shirt hop on board my friend thanks man just let me grab my favorite iron she's not getting that what a mess a really great wardrobe out for all to see whatever i can't deal with it right now [Music] can you drop me off at the golf club in richmond at least i know i'll be welcomed there so you're just gonna leave all your stuff in the driveway yeah i'm not giving her the satisfaction of cleaning that up i'll go to the club get a few drinks in me and hope either her meds have kicked in or the gin is worn off by the time i get back i appreciate you doing this by the way i i know it's kind of a weird one what's your name michael good to meet you you got a little cast buddy what is that italian spanish pure wasp i'm afraid my sister is called muffy so i think i got off lightly so what was that all about ah just the usual psycho female stuff she thinks i've got another woman on the side and do you that's not the point she doesn't know that i have one okay guide a guy now i have a very strict coat only on out of town trips no real names a dead trail that's a gentleman's way right i don't know i'm not that careful then again neither is my wife i'm good like that i don't want to embarrass her then she goes and literally airs our dirty laundry in front of all the neighbors i mean show some class so let me get this straight you're pissed because she's accusing you of cheating when she doesn't know you've cheated even though you have cheated exactly it's a lack of trust she'd be accusing me of it even if i hadn't i've never done anything at that golf club except play golf and that's the god honest truth which is more than i could say about her spin class instructor in fact i wonder if her fat ass is admissible as evidence at court because if she's doing that much spinning it should be like a bowling ball by now anyway sorry you don't need to hear this no i don't it's a horrifying reflection of my own shallow existence money doesn't buy you happiness it just buys you a lot of therapy to talk about why you're not happy thank god for golf that's all i say do you play i try my best what a game true sport of kings you know they still don't let women on the course in los santos it's a throwback to a less confusing time when everyone knew who they were i can't wait to get to the club see the guys forget all about this [Music] if you just drop me off

stand on the union depository hell no we move on that right away before it gets any hotter that's smart meet me the strip joint i'll get word to frank and trevor yo son it's me so uh this is it hope you and michael will be able to uh let each other move on in peace i just hope he keeps his [ __ ] mouth shut you know i mean when the heat comes and we both know we pull this off it's gonna come yes it will come and i think that he will and franklin and franklin what you gonna keep your mouth shut why because i've squealed like a [ __ ] so far hey you ain't seen nothing yet you know bit of heat a few years back there in the midwest and your boy michael he changed his name well the way he tell it it wasn't that clear hey sorry i'm late oh we were just talking about you well don't worry another few hours you never have to talk about me again trevor you're the one who likes to talk watch your back you too that's all i'm saying [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] you it's all right enough thank you okay uh this is it well we have two options they're both little uh out there but then again what do you expect okay option one we hijack their armored cars we take the crews hostage and then we infiltrate the depository now once you're in there and you've got the score we send in a team of modded cars you load up you get out we'll need to infiltrate the transportation grid and manipulate it to aid our escape but option two we cause a distraction out front make him think we're dumb well we've never had a problem convincing people of that have we the other guys will be drilling taking what they can you're going to be the distraction always the attention seeker you know for a guy who's always stepping on his friends to get ahead he has an unfortunately low sense of self-worth okay okay let me show you the board to uh recap these are our options we try to make them give us the gold or we drill a big old hole in the side of the bank and we take it out if you're drilling a big old hole you'll need a big old drill a tunnel bore machine i'll locate it but you have to steal it and store it near the bank they're excavating a new part of the metro network around there so that's where you'll go in we'll need choppers for the getaway to trevor has one we can use the other can be bought the guys on the ground will need a getaway car so get something fast and tough and then modify it as much as you can to increase your chances of getting away from the cops it's got to be stored in a parking garage near the ud there's gonna be a lot of heat so think about that um per i'm forgetting something uh oh that's it we'll need a train to land the gold on and take it to the warehouse you'll have to steal it again i'll send you the details now if you're interested in the more um subtle approach hijacking the armored cars and so on huh you've got to get some police stingers and only cops are licensed to have them so that's a headache of its own oh what else um oh right yeah you'll need to get a hold of and mod some getaway cars then the normal suspension's gonna give out under a couple of tons of gold whoa man a couple of times four tons in total that's what i can get the system to divert into the cage we're hitting [ __ ] me okay okay last thing you remember that underpass we saw from the helicopter now that's where i'll set up the smoke and mirrors to get the cops off your sense i've heard that before michael subtle or obvious what's it going to be [Laughter] um all right we're going through the wall so we'll just need a skeleton crew okay um two gunmen and two drivers the first driver will pilot one of the choppers getting you out of there half the gold will be in that chopper so these better be some safe effing hands and the second driver's in charge of the train i don't think we need to hire someone very expensive for this jobs for the bureau team gunman one is with franklin burrowing in and pulling out the gold gunman two hits the bank lobby with you and makes it look like you're a couple of idiots trying your luck darryl uh i'm not hearing great things to be honest but you just might be able to do this with him well should be okay he's got a few scores left in him we've been waiting our whole lives for this one are you sure you got this right great all right we get the tunnel bore machine and we're good to go [ __ ] glory seeker oh you got any better ideas obviously not otherwise you already killed me and done the gig yourself i mean what kind of vain [ __ ] decides that the best way to rob the largest holding bank on the west coast is for him and him personally to come at the front door the kind of vain [ __ ] who's stuck working with you okay all right all right ladies we gotta move come on man can we [ __ ] do this i'll show you what you need trace daddy are you okay yeah sure why not cause some guys came to our house with automatic weapons maybe i'm dealing with that honey you don't need to worry money doesn't matter when you're dead daddy michael did you find them oh the person who sent the mercenaries to our house i'm working on it are we safe you said we would be safe he's not gonna try that again i'm on top of this amanda trust me really you're sure i'm positive look i love you baby i'm gonna take care of this hey you gotta go remember i'm a bad person [Music] we have a report [Applause] [Applause] so [Applause] michael yeah so we got one of these uh cutter things what do you want me to do with it i paid off a guard at the parking lot around from the bank he'll open the gates for you okay if you trust him leave the truck up there and i'll look after it didn't even get to leave the office for two minutes today all right lester the drill's at the lot good work but let's not get ahead of ourselves there's

but the way i see it there's two great evils that bedevil american capitalism the type that you practice number one is outsourcing you paid a private company to do your dirty work for you and then you underpaid that company because you thought you were big enough and bad enough that you didn't have to play by the rules oh number two offshoring your profits offshoring oh it's horrible you wouldn't want to be sent offshore just to save a little money would you t no i wouldn't oh no i would you and no see but we know your opinions on the matter devon keep your problems the [ __ ] out of america huh in this instance when he puts it like that it makes sense of course it does hey devon goodbye my old friend thanks for all the advice [Music] [Applause] so now what ah now we keep a low profile and get on with our lives as friends well do i have a choice no not really all right then as uh flawed awful totally uncomfortable and poorly matched friends absolutely oh that's perfect then we can get back to the kind of capitalism we practice [ __ ] i don't know how much more better that is than devin's con ooh hypocrisy franklin civilization's greatest virtue jesus your therapist has a lot to answer for i know i still hate myself but hey at least i know the words for it now yeah but i hate you and i know the words for it so does that mean i don't have to go to therapy look man you two [ __ ] terrify me of that middle age i'm good you're right to be afraid franklin yeah be very afraid franklin day one thing t i'm getting too old for this nonsense uh wow michael i see you're back around and making time for your mental health yeah i don't know why it came [Music] what do you want michael i don't know just i just want i want something that isn't this you know just caring about two things at once i want to be a good dad love my family live the dream but at the same time i really want the other stuff too i suppose you haven't really considered the fact that by neglecting your therapy you've guaranteed these behavioral relapses no i hadn't considered that so pal what's the source of conflict this time things are kind of on the uptick doc there's no greater concern than optimism you know what doc i'm okay things have finally come together for me i mean i made a bunch of money and most of those guys that wanted me gone they don't want nothing no more well i'm not going to pretend that my life's not still a mess i mean i know i still got a long way to go you know with my family my friends my aspirations i mean i know i've done a lot of bad things doc i told a lot of lies but doc i'm hopeful [Music] don't hide behind hope michael hope is the enemy of hard work any other acting out friend tell me yeah i mean i've had good days doc but mostly they've just been really bad days they're doing really bad things you know hurting people you're a very sick man michael i'm doing all i can but we need more sessions i want to be good doc i really do but then i get angry hmm [Music] anything else anything sexual i got real lonely so i picked up a girl you know how it is didn't help i still hate myself i don't feel sorry for you i feel concerned you can't manage your emotions better so i feel like there's progress in some areas and you know none in others that's incredible stuff i don't think i've ever heard such a barrage of denial self-justification and outright horror the thing is michael here can we just get a quick photo together cheese what is this i really think i can't treat you anymore the fact is i'm in love with you a [ __ ] talk okay
