what's up legends and welcome back to sniper elite five today we're playing mission number three called spy academy and this is easily one of the most intricate and confusing levels i've played in this game so far there's a good mix of stealth and assault gameplay in this video too which i think you'll really enjoy and this time now that i've got a basic understanding of the game we're stepping up to authentic difficulty which is as tough as it gets that means minimal hud less assists and more aggressive enemies if i mess up if you do go on to enjoy the video and you want to see a full playthrough of sniper elite 5 then let it be known by dropping a like on this video thank you so much for the support on the channel lately it doesn't go unnoticed and without being said let's go snipe some bad guys moeller's still out there somewhere but i've uncovered a dossier referring to something called operation kraken the dossier also details our high-level meeting about to take place at beaumont sandini in attendance forgotten capitan cydel krieg's marine german navy ober stern bonfire richter ausland sd nazi foreign intelligence ober sternbom fiora sauer mulder's representative hopton bruhl head of security local resistance says he's a crack shot it's quite the guest list operation kraken has to be something big but that's never stopped me before [Music] high-ranking nazi officers highly secure fortress shouldn't be a problem fabian richter he's on soe's kill list and this beating's guest list wow lucky him i hear a plane was that stuka i think so it's got the fixed landing gear hasn't it i really want to take this shot doesn't there's anyone next to him zero at 300 meters let's do it [Applause] beautiful shot mind blowing even enemy down got medal for that too nice all right set up here try and scour the area with my binoculars i think that was a safe kill so vehicle on the road ah don't like where you're headed oh there's someone on him [Music] we hit the shot luckily oh yeah i need to act fast now this guy's not onto me yet i need to take a leading shot here miss try that again under the cover of the airplane headshot should be good now quite a few of them down on the beach here one there just chilling some seagulls there's one there as well hmm another sniper glenn probably take you out 320. [Music] there we go getting the hang of this took his helmet right off clean what are you doing two cool guys on a bike i can't mark the guy in the sidecar it's fine we know where he is alarm there nobody next to it what is that hopefully these planes will keep flying overhead because they actually provide good sound cover there's one behind that rock too okay i could take the guy out in the back and then quickly follow up on the one in front let's try it [Music] i don't know what i'm gonna do when i have to enter the castle probably gonna be quite close quarters isn't it i can speed up and slow down these uh kill cams too which is cool that's absolutely brutal okay yeah he's on to me still zero to three hundred [Applause] oh through the spinal cord you can actually see fragments of the spine that's insane it didn't need to be that detailed but it is okay 200 meters this guy please stand still and there it is see the birds fly away as they did now that's really cool oh this guy's seeing me oh no i need to reload full reload as well what the hell how have you guys been there [Applause] man i really gotta check my surroundings there's a delivery van right there okay this guy is none the wiser thankfully beautiful all right area clear i think i didn't finish that guy ah now we're clear try and get some on my back that's all all right lovely let's hide you in the grass just to be sure anyone else down on that beach that's so cool oh what's that intel updated oh yeah i'm not one to just ignore a zipline there's a guy right there though hopefully he didn't see me nice passive oh the plane's coming over trying to get his attention boy hello come by yes this way come on a little bit closer oh i love that takedown just in time too this pokemon saw me how do i take you out there is a weak spot on the vehicle but i can't see it that would be a risky shot to take well i could do if he's just driving around in the same pattern place a landmine down i'm waiting for him to come back here he comes don't want to miss this yes keep going oh my god i forgot there was kill cams for this too that's brilliant whoa it's so overkill really sorry about that gents that can't have been fun uh man's got to do what man's got to do another sniper on that battlement there look he's seen that too need to take the shot before he goes and grasses on me about there [Applause] wow i took his ear off his ear is gone i call that the vincent van gogh that'll be sneaky here let's get a bit closer oh yes the plane oh one to the shoulder and one in the back of the neck brutal the plane covered the sound of my footsteps there too that's really cool all right what do we have here some ammo collect supply pouch okay more ammo we'll take it need to find the way in some sort of minefield that way perhaps i need to disable this alarm operation kraken whatever it is the abbey here at beaumont sandini has the answers meeting could be taking place anywhere where did you come from he must have come down that staircase sneaky bugger yeah that's definitely a they're placing mines better watch my step oh god that's a lot of landmines easy desert well that was almost the end of my play through there let's see that one look is this way safe the guy on that hill wait for the plane [Music] that's a kill shot all right medal unlocked as quiet as a mouse almost just blew up to a landline but hang on i think we've just found our way in i suppose i could climb up that as well easy now almost there careful climb this we made it can't believe that guy okay we're in climb up those vines don't really want to go in that building we'll check this one out officer oh my god the reaction time another guy on his left didn't hear me these planes are clutch and go around this way go on a bridge wait for the plane i switched to the knockout rounds i think they're called or non-lethal it's basically a wooden bullet just knocks them out instead of killing them it's a lot quieter than a standard round i don't know they heard me or someone saw that body probably the latter not discovered yet though there's a guy here too that'll be sneaky [Music] can't hear me there we go plane's gone i'll sleep well sleep well let's hide him down here i don't think he'll be waking up for a while a vehicle oh wait i can climb this right yes oh this is brilliant this is exactly what i need [Music] i need the high ground it saves me walking up and a slice of stairs too this way is a lot cooler almost there i think we're clear that was a very convenient way up missing bolt cutters okay like this we're doing well so far move with the planes whenever they fly over let's take a look at the map actually where are we right now got that off to my left the delivery schedule is kept near the bridge checkpoint all right what's this silenced gewehr don't mind if i do those two of them clobbered in i had to fire there that's gonna be pretty loud unless the plane saved me would have liked to wait a bit longer but he'd see me there dump you in this corner do the same with your friend mp40 i think i'll just stick with the pistol to be honest all right i need to go back this way find the intel there is an alarm system there would be helpful to disable that bowl cutters nice subsonic rounds and there's the intel meetings taking place in an anti-chamber in the top levels of the abbey time to get climbing oh no way i've got to climb it i was close good job it wasn't looking this way i think they heard me down here calm down it's not that serious it's only a body [Music] definitely gonna hear that can't be any more alert than they are now though hopefully it's just this area and the whistle wasn't heard anywhere else [Music] yeah that was the general he commands the regular soldiers so can't give them orders anymore i did unlock an actual scope for this pistol but oh that was good timing oh no i didn't reload rookie mistake you saw me not anymore enemy down sounds like they heard that too hopefully word doesn't spread where is that i see you wait for him to repeat before i take this shot i've got a one-hit kill with a helmet bingo i like these knockout rounds these are cool it's basically a wooden bullet still causes some damage but it's a lot quieter to shoot than a regular round alright let's be careful here i think we've cleared most of this area though hmm if i can shoot him in the face it'll be a one-hit kill what's the guy there come here stay dead yeah they're definitely on to me oh um i guess we're going loud oh his testicles exploded oi come back here what the hell is going on right now what am i supposed to do here without oh there's a plane tell this guy no here we go thank god for that more steps oh that's my favorite thing you gotta love environmental kills that was more would you blow your whistle i think we're in the clear i'm just gonna try and hide these guys in a less obvious spot just stuff them in this box good night hello hello should i blow my whistle in go for the takedown kill yes i don't know what that means oh there we go oh that's what we're looking for what okay he's fine i'm too intrigued by this ladder hatch oh you can slide on it too love that what does this lead oh no look in the footsteps gonna have to snipe him did not have the range for that with my pistol more steps over here too just gonna try and clear the area oh they definitely know i'm here okay that guy doesn't another one outside the church take him out before he sees that body zero 100 bingo [Music] what's inside here then there is an enemy is he gonna come outside no perfect perfect perfect perfect i ranked up too i still know i'm here though there's one here love that one in this tower let's get him you can run i can literally see through walls good night sweet prince sleep well submachine gun short control bursts i'll take this there's a bunch of them down there i'm gonna do this switch back to regular ammo these guys are gonna be a bit more resilient i think 127 meters 67 take you out first zero to 50. come this way a bit more stand still boom there it is don't get these gruesome kill cams with the knockout rounds it's so crazy that the amount of detail seeing the anatomy of the human body right as you put a bullet through their skull can't beat it all right this time we just get a cool outside view another one to the right of him because his helmet love that that's so cool i don't see anyone else i hear steps i was right behind me not today oh jesus that is gruesome i hope it'd fall down that hole bye-bye all right we're all clear over there now oh wait i forgot about this guy [Music] his voice was in slow motion too all right that was awesome let's get back to the main area shall we gotta be distracted there this guy just shot me i don't think so see i don't miss the first shot that guy needs to go back to sniper school oh that's just too tempting oh god oh no um okay i didn't realize there was a massive pile of explosives below that just pretend that happened naturally shall we yeah completely natural that's not gonna cause any attention see this guy's blissfully unaware for some reason okay meetings being held beneath the bell tower time to get climbing just turned his mate into dust i'm going this left side take this guy down try and wrap around the edge i need to make a confession father i did not mean to put that man in such danger and send him to the high heavens now who am i kidding keeps him out of action for a while where can i hide you behind here yeah that's good enough i can't drop you but i'll throw you in that corner i guess silence cover probably not gonna use it in here i just want to make sure we're clear outside here there's an alarm over there stood right next to it what to do he's on the move now this guy's turned his back planes covering my ass once again now i can sneak up on this guy she'll whistle at him again hey buddy nice to meet you all right let's disable this enough jokes this is serious there's another guy down here but i think he's a bit out of range for a melee takedown oh no i found a body died [Applause] what's that face why is he doing that expression he seemed to enjoy it strange guy i have to go loud i think these guys are definitely on to me now oh god all right going loud even though i've got a suppressor they're making all the noise for me goodbye general ow stay down there's no hiding now i had to scale this church anyway so yeah lots of steps god damn that's still a long way up to the bell tower better keep climbing bus come here sleep well i'll take these guys out quickly now wood spreads fast precise shots what is this staircase i feel like i'm playing ready or not ow didn't even see you guys come here my main target is right at the top somewhere this whole place is a maze telling me got to be close to that bill tower by now maybe i have to go out to go in this looks promising so cool man that has to be it this place is absolutely massive the zip line there i must be close voices raised voices locked room that's got to be the meeting i have the key to find a way in bingo this is it now to find out what kraken really is can i get up there like message fighters nothing first officer fabian richter so we want you dead and i'm not one to disappoint my guy's on the left factory the channel a black site whatever kraken is it's being made and tested there that's a lot to take in should take a dossier hard evidence is always useful going in [Music] damage kraken all the officers involved with the meeting are dead not exactly subtle but should slow down whatever cracking is the info got all the information i need but this dossier will make for solid proof of cracking oh wait you can take the zip line can't i feel sorry for that guy he got turned into ashes down there boop his butt a flesh wound put some ice on it i'm sure you'll recover here we go so fun oh boy stood in the open come here what okay dude this guy's a tank oh no way thread the needle that's sick the ricochet too oh my god that's amazing the bullet ricocheted that's so cool this game is something else why does this glow by the way i've been seeing these everywhere i think there's an easter egg for shooting them all there's more of them coming shoot through the door i took his helmet off i did heard his helmet hit the ground all right i guess we're done is a really cool mission absolutely massive this place look at that gorgeous so intricate though but the level design is crazy what is this lead oh here we go got another ladder hatch i've been here already oh yeah i came to check this out earlier there's a ramp here didn't slide down it before though now i get to wee i gotta stop doing that
