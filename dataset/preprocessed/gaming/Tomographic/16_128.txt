oh boy do i have a solos match to show you today now i'm gonna be real i hate solo sometimes but you guys seem to absolutely love my solo gameplay and the watch time is always really high so clearly the solo gameplay makes your viewing experience much more engaging that or most of you out there who watch my solo videos are just too scared to play solos yourself and so you live vicariously through my pain and mental torment it really does feel like a horror game at times but i have got a ridiculous match to show you today and speaking of ridiculous i'm using the new krieg eyestrake blueprint in today's video which also has an ice dismemberment effect which is also very cool pun intended and just look at this inspect animation i mean how crazy is that does it fit into the more grounded world and overarching story of modern warfare cold war and war zone however i don't really think it does but warzone does seem to be taking a much more playful and experimental route since the cold war integration so let me know your thoughts on these weird and wacky blueprints that have been popping up in the store lately you know the krig isn't super effective in warzone right now which is why i don't have it fully ranked up but these are the attachments that i'm using if you do enjoy the video though make sure to leave a like as it really helps out the channel and subscribe for more content like this oh and do let me know in the comments down below if you want to see more solo gameplay in the future at the expense of my own mental health and sanity thank you guys for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one all right let's do this i don't usually play warzone this early but they've added this new craig dragon blueprint which just looks insane and i mean i had to i had to get it gotta get the content for you guys if any of you do use the craig then i mean you know this is a good way for you to see the the weapon in action stand up boneyard never start here so but yeah the um the attachments are really weird on it you know like if you're buying this blueprint you're not buying it for the competitive edge you're buying it for the cool factor or if you're a game of thrones fan or a content creator like me soldier oh you're so blind he didn't know what day it was after that him flash banged him into the middle of next week right give me that i thought i'd be fighting him with a pistol there like i thought he'd have a pistol but just be me with the ffr almost got me i'm gonna take this truck before anyone else does there's a guy see in this corner no it's fine well done that's my bounty done was it that guy though um let's play up and hear him running around in there jesus peekaboo just jumped out of me all right let's put this plate box down and drop my plates take those and take this one for later lovely stopping power as well why not cool it's probably a bad idea actually because i've just left seven plates lying on the ground for whoever lose that guy next all right so let's drive around see if we can find anyone it's currently 10 38 in the morning i'm feeling pretty rusty right now it's gonna take me a few games i didn't even mean to mount there that guy scared the crap out of me i've got a new ambidextrous mouse and it mirrors the uh mouse buttons on both sides of the mouse so i just mounted unintentionally there by hitting the right side of my mouse oh gave me a heart attack oh no no that threw me off i thought that guy was just gonna let me run him over i got out of the truck not knowing where it was gonna put me and then it just threw off my aim all right we gotta regain now i didn't have my loadout so hopefully we can come back to the front line you lose your fight is over and 94. here we go this thing's so slow man i wasn't gonna put me brilliant like three thousand meters away from boneyard it's fine gonna try and steal this truck definitely doesn't spawn here does it no goodbye there he is all right let's look at this house hopefully no one's in here very good right i need my loadout let's get involved there is he's crossing into the to this building what do you call it let's try and get the jump on him hit him with a flaming thrower knife before finishing him off lovely it's a great little flank that it's a few ways on top of this building okay light control oh he's got rpg i don't think so matey that was my last bullet to kill them as well all right please don't be anyone else put a trophy on top and gtfo if there's another truck i can take that'd be great loadout quick craig lw3 that's what i'm rocking yeah the new blueprint on this thing is nurse whether it's grounded in the reality of war zone i don't know it's a bit of fun though going the mini map over here sounds like there's a big fight going on wait you're still in the open looking to get squished uh it makes me feel so bad every time it's so hard to avoid this truck when it gets in close proximity oh god selfres get uav as well back to the truck i'll drive we have a contender ready to go he almost got me there to be fair got my house quite low the strafe speed of this raider stock is just nuts it's the ffar for you though everyone's using it i'll take them onwards noah i need another truck so i'm gonna try and take this one saw on the map earlier oh there's a guy there seen me i think i'm squishing this guy am i you can see it coming oh my god that dismemberment is insane you see that his frozen limbs just flew all over the place what is this guy doing coming out of the zone so late he's been at the ship this whole time how did he get the truck stuck maybe oh no it's fine go away [Music] pack you dude mine's bigger than yours i know you're just jealous chase me chase me let's go this way come on follow me i don't have full plates i just realized oh no the raiders stopped ruining me again it's over no he ruined himself what have i just witnessed what have i just witnessed oh my god this guy had me get wrecked son get mad he got cocky and went for the assassination and because he got behind me the animation put him inside the truck which just crushed him oh my god that is hilarious it's one of the single greatest moments in my warzone career that's so funny man requesting never gonna forget that moment uav entering the ao work together airstrike either be advised i wish i could see the reaction on his face as that happened he's never playing this game again not after that there's a guy there let's get the sniper out how he's missing why were those shots so inconsistent i was just whiff after whiff after whiff but the shots that hit didn't look any less accurate than the ones that didn't that's bizarre all right a series of events that was it's not over yet still in this all right it's changed to another truck i hate that this is the solo meta but oh no that's okay it did its job let me try and get ahead of these guys hopefully i'll make it to this truck first because i mean i was vehicle coming come on that's a hit i'm not landing that just drawing attention to myself okay let's reload and uh take this vehicle just you wait till the end game everyone is going to be in a vehicle of some sort solos gets crazy it's like a horror game in the first half and then just intense mad max style gameplay in the end game i think this has to be the truck that drove past me before yeah this is definitely his vehicle be in those buildings now where do i go is the question lots of places to hide but he feels safest in my truck right now if i check if there's anyone over here doesn't look like it's another vehicle ahead of me oh we got out wait did he get out yeah he did enemy uav over any goodies for me full gas mask some ammo i'll drive i'll take it there's a truck down there could air strike it no he's in it now he stays on that road like an airstrike ahead of him he's coming towards me i don't know what to do so many people in this circle the best buildings for cover are all occupied here we go i thought he's going to jump out of me this guy's ready for a squishin oh my god how is this game see what i mean look at all the vehicles in this one area it's nuts these four ton trucks are just a huge problem in solos they need to get rid of them there's definitely someone under here i want to try and use this buy station there's a bouncing betty in the grass there i think almost killed me kind of ruined himself there did a lot of damage to himself with the explosion luckily for me be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply still in the uav ahead of me i just got beamed this dude's gonna be coming up any second gas is pushing him now there we go yeah the dismemberment is nice i got my airstrike back from earlier forgot about that uh oh god what am i doing no give me that vehicle back i don't like it positioning is compromised and i'm in a vehicle that will be one hit with a c4 now so oh look at this gem this absolute gem but weirdly no one's taken oh my god oh my god what is this guy doing that guy needs like david attenborough commentating over him and here we have a wild camper in his natural habitat i'm sorry that was terrible any rats under this bridge there we go oh he's ready for me got [Music] oh no that's not good found him i put an airstrike on it i think i have the time oh god how no this game is so chalk dude no yes [Music] so dead i'm so dead come on man what was the end game that was so crazy 17 kills on the board oh that could have been that could have been a win easily if i'd have just run that guy over against the van easy dub gg though i mean can't be mad at that that was that was good fun the turning point in that match was when that guy went to assassinate me on the back of the truck and got himself killed by the truck itself that was so funny what an insane match that was oh that was intense gg guys i came here to get the content with the new dragon craig blueprint and we've got so much more you
