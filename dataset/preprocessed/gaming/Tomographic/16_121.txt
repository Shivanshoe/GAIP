there's a window here there's a lot more cover there next roof is being beamed did you just hit the most disgusting jump shot flick shot i just saw that in third person you're my hero okay quick recap after much anticipation season three's live event source launch a nuclear missile at verdansk big nuke go boom and the dance because we know it it's changed forever that's right will there's a it's your favorite time of the year it's rewind time and with that we go back to 1984. am i getting a little too carried away with this intro the answer is yes but stick with me so the old verdansk is gone and sadly we will never play it again but we're now in a 1984 version of a dansk in springtime the lighting and general vibe of a dance has completely changed but that's not all my friends there are seven new locations and there is going to be so much more to discover throughout the season season three launches with an all-new narrative event called the hunt for adler and introduces two new operators wraith and knight who heads to yamato to help carry out stitch's grandmaster plan and after successfully extracting the numbers data from yamantal and with stitch's work on adler almost complete wraith and knight set off a nuke of their own destroying yamantal mountain and leading to the hunt for adler event in warzone and black ops cold war and that brings us up to speed with the season three story so far what we do in the way for the rise of greater russia so season three is the beginning of a new era for war zone one that brings vedanska back to 1984 with massive changes to the map so how have the multiple new and reworked locations changed exactly well let's take a look first up is gora summit a sprawling complex with a central island base three gondola stations complete with working gondolas and a lower river valley to ascend on foot this single location is bigger than many of call of duty's multiplayer maps yet should be familiar to veterans of the original black ops games bridging the chasm in front of the summit is the viaduct the bridge spans the gora valley with dams further upstream causing the valley below to be a lush grassland here you can find ascenders drop off the bridge onto gondola roofs or if you can calculate everything just right try to snipe some poor soul across the dansk from this epic vantage point this location is massive maybe too big for a point of interest so far up north but time will tell just how popular this spot will be among players next up is the old stadium which is being dismantled in preparation for the construction of the modern day stadium that we're all familiar with and it is much more open than the original stadium with high vantage points such as an announcer booth and an archaic scoreboard with insane sight lines as well as a huge crane for you to drop onto and there's even an interior and an underside walkway running around the perimeter to a hole in the arena wall which is big enough to allow a cargo truck onto the pitch now perhaps the biggest new landmark and certainly the easiest to spot is the grid radar array need a sight line over central verdansk while this new point of interest has you covered i can already see my friends plummeting to their death off this thing i don't need to mention any names you are very exposed up there so it's definitely a high risk high reward location then formerly known as quarry are the salt mines this sprawling space has two large and currently sealed entrances numerous old mine conduits and a large craggy hillside to explore about the containment ponds and factories the woodland above the salt mine is a great place to watch the action down below while the crystallizing pools run red with the beautiful chemical reaction of salt yes it does indeed look like they've been collecting our tears over the last few months of war zone superstore has also changed quite a bit not only is the interior lighting much brighter now giving those pesky rose skins nowhere to hide but the roof is now completely open which could make for some very intense vertical gunfights but that's not all expect a large number of adjacent threats thanks to the new factory location remember the car dealership and the silos or the water treatment works just east of superstore well this is now a brand new area featuring four large warehouses outside is a large hangar numerous outbuildings and a parked plane and a fuel tower similar to the one that you can find at salt mines perhaps now the superstore won't be the most popular drop spot after this update or at least if the area gets too hot you and your squad have a backup option one of the biggest changes downtown is the broadcast tower currently under construction the interior of which is now more accessible with a stairwell running to the top of three unfinished floors where views and long range takedowns are spectacular you can find the fan favorite map standoff in krovnig farmland part of which as you may know is also playable in the new gulag there is lots more to explore in the dansk 1984 as well as new secrets to uncover in the coming weeks something tells me that the old mine along the north western edge of the map is hiding something special the interior mine complex is currently blocked off as you can see but i'm sure this will be accessible at a later date new weapons are also coming later in the season like the amp full auto pistol that you can see wraith using in the hunt for adler cinematic and the new carve2 tactical rifle which i actually picked up as groundley when the season first went live and it felt super strong up close with barely any recoil i don't think any of us want another overpowered burst meta so hopefully it's not completely busted when everyone gets their hands on it later in the season i've got some gameplay to show you now that gives you a more in-depth look at some of the smaller changes around the dance and what gunfights actually look like in some of these areas but first do me a favor this video took a considerable amount of time to put together so make sure to drop a like to help me break into youtube's algorithm it's not a huge task on your part but it helps me out more than you know and if you enjoyed and you're not already subscribed make sure to do so with notifications turned on because there is

out where you live i mean i don't know if they're called a gondola yeah you're right mugs isn't it you're right that is definitely shorter i'm not losing my mind it's going to be way higher like another quarter higher it's a baby i don't know oh yeah no there had to be a massive parachute jump together it was like i actually don't know you jump out of was here just size matter though guys you know i don't think we need to judge it based on its size honestly i think we do one hp this is safe welcome to tomographic tours if you look into the ravine to the right hand side you can see that there's now added cover for cover and if you want cover you can take cover ah on that roof one just got knocked out right there on blue route you can see a crane over broadcast tower which is currently under construction we could drive by and beam these men if you would like to he will not be getting a refund for his tour tickets full teammates is great i won ruined actually ruined some death oh there's a guy right next to me i hate it there's an armor box here there's an armor box here i'm grabbing it you got a res okay i'm gonna check it down intense sense why do i live just to
