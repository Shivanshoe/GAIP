season five is finally here and in today's video i've got some awesome mini royal gameplay to show you and i think this might just be my new favorite way to play warzone it skips the slow paced early game and allows you to get straight into the action during the final few circles which is always the most thrilling part of any battle royale game i also really wanted to hit the ground running with season five so i actually purchased all 100 tiers of the battle pass to unlock the new iso submachine gun as well as the a 94 assault rifle i wanted to showcase the new legendary blueprints for both new weapons and the a 94 blueprint actually comes with these awesome shadowy tracer rounds which look really cool in game i need to spend some extra time unlocking all of the attachments for both new weapons before i bring you my loadout recommendations but these blueprints were at least usable and the a94 setup isn't far off how i imagine most people running it in warzone with that said do make sure that you're subscribed so that you don't miss out on any future warzone and season five content leave a like if you enjoyed the video and i'll catch you in the next one well then what else um i think the smartest thing to do is just to loot nowhere near damn and then just move in yeah the millie based i think how many we got not sure oh come on lamppost jesus do you like the new trails i think that's cool let's use that i've got so much monies i don't know stuff we've got to use that question yeah there's nothing coming in so we got to be careful come on start it's quick is it okay
