the new armored trucks in warzone so broken that raven had to remove them and not because they were blatantly overpowered which they definitely were but because somehow the invisibility glitch found its way back into the game and it was caused because of these trucks now the armor trucks you might have seen before a few seasons ago before the cold war integration they were in fact in a limited time game mode called armored royal but basically someone at raven i guess thought they didn't want all of their hard work to go to waste developing that truck system so they decided to add it to the core game mode and as you can imagine it completely broke the game raven didn't address the fact that in and of itself the truck is completely broken but obviously they did pull it for other game breaking reasons but there's absolutely no way that this truck could have stayed in the game the core battle royale game modes just ended up feeling like a limited time game mode and i'm not gonna lie we had a lot of fun stomping people with the trucks but it's just not fair if you're on the receiving end of it like we were a couple of times it's absolutely horrible the best way to defeat them was to use the cavalry lancer barrel on the lmg or whatever cold war weapon you have the vehicle damage buff that you get from that barrel is enough to take the trucks out pretty quickly but the barrel itself isn't exactly meta so you won't find a lot of people using it regardless the truck is gone now who knows if they're gonna add it back but i really hope that it stays out of the game there's no reason for it to be in the main modes but i've got some gameplay to show you now playing with the fast squad thuggler acolyte and stone 64. let me know in the comments down below did you get to try
