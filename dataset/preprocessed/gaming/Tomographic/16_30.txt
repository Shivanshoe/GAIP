oh i wonder if the spas 12 is still as broken as it used to be back in the day because it's still one hit like it did before there's only one way to find out no way [Music] oh how are you alive the last guy died oh it's another one don't die don't die oh my oh we dropped a frag grenade right as i killed him what the [ __ ] yes give me more i need more kills [Music] [Music] let's go we actually hit it yes i love that this server is just trick shots only and people are still doing this today what was that oh my god i am having too much fun thank you honestly i need to calm down hello legends and welcome to modern warfare 2. it's not exactly the same one we all remember playing you probably saw the damascus intervention in the intro and you can see here that there are some custom maps and fan favorites like nuketown as well as the inclusion of all the weapons from previous chord titles like the peacekeeper from black ops 2 and the m40a3 from cod4 and this is all made possible by a free mod on pc called iw4x i'll leave a link in the description if you want to check it out for yourself but i've been playing modern warfare 2 for the past couple of days now and i haven't been able to stop playing since it's safe to say the nostalgia has fully washed over me and i just feel like a kid again playing this game modern warfare 2 was the first call of duty game that completely took over my life as a kid coming home and grinding full camo on all of my guns and racing my friends to max prestige which by the way with this mod if you want to do that you can just click barracks go to unlock stats accept and boom you've got max prestige with all of the weapons and cameras you know the game's been out long enough now that people don't really want to spend their time grinding out unlocks on a 13 year old game another great feature of this mod is it allows you to play with uncapped frame rates and a custom fov which you just couldn't do in the base game so if you haven't already clicked off this video and started the download then i highly recommend you check it out and all you have to do to thank me for bringing this to your attention is to subscribe to the channel and hit the like button i don't ask very often but it really does help out the channel and it gives me a better idea of the types of videos you guys enjoy so if you want to see more modern warfare 2 content from me before the release of modern modern warfare 2 later this year and let me know in the comments below and i would be happy to deliver and maybe even bring some friends along next time so then without further ado we're gonna jump in on a custom server now and i'm gonna do my best to get a nuke for you today so wish me luck because these lobbies get pretty damn sweaty oh yeah some classic team death match on underpass let's do this baby okay i do wanna see what this game looks like with maxed out fov oh my my sensitivity is so high now now that looks stupid that looks stupid oh emotional damage okay the admin restarted the server for some reason but i joined later anyway so it's fine by me i didn't see that guy until he jumped oh come on i was fully around that corner i actually feel so good playing this game again there we go oh they're all spawning over here look on the uav i forgot how crazy the time to kill was in this game it's actually way lower than i remember okay i need to try and rotate to my go-to spot on this map the slums you can't sprint for very long in this game that's why marathon exists yeah this area here this was my bread and butter it's on above me i can actually hear his footsteps a12 still as op as it used to be but that's okay because everything in this game is overpowered and that's why people loved it there you go how are you seven kills already i think they're all underneath that bridge come on harrier at least get me one kill there we go there we go that's 10 kills without dying one more for the ac 130 all over there somewhere there we go visibility is terrible in their spawn i suppose that's a good thing all right here we go i don't think this is the best ac 130 map i think the chopper gun is better on this because you're a bit lower yeah that everyone's inside buildings is going to be really hard trying to thread the needle through that window there we go yeah this top down bird's eye view isn't really helping me come on there we go guy god the acr is such a beamer where is that guy he's going close to me i'm gonna wait for him oh no where did you come from oh it's this map what is this one called i forget oh look at this guy just sniping people as they spawn what the hell you're so good at this game oh my god the ump he's up there how is how is the ump that good oh and the spas as well my god just so powerful i was a tattoo insertion here oh feels bad nice trick shot bro you're cracked five kill streak come on let's get the harrier that's a little bit of recoil at that distance four steps how do you get over there so fast that's not where i heard him there he is seven kill streak got the harrier somebody steps around me right now that guy's dead oh it's sketchy i'm gonna call mine in was it six yeah helicopter here we go oh god someone's already shooting at me are you kidding me that has to be the shortest chopper gun i've ever used people are on it now they don't mess around oh man it feels bad let's go outside my building okay he's inside my building and inside my face scared me teammate from good place for the nuke right now no no no no i thought my team was spawning over there oh [ __ ] where is he why are you in that bush oh you're not in that bush oh i'm so confused why did my chopper gunner last two seconds and this guy's been in the air for like five minutes okay now he's dead it's a bit of an exaggeration but i just wanted the nuke man give me the nuke this isn't working for me what i need is the ultimate nuke class which is the acr with a red dot red tiger very important equipment whatever semtex stun grenade uh scavenger pro so i can get my armor back stopping power of course for increased damage and ninja i swear juice was called painkiller before maybe it's different in the mod uh shotgun a12 with extended magazines and that is what's gonna get us the nuke oh baby we got afghan as well the stars are aligning this is a great map to get nukes on we gotta get one at least team deathmatch played this for three hours yesterday and didn't get a nuke so i need to speak into existence this is the first time i've even played afghan in this rotation i'd actually love to see this map in the next modern warfare game if they remastered it it'd be so good two oh my god the time to kill in this game is crazy i need my health back i'm gonna try and go down to the right here here please getting hit markers i'm just not getting the kills you guys dead it's two kills nice one harrier i think next killer get the ac 130 yes come on this has got to be it i hope no one finds me there oh yes look at him they're right next to me come on there we go we're owning we got it let's go i don't even care anymore i don't care for these kills this server though i don't think it ends when i call in the nuke which is actually quite cool it's like a moab in uh modern warfare 3. it doesn't just end the whole game for everyone which i quite like i don't think a lot of people are a fan of that aside from the person calling in the nuke which i'm about to do oh my god that sound effect that is pure nostalgia right there three two one i love it damn so much for playing afghan that guy said he doesn't know let me tell him don't worry the server continues when it goes off oh man that's so good has it got darker since the nuke went off i feel like it has oh didn't know stone mountain was still playing this game checks out i've had such a good time playing this game the past couple of days it's been such a nostalgia trip for me this acr just rips people apart yeah sorry mate that's how it goes i'm just about to end i get a couple more kills that's one oh my how is it that accurate range you can literally compete with snipers with this thing oh my god there's a chopper gun i didn't even realize 55 kills how did we lose that game i wasn't paying attention hey look at him going ham with a chopper gunner crazy how powerful the kill streaks used to be gg all right well there it is we got the nuke modern warfare 2 in 2022 still holds up man what a time to be alive [Music] you
