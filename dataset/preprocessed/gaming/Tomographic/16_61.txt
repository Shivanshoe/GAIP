hello everyone and welcome back to sniper ghost warrior contracts 2. now i've got some explaining to do because after the last video i posted on this game i honestly thought i was done with the main story and my actual plan for today was to play through the dlc level that got added maybe a month or two ago but it turns out there was actually an extra level that had unlocked after the last mission i played so mistakes were made on my part definitely but let's be honest nobody really plays sniper ghost warrior for the story and it looks like this mission is relatively short so we're gonna run through this one in just a minute but before we do that i have to give thanks to today's sponsor alienware who recently hooked me up with one of their new m15 r5 ryzen edition laptops and i've actually been using this thing daily for a couple of months now without a hitch it comes with some pretty impressive specs too which is great for gaming video editing and working on photoshop all of which i do frequently as a content creator it combines an 8 core amd ryzen 9 5900 hx processor with an nvidia rtx 3070 laptop gpu giving you access to features such as dlss which uses ai to give you high frame rates while maintaining excellent image quality and another great nvidia feature is nvidia reflex which enables lower system latency while you're gaming it basically reduces the time it takes from a mouse click to an action happening on screen and speaking of screens we've got this beautiful 1440p 240hz display which is pretty similar to the one that i use in my home office setup which is something that my eyes appreciate when i switch from my home pc to the laptop so then if you want to check out the alienware m15 r5 for yourself you can do so by clicking the link in the description below and of course a big thank you to alienware for sponsoring this one raven it seems we were wrong about tahir no his actions since taken over the presidency have been troubling not to hear we recruited him two years ago due to his connections with kumar and his articles critical of the alba family he's that guy we saved in the last mission there were no plans to replace rashida back then just keep a weather eye on her activities i've killed her already all that changed onto here's last trip he told us about the attack before they picked him up and we needed to act you got the job the election afterwards was just good fortune or so we thought looks like our friends in the east got to him now he's working for them with tahir running things our whole game planning kumar will be blown feel so betrayed we intercepted a transmission indicating tahir and his handler have a meeting scheduled okay the handler's identity is unknown but he's in a village close to the airport we do know he's a heavy smoker and smoking kills oh i'm picking up your burn down after eliminating the handler make sure to hear against the same treatment it'll be a powerful message to the other side plus we'd rather have a neutral running cooler instead of one of those we need your long shot skills as we can't get close to the target sights speak to you on the ground copy that sean bean let's do this i'm on the x clear path to the high ground i'm not even gonna try and pronounce that eliminating this contact is as important as killing to here this guy is still at the village ahead to night mission confirm we've monitored calls between them and know that the contact smokes heavily no other id available their meeting is scheduled for tonight at the airport to here is on route to that location now this is our best chance to terminate each man without alerting the other that ridge has solid foot access to ops for both sites roger all i'm asking mike wait i'm oscar mike i thought my name was tom i've been light all these years i was close let's climb up here let's not get spotted straight away someone here yes oh no it's a juggernaut don't want to deal with him just yet [Music] did you hear that yeah checks out gonna need my eagle for this so anyway i'm taking him down even that takes two shots geez 50 cal bullet to the face look at this guy that's one way to get rid of the evidence isn't it instant cremation i think i need to scale that overwatch though some kind of tower ahead that could be a good op solid elevation over your terrain oh i almost missed that guy if it wasn't for his flashlight might be someone up there don't turn around i miss my real life this job makes me feel like i'm a character in a video game focused on a very specific purpose i had to let him finish that line casually breaking the fourth wall oh so annoying how did you survive i think i shot him in the shoulder let's make sure he's dead that was graphic control i have overwatch homography village is below me we're sending a message to the other side so make sure you confirm id before terminating he has a bad nicotine habit to hear doesn't like it always complaining about the smell oh yeah there are three civilian advisors there it has to be one of them acknowledged i need to look out for the smoker don't miss alert him and he have eyes on a civilian suspect what about the others there's a lot of enemies patrolling this area jeez big chungus as well he's always on patrol there's one bingo not enough for confirmation yet it's not a group here but target inside potentially get confirmation don't see a smoker just gotta play the waiting game i guess follow their paths sniper there now what are you doing just staring into the abyss maybe he needs a smoke break come on show me the cigarette bingo yes we have a smoker you have the green light send when ready sending now is there twofer where did that even hit i don't know but we got him good shot raven that is a confirmed kill two birds one stone let's move you can exfiltrate now wait if they found me that's an enemy smoke grenade where are they though there's one oh god there's actually no other way for me to get down unless oh that worked somehow semtex is that it that's it okay well that actually went better than expected i thought we were gonna send waves after me seems to be just the one patrol damn that guy's face is gone let's get as much ammo as i can off these guys let's hope that word hasn't gotten to here because he's next on the list but number one priority for me to eliminate him i can't believe i i missed this mission entirely a bunch of people said are you gonna continue sniper ghost warrior and i thought well yeah i finished the main story turns out i didn't here we go more enemies ahead just two on thermals for the looks of it oh don't shine your light in my face like that dude neat oh my god i missed still worked as a good distraction could have thrown a rock instead i threw a knife i know someone's got someone's got the c word it's coughing all over the place let's try this again there it is i don't think i'm gonna need those three knives back oh no oh it was a sniper jesus he took a b and didn't he oh no there's more i gotta get off my feet [Music] well you're off your feet now on the cold ground anyone else in the vicinity i think so it's got vector this is the first knight map we've played on in this game control looks pretty good i'm on the op i can see the lights of the airport roger we're tracking a vehicle approaching from the service road left side could be to here any special orders against position negative but you may only get one shot at him there's a lot of cover there and plenty of escape routes so take your time yeah try to hit him before he boards the transport plane acknowledge daw let's do this raven out is he in the vehicle i didn't quite catch that i don't see anyone that looks out of place that's got to be him i could have just sniped him from here i have eyes onto here but late night exiting the vehicle positive confirmation what distance is that don't rush this if you miss or spook him he'll run i'd rather just kill him immediately a thousand meters we're piggybacking i don't care mate i've done it the triple collat oh wait what the target splashed did i not hit the first guy well done well he's dead you have hostiles closing in on your location sorry what oh they've got flares [Music] son of a there's an enemy there oh god the sniper's looking at me and they're firing mortars the big chungus just beyond that tree another killing with a deagle shot or assassinate him those mortars might end up killing them at this rate i upgraded my uh skill tree earlier so i can assassinate the big dudes now oh that actually helped me yes targets eliminated you've taken down to here and removed our friend in the village that's the cabinet controller there's more of all your help out here you might not have made it through without the intel this is raven signing off staggered it's assassin's name what the hell i would kill him i thought he counted it he's about to kill me all right well that's gonna do it then for this video i guess that's a pretty short mission but we finally finished the campaign a month after my last video on this game hey i guess that means that we're not totally finished with this game yet i'll see you in the next one you've done it raven kumar is finally at peace and free from all external forces sadly even ours but we can live with that for now i'm sure they'll elect another president but they'll need a strong heart given what's happened to the last three and you can take art yourself he stopped a war removed a lot of very unlikable people from the planet and not least save millions from seeing a new go off first hand unaid organizations are mobilizing kumar's population will have the food and resources they need during transition oh and uh one last thing we've worked well together you've proven to be a capable operator and i've been proud to have you in my old unit and i don't say that to many it's alex by the way my name is alex i'll send you the number of a burner phone just in case one day i might even buy you a pint [Music] good luck control out
