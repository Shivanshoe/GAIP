hello legends so i decided to play through call of duty 4 again recently for one reason and one reason only to get to this point in a game's campaign and relive what i think we can all agree is one of the greatest levels in video game history i am of course talking about all gillied up and as a young lad i must have replayed this mission at least a dozen times with a different strategy each time i came back to it and since the game got a pretty decent looking remaster in 2016 i figured i'd take you all on a trip down memory lane and replay this level for the first time in what must be at least 10 years for me and maybe for some of you watching this video will allow you to experience orgillydub for the first time ever and in a resolution that we could only dream of when the game was in its heyday all gili darpa is presented as a flashback in which the player assumes control of captain price himself who at the time was just a lieutenant and you are assisted by captain mcmillan who is known for saying some of the most memorable voice lines in call of duty history set in 1996 15 years before the events of the game in a town called pripyat just outside chernobyl which was abandoned after the 1986 nuclear disaster your mission is to locate and neutralize this guy imran zakiyev who let's just say was responsible for some very bad the sniping mechanics are really nothing to write home about compared to modern day shooters in fact the gunplay and movement had very little depth in god for but that's not what made all ghillie dub so great it was about the overall experience and this level was most notably praised for its harrowing atmosphere intense pacing and player freedom so with the foundation laid and all of that being said i'm gonna shut up now and leave you to enjoy the video so grab a drink grab a snack and let's play all gillied follow me up keep low careful there's pockets of radiation all over this area if you absorb too much you're a dead man stand by [Music] contact enemy patrol dead ahead stay low and move slowly will be impossible to spot in our regular suits good night move hop up there's more cover if we go around four tangos inside don't even think about it wait there tingle by the car take him out quietly or just let him pass you're cool okay go move up don't move we've got to look out in the church store on the patrol coming from the north let's move up for a better view [Music] do you have a shop on the lookout target approaching from the north take him out quietly down go forward area clear [Music] coast is clear you hear that enemy helicopter get down stay in the shadows my school get down no [Music] easy one there's too many of them let them go keep a low profile and hold your fire try to anticipate their parts movements

should be able to observe the exchange for the top floor up there let's move [Music] [Music] [Music] entering the target area the one's getting a bit choppy you can compensate for it or you can wait to date but he might leave before it dies down as your goal remember what i've taught you keep in mind variable humidity and one speed along the body's flight path at this distance you'll also have to take the coriolis effect into account okay i think i see him wait for my mark target acquired i have a positive idea on emranza kf steady keep an eye on that flag watch for any change in one speed and direction ah where did he come from patience why they wait for a clear shot [Music] it's time to we'll have to take a move this is alpha six we have been compromised i repeat we have been compromised
