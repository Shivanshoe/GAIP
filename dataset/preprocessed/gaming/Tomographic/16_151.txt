hello everyone and a very happy new year to each and every one of you so i just wanted to start this video off by saying a huge thank you for all of the support that you've shown not only towards me but also to my friends and their respective channels over the last year it's really difficult for me to imagine doing a job like this one during a year like 2020 without their company and i know for so many of you that you've also felt like part of the gang whenever we've made videos together so that's definitely been one of the most rewarding aspects of our combined success in 2020 it's uh it's been a strange year for humanity on the whole but here's hoping that we can all take back a sense of normalcy in 2021 so i'm starting off the year kicking off with more warzone content and full sending on this game hopefully it continues to provide content for me if it does then i'm sure be covering this game for the foreseeable future but who knows what we'll all be playing by the end of the year i for one have my fingers crossed at this new warzone map that is apparently rumored for march i believe one year after war zone's release i'm just i'm really hoping that the new map breathes new life into the game because let's be honest if you're watching this video we all love warzone and want this game to last at its core the gunplay and mechanics such as the respawn system and gulag have all been real game changers for the battle royale genre and it's always been an absolute blast playing this game with friends even with all of the bugs and broken guns we've been through so much crap with this game but at the same time it has provided hours of what feels like endless entertainment and really good times with all of my friends and to my friends old and new acolyte stone buglet stoddy westy and jack frags and anyone else i've met along the way seriously thank you i truly love you all like brothers and i can't wait to meet my way into 2021 together i've made memories that i will never forget playing this game and the initial release of warzone has allowed me to grow my channel beyond my wildest dreams and you've all been with me supporting the content every single step of the way and i appreciate you all so much liking commenting sharing the videos and subscribing in your thousands it's a lot to get my head around and i never really expected to be where i am now especially since i started out 2020 with around 50 000 subscribers which i accumulated over a four year period and i was posting all sorts of fps games back then and now here we are at just over 260 000 subscribers and quickly approaching 300 000 it's just incredible and without sounding facetious i wanted to give a genuine thank you to all of you for not only helping me get through this year mentally but also making it my best year on youtube anyway i'm going to leave you with a match that i had late last night playing with my good friends acula and stoneman 64 as we brought in the new year together but with that said thank you again for all of your support during 2020 i hope you'll still be with me in 2021 and i wish you and your families nothing but the best in the new year stay
