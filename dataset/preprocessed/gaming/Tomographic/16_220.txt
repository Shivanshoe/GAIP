hey guys it's Tom here and welcome back to another warzone video so in this one we're gonna be checking out my tiger King inspired loadout and you might be like what the hell Tommy you're running out of ideas and my answer to that question would be yes yes I am so there have been these fire claw bundles in the store recently and I already own the one for the karna a but the most recent one fire claw 3 included a skin for the org and I mean look at the cover art for that bundle if that isn't tiger king inspired I don't know what is I mean that is clearly Joe exotic definitely looks more like Joe exotic than Nicolas Cage does that's for sure but yeah we're gonna check out this loadout today as you guys know I love the org and the carne is a great sniper rifle for aggressive gameplay so that's exactly what you're going to see in today's video I'm playing trios with study and Westie and there are some really chaotic moments in this one so I really hope you enjoy it if you do make sure
