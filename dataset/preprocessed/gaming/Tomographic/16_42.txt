oh this guy here he's at the fence are you on the other side of the wall no no i'm on our side of the wall okay okay i saw him he's coming in blast him all done just got your first kill i melted him too yeah you shredded him now your rig should be able to fit okay perfect drop the armor drop your armor nice take his now open your current your rig in your backpack and make sure you got ammo for your your gun by dragging yep yes tom it's coming back to me it's coming back to me well done brother just need the guidance you know i know it's a lot this game is a lot you are my sherpa how about this how about this song how about what how about that do you think about that hey there's a spine up here it's your life where i'm hearing more steps nearby okay spawn on the left how about some of this some how about some of this wait watch do you think about something i'm just gonna get a head shotted right now i feel it you think about this do you think about that did you think about that conor listen we've got good guns we need to take this seriously otherwise colin is never going to play against did you think about that let's go did you think about it unbelievable take them out jack you get the one on the left go on the right oh yeah you think about this i'm pumped we've got to take it serious now because if you die okay okay serious serious i killed one oh he's dead well done where's the other one coming i'll just corner peek him like this watch well we thought about that clearly behind him yep oh my gosh here's someone on the left there's a container here oh it's a scab he's right here he's in corner got him lean in your headshot yeah just two tapped him it's just a scarf oh my god scared me sounded like he was being shot then i put a bag in a bag and then put that bag in my bag a bag within a bag with thomas exception well they're going to start hearing us now jack within this range if they are in dorms okay so what's so special about dorms it's like the pvp area there's a really high tier loot and you usually get keys that open the doors to search for that high tier loot and also there's tasks so people come here a lot for those just a busy area then you see me yeah we say hey down for a party everyone knows now that we're here [Music] that's been looted so is there usually someone in here usually often depending on where you spawn uh there's a main door on your right and then somebody can jump in the window at the end of the hall this is horrible yeah someone's outside are they you sure yep yeah i hear that is it creeping around mm-hmm someone's definitely outside killed him well done good job something i believe didn't know i'm running down the ball uh just outside the window jack you only heard one set of footsteps right here with a shotgun so i need to met up okay lock down my left arm hello tom hello my friend i'm just healing my arm it is gone please look look right there behind you ah my eyes i'm oh hello have been cleansed okay i stole the rubles could still potentially be a guy upstairs though so be careful you go clear it oh oh oh oh oh oh let's go i was i was looting and he came down the stairs just blasted me in the ass i'm an angle how did you guys get around there sorry do i have to go out go out front yeah go the way you can go right do you think anyone has ever escaped from tarkov i have a few times yeah you have what do you mean you escaped for 10 seconds never i've not died once as a pmc have you died at all no i haven't died at all times yeah but neither have you come yeah i mean either around here there was tom either yeah that's crazy if you try you'll run overland mines oh oh i missed landmines oh god oh that doesn't sound good tom i just watched that are you dead yeah he's dead really dude nothing's all the way down that doesn't look like a fatal fall though oh course if stone was here now whatever at the end of it demographic i believe at any given time there can only be 12 people on the map so if there's already scavs in that means that there's less players like actual players yeah no don't look at me just so we know what each other looks like like connor's very's got an acolyte band dude that's apraxia yeah yeah wanna give you a thumbnail jack no no it's all right i'm just waiting for you to because you're the leader connors i mean what are you guys what do you think exactly do you want to you're the elite task force member who can kill everyone with the drop of a bullet for the two humbling idiots who inevitably will die well we need to eliminate scavs me and jack the way yeah if you want to if you guys want to focus on tasks we can but you don't accept no that's me that's me holy jesus home wait you passed us are you taking the pissed off was that accident or what did i hit you connor yes you hit me serious weren't you yeah i kind of was i thought connor was behind us i reckon just kicking him from the team i literally moved i really thought connor was behind us jack tom's already killed one so there's a there's a secret stash right here someone wants to grab that well you told me jack told me a lead i know he said to lead but like you must have gone down the left side or something i don't know you go so far i walked right in front of you i literally ran i was uh a secret stash it's an f cond it looks like a dustbin lid oh yeah but that's where you get some link from is there anything in it yeah i took of an f con from it what's that there you go you can have it it's on the phone no i don't want it oh you've got it now absolutely trash that that's worth a lot actually okay conditioner what'd you say yeah that's where the light is you could keep it i would like it back please give me my f on no people do that all the time at the beginning this thing looks like crap it's weighing me down it looked trash does it look like an empty can that's worth like one 70k on the floor oh my god that's more than my golden horse i found okay i'm going to try to keep you guys away from the hot zones the potential hot zones you know i remember i was like let's loot up for a bit of spawns over there isn't that i'll try to get you guys some loot a little bit first wee oh you can jump tom yeah but you've got to be careful because you take full damage from very short heights in this game not from like here though yeah but if you if you if you're too high up the hill and there's a dip in the hill below you you might break your egg break your eggs search this break my egg what the [ __ ] am i doing here we got here i've got a bad feeling about this probably i should not have taught you guys that never mind you still got work to do you need to be worried about bear better you need to be worried about bears yeah that's bear that's the uh other we're the pmcs right yeah so uh useek is a type of pmc there's two factions there's bears and npms or usex yeah right which are both pmcs player players um there's a barrel right here to your left in that tire it's gonna say yeah i saw that part of tires i was like hang on a minute and go on a second we should go we could go into an offline raid with you guys we're advanced players we don't need offline you don't see me like that guy out when we first started uh yeah that guy was experienced too like you got ruined yeah good gear on yeah i'm over here with me be careful right here because there's barbed wire yeah wedge you're waiting for all this okay careful you're about to walk into it you just be careful there's some barbed wire there why are you standing there like this before you actually walked into it twice connor's already gone he's just run away from us not once twice no no no we got players down here oh no okay yeah yeah what are they gonna kill us just at the wall or the outside shoot i see him i see him yeah shoot them the outside wall yeah yeah they're further down the road where we came just in front of the barbed wire i mean they could easily kill us right no no one has an sv98 are these scops or pmcs he's in between the walls there i feel so useless with my iron sight and pea oh there's one in the crate in there in the container yeah there's three of them yeah the popular thing i missed my grenade you got grenades one's peeking left side of the door i'm gonna go outer wall here and try to get a different thing together because me and tom will then end up just killing you or each other i think you might have killed one tom yeah i think i'm pretty sure i headshotted one i just couldn't call it i think i'm good is he on my left right it's gone away now are you at the container yeah okay okay this is us there's a lot of blood around here but i don't think i killed him okay so this is the new area of customs almost yeah there was a big wall before
