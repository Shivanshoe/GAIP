let's be vlogging us in this problem see for up you guys coming to me yeah yep we're coming together making a pika me from blue probably from blue guys copy I'm sending it the clown car got fuel I'm jumping off I can hit oh my god Danny the c-4 is OST yeah I did it just oh hey guys it's Tom here and welcome back to more war zone so I don't want to waste too much time before getting into today's gameplay I'm gonna show you my ramp 7 build right now we've got the monolithic suppressor FSS Ranger barrel commando foregrip 50 round mags and stipple griptape now I'm sure most of you will agree there seems to be like maybe three or four main attachments in warzone that just work well for any assault rifle or SMG and in this case we're talking about the monolithic suppressor which adds sound suppression and damage range FSS Ranger barrel which is usually the longer barrel of your options it gives you damage range bullet velocity and increased recoil control which is integral to maximizing your weapons performance in warzone the commander for grip which I mean out of the list it's definitely one of the best for grips for overall weapon handling and it doesn't offer many cons which is great and we've got the 50 round mags which is actually the only magazine upgrade you get for the round 7 but this is definitely a necessity for playing and warzone and taking on as many targets as possible finally we've got the stipple grip and I'd probably say this is the attachment I'd swap out if you wanted to use an optic personally though I find the ADF speed for the RAM 7 way too slow for my liking so I've forced myself to use the iron sights and I'm kind of used to it now it works pretty well and I actually run a HDR as my secondary so any ranged engagements that I get myself into I'm using this over the RAM 7 which works well because the RAM 7 seems to dominate at close to medium range anything past that it can be really hard to manage the recoil control so I definitely recommend this build easily the best I've come across for the RAM 7 so far and let's face it sooner rather than later I think we're going to see some major tweaks made to the growl to bring it more in line with the rest of the assault rifles so this is maybe going to be a great alternative when we see any changes made to the matter in the future so that's it for this breakdown now let's get into the gameplay

good route des Rams good but I'm finding like certain ranges it's really hard to track people I mean III let me just fine it's like an m4 ready it feels exactly I can import but I just can't do as I don't force myself to use their own for it just doesn't quite reach as far as an m4 which actually makes it really good at close to mid-range it just tells people to shreds close cause it does it destroys insane damage [Music] you
