battle royale battle royale just in case you didn't know every single time i've made this announcement fast get to the site it's gonna have to be a melee game okay let's get silly yeah yeah yeah what's really gonna happen is you're gonna get there last and someone's gonna chop you up as you get there tom please oh my trajectory is looking all right yes go on the bad man the bad man he's gonna he's gonna kill you one's inside it's gonna kill you got it hey he's coming back you chunked him did you stop no no wow come on is there a man there thomas hey he just vaulted he vaulted up into the propellers whilst he tried to jump over a wall tom i don't think you're taking this seriously what do you mean it's almost like there's a infuriating meta in the game though no no no no no no no i haven't let it get to me jack after two weeks of this [ __ ] king valley i'm not having more fun flying around in halley just crushing people what do you mean we're going um dmr i'm committed okay yeah i'm gonna stick with my ak74u and hate my life okay and the lw3 that takes me six years to ideas with whilst they've already killed me listen if it's another bad game i'll switch and go dm or mac 10. the worst thing is jack that the moment you do that then you have a really crashy game and it's perfect for the other loadout yep they're not on the roof of the big building maybe well they're all down below someone is someone's right next to us okay [Music] found him his teammates here two teammate two down the booty killer well i decimated them but wow oh yeah i killed another guy i don't know if he was part of the same thing you can deliver your money yeah closer towards the rest nice jesus christ i think there's i think there's more than one there's definitely more than one team around here so i'm just gonna drop the money here and comment back i don't want to be here alive my roof looks clear i'm going to check bank roof looking everywhere what's that oh the load out here i'm blue i'm blowing blue hey i'm on the other dude i'm a hit should be an easy there we go boys um shots here on tv is someone a bed here oh no it's beamed then they're plates gone pronoun this stuff's done finished this is teammate all behind on blue and blue well then oh god he's right there in blue come on there i'm blue he was in the book yeah he ran out he ran towards us a little bit come on if you could join us yeah then again you don't have to find the dmr the dmr finds you jack immediately resorted to watching tick tocks there's a video of mitt romney that was so quick jack and let's go there yeah aggies we should go go slide out as well and you're back in the game oh you i just bought him and we got a jailbreak a millisecond later what is that dude they just don't want us to play they just stop playing i hate my life actually jack can use the uh money he has to get himself can you just hit the floor so the jailbreak just pretty yeah yeah yeah i'll be great i'm gonna try and get my load out of the box someone just dropped on the box yeah i saw it on the box uh he's fighting he's gonna have a dmr and a dear mercy what's up i don't want nothing anymore being shot in the back being shot in the back from the bank i can't move log i don't think anyway i'm probably gonna get beamed he's getting shot out by someone on the bank someone's contesting him oh no they're on top of apartment building i might cluster it i'm going to cluster it target foster departments i'm just running back hoping for the best that dmr what was it don't know but down you yeah and how did he get it who the guy the guy down me from hit from here but i don't know where he got his loadout it could have shot us way earlier i mean it got down and finished i think i don't like this position it's getting zoned cut them out when they get there perfect the game's just giving us stuff as soon as we buy it would you like to buy jack frags yes jailbroken it does enable lesser skilled players to get kills i'm a hit i'm a hit broke sound oh his toe that's the team from he's a clown tom's having a great game that is yeah i don't know what i've used most there's been an even balance of the ace ak-74u and the lw3 but i have to be ads first with the lw3 because it's just like i can't do the ads time oh here we go there shooting oh my god you might have heard that in my hand sir what did he say uh he just screamed off of his lungs i don't know if we want to take our hell though because we're still gonna have people on our back coming in from airport yeah we can try and contest fire station i mean the the guys in the truck are on fire station down there um that's where the truck that's the fire truck guys uh yeah they seemed quite adequate as well they're fighting or no they are definitely fighting they're fighting in size not on the roof not in the what if we wide stretch right get on the hill behind them i don't know whether we'll be able to do that safely being shot in the back right behind me good stuff what are you doing i think that dude was just looking for a free kill yeah it stopped fighting in the fire station now we need to be really careful of west i'm gonna get this okay i don't know about the same knife or man time to count sorry even at long range just even then that was what that was pretty short range though mm-hmm guy here yeah long range you want to make the most of that nice great head shot we won to the right to the right to the right coming over now on the right just done blue mark going for the res yeah yeah yeah did he make it make it past red okay yeah let's get in the buildings or at least near the buildings yeah i can't see him because the trees i can run into the tree right here they're on the road according to this they're like right next to us in the road right here oh closer right next to us look in the building there's still one up on the hill that ghost dude he's in this in that shack oh yeah it's 100 uh we need to move though i said we were about the way we came and go around we can hold us no we we can cross to the building that's across the road and because there's still a dash that's what i'm doing they have to cross [Music] perfect headshot we have to move the zone's moving we might want to get a shack or something yeah i'm trying to parachute championship perspective hit that guy on the red marker what was that where was that yeah they got sniper on there sniper on the roof oh god oh god one down left foot last guy that card right hard right of course good stuff oh is there a buy can i get you guys one no ah that's it now mate good luck down two on top of fire uh never got confirmations one guy was left be careful jack yeah i'm going to be rude yeah roof of fire station i don't think i got credit for the kills we're gonna have to go far left maybe to avoid anything you can take the atv but i honestly don't know what else to do i'm just going to get down no go yeah go on those left side yeah just hitting those uh the hills there you go take the fight now he's dashing to the guy that you originally were shooting at ran away from the building towards the it's the one on the rocks
