hey what's up everyone and welcome back to another warzone video sorry if my voice sounds a bit weird by the way it's allergy season in the uk so i feel like my voice sounds a bit more nasally than usual but season four for war zone drops tomorrow july 17th and i'm hoping there'll be enough content there to hold us over for a couple of weeks you know the new weapons and limited time mode should be quite fun but based on what we've seen on the whole for what's coming in season four i'm not all that impressed like there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of content and today i thought it makes it up a bit so i'm taking the m13 and get this the ax-50 sniper rifle i don't see anybody using this sniper rifle anymore i totally understand why i mean it just massively underperforms in comparison to the cold war snipers for example but i mean at least it looks good but yeah i'm not going to waste too much time today one last reminder if you wanted to get your very own thomas sloth plushie now is your last chance to do so the campaign will be ending in just two days so we're really hoping to raise some money for the sloth conservation foundation so your support would be awesome you can find the link in the description below but with that being said though thank you all so much for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one i'm going to die immediately i always get

juggernaut has anybody stuck with a ladder yeah i think going for it he's gonna get stuck by that ladder yeah and it's in okay go for it one on roof i think i'll be okay but i don't think we should all be on the roof yeah i like this i like this oh wait they fixed it didn't they need to be split angles while he's looking at one of us the others need to be beaming heads or i just die oh no stein how's the third round outside of the building no i can't get up there this is horrible you can't you might have to go farther into the stands there i'll have to leave the truck jump from the hedge onto the red roof now i can get up there fine but you can't do the old vault there's no like satellite dish to jump on top of i'm surprised they didn't run into each other there yeah i know right i'm just gonna wait it out you download corner no i'm going to i want to try and use the ammo box to take out the jug if you need to could do the play happens you've got to play really passive one torture truck yep one's in this door for sure moving position connor okay he crossed over to the by come on get ahead of gas see how do you get up there now maybe jump on the ledge ahead of you no uh window the window ledge right ahead of you tom yeah i tried that it gives you no vote from them i think you just do it from here oh [Music] that was the random third so you got the jug and and it's the last 2v1 that's the jug throw all of your equipment on double sem text stucco yes i was a horrible person with that truck that's all right no you did good plays in the truck that was great yeah we we totally cleared out that eastern side of the zone controlled it let us rotate in disgusting a little air vent tom oh yeah little air conditioning thing on the side that's where you have to come up from dude though it's crazy it pushes you up slightly because you can't stand on it because they've added a ladder on the inside of our building now so yeah i think that's how that dude got up on the roof and snuck up there geez boys [Music] um you
