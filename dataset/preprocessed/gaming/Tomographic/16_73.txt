[Music] okay hello guys and welcome to my first youtube stream my first youtube live stream and my first live stream in i think it's about three months now so uh i've got the jitters i'm not gonna lie this is like this feels so alien to me it's been so long and i'm on an entirely new platform now as well i haven't got the big fat paycheck like some of the big streamers are coming over to youtube but uh i want to try some new things and streaming on youtube gives me the option to i don't know make more quality live streams i suppose so it's good to see you all in the chat welcome everyone who's just getting in uh today we're playing a new game called death loop now this is by a studio that created uh i think the name of the game now uh [Music] arcane i believe is the name of the studio dishonored that's the one i'm trying to think of so that they're the designers of dishonored and the gameplay is quite similar i have played a little bit of this not enough to really progress in the story uh but we're just gonna get right into it uh thanks tuning in everyone we'll see how this goes let me know if there's any trouble with the stream if the quality looks good all that stuff i haven't been able to do any sort of tests for this yet so uh here it goes thanks for tuning everyone and uh membership's now live as well i've reactivated those for anyone that's to become a member all the support is appreciated for the last time why can't you remember don't know if you just give me a second oh you're not even trying lady i have no idea oh [ __ ] you just hurry up already [Music] oh i got to snap drinking okay how the [ __ ] did i get here i like the voice actors in this game i played about 10 minutes of it and they were really they were really into it um yeah so welcome everyone tuning in hope you're doing well this is a game called death loop where you re you relive the same day over and over again learning more and more about it as the game continues um so that's all of the information i'm gonna give you and we're gonna unwrap this puzzle together and uh yeah we'll see how it goes so i can sprint and i can dodge with shift as well i'm playing on pc the game is available on playstation 5 as well and it comes out tomorrow september 14th oh you gotta be kidding me nope that's there i'm seeing it ah man this isn't a sponsored stream by the way i was given a code early though to play the game who are you who who am i my name my name son of a [ __ ] what the [ __ ] my name hopefully the stream quality looks quite good i mean if there's any issues uh but yeah i'm excited to get into this it's one of those games i was looking forward to for 2021 um this is like a training area hey babe you miss me i don't even know who you are why do i know this oh oh okay yeah i don't know if youtube auto generates subtitles i'm not sure about that one okay so is there anything in particular i'm supposed to be shooting i don't think so all right uh great of course you were hey sorry thank you for the is that a membership or is that 4.99 you've donated i think so this place is mine thank you man i appreciate the support and hanky new member okay that's a member i see i gotta figure all of this stuff out this youtube dashboard is so alien to me shiny makes me feel funny right okay there's a lot of uh settings you can change for this game which is quite nice um i've got the fov pretty much cranked on this game it will be coming to xbox i believe black reef uh but it's a low season limited console release at the moment i made this i think playstation 5 and pc what is this thing oh you know the code i don't know any damn code yo hello what you already know the code this one right here you know the code i think i know the code guys what's the code gonna be guess i forgot the code after all guess it wasn't leaked maybe i should go look for this code colt hey is my name colt that's gotta be it right kick i don't think this is a permanent move to youtube so the plan is i'll still do some chill streams on twitch every now and then um i'm supposed to go through that but uh streaming on youtube will allow me to sort of make the uh do some more quality streams and uh [Music] i think the options are a lot better for you guys [ __ ] that's her i've completely disabled ads on my live stream so you won't get interrupted which is something you just don't have the option to do on switch you get four stars all the time i'll try to stop you all right yeah that doesn't sound good okay i think he is nice i hope i didn't get any splash back there oh they just disappeared that felt too easy i've done this before haven't i yes apparently i have the nice looking sunset [ __ ] we'll be back tomorrow okay stay low can i vault these yes i can some enemies prepare for possible high alert and big [ __ ] i shouldn't have used all of my ammo in that training ground okay here we go that's what i need what i'm just a biologist there's no point glass bottle in someone's face get their attention nothing there's always tomorrow that's it that's it now you're just gonna go make coffee i like coffee [ __ ] oh what about my kyle drunk idiot who tried to pee on me come over here okay so they spot me like that yeah you take him away this is perfect stealth run engaged oh hello mates oh they've all seen me now okay look i don't know what i did last night exactly but if you could just uh what what uh i think we know each other we know each other don't we [Laughter] finally you're back so how much do you remember about me well it's a little hazy what do you remember my name's colt about me you want to kill me for some reason and i already know some [ __ ] code which i don't and this is you wanna break the to piss you off i'm sorry uh still there you never said that before we dated didn't just go inside the library you need to see this okay let me uh let me turn subtitles on for you guys what will that be gameplay visuals there we go do main dialogue uh end of radio thanks for the five pounds man i appreciate you that's the support i don't know if there's anything else i can really loot around here at the moment what's this [Music] is that a gumball another gumball another gumball [Music] endless gumballs what are you doing okay sorry yeah no no no i'm not a very productive the visionaries oh you always fall for the same old [ __ ] just once please can you try try your hardest to make this interesting what the [ __ ] is this you're gonna give me that attitude you know i usually make it easy for you you ungrateful prick but this time i'll let you see yourself out [Music] yep we dated why are you doing this what did i do to you you don't remember how about that code you remember that yet i don't know the code ah what is that thing it looks like the uh one of thanos's ships and avengers i mean jump all right it's just uh some shutters get back up all right i guess we're jumping okay probably helps everyone break the glass first [Music] i was saved from the full damage you listen to me you wrote it on black brief you already know the code what the [ __ ] does that mean hello are you dead yet the postcard dumbass you wrote it on the black brief postcard you understand okay i'm gonna drop you now wait no wait the [ __ ] no holy that's two me's and i just died to fall damage you don't see that very often stone would be proud ah just drop myself what kind of [ __ ] up world is this okay postcard postcard get the postcard get off the speech it's a nice looking beach to be fair i swim okay now let's let's not die uh speed icon thank you so much for the 10 euros it's weird seeing all these different currencies usually i'm just used to getting the one donation type thank you so much for the support though man i just discovered you yesterday you're awesome subbed thank you so much uh okay so about where we started i guess that's our first loop completely to do that again the game encourages you to listen to things like radio broadcasts and conversations between the ai so it can help you understand what the hell is going on so i like the text textures everywhere as well it's an interesting mechanic uh you wrote it on black reef on the postcard yeah i threw it away in the first run this thing you gotta be kidding me uh all right three two six three so it wasn't leaked break some loops loop it's absolutely impossible you want me to break it you don't want me to break it what do you want from me i want you to not suck okay it's been a pretty shitty morning or two so i'm done with you and all of this it ends today good morning juliana blake with an urgent announcement i have just [Music] okay so everyone's out to kill me that's great let's go what the [ __ ] it's a shiny pokemon card that splits in half and it's alive yeah that's fine okay ah it's cold and weird there's an auto fill button oh for the code i didn't see that i'll make sure to remember if i need to re-enter that uh reprise this mysterious piece of metal seems to belong to you a slab it grants you the reprisability which will return you to life after you die but only twice dying a third time will end your current loop you'll wake up in the morning of the subsequent loop bereft of equipment collected during the loop before okay so there's some like looting element to this game but you can lose your loot if you die all of those times interesting all right like a raid in that regard then the number of times you can return with reprise resets when traveling between districts okay here goes [Music] all right second loop oh what's this you've got a gun a fistful of grenades and an address in some place called up damn now go get yourself some answers okay so i've survived the loop so i come back to the it's the loot i acquired okay welcome to death loop you're a few tips here are a few tips to get you started is what i need uh leads track the information you have found that will further colt's goal of breaking the loop and escaping black reef check out the leads you've uncovered move the cursor and press enter select this yeah it currently is called the longest day you'll you'll use it and other leads like it throughout death loop to provide guidance and track progress my mail goes to an address in up down i'm allowed to open my own own mail even if i don't know who i am right yeah that's fine mate wait that's illegal uh it's dangerous out there you want to make sure you're carrying the best weapons and items and customizing the loadout teams we do love loadouts use your cursor to select this to inspect your gear before venturing back into black reef these slots are slabs strange objects that provide potent and unusual abilities current currently you have reprise colt's personal slab which gives him a second and third chance after dying we like respawns kill visionaries and swipe their slabs equip and upgrade them here all right so visionaries are i believe just the the ai that we find around or i think we have eight targets in total the aim of the game is to kill all eight targets in a single loop but i think it's a bit linear in a way it's not like you're not replaying the same like stuff every time there is a story to it um so we'll figure that out as we go along uh trinkets are small devices that can provide you with big boosts some add entirely new aspects to your basic abilities you've already found a trinket use your ghost to equip it spring healed double jump in midair a classic maneuver that is pretty classic once you've collected more weapons you can choose among here many trinkets we can customize this shock absorber slightly reduced recoil come on i'm a pc gamer just pull the other way mate pull the opposite direction your arms are kitted out and you're ready to break some lubes hopefully select and hold this to continue to up down let's go let's go why stream on youtube today that's a new thing prime i'm trying new things um i mean i just want to stream where my audience is really i'll still do some chill streams on twitch every now and then and again but um dorsey square second floor dorsey square second floor dorsey square with any play-throughs and stuff like that i feel like this makes sense sounds like you're angling for an invite so you can show yeah i like it too okay so apparently i died here before i just said watch yourself out there if at first you don't succeed die and die again i think that's the uh the motto of the game black reefs all yours use it a trash your decoy use this that's what i'm saying firecracker okay i like the time to kill if that's what it's like when you shoot people now infinite amounts of health like some of these games do oh hi i didn't get a chance to read that but we're heading up anyway library it's not a safe place yeah there is okay listen bye guys only so many hours before the festivities tonight so get outside and have some fun today dorsey square that doesn't look practice makes perfect that's the one i can hack these don't get caught out by any sensors do we dorsi square is this way show you eternity my flat is up there uh blank thanks for the uh thanks for coming a member man hope you're doing well good to see you again this is your this is your play thing oh mate oh well it's don't cost a thing what's he square second floor i can't get in there can i [ __ ] maybe there's another way in i want to sneak out behind this one who's sat in a chair named after a sword okay how do i get up here vault less yep [Music] ah you heard nothing oh my god i like this thing i really like this thing [Music] like an old man on his porch i think i've done that all right terminal minicom you need to my sensitivity down a little bit wow pretty ai is pretty stupid yeah to mess with me i mean come on come on now hey georgie thank you for coming to member appreciate you welcome back uh okay so new messages good morning everyone colts decided to break the loop why would he do an ass backwards thing like that an unintended effect of the anomaly on his cognition the why doesn't matter he's a danger to us all so be smart or at least try alexis screw you juliana who made you head of security hahaha cried out alexis where's the other half of your brain ass crab i got plans for it the adults are speaking just protect yourselves whatever else happens we must survive shouldn't we be actively hunting him trapping him studying him oh come on man it's cold for f sake the lpp remains our salvation cult sees these words gleaming against lit black not for long okay whatever that means obnoxious i imagine this is just like a bunch of lore that i don't really need to read in depth but you can i mean you can pause and rewind on youtube streams you can do it when this is a vod as well so feel free to do that uh looking for anything pretty amazing that despite all this infrastructure the entire loop was run from that control room okay i controlled people all the time in a control room who would have thought so the loops run from a control room and this is too easy see i read the important part of the info way too easy oh no i just opened a pop-up didn't i this is clearly the scam emails you get meet hot singles every loop i mean come on i've been hacked guys all right you're finishing up down for now you'll next stop the complex you continue to export up down or head for the exit you have plenty of opportunities to return to up down later so i feel you have to explore every nook and cranny at this moment if you die before you leave this district col will restart the loop losing any weapons or drink as you collected since all right i don't plan on dying are you [ __ ] kidding me okay great everyone knows where i am okay so another it's going sick ftu's window he's gonna speed run it get away from him oh i can vote up that way good to know we'll kill him another day i feel like i have the appropriate gear right now shooting him one bullet at a time this is a sick gun though i like it candy bar i like candy they only sell gumballs there's a guy there i put this uh [Music] thing away empty hand to cancel over the control that's weird [Music] i saw this in the trailer [Music] oh my god they trip over the gumballs that's good that's good that's great what a great mechanic god that was great yeah let's blow this joint what a mechanic that is just make everyone trip up yeah i remember seeing that in the in the gameplay trailer i was watching some [Music] gameplay in this uh valerie d welcome back thanks for becoming a legend you've always been a legend in my eye thank you for becoming a member uh bahamas with a membership as well thank you very much doug a became a member and emma emematic weird because i recognize so many of your profile pictures some of you don't have the same some of you don't have the same names that you do on like discord on twitch so i'm seeing your names for a change which is weird i feel like i i know you more you know yeah it's uh it's made by the same developers as dishonored and i believe prey pray one and two arcane lion i believe is the name of the studio arcane previously developed bioshock i think this is a different branch of arcane you're gonna call me like this all the time julian dishonor is a massive hair i give approximately zero [ __ ] about that those players are gonna love this game so that's why you told everyone to kill me but i'm the only one talking to you so what does that tell you that i hang out with the wrong people all right control center shut it down so me and juliana were friends previously what the hell oh is it like a mining facility controls in another bunker watch out not this way okay hello it's like a radiating some sort of pulse go live go proud love the low road do i this dash thing's interesting just tap shift do a dash everything is below [Music] got tinnitus do you guys like that effect in games the ear ringing i'm going to call it tonight's spec i'll see if everyone's seen me correct ignition station [Music] okay full ammo oh this thing scramble sensor there we go it's mine now i am running the game at pretty much all high settings it does i'll be honest with you it does feel like it's a a port of the playstation 5 game which is i mean pretty pretty regular occurrence but there's a lot of graphic settings and stuff for me it's just some of the weird key bindings like if i hold g to put this away i have to press control to empty off hand and then because there's no like deselect option i have to select one of these i have to press escape to cancel it which is whilst i'm already holding g with my left hand i then have to press escape which is the top left of my keyboard with my right does that make sense it's just a bit too out of reach so some of the key binders just feel like there hasn't been much thought put into him attention everybody shut this place down and leave it shut i don't give the first [ __ ] about wengie's horizon obsession if colt gets in here the party's over you don't want to go back do you station stays sealed that's a note from giuliana which means i won't be open you greatly dislike the earring sound some games give you an option to turn it off protect the loop that felt good vm value is six four six five [Music] you're telling me you don't see me that's hilarious hey girl why are you wearing masks um okay gotta be a switch around here somewhere no off button oh this looks like it does something important i got a better version of that gun i have [Music] yeah it feels very boring inspired oh you gotta be kidding me so what i gotta find dishonored insert battery okay we're charging it fully charged that in there oh okay we're juiced show me what you can do he knows things not the credit he [Music] wondered how our deserves time loop functions long ago the isle of black reef experienced a cataclysmic event which tore the fabric of space and time we call this terror the anomaly i founded the eon program with imbalances of this phenomenon and thus you must protect and study us the visionaries follow uh could do some damage yeah let's go get the lpp hmm yes there's a lot of law that you can find around i guess a lot of clipboards everywhere and stuff um what was it up to christy kale thank you for coming a member man and evan heel your surnames are very similar also with the uh first-time membership thank you guys i will be figuring out some some more member rewards as well as we continue with this youtube streaming endeavor uh right now i've just got like a basic one set up but it will give you a role in my discord um if you use discord uh we can hang out in a chat together and you also get some priority if i want to do some like warzone games or whatever uh what do i do with this again hack it with that okay we need to find this lpp thing lpp what's called door animation laboratory annex all this glowing stuff is weird i think the game wants me to go back to where i was before i've got double jump now right oh i do that's cool look at that yeah mario turned off some of the pros like post processing stuff and motion blur and all that and a 1440p on a rtx 3080 let's go this way exit let's blow this joint loop complete not bad looking stream good i'm glad to hear a hanky i'm streaming at 4040p youtube allows you to up the bitrate a bit more as well so uh very happy about that oh look at this it's a nice little animation as the day progresses something we're gonna be in the sun in the air the snow now this lpp thing sounds useful it's in the aeon program security office on fristad rock there's no power station beneath the loop control center what are these symbols up down charlie runs the minicom network these little side quests i suppose i've been to these places yet uh all right explore face down rock i guess let's have a look in the trinkets that i can put on this slight reduced recoil isn't going to help with that just slap it on oh it's already on there okay oh no abilities so we will continue oh the diesel guy come on now is that really what you want to be doing there you go goodbye everyone say goodbye to the diesel guy what have you learned today oh you wanted me to answer i want to know if you figured out who you really are oh that's easy i'm a drinker occasionally sorry michael bond island everyone knows me everyone hates me handy with a gun quick with a joke i dress well and why the [ __ ] is everyone wearing a mask it's a heck of a jig i'm done playing this your way it's the cult show from now on okay all aboard [Music] [ __ ] it next stop security office choo choo just down the road oh why is everyone just like may at least turn away from the female have some respect oh she's also drunk kicks her in the butt almost paradise and it does look very pretty just going to shovely joe it's a shotgun yeah yeah that works so i'm gonna make sure my shotgun works [Music] [Music] [Music] how about a shotgun that works for you [Music] oh okay noted those things spot you quick [Music] i was a turret not a scanner oh my god is it gonna [Music] okay deactivate don't kill me wait that's me a on security office door is locked hack me that is mr okay lbp [Music] kill the captain hacker's delight uh killalicious thank you very much for the membership man welcome and margie or maggie miller thank you for the membership as well welcome guys someone has inspiration to make that smg look like yeah it does look like a scorpion doesn't it very much so i mean a lot of games have the same weapon models they just have to rename them for copyright purposes where's the safe captain my captain my coal you want your hair safe to be you're there safe and now it is what they're safe in your up down flat except miss mina told me you left the code default is that an invitation everybody knows those numbers that's four three four and seven okay four three four and seven do i need to remember that i don't know on black reef knowledge is progress you will often need to return to a location on with new information now that you've found the code to your safe for example you can head back to your flatten up down and crack that baby open okay wait a [ __ ] second i made the lpp oh the lpp is in the safe but my flat i've just been [ __ ] [Music] like getting drunk in this game huh it's gonna pop out of a briefcase [Music] oh mate i'm sorry you're just enjoying your it's enjoying your drink looking out at the ocean jesus oh yeah i like the head shots are a one shot kill let's go again i can carry it as well oh i just turned it on all right back to my flat don't fall in the ice water i mean okay made it safely let's get back open that safe there's a lot of cool abilities you can get in this game by the way i'm not just stuck to like running on my feet all the time but i haven't got to the stage where i get given those yeah also phil it's the same code yeah i think it's just gonna let me remember the code for the safe yeah let's blow this joint matt has just become a member as well thank you very much matt welcome i thought you only streamed on twitch i did this is my first stream in about three months my friend um gonna be streaming a bit more on youtube i go advancing there bouncing the timeline now to the night um but yeah i figured with some of these like let's plays i'm going to be doing and some with battlefield 2042 on the way i'm going to start throwing some youtube streams into the mix um just to you know explore some new options see what you guys guys enjoy and stream where my audience is a lot of people miss the uh the twitch streams [Music] juliana juliana you there juliana i remember lyanna what's my name whatever where is she had a party streets crawl at night okay oh they do hey guys i have top secret information okay what is it i said it was top secret grenade proximity charge best place to see the fireworks is it makes more sense what's the difference between a trip mine and a proximity charge it's gonna be spectacular i'm freezing my ass off looking for colts very [ __ ] spectacular you should take them alive and strap them it's not sticks how do i put it away off hand there we go that awkward mechanic come over here mate right here i found you started this got eyes on the crater yeah what jesus the radius was a bit further than i was expecting well god damn that was a bit risque that heals me like a damn subwoofer i think i'm good accessory we're standing right next to it what was i standing right next to well oh my mind well yeah i was hoping it would be one of those minds that like blows towards its target you know it kind of just didn't care for my life so i learned the hard way party their heads off nice bit of parkour in this game oh god these enemies weren't here for yesterday oh mate oh stone what are you doing in this game dude okay okay stone the hack this yeah it doesn't like anyone's gonna come this way it's still gonna help me though get past it security's tight here yeah i can see that what's the activator going to shoot me in the back you can lean pack this one what was a bit scuffed these turrets are in some pretty convenient places floyd oh we just or get wrecked there's another one all right let's check out this safe in my apartment i love the different weather types that was a firework show huh for this beautiful oh some nice reflections going on as well on my gun look good attention to detail that not even using rtx ray tracing i think we're clear this time around worth noting that enemies don't spawn in the same place every time though it's already gone yoink took your precious lpp i'm too smart too fast too powerful and you're just as slow and boring as ever come on i'm not even mad about it just disappointed i know you can do better or you can go for yourself whichever you'll call all right julianna so i'll just do your old thing then what was that writing hacky [ __ ] for a bunch of dick bags looks like somebody came by to say hi i'm not finished yet i locked the door so the tv can get acquainted what really and doors courtesy of the captain wait [ __ ] [ __ ] this gonna lock my turtles now i'll just have to unlock them i love the voice actors [Music] very convincing oh juliana's on the hunt okay i need to pause and explain something to you real quick there is a multiplayer aspect to this game now juliana who is the character the uh antagonist i suppose she is gonna hunt me and the ai can do that you can choose to have that as ai or you can opt for uh multiplayer hunters so this juliana that i'm about to find i suppose could be ai but it could also be a enemy player who's also in my game trying to kill me in my story uh it's a pretty interesting mechanic but you can queue into the multiplayer from the main menu and uh hunt the enemy colt who is i'm who's i'm playing right now hack the internet to unlock your tunnels all right well i don't know if there's any resources for me in here fizz pop a note who the [ __ ] is frank can i get out here nice i hear her yeah she's got some crazy abilities dude dude well she just did that i was crazy ran directly towards me on top of a roof never seen that before oh this is her ability shift you should just slide down there see back again for good measure so i find out later in the game that she's actually my daughter and this gets really weird didn't think of that the packing internet to unlock your tunnels oh my uh my dash things here nice oh yeah it's fishing power okay that charges up in the top left next to my health she got absolutely wrecked how do i there we go i'll press tab to switch to my main ability my gadget swift switch with that i suppose let's change back to that can someone on the okay they're a lower platform somewhere in here what is this some sort of telephone tech review when you think bicycles would have advanced a bit in the future but apparently not keypad this is some sort of puzzle isn't it [Music] what is this oh let's work this out chat uh oh no oh it's some sort of gas i hope the room doesn't fill with gas now i can't turn it off oh god what the hell guy doesn't have something to do with those codes right i have no idea i'll come back to that later i'm gonna spend forever working on the puzzles it's not main story but that's really cool you keep coming back to these areas so oh god sorry mate you don't want to see me i should probably use my dash thing i'll just do that oh okay the range is pretty limited oh this thing's cool though movement's great once you get some cool abilities keypad oil fill an fps drop i've noticed a little bit like the frames do drop in some of the larger areas i mean i'm running the game quite high dishonored yeah it's made by the same developers copper this is their latest title it comes out tomorrow bethesda sent me a review copy start another day okay so that was the first loop i guess okay it makes sense so that was the first loop because we've been through every weather type i suppose now we're going to do that again but i guess the story's going to be a bit different right lbp save gotta get to the safe before yeah okay i've lost all my gear that's a cool jacket isn't it that's a very cool jacket is this how i got here originally it's like some sort of it's not a fighter plane is it i don't see any guns unless maybe go go alright alarm clock for code numbers maybe that's actually a good show same day which means i already know what's going to happen yeah and i am sick of waking up on this [ __ ] beach what am i saying maybe the numbers changed for the rest of my life [ __ ] that i'm breaking this loop nope i'm good apparently guns can jam in this game as well far too close i don't know if this is one of those guns but some of the older guns can apparently start the jam which is great okay so take this again which is my double jump don't stop there put them both together the body count is gonna get out you got me and a few others but you really want to kill everyone on the island not efficient you i feel fantastic thanks for asking and if you try to ambush it again expect the same outcome yes welcome back okay it's definitely some history between these two that's for sure i like there's an autofill feature that's good way that it tells you the number sequence though if you could just autofill it anyway but okay whatever all right hit the apartment hard get the safe lpp [Music] thank you so much man huge fan of your gameplay love from india appreciate it it's very generous i know bruce can you believe it tomographic stream since when who would have thought not me i return in the morning juliana ransacked my safe during the day too bad for her i'll be waiting for he'll be waiting for me in the morning okay so i go back to up down which is the place i just was she stole my stuff she stole my stuff i don't know what the lpp is what was the title that i got lion's quite nice isn't it how's the stream been so far guys any any dips quality looking good still can everyone read these do i not have that ability anymore damn i was enjoying that i guess i need to save it somehow oh crap you weren't here before what are you doing oh my god one arm sorry about that i wish i had an electric butler do all my the chores okay well he said it can open the lines and lock doors yeah okay mobsting up there could go wrong real fast that was sick always got a test to drop down stealth kills haven't you yes you can really play however you want now they're everywhere there they are if i can get back in over here oh my god [Music] are they shouting jumps [Applause] i want to see if he does it now um oh my god yeah yeah whatever uh huh yeah whatever fair to kill you all yes he actually jumped that was crazy i guess they will have loops too right so yeah you're terrible you're actually trash i like swinging this sword [Music] dumb didn't hear your mate get stabbed over your shoulder like that right lpp show me some four three four seven that is not what i wanted yeah that's not what i was expecting this is the lpp loop preservation protocol okay the visionaries are the loop it persists only so long as they survive any threat to the visionaries is a threat to the loop if every visionary perishes in a single loop the loop will destabilize and collapse no more parties no more experiments no more eternal life okay so these are the targets i'm looking for i need to kill eight eight different visionaries to disable to destabilize the loop and collapse it which doesn't actually sound reading they're seeing as it's signed by me obviously the response behind eliminating a threat falls primarily on the head of scary and i am the head of security okay great this is how i'm going to break the loop mate all right eight people one day that's you yup oh all right so so what's the plan eight targets one day we're going to need a couple more cults in here if we're going to raise this island in a cold what no this jacket is so much cooler how did you even get in here didn't you get shot two loops ago or or was it three so difficult look there's thousands of us or more i don't know but none of us have gotten it right okay you've got to be better than all of us so don't just try to shoot everything but i like shooting you got to be smart it's the only way to fix this this and this i prefer the cold storm plant man jesus figure out residual it'll make your life easier or do it the hard way whatever hand holding is over what what are you looking at why are you son of a [ __ ] all right let's get started wendy's lab huh he'll be positioned back at the complainer the lpp may not be a gun but it contains something almost even better information specifically where each of the visionaries are the most vulnerable what's going on right now am i missing some cool like animation for that pistol i picked up other car also offered up this juicy tidbit wendy's research into a thing called residium or regime i think he pronounced it will help you break the loop that is your next lead according to the rpp wendy performs experiments at her lab at the complex all right useful for redecorating head shots with pneumatic prickles this is the animation i missed she's not playing the sound now there's only so many hours looks cool it's a nail gun all right we're hunting our first target what's this sleek personal trinket okay those are the things i put on guns i want my shift dash back i was sick stick with my parkour for now actually took a bit of damage there i didn't realize there's a health station somewhere i'll do for now i guess oh i'm good sky sensei thanks for coming i'm becoming a member man good to see you again hope you're doing well i'm intrigued to go in there i can go in there i think but we'll get there when the story brings me to it my health around here already got full ammo just those flashbang things you know what the candy store was like it was a great time kill the visionaries but you gotta kill them kill them all that's the plan atlas world noon day charlie in his club frank spicer this just look like my subconscious speaking to me what about juliana where is she everywhere but where i was let's take in it's cool though it's uh it's explained to you pretty well i think apparently me yeah [Music] okay you survived check out the power station julian doesn't want me in the power station which means there's something she doesn't want me to see apparently so got that nail gun now i can put that in my loadout the loop preservation protocol a bunch of big words to make a simple point i kill every visionary in one day i break the loop period i know where they spend time but i'm guessing it won't be as easy as hunting them down good thing i'm one stubborn [ __ ] badass by finding the lpp and establishing the locations of the visionaries you've completed the lead the longest day all right one league complete sick these aren't just for visionaries use your cursor to select this and arsenal leads find wendy's research the awesomeness help you locate and claim for yourself powerful tools that will help you break the loop these include unique weapons slabs and grant mystical powers and one very important ability i'm down the ubiquity lead will help you unlock one of the ion programs secrets infusion when you want to follow a lead be sure to track it to activate it okay understood tom black reef is divided to four periods morning noon afternoon and evening the periods don't advance while you're in a district so feel free to take your time to thoroughly explore the periods don't advance while you're in a district okay that makes sense that means that like in one instance it won't go from like morning to afternoon i have to leave the morning to come back here and then launch into the afternoon it's new now in the past you visited the complex at noon later you'll be able to return to the complex at noon or you can check out up damn or first time rock instead got so much information dr wendy's dr wenjie evans lab wengie is such a weird name sorry if anyone a chat happens to be called wengie um for example you're going to toss the place like that other call suggested you'll have to do it then so i have to do it in the afternoon okay it's not only to play it displays the current time period but also allows you to move between time periods even on black reef time moves mostly forward from morning to noon to afternoon to evening morning comes again after night but due to the loop it's always the morning before it's new now so select your cursor and hold enter to wait until the afternoon gotcha all right it's starting to make sense they do dump a lot of info on you but i think they're just trying to get out of the way wendy's lab is available at the complex which is here explore the complex probably should customize my loadout shouldn't i oh well you're a bit late walrus but the beauty of the stream is that you can rewind it on youtube whilst it's live or uh it'll be up as a vod after i'm done that was a lot of info wasn't it it's very intriguing though it's a great premise for a game i've never played anything like it this is one of my favorite parts of the dishonored i suppose but i mean what do i have time is done really well i'm always succeeding even when i'm not how do i keep my weapons again uh the infusion process isn't that why you came up here not gonna lie me told me to you're not the only one with other knees you know you're not special yeah but if i succeed yeah if good luck this infusion keeps sounding better and better yeah i want to keep some stuff if i infuse something i can keep it across loops yeah i want to try that nail gun this thing it doesn't make much noise oh my god it's trash charge it maybe ah that's why that's why key to everything who spotted me oh you seen the body correct okay they're all getting sniped now this is sick i'm here bro all right all my stuff okay i understand the nail gun though you have to charge it before you fire you go what are these things though just antennas sneak up and stab him don't need to go that way i was there before when i uh looked at that projector thing just another dead scientist okay let's get some more ammo i already got full ammo safety for a moment oh no can you pay attention to the ballistic torah okay it's not gonna shoot down is it good i don't really wanna get spotted right now the neck snaps are brutal when you don't use your uh machete all right so she's in here oh hey mate no time for a swim is a gross misuse of crucial research so we're in agreement why do you ask just one clarification sounds awful no no no no no scramble that oh gosh she's coming up that's wenji key to the queendom now you don't see me mate you forget to walk upstairs what the [ __ ] where's that what what two ngs don't need it i don't have double jump anymore do i i think i do death trap my new fluctuations in transit create microsoft deficiencies that become emergency [Music] almost to yikes i need the health oh i died okay that's a really cool respawn mechanic but they're still on to me right death trap what do you have i can't use any of this until i'm good just take more correct god damn oh no [ __ ] you quick [Music] what is going on right now how many times we need to kill this girl five to go [Music] they're locked what was that who knocked it doesn't look like it has power sound like morgan freeman then her own best rat so she is cloning herself carry this uh hang on a minute my chat's not showing up come on youtube what you doing refresh how do you have it already i got given an early code uh frosty game comes out tomorrow though okay i could see your lovely faces again or at least your names uh what was it saying here um harvester is ready the infuser is ready i'm ready help yourself should be a blast each visionary contains a significant significant residual reservoirs but the harvesting process is almost certainly lethal killing visionaries risks loop instability it's a tester and breach experiment experiment semi-successful killing every version of myself would produce requisite residium for infusion but then i'd be dead unacceptable can't slot the harvester into the infuser as a corpse or benefit from infusion need someone else yeah and i can use this thing to collect [Music] that makes sense yeah what i can't shoot those which is nice oh [Music] stop supporting me good no no no jesus there's three more of her up there as well don't get greedy cold this game is crazy it's less input code do not have a code [Music] security haven't been able to monitor chat too much i like the drop downs that's really cool what do you have i've seen that one a few times oh my gosh she doesn't want to die this one this way oh my god tomorrow wendy please that's obviously the last wengie i need to take her by surprise get rekt i can't die any more times now we've done it sent to arsenal it's like a wingman here look it's a lot of hand okay [Music] how does one mod on youtube would you like to be a mod valerie no no no i cannot die i need that to go blue i feel like a wingman there we go good gets better and harder every loop yeah i'm trying to catch up georgie it's very fast oh i see yeah yeah yeah classic porn bots all right give me a sec can it just let me do it from here add moderator hanky as well and georgie all people i know there you go thanks guys i need you to be in the chat before i can mod but yeah i know the i know they i know the accounts you speak of i don't get healthier now that i've got myself in here this way we need to disable this thing so all right let's figure this [ __ ] out i got in there no don't plug that in there final wengie oh right i need to sucker of course come and wengie that's not how you do it science it's like vacuuming okay she's been sucked don't worry guys okay you're on my side still right good action is coming i don't want that to be action i've got one life left she killed me twice all right now just get in this tube shower thing and press the button [ __ ] how the [ __ ] am i supposed to do that stand on shoot the button yeah that works jaclyn that was a painful scream i died all right sick so that's progress i guess that's a small price to play to hold on to your gear lovely lovely well it is called death loop [Music] yeah you tuned in at the perfect time you like the stream for me jack thank you that's really important for the algorithm really important for the algorithm that one chat thank you uh georgie valerie and uh hanky get modded [Music] all right new day oh what the [ __ ] i've got scorpion now though worked good enough that last time oh yeah it [ __ ] it actually actually worked who's the superstar yeah [Applause] together forever but what should i call you mr gun feels a bit uh formal gunter gonna slav maybe the machine what do we call our gunshot he seems very indecisive it's called the limp 10. let's see how sick i can be everybody i'm not sick just not sick enough onwards whatever it is we can do that now all this glowing stuff let's go that'll help me keep my gear i guess got double jump back i think i missed that the last time let me grab the hakama jig repeat all the stuff we've done hell yeah what a great stream wow high praise from jackfrags oh thanks for coming a member jack it just says at the bottom of my screen welcome to legend that's weird isn't it just sounds odd uh i need to bring up my where is it viewer activity it's a reset a second ago when i modded everyone for some reason it refreshed all right so we did get just go through the store i guess we've got the code now so autofill miracle i'll go back to colt jewish flat now that has a ring to it yeah code two code square why the [ __ ] am i naming this warwick gaming channel also has welcome to legend status you slipped away into the tunnels all right a new loop begins i think yeah it's been a while francisco appreciate you know ma'am okay this is where i customize my loadout makes sense dr wenji evans was no match for you you're off to a strong start all right that's our first target down with the power infusion your command you don't need wengie's tools collect residue by hand and a fuse your items when you have enough residue to do so harvest revision from shimmering visitor objects across black reef and from slain visionaries when you're a prize which is respawn what we did before uh you dropped your residue when you died if you find your remnants you can recover the residue from them all right if you're closer to the loadout infuse gear cop finds a new visitor objects on the bench so you begin each loop with some residue not enough though to infuse your gun luckily you can fix that many items contain residue and you can sacrifice them to harvest it use your curse to select weapons and trinkets yeah i don't need that who needs to control recall on pc sacrifice hold the lead sacrifice item there we go my limp has been sacrificed you've got enough residue to infuse the lymph 10 so let's select the weapons where do i select that this uh move your cursor over the limb and hold enter select it from fusion and there we go we keep the limp in our next run with the power of fusion your hands you can begin building an armory of weapons trinkets and slabs that withstand the ravages of the repeating lube slabs in particular provide potent supernatural abilities such as teleportation or incredible strength wendy didn't have a slab but most of the other visionaries do kill visionaries yeah whatever get it let's go uh wondering what to do next check out the clues you've uncovered among the mongol leads if you want more slabs consider going after charlie montague whose shift lets you teleport or harriet morse whose nexus links enemies together what happens to one happens to all as you explore black reef you will find numerous secrets codes clues and other bits of info about the different districts and time periods these discoveries are collected here many discoveries can be tracked like leads finding and making use of discoveries is key there's so much information it's thrown at me right now remember each district offers different opportunities and threats depending on the time of day and actions in earlier periods can affect later periods in empty square a morning may become a crowded concert in the afternoon that's cool assuming no major event disrupts the festivities like me throwing a grenade into the mix be true but try carefully other players can invade your game as juliana interfering with your mission to break the loop that's what i was explaining earlier so juliana who we saw hunt me before as she got absolutely wrecked um she can be controlled as a player so there is a multiplayer aspect to the game i suppose once you complete the main story you can uh do that or do it as you're progressing through the story i think you unlock rewards by playing as her for colt which sounds strange but i can get like new outfits and stuff uh with this you can control whether or not other players are allowed in your game okay i'll we'll we'll do it we'll have some pvp engagements i guess see what that's like um okay what's the main part of the story now then up damn frank sends up fireworks every evening there's an old power station beneath the loop control center 40 rupees from ben sonny isaac thank you man appreciate the support is this a roguelike game rogue a roguelike game in the game rogue i'm trying to think there's a game that came out recently called broke right oh my am i completely wrong uh alexis invited wendy to his party well wendy's dead i don't know what the main mission is here because it's not i guess we just do anything we've got a track one though let's do i can't track from here it's fine okay this helps here we go we can see the leads when we click on a specific district julia doesn't want me in the power station which means there's something she doesn't want me to see so let's go to the power station explore complex they just dumped so much information on me like i'm gonna remember it but i mean you know i mean you know at least they gave it me all at once so i don't have constant stuff i suppose but i don't want to get my game interrupted every time i like throw a frag or something i infuse myself a gun might infuse some trinkets i might infuse a sweater what's your point then i figured out how to infuse things this is the first time on day 7 then why'd i have to do it again it's got something to do with memory stuff you can't recall [Music] all i see is me one step closer to breaking how do you not see me all right well i'm pretty limited in my weapons and stuff so that looks blocked off i want to find out what that is so guess i'm killing these guys correct you got any cool weapons for me i think so gift [Applause] look at you you've collected the first reward in the wake up challenge a charlie montague game good game design demands i make you feel extremely gratified here even though this one's kind of gimme next reward is just a shade more difficult i thought i was going to explode the hell did i just vault um yes give me that i already got full ammo don't get greedy colt nope i'm good how many voice lines you think he's done for that nice view mate i mean not really so i can't just go gun blick guns blazing but you can also do stealth i haven't really found any stealthy weapons or than the sword this is the best kind of i've come across so far feels really cool it's got a nice reload as well akshay mehta with the 50 donation you mad lad thank you so much for the support and uh casper evans just become a member thank you casper i hope we didn't miss any memberships earlier when the the thing froze but thank you everyone who's been supporting the stream and welcoming me to streaming on youtube appreciate you [Music] i don't know if this is like a shotgun or a marksman rifle but these guys just got absolutely handed to him [Music] i think i can dual wield weapons um i forget how i do that though well get wrecked pack this i need to get in that room hopefully that's open for me now there we go loop control center more people in the world last time it's gone as a silencer or the one i just had uh this one doesn't look like a silencer maybe at the front yeah i mean that doesn't sound very silent that was the gun you're talking about we're in this fight now ids sounds a bit too high do i need to do this again i don't know go down hard sentence okay send power to the complex didn't uh control the flow run the show worst advice ever you hear that damn radio sure a power generator what does that do though i can't jump over that you getting paid for this oh i see why no he's using the tunnel i love the melee i want some cool melee weapons [Music] okay that's everyone i need a battery a battery where do i find a battery guys there no so i absorb this stuff i mean i know what the battery stuff looks like got one before but i'll go through there this is cool i mean i'm missing something because i guess through the store bingo no that's more of this it's just an ammo room that's where i charge it what is that yes please i want to carry on go through here doesn't it what are you doing sorry i had to like you know screw stealth in that situation [Music] salam he's pretty sick recall from hipfire though interesting i get wrecked oh field modifiers feel nullifiers block the effects of slabs including reprise with a small area press f to pick one up and hold f to deploy or collapse okay so i can take this and throw it a visionary oh no keep forgetting about these things [Music] deactivate the carry throw all right that's good to know so if i see one of those i can use it against the visionaries i guess so they can't use their abilities uh right where do i find a battery this looks like a power room lmg goes bro hello broken what's going on here have you heard about this game made by the developers of dishonored arcane stuck in a loop and you're trying to figure out what's going on uh i'm not getting any clues here bingo of course it's our power charge it up i'm gonna have to do this for every machine yeah just spits out still some charge in the old girl though that's all of those charge you up again it is worth the memes broken yeah it's a good time i really liked any of the the cool abilities right now so i'm kind of just like stuck in you know standard shooter mode but there's some really cool mystical abilities you can get your hands on all right let's charge these ones up now i assume there's just one battery to do this i hope you're enjoying it chat bit different but uh yeah i've been posting some variety on the channel lately which uh i'm really happy that you guys have been enjoying so i mean you all know that war zone's a bit dry right now so i'll be more of that game soon when some content actually comes out it's supposed to be some new uh trials event soon right iron trials it's uh the description for that is it's basically like it tests your skills it's like a skilled version of warzone but isn't that just normal warzone there we go we did it for me baby this sounds like more spmn we'll see what that moment's like though i need to get to that station so i'm really the only one saying these how'd i get so lucky they never care that me it wasn't these messages from wherever or whenever this has to be my subconscious doesn't it it's like it sounds like i'm warning myself whenever i read this stuff on your feet maggots yeah that's the plane that we saw at the beach we're slowly discovering the answers oh baby i haven't seen you before that's a nice looking gun gold camo unlocked this is purple rarity too shove your scalpels these thin wet lines i don't know what any of this means we'll find out um given the loss of our experimental assets the captain included during the anomaly incident uh required documentation it'll be shelved in bookcase one i need to go to archival office near the gate up down that's where we go next primary power governor sounds like that could really ruin juliana's day let's go show some identification what i like is that it's not like just telling me like a to b where to go i mean obviously there's that checkpoint there but it sounds like i can like solve the story all right just by even going to the uh quest i guess i'll learn more about what's going on wrote our names in the sand on every stretch of beach i mean is that just a figure of speech they speaking ryan a lot of the time it's not a crime upgrade yeah it's a nice looking gun isn't it it looks really cool let's get youtube thumbnail for next time oh yeah that'll be i don't know what this is he likes the late shift okay so we'll come back here at night time ballistic turret let's uh hack this now what's that blowing pistol of some sort i don't know if that's going to save the next time i come back but we'll see auto fail let's blow this joint have you tried invading other players yet i have not no i'll probably do that once i've gone through the main story i think i want to like make sure i get through yeah the story first don't get too sidetracked it's an interesting mechanic if you're just tuning in there is a multiplayer aspect to this game um it's mostly single-player driven but there's another there's another character the antagonist of this game you're trying to find out how you know her if you're related if you're just friends um but there's clearly some like past history there but she's trying to hunt you because she doesn't want you to break the loop we're stuck in a time loop here so like we're living each day repeats we remember the days before and everything leading up to i guess what we're doing now which is trying to hunt eight different visionaries we've killed one so far one of eight i don't think it's possible what it's telling me so far is that you can't kill all eight in one actual playthrough like i could i don't think i could finish this game in one sitting you know it seems to me that it is quite linear but i kind of like that in a way because otherwise it would be very difficult to understand there's just so much information that they dump on you at once it's crazy i mean look at all these quests i just i don't know which one i should be doing first there's no power station beneath the loop i guess what i need to do is click these it shows me the most important ones these ones are just side quests i guess discoveries it says uh let's check loadout quickly i would like to not enough residue to infuse gear that's not what i want to hear because i do want to keep that gun i get a thousand if i sacrifice this that's already infused [Music] i can't delete it i guess because it's already equipped [Music] weird i forget how i do that it says press delete to that doesn't just doesn't do anything okay let's do that i can't keep this but i think i just want to save my residual for now that's a really cool gun though but i don't want to lose it basically what i'm telling myself right now is don't die do you think we can do it a fuse gear yeah i've only got 2 500 i need 8 000 to do that one so we'll just carry on with the game [Music] it's good to be back georgie different platform but same tomo streams i'll still do some some chill streams on uh i'm unsubscribing this dude is not nice he ain't giving me a shout out i thought if you're trolling or not but i'm sorry if that's how you feel uh elias cats killis cats cats dude if you want me to give you a shout out have a name that's easier to pronounce like tom dang you know or sandra a casper evans they just know um what was i reading i've i've gone off i've gone off trail look the way i see it youtube is investing into live streaming right and it has more of a there's more discoverability there whereas on twitch there is no discoverability sounds like my kind of guy the top dogs stay at the top of the people who started streaming on twitch 10 years ago still the number one and everyone else just gets left behind and i figured if i want to stream i want to do games like this where my audience is i've got a decent following on twitch and i'll still stream there and do some kill streams like play some warzone and stuff or whatever but if i have a plan for a stream oh uh she's hunting me again if i have a plan for a stream like a playthrough or something i figure like it's just it's just better to stream here also i don't like it when i'm playing a game like this and i have to subject you guys to ads all the time so like i've completely disabled uh monetization so you just won't see adverts when you watch youtube streams i i do not get that choice on on twitch you're forced to watch stream to watch advert sorry um we'll have double jump no lost that we'll find another way to get up there yeah plus i've got 1440p higher bitrate on youtube and then the streams go up as a vod afterwards for anyone that missed it and you can also rewind whilst the stream is live which is another cool feature well i think we can say that is definitely a player that's a player that is not ai oh god it's happening chat we're on that roof oh it's intense this is actually intense first player encounter give myself away and they are landing their shots too where are you join me [Music] this is nuts i can't get out until i activate the tunnel i need to heal up [Music] this is my last life holy crap this is crazy i'm gonna lose everything come on you've seen me i know you have stopped playing these games this play is good as well why have you got abilities like that jesus spm in this game there's spm guys it's proven she's so much higher than me oh no that's all my life's gone i think that just restarts my day right yeah dude i got absolutely that it's jack frags yeah you watch i actually just got my ass handed to me that was crazy they've definitely i mean the game's not out yet right and the reviewers have had i think this game for about two weeks so some of these people have already completed the main story so they're just some players aren't going to want their story to get interrupted by skillful players like that but if anything that motivates me to sooner than it's not called the dash ability i need to be up there what am i doing yeah the voice acting is great really good play off the booze should i see me coming a mile off i mean i think i played that as well as i could have with the resources i had but i just need uh i need to hunt the main targets i think otherwise i can't do any crazy abilities how do i get in here i'm so confused i'm missing something here we'll have it back this afternoon i'll leave the garage door cracked a smidge if you need a [ __ ] i'm guessing this is the only way in oh i'm gonna have to come back in the afternoon okay that's not the only thing i need to do here [Applause] why do i see quests again tab nope how do i see my quests it's not escape it's not tab it's not caps lock i don't know what my current current objectives are that was awesome though oh so intense when the energy kicked up there it was really fun i mean maybe this is the only thing i can do j oh it's jay that's weird thank you though let's get out of the way of the enemies j okay wow visionary leads okay i have to come back in the afternoon that was actually my main part of this quest i guess it's like a crime board i can't ignore those guys come back in the afternoon j for debated should trip some people up in the in the candy store again that was fun still up there yeah hi guys [Music] now it's your turn oh god stop that no stop that seriously stop that right now dude stop can you stop that's really that's really screwed me you should definitely get that checked out all right [Music] keep on keeping on that's really weird autofill there's a lot of side quests i can't believe how good that enemy player was unreal credit to him movement was on point repositioning was on point always had my that was always on my tail i activated the tunnel i think i think i managed to do it in time it's my play there was just to try and get back because when juliana hunts you you can't escape it suddenly turns into tarkov insane hey cole thanks for tuning in man all right so we're at noon now or no we need to hold call to get to the afternoon then we go to [Music] up down let's try this again so i wonder what the enemy player gets for killing me even just like one time she killed me three times house performance pretty good on pc uh doctor but at the same time the game's on ps5 it's like a limited console [Music] parkour anyway is there any need i don't know if you can take full damage on it oh here we go it's my fault does it matter it's a torture room always waiting might be enemies in here i like the music it's vibey deadliest bookworm [Music] hey movement is the second floor isn't it it is her game her board her rules aon archival office nobody's listening okay someone from eon has been redecorating main cult share your concerns most of these yahoos and blah blah blah when she's dead correct most people can't even be in igor sterling i know what any of that means but whatever progress keep finding that one but i don't know what that trinket does drinking buddies if you want to read that you can you can do that i'll probably do so after the stream but i want to try and keep moving the uh main story forward usually it'll tell me if i've read something that actually progresses a story there's a lot of law things to read terminals to access anything else i'm missing around here whoa almost willingly did a stone there what's this uh hello anybody home uh feeling exclusive tommy of the motherland i want some kind of password maybe analog propagation barnacle tourniquet galvanized retroactive actually if you can just keep guessing oh do i miss something supercilious bookshelf test flight electron tenderloin tenderloin i bet if you keep guessing they're probably there's just so many different lines of dialogue there imagine if you keep guessing maybe you will accidentally say the passcode that'd be cool i don't know if i actually missed anything up here but it's worth checking someone said bookshelf read that this uh interesting usually they highlight things in orange i think if it moves the story forward i mean it helps there's a lot more i missed oh perfect as per the field martial's orders you have been entrusted with a pass key to the up damn rack facility this pass key is troikea troika the contents of this communication is strictly confidential the field marshall expressed concerns a single audio lock is insufficient security given the importance and sensitivity of the equipment within you may provide any thoughts on the matter to him by way of the communications office at yasen station i don't know where that is operation horizon heard that a few times okay that was it nice i already oh come on i was almost there you're not even remotely close look out the window see that giant [ __ ] eye that's me so you are hiding in plain sight the problem captain vaughn is that i see everything i see moves you haven't even thought of yet better start looking for ladders hmm there's no ladder is that right again [ __ ] up damn more like what's up dog i'll get out of these windows all right that's cool i probably would have missed that and just left to the exit because the marker was over there i don't tell you when you've completed an objective but it's a good thing because i don't think i don't know what i'm doing right now is a main mission but i think really you can't do a wrong mission to progress the story because you you just repeat the day i think i just need to exit now i want that shift back man i really missed that i used it for two seconds yo mods thank you [Music] jesus [Music] the door no i don't think that passcode was for the door if it is um i think i need to return at night time that was evening yeah it's pretty smooth silence i'm on a 30 80. the rack door what is the rack door oh wow look at he signed in on a different account committed [Music] thanks mods appreciate you yeah i wanna i wanna hunt this guy mr dorsey a man of decadent tastes he's a his appetites run as deep as his pockets and a rotten sweetness fills the air around him or is that a smell of wet dog found a password for a site called the rack troika whatever it is [Music] it's next to the uh archivist office and juliana isn't in it maybe that is the right passcode then yeah i think i need to return at nighttime some sort of like vip club i guess maybe is there a proper band like on twitch i don't think so georgie if there's a hide user oh jesus here we go [Music] [ __ ] your skill oh this is new in the matrix now hey guys this is blocked off secret information okay what is it i said it was top secret spill it [ __ ] okay okay the best place to see the fireworks is next to the stage that's it that's all you've got please die [Music] huh that worked oh no juliana no no i don't have good guns please don't do this to me oh no [Music] put this thing away [Music] [Applause] i need to keep my eyes peeled if i was an enemy juliana player too much oh no don't shoot don't shoot don't shoot i hear i hear us oh my ass my beautiful ass where you hiding juliana we can be friends see ya yeet oh dead oh my god why have i got this gun wrecked oh that is so intense give me your shift ability and give me your residium holy and you've got this perk as well carnesis kinesis even send enemies flying through the air she had some sick abilities and she just got absolutely shot on and now doesn't have them so well it was i was weird shouldn't have been yes that was mid mid vault i'm just glad i killed it that could have been so bad for me i need to find health now she can kill me as many times as she wants if she uh if she's in my lobby hunting cult whereas i only have to kill her once i'm gonna sneak past here that was so crazy all right activate the tunnels again yeah that was a oh hi mate that was an enemy juliana and she put a freaking proximity mine on the thing that i had on the thing that i had to hack oh this play was good this player was good no that isn't juliana ai the enemy juliana can be controlled by a player there is a multiplayer aspect to the game you can disable the uh the multiplayer if you want and only go up against an ai juliana but you could see that she had like a different outfit on uh because she's obviously customized to a player outfit whoever that character the player is that was crazy though it's horrible fighting them when they've got the abilities and just teleporting everywhere and good weapons as well because she can customize her loadout and then come in with i guess all of the stuff that she's acquired as cult and uh keep stuff between lives but the fact that i killed her there i think maybe she doesn't have any of that stuff anymore so like i said earlier get rekt um yeah she's done this already what was i here for then i've completely lost track of what i was doing i came back here for a reason i think i need to go back to that door don't i they're all so skilled though as well if you notice like they don't look like new players i'm the noob right now but the fact that she put a uh a proximity mine on the thing that i had to go and deactivate in order to escape is crazy the game suddenly becomes a stake escape from tarkov when you've got a player in your game absolutely nuts perfect right let's find out what's inside this rack man oh man so we uh have to accelerate the schedule by six weeks otherwise the probability of a successful breach decreases to just 16 the rack team confirmed they can make the deadline if they forego the ejection seat the life support system and drop the shock absorbers from the landing gear uh the pilot uh lieutenant uh sorry uh he's been promoted for this governor he's been briefed and he's still 110 on board with the flight yeah i'll do some more moving forward man the weapons are super cool yeah they are no one they're really cool they're hard they're hard to uh figure out though like those other stations to find out just what it is i don't know if i need to be leading because there's a couple of times there i was like if it was hit scanner uh probably no no no no no it's gotta be military and unimaginative um bomb the hell is this do i not know is there a way for me to know a book or something something i'm missing anyone just have the passcode like barnacle vixen deity this stuff again what's the name of that uh paradiddle paradiddle what if there's a certain future of dishonored universe i mean maybe no they're not directly tied okay that's what that does i'm confused i was there something they said on that recording that i missed i hack anything around here i'm not missing anything i just don't think i have the passcode for whatever it is right outside the door okay someone collapsed enemy attack uh i guess i need to go here i guess so what was it called the control room which i think is yeah horizon facilities we've heard of that a few times i think there's something we can do there yeah do some streaming on youtube uh etf when it comes to games like this i think i'd rather my um if i can stream where my audience is then more people will see it whereas if i do these play-throughs then it never really goes up as content on youtube i just like get stuck i'll get if i if i do get lost in a good game then content slows down on the channel but this way i'm able to play through the games and then upload it as a vod immediately afterwards so um i think just better for content really still do streams on twitch but i'll be more chill if i don't have a plan just means that i can do streams with a plan this time around that makes any sense i'm very deliberate with every sort of move i make after wake up with a face full of sand oh yeah plus this way i don't have to leave you hanging all the time with uh editing like episodes you know if i was to do this i could do like a three hour live stream and then get it done in a few play sessions as opposed to like spreading out across however many episodes and leaving people on cliffhangers all the time you just watch it and fast forward through bits that you need to oh we got some gear now i would like to infuse some gear check out the geek collected here the hut the hourglass icon indicates new gear that you haven't preserved highlight your equipment to see how much residue it costs to rever preserve it into future loops or however or how much residue you can gain by sacrificing it forever yeah we've learned that already you can sacrifice lots of gear at once select one then select more okay highlight weapon or slab and press that to learn more about it or upgrade with trinkets sort your sport with tabs on the left cool escape right i want to keep uh i don't have lmg anymore slabs i want to keep 15 000 it's to preserve that and keep it for future runs how much do i have i was like fourteen thousand fourteen thousand throw enemies around painfully which one do we want chad i'm thinking shift movement was really good so i'm gonna like sacrifice that i can't sacrifice that interesting yeah that gave me nothing i have sacrificed it though it's just gone [Music] they're handed assassinations are quicker and kicks do something i don't really care about this one this one i will gain something from slabs infuse shift each lab has four upgrades find upgrades by collecting the slab again from the visionary carries it or juliana which is where we got it the first time around [Music] hell yeah so where do i find my slabs i forget she's what you need to infuse you have four non-infused items of gear yeah that's fine you find those weapons all over the place in the office almost like she doesn't want to see me that's like honestly the rack is my key to catching her but it's inside a password sealed vault this island studded with dusty old bunkers better start digging the hell a little bit laggy didn't it i woke up but i'm not playing um okay that's happening in the evening [Music] wasn't i supposed to hunt that i think i need to wait [Music] i need to wait until night time also wait until the afternoon [Music] time to stack bodies and get hardies exactly here we go let's go hunt mr dorsey let's do it our second visionary of eight in total uh sean it's not out until tomorrow so uh you haven't missed the [Music] your game you feeling good not the word i'd use yeah tell me about it uh it's weird but somehow familiar yeah it's kind of a rush this whole place i have done then why did i want to leave so bad all right you're just repeating what i've done yeah i'm here to parties i have top secret information okay what is it i said it was top secret spill it [ __ ] okay okay that i used last time see the fireworks is next to the stage that's it that's all you've got please listen to this conversation it's gonna be spectacular i'm freezing my ass off looking for colts very [ __ ] spectacular we should take him alive and strap him to the fireworks um what it's just a thought wait juliana was in my lobby i didn't even realize [Music] it's tough to tell when you've been hit in this entry like you game see any blood on your screen until it's pretty much too late i already got full ammo all right now i can press tab and i've got my shift thing back son of a bee and that's it for today's live stream no one send that clip to stone 64. i was gonna do some there was this badass play in my head i was just gonna land on that guy it did not go to plan it did not go to plan [Music] now you don't see anything no no no okay oh they see me oh they see me um i can't believe i got so outplayed by myself come on it's fine [Music] fish we were back being a snitch i knew it i knew i couldn't trust you guys but why wasn't i invited how am i gonna pack the turret all right i don't have many guns so i'll take whatever they've got the four pounder that sounds like a sex toy not gonna lie let's go they all wore the same masks [ __ ] nope i'm good you may never wear the same masks one of these [ __ ] is left oh my god question is which that this jackass will give himself away with the right inducement don't come down the staircase please don't forget sake oh no what what what money won't save him [Music] i mean i know what outfit he's wearing though right like if i see him and i say maybe that's him [Music] they're all the same gonna leave a stain look inside deep inside there i'm in the right room which one of them is it i think it's him oh this is a trapdoor stop spotting me [Music] [Music] excuse me [Music] to deduce which one of them it is but i don't kill everyone yeah it is a trapdoor what they keep going up to it like one at a time so do i just wait oh you recognize me right and they press the button themselves it was definitely not him because i didn't hit that just takes forever for them to go up how long am i gonna have to wait usually three three times a charm right i pressed the button already [Music] you just want me to press it for some random person oh this poor they lady all her books and i think she's going crazy you're horrible get in the bin come on is thought they just let you know one person votes and then they all agree they didn't agree you got all the time in the world come on stop searching for me you don't know where i am oh my god they're all leaving now he's here send everybody oh my god holy there's a lot of people here [Music] [Music] so short just run and hide tom run and hide get on the roof hello yes don't be greedy i'm going to hit up the nature [Music] where's the gun there before they're all on the search for me that is the right room i was in but yeah that was that's a long waiting game you've got to play for the right person to stand on that platform catch later joshua gavin clayton thank you for the two dollars australian appreciate it man look for the support tom do you ever sleep it's only midnight we're talking about i'm gonna aim for about three hours with these streams so i guess anyone could be a security expert around here i think they're yeah they're done searching for me what do you mean they're just finding bodies i think so i'll leave my gun jammed doors blocked oh we know this is the right way [ __ ] time hopefully they just get back to party in a second will they stop searching is the question i've blown it it's a good game spot yeah i'm enjoying it man [Music] hello hello what oh yeah they know where i am oh god oh right you know what you know what i've killed myself more than the enemy has even hasn't even managed to god is this what it's like is this what it's like to be stone is this just a stone role play game can you just go back to partying please and pretend i wasn't here i might just have to take a guess you see me now i'm gonna have to take a guess and just try and pick them all off one by one come on [Music] are these what are they doing [Music] all guns blazing might be the only option right now guys i think of i waited too long for the right person i mean they're not spotting me i do really like this gun i'm gonna make sure i hit all my shots though because i've got 14 rounds [Music] he says he misses [Music] forget my uh power up needs to be changed out of my grenades throwing bottles at me now oh god oh my god this is crazy they really do want me dead absolutely wingman this is sick um oh they're going to kill me i'm not careful is there something i can hack oh my there are so many of them it's insane out of ammo [Music] at least the song slaps [Music] well there's got to be ammo lying around somewhere again don't do this to me yes better need longer health whatever pretend i care about this stuff come on igor you shouldn't let science stand in the way of a good time if you want to read it you can pause it closed over born big cocky yet all right that's added something to my quest yes yes oh what do you want [Music] [Music] we better not be cold scoob zoix oh jesus [Music] hopefully i'll trip over that [Music] slip in the shower [Music] you start to run over if you die yeah it'll restart the day for me oh no no mother said not to play with my food better this time do you know who i am yes that was him oh that would have been so much easier [Music] i could have made that so much easier for myself if i'd have just waited for him to make his damn speech but it was just taking so long i was like is it ever gonna happen now what you're doing tom it's risky as hell i was i was trying to earn call points and then i was like it's not worth it you've already fallen and died twice i'm gonna try and do something like crazy shift jump aerial assassination residium down there that's where i died yeah you can see where i uh i definitely didn't die full damage because it's just not what i do [ __ ] almost happened again i thought he would just teleport me there oh god this is so chalked we killed the right man but i think maybe i need to get something off him fast way out i mean he's dead but yeah i think i've got i a i've got to take something from him already a slab yeah you're right level design is really good in this game there's actual routes that you've clearly like you find that have been set up i don't have a lot of health so i can't really people are here too if we were moving this place don't spot me don't stop me probably could have kicked him off the edge oh god they're all here though oh why did i kill him where i killed him i was so happy about it too for the worst spot how many people are in here you're gonna come outside maybe yeah keep coming come on come on please come outside you idiot you idiot why did you make that so much harder than it needed to be [Music] yeah whatever finding alternative roof route calculating no don't you come out of this door oh so much ammo yes elf oh all the cakes shifty sneaky shadows jesus i've literally made this so much more difficult than it needed to be oh buddy cole [Music] okay i'm gonna take this side now debating them all to the other side hey girl oh please this game is nice i don't even know if this is a way that i can go i don't want to risk it because if i fall off that edge it's death for me are you are you kidding me there's like six people on this balcony i've got no grenades murder him better this time oh boy i don't think they're gonna try and vault that because they'll fall to their death i am also screwed in this position he's here the alert the host is [ __ ] taste in tunes good to know one quack quack [Music] [Music] gtfo gtfo [Applause] sheesh that was nuts [Music] he spotted me oh god this guy's there [Music] um i'll get down here safely this is fun as hello guys not gonna lie i don't wanna do this because it's probably going to kill me isn't it full health it's fine you saw nothing mate fast way out sounds good sketchy as hell though mate like no good need to switch the generator over hack you down generator do another time oh mate don't do this oh [ __ ] [ __ ] is this mine have i hacked this already no now can i press f there we go we'll come back and do that generator thing when it needs me too it's horrible i haven't had any issues with stars no what the hell did i just kick the briefcase or something all those turret things i just baited those guys so hard with that dash of the umbrella thing to run inside and quickly grab that guy oh god thank god for double jump oh is there an enemy uh is that like one of the traps for uh for the hunt i think the people i'm hunting i'm confused not gonna lie the heart palpitations will reel that one i gotta get out of here though stop what we fell the hell out of here well that shows you that there's more than one money to play right way to kill two of them at once or three or four okay so you can or more no they can't be this well maybe alexis i have to do one at time maybe you can somehow take out multiple but they're all across different districts though so maybe you can get them into this all the same district at the same time that goes to show that there's more ways to uh play the game than just stealth right like using the abilities i'm just glad i didn't buy that third time it's actually has some stuff of value there yeah that julianna player i think what happened there was it was some sort of trap from another visionary but juliana they left early so as soon as i got in the game they left so i think maybe they were waiting for me and then i never showed up and then i finally got in the game when they pressed exit match so that was nuts um okay yeah smashed it somehow i could say that smashed my legs a couple of times uh slabs i would like to keep this one infused [Music] that's already been infused as well all right sick all right guys i think we're gonna call it left tonight that was a great stream though great first stream no issues and uh a good first look at death loop hope you all enjoyed it and we're back with another stream on this game soon try and throw in some other some other games in the meantime as well battlefield 2042 beta coming soon looking forward to that for sure probably do a youtube stream on that if it allows me to i have a bunch of issues streaming warzone but um i mean let's just hope that battlefield 2042 is actually optimized yeah it's been a it's been a blast guys thank you for tuning in i hope you enjoyed it um more streams soon like i said memberships are now active uh five dollars from uh captain indy thank you very much how's the performance on what is your gpu my gpu is a 3080 ti uh actually no it's just a normal 3080 the founders edition um but my performance has been really good i don't usually display fps counters because i have so much stuff running that it impacts the game's performance so i get a lot of questions about it like how are you using a 3080 and having you know stream you know fps drops it just eliminates those questions but i'm running it at like 180 fps um runs really well gavin clayton thank you for two dollars as well man i think i thank you for that but um i appreciate all the support tonight guys it's been great great first stream no issues got the 40 40p the high bitrate thanks valerie georgia um georgie as well and husky i think he was here earlier thanks thanks for mod in the chat when it went a bit crazy but yeah that's gonna do it for tonight more on the game soon like i said stay safe and i'll catch you legends in the next one bye bye
