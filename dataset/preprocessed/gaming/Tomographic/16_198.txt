what's up guys it's tom here and welcome back to another warzone video so before we start i just want to say a massive thank you for 150k subscribers on youtube i seriously can't keep up with how fast this channel is growing now and i mean it really does feel like yesterday that we hit 100k so it's just really cool that you guys keep coming back and if you are part of that 73 of people that aren't subscribed do me a favor hit that subscribe button and you won't miss out on any future war zone videos so i've used the khan i8 now in a bunch of videos but i've never actually made a dedicated weapon build video and showing you my setup and that's mainly because i switch things around all the time with my loadouts but i've decided on a loadout that works really well for warzone and with the recent khan i8 buff the ads speed and mobility of the con i8 has been vastly improved which has made this thing even better i mean i was already a big fan of the khan i8 in war zone so the fact that it's been buffed even further is just music to my ears so this is how i have the khana 8 setup i use the monolithic suppressor for sound suppression and damage range syngard 27.6 inch barrel for the damage range bullet velocity and recoil control i use the tac laser which gives you the biggest increase in ads speed as well as the variable zoom scope this is up to you if you want to use the regular sniper scope then be my guest but like i said the ads speed of the car 98 anyway is really good so using a variable optic allows me to adapt to the different ranges i'm playing at now i used to use the f-tac sport comb stock to help out with the ads speed but since this recent buff i've actually started using a focus perk because when you get shot out with marksman rifles in this game the amount of flinch reduction is huge and it saves me so many times because of that bolt time if i do miss that first shot and i start taking hits the amount of flinch that you have to deal with without using this perk i mean it just makes it unbearable to use for me so i've really liked using the focus perk with this build but if you really want to put everything into ads speed then i guess i'd remove the variable zoom scope put on a normal sniper scope and add that ftac sport comb stock so it's really up to you how you want to set this thing up but this has worked really well for me so i definitely recommend you try this build i've got a couple of matches to show you now which really show how powerful the car 98 can be playing with study westy and benny central thank you again for 150k subscribers and make sure to subscribe if you are new i guess the next milestone for the channel is 200k so if you could help me out and hit subscribe that would be great leave a like on the
