this random outhouse oh god why are you here what the chances oh no you don't no you don't oh my god there's another guy get out of my house peek it there you go oh we both broke each other the most intense pistol battle you've ever seen oh well that was a fun little fight wasn't it not how i intended to start the match but i'm not mad about it all right this train might just be my saving grace if it's unlooted oh no there's a guy there look mark to target hmm if he's fully looted the train i don't stand a chance with his pistol i just gotta hope that he gets off in a second doesn't ride the train come on get off the train get off the train yes good boy i feel like hitman planning my means of attack before i take out my enemy all right there's a gun on the other side of this tank can't get over it ak cold war ak oh no it's got the 4x on it though hasn't it well this is going to be fun there's a couple of vehicles at the buy station is that him it's like the same skin i'll just get over there see if we can uh third party these guys oh no that's way too much zoom where'd you go behind the truck okay that wasn't a fun fight that was a lot of recall to manage looking inside his brain without scope as well they didn't have much money i could use some uh someone just shoot at me they did show me ow i'll take the wheel i'm just gonna drive away i don't really want to try and fight that he's definitely got a nice sniper rifle of some sort good shot on him as well um right i've got like two and a half minutes to wait before i get my loadout so i'm gonna play up here and then maybe try and check out the old mine to the north of the map where exactly did that guy shoot me from [Music] don't know and this appears to have been looted somewhat the lord out over there the airport if i can find some cash i'll buy my loadout but i think i might just have to wait at this point spend the money on something else i can drive right onwards got a fresh vehicle [Music] and someone i can chase but they've got some money i like them there's a fight going down here okay that was embarrassing let's not let's not talk about that dude right this guy thought he could run me over i had my eyes on the mini map i knew you were coming actually i'm gonna fight this guy first because he's gonna have the high ground on me otherwise what exactly are you doing yeah remind me not to full spray the ffar again come on oh he's got a snipe that hurt i'm not gonna lie all right all right he's really desperate to run me over isn't he use your guns man there you go all right just give me all your stuff oh he's got his loadout okay 31 and it's maxed out as well it's got the uh giu suppressor on it very nice all right let me and then i'm going to use the vehicle the third person peaked and he's looking at me for that reason he's dead oh no get the finish i love it when a plan comes together i'll drive and my loadouts in so i can get my own in a second let's loot this guy if i can get up there i thought i could make this jump no that's not gonna happen i'm just glad they got a sniper on him oh almost missed that ledge oh god i just seen a guy oh damn there you go see can't be afraid to take a shot sometimes if it means that you're gonna get the critical hit because he hit me in the upper chest there so it wasn't a one-hit kill or as i took the time to get that head shot so glad that paid off i'm not gonna waste my time trying to leave that guy i might come back later but i just want my load out right now it's landed in a pretty perfect spot for me and it's the only load out there so that means there's no one else in my vicinity lovely as well con i8 i've got the gi mini reflex on this time the iron sights failed me in the last solar video i did a quick stop at the buy station we came to earlier i need some more plates and a cell phrase yeah that's lovely that's beautiful right back in the truck definitely not the rover and away we go let's find some more enemies oh crap again i find myself driving around in a truck just trying to find someone would i just as rather punch myself in the dick maybe i swear i landed in this building earlier maybe not i don't know if there's a guy in this building it has to be you wouldn't leave a truck behind would you though my truck is at half hp so maybe i should just steal his oh god he's right there what what the hell dude what blew me up he had a c4 oh he debated me to try and take the truck that's genius time to earn your freedom soldier okay because he's not repeating that hold that king how did you get there we'll spectate the rest of this round i think i uh i fully got outplayed there let's see how this goes though you know people like watching spectate content so i'll spectate this guy's gonna try and regain at these buildings yeah i got played in the gulag there as well actually didn't hear that guy run over it's funny there's this thing um it's in a lot of games it's a mechanic called footstep audio um you might have heard of it i haven't personally but apparently it's in this game i was getting into a bit of a groove there as well it's a shame but hey ho tis but the way of solos and the match goes on with or without me oh what do you know there's a guy camping in this building and there is a prime example as to why melee is so busted he actually nearly won that fight one more punch and let go be dead i mean is this fun are you having fun alex george i mean you've got seven kills but if you got them all playing this way i think there's a lesson we can all learn here you're checking that heartbeat like you're playing pokemon go i don't understand let's just sit here and watch this guy use his heartbeat for a bit was a truck coming up on the mini map we about to see some action you know i've said it before i'll say it again the truck in solos is like a mobile house you know it's what i use to move from house to house they are very broken in solos i'll admit i will admit it but at least it gives the aggressive players a means of pushing up on a building because you can use that truck for parkour routes or just scaring someone out of hiding you know sometimes they'll peek you and you'll see them in a window or start shooting at you and then you actually know that you've got a fight in your hands but this well this is like watching paint dry i never spectate solos to see how the rest of the players are enjoying the game quote but solos is scary you know i get it it is like a horror game at times but when you slow things down this much you're asking to get jump scared you know this guy's going to get headshotted and he's not even gonna know that he's being looked at because of the head glitch that guy's got on the roof he's got stung grenades of course i feel like we're gonna be seeing a lot of the adler skin raven gave it out to everybody so it's going to be the new default skin this is a nice little root he's got it he's very exposed but i can respect it he's fighting a bunny rabbit he's currently hopping inside a hole good beam good beam he's got semtex that could make the most of oh he's made the most of it replacement good placement but yeah a lot of people are gonna have eod that guy just took a peek and fired a airstrike his way i could have clipped him it's a ball push by this guy but makes sense given the circumstances and he's been stunned this means that he's dead and just like that another broken mechanic has been manipulated by a bunny rabbit this guy's at 12 kills respectable was this the dude to kill me no i don't think so but he seems a bit more of the aggressive type because he has a truck that's what i'm going off yeah my guess is he'll take his truck now try and find someone else over by that lowdown maybe is good cover so i'm gonna leave this behind especially when it comes down to the end game circles oh he's found a truck buddy and another truck buddy in the distance this is usually what it comes down to he does have an airstrike in his pocket as well as a play box there's pretty set up for end game here he's got a nice position in the zone and he spoiled a guy in the houses oh and they've only gone and traded blows would you look at that and they both have cell phones i'm on the edge of my seat i can't speak for the other guy but he must have had a con i eat as well because or at least something with a very similar bullet velocity that's where bullet velocity really comes into play on sniper rifles that's why it's so important oh my god he spotted a guy he didn't even move out of the way what is this game how did that guy make it so far into the match to get taken out like that it's up to 13 kills now look at him go and this guy's going full meme as well in his bunny outfit there's another guy moving behind that tree he's definitely seen him wow all right back in his truck 14 kills it's a good game so far he's doing well all things considered everyone else is a bit of a handicap because they don't have a truck but oh no there's absolutely zero cover in the circle but he has the power of a truck on his side it could very well be someone in that tower for all we know is coming from the north he's taking a hit there it's a 2v2 situation the enemies just got in the truck if you can see that on the mini map looks like it's coming directly over yeah the only cover in this final circle is going to be these two trucks this is a good play get the air strike on the truck oh my god this game ends like that they both air strikes each other oh no he went to put his airstrike down oh what a way to end the game two truck people two truck users in the end game both went to air strike the other one's truck and the guy in the middle of the zone got his down first the guy with spectating couldn't get his air strike down because the air space was too crowded he had to retreat and get in the truck because the air strike was inbound and he was just going to try and drive away from it but immediately got head shotted unbelievable scenes well played guys did you guys oh what good sportsman some respect at the end there as well well that was a game i hope you enjoyed that i'll bring you some more solos so when i can uh you know next time i can brave it i don't think my heart can take any more of that tonight it's just too uh much too campy for my liking maybe next time we'll try and force people into gunfights yeah i hope you enjoyed the uh the spectate commentary as well maybe we'll do more of that in the future but for now i just want
