[Music] can you see the floor it's the true car that's not experienced my god i'm good batteries i've never seen wars the visibility let me tell you is insane have you got no floor like does that happen to me earlier oh the floor's definitely there the sound effects are weird you're in the matrix now tom no no like yeah dude i've i've ascended see the woman in the red dress wow are you sure you haven't got comments insane making fun of my 1080. that card held up that was a good card 1080 was brilliant there's no weapon models yeah oh i don't have weapon models if i ads there's nothing tom just go along with it it's called have no irons oh i don't know why people have auto attack sprint enabled i don't find it's an enjoyable thing how's this weapon inspect look whoa this weapon looks sick dude whoa new weapon in a war zone what i broke warzone seriously you should see this oh some textures are popping in it's all that vram to get through damn the game slowly puts itself back together yeah it is i still don't have weapon models though you don't need them use the finger guns when i do when i hit yes it just zooms in my screen don't shoot them just you know diplomacy we've got enough cash now if you want to go i guess like it's not loaded properly you know just though every time i restart my pc my fps is a lot better memory that's something sounds like yeah yeah yeah i think it's something to do with memory leak for sure the other day i was playing my game literally just closed like no error code no nothing it just you're closed i heard that as well this is a different game man i mean roblox warzone does exist i'm legit playing roblox um does anybody want plates or anything so i'll just drop you money i've just seen little nas oh dear god i'm okay they'll knows x's in my game oh nice did you see that jack the roblox event no what they did at a roblox event with lil nas what they called it like the fortnite ones i needed a concert in the game all right like a live performance i mean to be fair we have the same thing here in london with a full 3d scale replica of rita ora so have you not seen the ad why do i buy that there's another one over there it's gonna be the weirdest game of war zone he's got the matties one of them just tried air striking me was that their ass right yeah yep i'm being beamed oh that wasn't there on my screen tom i fell in the hole because there was no texture he's literally shooting me through a solid rock right now yeah a lot of the meshes are broken at the moment air conditioning units and stuff and rock some of them you can just shoot right through them there's zero textures in the gulag i mean the gas in the sky and you return to the front line he did not say nice things to me okay this is the bus oh my god this is content could you see i'm the entire time is content oh oh my god the most broken game of war zone i've ever played at this time god damn i just got wrecked yeah rtb at this time let's return for return to base right yeah uh just the warning we played against like six playing cheers right okay oh yeah oh fabulous uh do you want me to just do a cheeky pull off no no see what happens i got the content lucky yeah if we die we die stay in for for time at least but legit you've also you've never seen war zone like this we got a friend jack tricia lester what does this look like tom um everything's just super clear like the visibility is insane i wonder what it looks like uh no there's no send me a picture afterwards i will this it's just like i mean legit minecraft everything's just like blocks blocked out no color no texture earlier today when we were playing tomorrow i had the bug floor didn't load in most of the walls didn't load in it looks like google earth street view oh 3d yes or like microsoft flight simulator the texture quality is so low yeah that you can you can spot details it's mental you're just letting the wind take you jack who knows about it so i was in that gulag and the buses that are in newtown weren't there so i could see the guy from a spawn which way went left or right i could see the headlights which were floating in front of me are you kidding me i have no weapon model so when ads i had no irons but i could see him clear as day cause i knew where the center of my screen was oh my god only things are fully rendered are weapon models when you're like when they're on the ground jack has no walls around him right now no floor he's floating holy crap yeah that looks mental just give him vertigo part way through his video are you fighting somebody no i was about to say surely he's about to come up right well there he is some textures have popped in around jack go above you jack so you're right a [ __ ] there you go there you go he's on shooter turret oh he just not frag though i can't i can't deploy this all right it's not letting me down yeah it's broken jack you can't put them down anymore real yeah i tried to do it earlier doesn't even put in your hands does it [Applause] oh you can't even see it floating in front of you when you get to place it he's coming up he's had his head set to your left unlucky well that's the most scuff game of war zone ever send me a picture i'm in trouble as to um i won contact relocating [ __ ] him okay everywhere oh god and him beaming me from a different angle i'll just parachute off by the sounds of it that's such a messy fight dude it's actually a war there's a guy on the um there's a guy in the building what is it good for absolutely nothing i shot a guy here i took tanks on her shots didn't even break him down one or more here me there you go finished that was a nice little flank i did there he was uh oh lol you literally caught him with the last bullet didn't you he's in there as well no way i went through the uh target down the box the fence and then the window what's going on well played you're still fighting um ballistic anomaly right now down finish okay i had a stun i heard one parachute a while ago like probably one over here i'm gonna try and flank on the left side there's one down here zombie i'm 91 i didn't shoot him to see if he'll peek this corner again oh here steps hit that guy there's gonna be one right above you somewhere are you up there don't hit him nice nice nice nice i needed you to hit that yeah then there's one more on blue or round blue jack he's probably to the left of it now more to the west don't see him down oh you said there's still one over oh yeah they're shooting at me maybe the very top level of crane in the like caddy yeah he's not peaked again there yeah oh [Music] give me the prompt thank you again i appreciate that uh ammo boxing find place for someone if they need them i've got eyes on him i was climbed up right to the top now yeah on orange okay i mean we should take him out really because he'll bring his team back if we're not careful just on his own i think more kills so i think these guys are going for the shot probably yeah that's probably their uav yep he's dumb okay all the prone i broke him i broke him whoever was with me there shouldn't have died there he was very angry tom he was so ready for me jack like proper like cracked out of his mind i was dead silence and everything i'd hide had had um what did he say he screamed no if he's still on blue aggressively no no no i refuse to believe the dmr has been left he's probably going to try pushing me from what side uh he's on blue still he's still on blue mountain they're right on top of his stud broke him breaking break

they i'm i'm in the stairwell now stud yeah coming over instead guys the game must definitely be enough that's there's no way it's so frustrating indeed i think we should all become totally accurate about royale players i think we should become game devs yeah i feel like they've either they've undercooked it or that it's not been applied or it hasn't been applied no but it has though because you can fit like you can see no it definitely has it's been tested it's been tested it's like they have they haven't gone into the logistics of what makes that gun broken and they just like there's a slider they turned it down by ten percent and thought oh yeah when they and they've done it completely wrong they've panicked because they've had so much hate and they wanted to get an update out quickly and they've taken zero time to make sure it works effectively [Music] you
