scan's range of 360hz g-sync ips monitors in the description below and also if you have been playing the beta on pc you may want to enable nvidia reflex in the game's options which you can find here and yeah nvidia reflex if you didn't know essentially lowers the time it takes from a mouse click to an action happening on screen and in doing so lowers your system's responsiveness and for those wondering battlefield 2042 will also include dlss 2.0 which uses ai to boost frame rates while also retaining neo-native image quality which is great for pc players who want to get the most out of their systems hardware with all of that being said though thank you to nvidia and scan for sponsoring this stream and thank you guys for watching whether you're watching this as a stream or a vod after the fact if you could leave a like and subscribe for more battlefield 2042 that would be great and yeah i think that's about it so let's get this show on the road shall we hello legends and welcome to the battlefield 2042 open beta early access is over and the game is now available for everyone to jump into starting today but before we get started this stream is brought to you by okay welcome everyone i hope that played correctly i pre-recorded that segment to keep this as smooth as possible and i think the video might have looped there so if you heard me a second time then it's all gone wrong otherwise we're good i want to keep it as professional as possible crispy streams straight to the point no rambling when it comes to the sponsored stream we're doing today uh i hope you're all doing well welcome to the stream guys we're gonna be playing with uh acolyte and stomach 64 today and the game is just going to uh open beta so everybody has access to the game so it should be good time i'm uh i'm excited because well let's be honest there's gonna be some inexperienced players it did it did repeat a second time well there you go i figured the pre-recorded idea was better than me old habit and being really messy with the things i had to cover so big brain tomo at it again um but yeah we're just gonna jump right into it i'm gonna check with the guys now and uh look you up damn spot okay then boys sweet i just right clicked and joined aculite and put me back in his game but if that doesn't work for you yeah i disconnected actually when i was changing my that setting for the ratio thing um the ratio movement which it does feel like there's less i'm gonna try uh yeah i just don't know there you go i'm gonna try and go full screen after this as well i just like having borderless so i can alt tab no i totally understand that i never hit the main menu dude i don't know it does it feels a little weird on the one hundred percent sniping though did you switch it back calculate no i'm keeping it for now maybe don't do your ads then if that feels weird but i definitely feel like the vertical sense is faster in the horizontal sense that's what it is that's what feels weird but they're both on a hundred yeah that doesn't make much sense i mean you're getting vertical mouse aim ratio i don't see conor oh did you you did zoom and you did mouse ratio i think i joined the lobby you were in and then you'd already back that up yeah you're gonna have to uh all right i'll just back out yeah i'd say no you guys just quit you should you should still be in my party yeah but did you do did you do both of them the aim sense and the the vertical aim sense in the vertical 100 yeah okay yeah chad you know the issue we were having with the sensitivity am i still in your party here maybe some pc players having the same issues but there's like a setting in the menus that is harmful i'm leaving that match now i should be in a sec i've just got that battlefield splash screen all right okay i guess i'm in your party now right yep okay let's go uh catwolf thanks for becoming a member i appreciate you and young bremer as well becoming a member too thanks for the support guys yeah so uh if you go here look options uh i think it's on the first page this is like halved it's it's by default when you launch the game it's at 50 but it should be a hundred yeah you know it may just be that i'm not used to it because i got so used to the other one i think that's the problem but it should be 100 it should be 100 by default i think i trained myself to over aim yeah and now i need to fix myself because when i went through it yeah you're exactly right tom it should be exact one-to-one ratio i was messing around with it this morning that's so stupid i checked i saw that option and i was like hang on why is that not 100 because it wasn't affecting my sensitivity as much as i thought it would be right and then i realized that it's obviously an oversight on their part uh yeah when i get in vehicles i just i don't push anything and my my guy just keeps on shooting i'm just in the passenger seat meleeing infinitely right now okay what the heck these things oh no oh yeah yeah so any pc players in the chat right now making sure you're flying circles man make sure this i went that one can be solid right like pop line of advice ratio and aim zoom ratio or a hundred percent then base your sensitivity what the top one off of that um does this thing have a shotgun oh this this uh tank this vehicle yeah yep yeah it does look at that it's sick too the little reload that the turret does mm-hmm i like it how did my stream wake you up yes kinda those are captains c2 this voice is so therapeutic thank you all that stick to it all right i'm going to help connor it's e right yeah oh man i don't have the grappling hook you fool connor well you can't choose your character as soon as you spawn in right yeah just gives you somebody random did you guys also hear about that is that what happens oh yeah because i got the freaking sentry guy oh my god when you run out of ammo it's faster to swap mag yeah yeah that's true huh switcher mag yeah but you still have to reload that that meg as well later no well yeah but say you have five shots you shoot those five shots you switch mag and there's no down time between fire and again oh hot damn yep oh hot damn i depleted all these rounds tom i changed this so the uh the the switching whatever yeah yeah i changed it to caps lock so it's easy to hit and then i changed the optic switching to scroll wheel up so i can just hit caps lock scroll wheel up to switch really quick that's good without having to adjust anything yeah the ffv is weird you're right uh by default well not by default what i've got mine set to is what would it be i'll feel the view i've got a 52 usually i'd have that cranked over here somewhere like a hundred sniping i tell ya i've got the crosshair glitch crossover glitch is very weird isn't it when you go in your settings and then come back out and it's like i hit my red cross in the middle of your screen yeah yeah yeah oh that's an enemy oh that's an enemy too i made the decision of running down this tunnel and the rule above me so you're saying it wasn't a good decision no oh my god oh hello oh i killed him with that grenade oh my god what was my latency on the server 159 took so long for the skull to pick yeah i'm at 80. you try to find a different one if you want it's all right okay i actually need to turn my scents down a little bit now i've changed that i'm 25. yeah i know a lot of people are complaining about this map i put a tweet out about it press my windows oh okay i will agree it's absolutely massive isn't it wait what is this i do understand why dice picked it because it's a great representation of like every aspect of the new game you've got vehicle gameplay it's a good uh oh my god it's a good way to experiment with a gunplay you've got all the vehicles available big enough for some good jet and heli action you've got the spectacle of the rocket which is a good like you know you've got the wow factor of that is that an enemy no uh how does my sense feel no i need to change and then you've got the tornado too right like it's big enough to where the tornado doesn't interrupt your your gameplay but i'm just waiting for a good a good infantry focus map i'll be very happy that flick shot was nasty by the way i don't think i would have heard that had my oh wait how's that tank doing so much damage to me just blew this thing up that's cool interactive environment this is apparently a mid-sized map crazy enemies out ah would have got away with it too if it wasn't a few meddling n a servers yeah i'll get in here i'll get you hello buddy go me choose me yes my guy what a lad doesn't seem like confident flying does he we'll see how this goes i'm a i'm a gunner in an attack helicopter i'm with you it's you no i'm not flying i literally can't fly wait it's impossible yeah he's landing i don't know if you can get all these people in that's cool well it's dead now that was another alley i hit the hit the pilot hit the pilot he's one reloading reloading cover me i'm reloading you just through the pilot the pilot that i hit he jumped out and got hit by his own propeller blades and died i got the assist someone got a robot yeah 600 million wait what wait what what just happened there's a gunner there i can't mark him things don't exist in this game oh oh oh that was a nice shot but for the uh what it's called this guy is below missile silo i'm hitting them look at them look at the wave of them you want some tack i've got economist he's flying upside down right now no i'm taking your kit oh forgot to see i took your kit like six times it's faster to die sometimes ow ouch charlie yeah these helies are uh totally hit me with a rocket launcher and i really hurt and it's still here will i play with jack in this game absolutely we're going to james jackson we can't take out the helix i can't fly maybe that's the issue with their team you jump later up there this guy is like jerk food crouching underneath all my shots stands up duck stands up ducks right as i'm pulling my revolver hammer backwards yeah that's like the clip that i showed you yeah yeah oh that was painful i just cried [Music] i'm out battlefield you're out of battlefield i'm out of battlefield wait two one oh my god i just entered the area on zero yeah i couldn't i couldn't hit that guy every single time i shot he moved what are you doing out of here i'm sniping a guy i i spawned in a guy's heli see the guy parachuting yeah kill i've him him twice all right kill him there we go that's easy got the assist look there's another one where oh yeah yes miss dead here next thank you again oh my god what's happening that's a that's a buzzard he's found us on the edge of the map come on man i think you're sick because your controls aren't bugged huh i'll tell you what i'm using i've got an i9 7 900 i can fix my controls which i actually regret because it's more of a workhorse cpu it's very expensive but i mean it's just not optimized for games and i have a right stone your when your teammates spawn in uh g4 when your teammates spawn in they don't have the thing over their head the founders edition not immediately what one hit i'm over flicking now i've got to re-refine my sense which is good because i've got it right now but like over flicking point blank range have a look what length of my mouse pad oh yes this is battlefield 2042 what's that it's nice oh that feels a little bit better well that's a mess oh but for some reason my sense is faster look around sense on foot is faster than with my pistol than it is with my sniper yeah so my my default sense up to uh 1.5 i think is high and then i at the like the in-between sense after that i go lower and the higher ones i have to put higher again these three things you have to adjust too many sensitivity let sliders try and snap to these helis okay that's too much of a flick what's this guy doing i can't hit him stand still so i can shoot you thank you hopefully they figure that out and just limit the amount of sensitivity sliders we get it's a lot man it's too much there is quite a few are you muted by mistake stone people are asking i'm eating sorry oh sound that's so good i figured i might as well just finish eating and playing a little less pressure honestly the game where i was trying my hardest and slaying out we lost and right now i'm not doing anything we're winning so uh i hear that that's battlefield for you come on oh okay this is a teammate he came up he's gonna snuck it behind me lower weight of the pistol yeah let me just decrease the pistol values wait that can't be right surely the more attachments you put on don't make the weapon heavier no no no this guy's literally afk and i'm stuck on the ladder damn it no ladder stairs i missed that shot connor thing that allows me to get to an elevated position so many memes going around about the uh the identical looking teams in this game pretty funny the spider-man is the most prevalent yeah there's been many times many times we shoot a teammate you have no idea what's going on this guy's doing his plus system right in front of me oh this sucks dude i'm missing shots that i would be hitting on you but 170 milliseconds on this server yeah we can find a new server after this one yeah a couple of the devs put our tweets earlier that um their servers like putting people in regions it shouldn't be which is great yeah that's what i noticed the last time we played because i was i was getting thrown into servers with 300 ping that's a dead guy yeah i want to snipe the pilot out of one of these things i don't think you can you can i forget what the vehicle is called though oh wrong would be small sure because you know it's supposed to be dull sorry swack on the scope on the revolver showing swag it on there swack it on and tap it thwack it it's funny because that in that video intro like i'd snipe so many pilots within like a minute and then barely hit one since the fate has been live yeah i know i don't know how you did it because i can't hit anything oh he keeps jumping my bullets i'll spray that's it it's the time gonna go oh good hit solid effect on target the double whammy right there oh being smart like that that roof look good shots too medic give me the heels such a long shot whoa gamers i'm going to bring out the vectors bring up the vector and storm that building you want to do that with me connor i'm sniping which building tallest the top of the tower yeah they're all at the top of it dollars yeah no but yeah all right i'm already up there i'm trying to spawn on you there we go oh what just happened it threw me off the zip yeah i there's noticed turret at the end ow for the m5a3 is that you that i spawned on off the edge uh i don't think so maybe yeah i was going up the zip so if you spawn on me probably got thrown off yeah i had to like like spawn me free falling so i had to grab the zip behind you now there should be a guy on your right so what i like to do is i jump off three quarters way up use my grappling hook the rest of the way from a different angle gaming yeah absolutely you have to have the grapple out well they don't know oh he's looking at me there's a few looking at me i can't it's an enemy or teammate i can't tell that guy was looking around because i zoomed i uh did the grapple thing that's good i like that strap it's good right yeah because everyone camps the top of it it's looking in the sky it was like this guy just like superman over me he's like wait you can't do that it was illegal oh only one kill four people lined up i almost thought i had it looks like i'm really listening time what's going on you i'm dead did you spawn into the gunfire yep does it fit i didn't see my character if it didn't tell you that i was in combat yeah i just don't care i bypassed that i was a good push because the team actually managed to uh put in some work i supposed stone has been careful activity i'm here i'm ready listen i know how to stay in a game all right i've been playing new world for the i'm last w i know how to stay in a game my guy i love it it's too real he's literally always playing it yeah i know i know i don't get off that game my hours played or just like they're probably like jesus i'm playing way less than what my hours played are you sure although i am playing it a lot let me spawn okay i wake up the spawns have changed i'm on a call i'm just sitting in new world doing nothing now actually the queues are even gone too so that's kind of nice there's a lot of blur outside oh it feels good to hit a long range snipe i do wish i know we were talking about it the other day but i do really wish that it it gave you oh my god gave you bonus points for uh for the range of your snipe like i just hit a 440 meter headshot right there oh my god i wish it would give you a 440 point bonus for it because that was nice yeah but it doesn't tell you my guy's buried it doesn't tell you the uh the distance does it the range of how far you feel no it doesn't exactly and in the past battlefield was always when you got the kill you would get bonus points based off of yeah the distance range of the if it was a headshot that was how you got the uh you would know i think it will it's what the hell is going on my screen i've got these visual glitches that people been talking about the white lines that spazz out as a if you're still in that tower there's a guy in the where the f flag would be f flag directly below you in that like gas station oh yeah i don't think i can look down that far though i'm shooting at people on top of the launch pad uh this one d1 i know we agreed we wouldn't go back on the tower but oh i'm not in that tower i'm in the foxtrot tower i respect it this is literally this is how i would play battlefield back in the day that's all i would do just sit on top of a tower and snipe true i'm glad that they they still they've got this they literally have zip lines going up here like this is the best this is amazing oh my god i need a flashlight i need a flashlight down here oh yeah yeah it's like you can't see anything down there holy that's the first time i've been in that i think i was saying that the other day i've seen i actually inside it because i've been sniping them from the roof the whole time that's about the most close quarter place on this entire map a damn corridor under the under the ground it's a dog shooting at me oh violet guy's dark i can grab a list right roskin's in this dude holy rocket launching look at it go man i like that it deafens everything it's so cool to see all the smoke go flying out of the uh bottom path there too yeah yeah when it explodes the after explosion is sick i think so epic bronze such a gigantic map and yet i only go tower yeah i'm always in the tower dude can i outsmart this guy with a vector i don't think i can where the action is you know so that's where i go oh i tagged them so much recoil have to burst fire oh okay guys the shot hp not that bad let's not put slugs on it jesus i throw slugs on the shotgun yes trust me put slugs on the shotgun no no no no spray some people down what do you mean doesn't make it you can aim oh i can't that's why i'm using a shotgun i'm sure you can aim don't judge me i'm not judging you i'm i'm busy okay i'm hyping you up dude i do want to try them out it's supposed to be like armor piercing or something right it gives range we'll check it out we'll check it out give it a little look-see i need to be smarter about my spawns here i'm just throwing myself into where the action is uh how how where are you is this you that's stone i'll see you come up and go space man i'm just watching the i'm just watching all this unfold here comes a tornado should have grappled into the rocket dude that's what i said it's got a uh graphic when you're about to spawn in spam are you trying to spawn in on me yes desperately oh okay give me give me five moments five more moments i'm seeing red.5 okay try now i'm spamming in combat i think it's because someone's on your flag i'm just gonna spawn here there's there's 12 there's 12 people here 13 15 15. all right i'm gonna come out hell i'm gonna spawn on the tower sit up there all right good luck thanks i require assistance okay i'll give you sniper overwatch behind you aculate there's two of them on you let's go under here dude i have like 50 fps here i don't know what's going on oh my god there's more behind me okay yeah maybe maybe the shogun is in the one every time i try and use a different gun like this map is just it's so sniper friendly you know what i mean i can't like count snipes i can't help but fall back to the sniper who did i just spawn on i spawned on you power shooting i'm parachuting down i had to get off the top there's too many people fighting up there man it's not it's like it is a great sniping spot but like you can do so much more work just not being in the most obvious amount i'm having to over lead 170 ping is ridiculous with these with the sleeves maybe that's why all my sniper shots seem to be hitting right now i'm on 26p that's probably it i'm having to double the amount of lead i would have done before the best that the game's felt oh my god the amount of lee you have to put on that yeah that's what i noticed when i was on higher ping like the game was not feeling that great it really it it's uh that's what that goes yeah i'm hitting bro it's nice that reg feels better maybe that's why the reg felt bad come on i gotta sit still yes got a kill let's go gamers have you guys tried the smg um i tried it once first one yeah i tried i only tried the first one because you said the vector wasn't very good right the vectors so the the thing about the damage really good yeah but you have to reload after like one or two kills max well even though even the first gun you gotta get like around i struggled to even get two kills with it so you're full auto spraying you it becomes pretty uncontrollable i've noticed yeah but you just need to know like you figure out how many bullets is required to kill with a vector dude sniping feels so good what but yeah do you like it then accurate or no smg yeah that's good definitely more guys i didn't like it i don't know i just i felt like i was it wasn't as uh the map was too big for an smg definitely yeah you have to either be on this it depends where you play though on the roof or in that one corridor that was in the dark one do you think there's gonna be ui for going for the res on people too like you can't really tell when it's almost done or anything damn i clearly press space yeah i i don't think they've flushed everything out i honestly think this is pretty early yeah you think they're gonna have that like they don't yeah they don't even have the difference between jet and heli controls right like there's no way yeah that they gotta fix that right like that there's no way that's gonna be that's the change i just don't believe that dude the uh the tornado didn't even like come into the map it was just something we watch see i just gotta not play and then we win yeah that's the secret eat a nice sandwich you know relax a little bit what you playing oh you play i thought you have someone to do that for you usually that's it that's that's all we get usually yeah usually i mean sometimes i play mostly i just eat you know yeah hey i'm all about that i like that kickback play some new world you know yeah hell yeah he's got his display duplicate and someone sat underneath his desk he's actually playing pokemon go right now he's walking around he's going he's got multiple games on the go he just pre-records his face cam exactly i just talk for talking to the camera for a long time and then boom shipping this isn't even live nobody else is playing it yeah no this is you guys are talking to a recording right now clip it and ship it wait how do you answer this then i just i i don't know just got it going it works i just say generic things and then uh you know it works had a great sandwich today did you what'd you have on it it was a really tasty sandwich did someone eat it for you they're the same guys that eat and game for you yeah it's an ai it's a machine learning map yeah yeah it makes sense that's good haven't you heard of machine learning yet how can you pre-record something if it's machine learning no no so i got i got the ai like i talked a whole bunch and then uh the ai now just talks for me so it's kind of like it's not necessarily that's pretty reported the ai just does all of it oh yeah i'll try that i will try that the dmr with an acog good show man then i don't have to do anything i just let the ai do all of it it knows what i would say and do honestly my game crashed people asking how i feel about the game like i think most of the issues i'm having are all server side ping ruins the game for me there's like player models that i kill will like stand still or glitch out but i haven't had half the problems that i think a lot of console players are having more than pc um i i do think it's tough man i think they need to dial back on the the modern warfare-esque it's good that they've modernized the battlefield game i like the mechanics of being added but they just need to like tone it down a bit the slide mechanic is what i'm mostly thinking about here and the tactical sprint i don't think needs to be in the game you get a slight bit of movement but i think since you can literally do this if you didn't know um you go to options on foot and then always use traversal sprint you just press that on it's off by default you can just run around with that on all the time and it doesn't it doesn't expire like it does in modern warfare you just have it but constantly in the tactical sprint mode i'm really fast and watch my reddit my ready time that's how quickly i can read my weapon after it then we compare that to the default run speed oh look it's exactly the same tactical sprint ready ready normal sprint ready like this should be twice the length of that oh my god i'm not kill that guy that's about armor but the fact i can just press on and have unlimited tactical sprint go faster than the default why wouldn't you just have that that's why i don't understand there's no default value for sprinting around but yeah i genuinely think with this build being as old as it is like i explained in the last stream they have to have uh it's it's all server problems for me at the moment but the devs have to have an in well they have an internal build of the game that they're playing on which is very different to the one that we're playing on right now and a lot of the bugs that we are complaining about have already been fixed and confirmed by developers and they're like tweeting about it but you know it's uh it's just the way it is with these betas they're just like an early preview and yet it's not accurate of what the game is like and that is my like why would you give this to players as the first experience but it's all just to generate hype for the game and if anything people are talking about it right all press is good press and uh after battlefield 4's initial launch the disaster that was and the turn around how good the game was by the end of its life cycle i think uh the community has a big role to play in terms of shaping the game and the battlefield 21 for 2042 experience we all want so yeah we just gotta be patient gotta be patient and again like i said like this this this map we're on right now is not a good for infantry players you're not going to get a good first impression on this but i understand why this is the map we've been given because it's a great it's a great way to just show off every single type of gameplay element and that rocket is a big spectacle like they remember uh what's our situation siege of shanghai by the skyscraper falling that is this game's equivalent at least that's the one they want to show off and it has a couple of different instances with it exploding or launching it's just something for people to talk about so i don't know where i'm being shot from there i have hope at least there's definitely problems but i can see past a lot of them on my end but i understand that some people are having much worse experiences than me he's what it is i think it's dead yeah i was just testing the gun for the overheat oh my god a lot of the gun the weapon tree too like i feel like it needs a little bit more ui on the heads-up display yeah supposed to be ten specialists i'm just on tanks in general you mean i really want to try out some of the other ones i noticed the same thing in the uh helicopter as well but like the tank secondary gun it'd be nice if there was something showing me when it was overheating it shows me in the bottom right corner but it doesn't show me on the actual tank hud which would be nice if you did okay i just said everything yep i said everything i don't know i've got out of the way now maybe i'm too uh i'm demanding too much so now i don't need to answer the the how do you feel about the beta a million times about the stream because they have it for something like the main cannon i see the reload timer he's trying to see for you maybe oh yeah you're right you started me you definitely killed him i didn't realize you were the one in the tank yeah i'm driving it oh it's brilliant yeah i hope they buff the bullet velocity for the snipers i wanted to try mostly i'm used to it now but it's inconsistent like my ping wasn't as bad as it is a lot more happy i'm getting obliterated though there is no guy in the tower where's that chopper gun yeah the g17 has burst fire doesn't it it's pretty weird you control the game with you can't control the game with arrow keys yeah that's so strange i go to meet my mic and i just look down it's a teammate everyone looks the same it's a nightmare that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying they look the same like that too much oh i feel so bad for this guy trying to use the revolver four shots i mean i was standing still it was bad yeah we've been there we have we have been there who is sniping me i don't have a lot of audio that's that's a problem for me right now like the heli audio isn't playing correctly really yeah it's just like almost got that guy oh my goodness i thought my pistol reload be faster than that c5 can i not select that with this class we need to secure more sectors mckay not get c5 uh it's a gadget right oh he does he does i think his name does it so what v am i using i'm using 52 why is your voice why is your voice so luscious and nice asmr sub channel soon wait hello my rocket launcher anymore i don't even know what my accent is anymore like i had i had an accent when i was younger my family's all from wolverhampton but i'd say i have a more clean british accent now it's two guys on point why is there a tank on our roof the tank look at the boy where they won't come oh that was painful called in the tank on top huh there's two guys just spawning on each other at the bottom of the rocket if anyone's there [Music] 224 milliseconds yep that explains a lot i'm playing a different game each lobby we get into i'm gonna have to put like an lmg on or something i forget a server that makes sense i don't know why i put us into another 80 ping server so i'm hosting right yeah oh i see the tank on the roof look at him he's like mounted with the turret that guy yeah you can't hit this guy oh my god that was great yeah all the vehicles die from the side get wrecked idiot jesus he rammed me off the edge yeah he pushed him off the edge i was the only one who wasn't sniping up there that's probably why he was like just get off of you get out of here you don't belong get down there and do some work yeah if you're not sniping get off the roof yeah there's a guy on the roof got him i'll raise you already i want to change i want to change july [Music] oh i keep on redeploying so that i can change my thing and i keep forgetting every time i die i'm not getting the revolver that i keep selecting which is annoying just like oh yeah a new pistol huh the role was great sony i haven't used it i'm gonna try no i haven't tried it yet amazing i always really like the revolver in battlefield but it's tough whichever one is very tough shooter how's the reload on it though it's pretty pretty nice pretty good yeah that is nice that is really nice actually it's got a nice little reload animation somebody mentioned this in my chat i thought it was a great point i kind of wish that the guns had the optic had to meld dots on it for the snipe yeah yeah those would be good like i feel like that that would be amazing if they did that yeah i don't remember if the other snipers had it i have seen some more of that cheater gameplay since oh good you've seen more cheaters in it well i've seen footage now like obviously this as a screenshot yeah that isn't me that's not an enemy the tiniest blue dot above his head christ i'll spawn in there again oh it's kind of that's kind of cool you can save your um own packages you can do loadouts what so if you if you click the next to the specialist if you do loadout there's like pre-made assault package medic package whatever that's about to redeploy to see that and then you can you can change what it is and then click it and it'll save it nice dude i think at least that's what it seems to change my medic one my god i just reflected on the medic the nastiest flick shot with this snipe i want to see that from his perspective it only looks like a flick shot on your end maybe yeah look i select the revolver but it auto changes why is it doing that didn't have that before okay that's a bug he's looking the revolver and then it like refreshes the loadout and changes back to the g57 the heck might be a penguisher again but yeah just wanna try changing your character i don't know if that'll help but does not help that's a weird one where are these guys does the recon drone replace the c4 it's on the recon deed uh no i think you can do it you can do both yeah because c4 is a gadget right here i'll heal you tom counts as like a star mobile or something it'll work yeah benji didn't even give me any points running left of the oh he's there oh my god another one hit him twice got him nice picking up your lmg right now it's not going bro i need help oh my god dude i'm getting annihilated i know where i've just redeployed figured you would have died because you're right on me but no you're just sorry i got you shake on you you got mini guns [Music] very bad very bad bad idea wait that thing has guns on it yeah you can't use that when you're filing it oh it's got gunners either side okay uh they're trying to take trying to take f1 i can't spawn in it because okay honestly that tower i'm not going up there right now yeah it's too rough so all right i'll go up there thank you you go solo at acolyte i don't want to go up there sneak up are there um oh he definitely saw me are there power weapons hidden around the map at all like that i know of no wow i didn't even think about that because they've had that in battlefield i'd like the bar of 50 cal and stuff before aren't they yeah um this tank can just leave me alone that was how you got like the flamethrower kit in battlefield one two and like you know yeah yeah they usually have or i mean even in battlefield four they had stuff laying around the map hot flame dork it was insane yeah oh my god you're an actual tank because there was like a little in battlefield 4 there was like a little drone that you could drive around on the ground blow people up with rockets fbs doesn't feel as good today connor no i've been getting like some serious stutters too like even in the recordings it'll say encoding overloaded yeah it's weird i don't know it's our heli no that's not a really one's got to turn around oh this guy's down here was in the tank how am i supposed to take that thing out let's dog shoot me from over there but i think i think i'm gonna die here but yeah we'll do it anyways so the zigzags on point this dude jesus look at him how's that here they've taken bravo sector i'm gonna go so many of them now yeah i'm even feeling the ping on my end too yeah on want some long-range snipes now we can go to tower because they have it he scared me dude hi tom hey bud i'm gonna try and capture the objective below this guy's where your tank was on the ramp before oh you know where that is i do know you see him to the left of the ramp at the base of it i'm literally just kicking dust up so you can't see am i on 170 so i need to yeah we'll find another server we'll keep joining until we find something yeah okay i'm gonna try to cut the ball there's a ton of people below us oh yeah i see that and they're trying to snipe me out the sky you good i'm chilling here come on over i'll heal you please do i see him on the hill there's a box there's the body spots over scenes hey well come on tom do you have ammo bunny chance uh now i switched the armor in which case yikes i just killed one there good stuff he might be able to get his gun or something i don't know yeah okay oh on the back hill which pacquiao um eastern oh it's a dog yeah i killed the guy next to it all right ammo please oh really yeah i'll see if i can take it out here i'll switch the armor piercing it's not giving me okay i guess i already took it i don't think i destroyed it but i think it might be dead open never mind full health i'm doing any damage i can't shoot it yeah i'm doing like a terminator dog is the terminator well it's kind of over there out of the way anyways so let's just let it be okay where'd it go despawn eventually i don't know yeah it will it'll blow up the objective guys well done i spawn on you after his already capped hell yeah well done hey do you have ammo accolade yeah just dropped it right there my freaking man of course i always try to like as much as i can yeah that's good i'm using the armor too so that refills my armor oh i've got um preview on my obs go away can't get that out of here we don't want no preview hey my doggo oh let's race acolyte you want to try it yeah oh shoot nevermind run hold on let me just kill that guy real quick all right actually he's calling a vehicle that's right he's oh shoot how you like don't shoot don't shoot don't shoot stay calm no i'm already throwing two frags all right i'm throwing forward i went too far give me a refill oh that took off that was a great thing a quarter of its hp it's less on it i'm going ap rounds what are you shooting at the tank that we marked it's coming to you coming to you okay that was sick dude frank's destroyed those things that was did you throw your ammo down yeah i did in that bush he's out of it yeah yeah it blew up i don't know i didn't get the kill but it's my dog shooting uh what if the dogs prioritize ai a little bit you know did i take damage or does oh i must have taken damage i guess i wish the cycle gave me a little bit more zoom maybe yeah right it doesn't feel like it zooms very much oh maybe that's why maybe f will be affected nice aculate i didn't even kill that guy i don't know who killed him hey i'll take it just died this is this is sounds like a dentist oh i do like playing affected fov though so you don't want to turn it off he knows you see this guy on top of the tower of b nah it's like actual tower on b this guy closes killed me oh you got me too how is that not connecting that's so weird the dog goes freaking out tell you that much there we go found the sniper okay let's just shut my arm or something how does the beta last it'll end between the 9th and the 10th i believe it says the 9th technically but it's going to be the 10th for some people so i imagine like maybe midnight for na if i were to guess yeah i'm uh i'm i'm really intrigued to see what the final bill of the game is like something tells me that the devs were pushed to just show a version of the game and because when they build a version of the of the game itself for beta it's like making a second game they've got to prepare it for global release right so they're focused on one map they've had like when we played it early the game felt great it felt so good and since it's been live it hasn't felt as good and that's because we we were like given privilege of those servers right and now that everyone and their mum is playing it i'm having so many server issues so i i was having second thoughts after i i played it when it went to beta because in my videos i was praising the game so highly it felt so great and you can tell from the gameplay i felt so connected and i haven't since then but i know there is a better version of this game the devs just sounded so confident and they're testing it internally and like i said all the bugs we're seeing they can be fixed so easily this is this is dice they've had problems with major bugs but things like you know bodies freaking out visual glitches all that stuff will be fixed in the main game just hoping it's more optimized my fps has definitely taken a hit since uh it went into beta that's why i'm questioning whether or not we're actually playing on a different build to the one that we played early it's this map more than anything for me i love the look of the map it looks great but it only really showcases a few different like it there's a lot to you know you can choose the the smg's and stuff but it shows a few different gameplay options like sniping is the main thing i love sniping in game so i'm not complaining but like i'm limited to one sniper with what 600 millisecond bullet velocity i have to lead massively because i'm on 200 ping it's tough dude whoa oh i'm not gonna last i'm dead mate both games weren't great start yeah i mean like a look at bf4 start to end there's no excuse regardless like not to say oh it's fine if the game releases in this state because they'll fix it in time like some people just want the patience there's other games they can be playing what we have is a good taster and it is fun it's just uh it's a bad version of the game to showcase for the first time definitely the delay though i think we can all agree on that an extra month hopefully they're polished most of the things that people are complaining about fps doesn't feel as good for me today that's for sure i'll find the background music i've preferred it in previous games yeah it's too repetitive the end game music are we looking up there tom um okay i'm i'm gaming playing the game i'm trying to i'm trying to figure out bullet lossy hasn't really been working working for me every time i feel like i learn it i just i don't learn it [Applause] it's like between 170 and 200 so like it changes for me it's like i'm using different snipers each time and i have to figure out which version i have when there's only one in the game assist there yeah my sense is so short since that since that uh initial slider was so broken you think it's worse now it's just i'll have to get used to it again yeah i would agree with that too i'm a headshot pilot a guy up here with me wait am i alive bro i'm alive i raised you high stone oh my gosh i think the audience is so dark that i thought i was dead still i think the audio needs a lot of work in this i was just standing here doing nothing compared to games like bf1 the audio in this is close to vanguard which is ass vehicle wasn't great yeah i mean most games are better than vanguard but like we need 25 kills that's it audio just isn't consistent in this game so far the first day maybe i just got lucky right off the bat but i heard somebody sneaking up on me so i flicked and got him and i was like oh man audio's great but that's the only time it's ever happened when nothing's going on you can tell if there's somebody near you but just playing running we need to work together next game yeah and i was out in the open completely like in a field next game i'm gonna snipe can we try some squad play in the next match we're just doing our own thing we get a decent server for you yeah that'll be nice [Music] wow that was a close game five tickets in it i should have paid attention jesus literally could have won that maybe i would have actually had an impact at that game but see that's what i get this time i wasn't eating i should have got myself another sandwich we would have won he said this is the biggest powerful yet to come should we believe them and give them our money maybe the issue was i was eating this time the amount of game developers that say it's bigger and better than ever before our biggest open world yet ubisoft love that one um there's no arguing that this battlefield is bigger and better right it is designed for next-gen consoles though and i feel bad for anyone that i don't know what the experience is like on ps4 i don't know how cleanly the game runs but yeah just a reminder this uh this stream is sponsored by nvidia and scan and um you can check out the link in the description to view scans right if if you're in the uk view scans range of uh 360 hertz pc gaming monitors and um if i scroll down a bit a video low latency is in the game i recommend if you're playing on pc you turn this on definitely not just because it is sponsored but i use this in pretty much any game it has available reduces the um latency of your system there's a lot of evidence that proves how effective it is the technology is actually pretty impressive and it'll have dlss on launch which it doesn't have currently which obviously improves performance which would be great but you still keep the visual fideli hashtag it's hashtag ad but it's all facts i don't i don't accept many sponsorships anymore but i like working with nvidia nvidia because like everything that i talk about it's already baked it's like baked into the game you know it's like things i actually use i'm not just promoting a product that i don't believe in even ps5 or some issues at the minute can't imagine last gen yeah i mean that's the thing i'm hearing some people having a really great experience on ps5 i think xbox is not as smooth do we get tanks so early man and i have this game on an ssd why not why am i not getting that option sooner uh what should we try chat what should we try i haven't really used the m5 i'm gonna choose recon wait oh yeah it's a gadget so recon frag c5 no motion ball can i select a pistol now yes that saves good all right let's try casper out no grapple hook but um i'll stone and connor in that tank more picky with sponsors than you with food georgie let's steal your series can i see you let's steal your seat you can have it back somebody else got in oh yikes let's just go cap some objectives here i'll give you some permanent ammo there we go i can go drive towards the water and maybe one of these guys will get out this is how you do it now we got three guns on here are you just holding on i'm just prone thanks for stopping look at him go this is cool they actually have a flat bed that you can stand in on this vehicle you can never like stand on vehicles very long battlefield now oh i'm a bit it's a bit shaky but it's keeping me in probably you're getting the left and right glitch probably my latency again yeah side to side okay now i'm out because they crashed i mean it works all right moving in quick on foxtrot if you want to try and take the hill here and approach aculate you can copy that comment i think i might go up that good luck it's show time you guys use the m5 much yeah i like that one yeah i don't know if i'm too basic but that's really good okay the guy in the tower oh hot damn oh hot damn this is my jail anyhow just someone have a dog already yeah i got a dog out he's dead oh my god the top fire you're bringing in your own dog huh yeah puppy this guy's all right we back capped him on fox trout secured not evading shots whatsoever roger that objective there's one still on it but i'm gonna assume that they take care of them oh no more coming yeah i might put that thing on single fire dude the m55 medium single fire holy crap it's like better than the dmr really yeah dude i don't know about that yes is it better like i was trying to burst fire it and i didn't really like it because because the damage is better with the yeah that's what i mean because if you wait for the shot because the damage is better with a dmr like effectively obviously it's better but just you can just spam it how do i change what are these guys pushing where do i need to assist that's v where do you need tank support we have all the objectives we have every objective dude system one let's go stone we back capped them and we we've we're winning we're weakening our points right now how do i enter drone left click oh if you mark some people for me that's it i will blow them to kingdom come my good sir my goods are doing this wrong i guess some people were saying that their keybinds for the drone were not half the working i missed dude wait half the resources have been expended we have what that's what i'm saying we're full capped on immaculite they are getting a dumpster fired oh ouch wow they're all coming up the tower right now the zip from their spawn from their spawn uh i need a repair on my tank though here's where i should be sniping the heck one time i swap off of sniping oh i did a bit of damage to it there if only i had my repair tool dude whoa i wish you could just spawn with it uh if you guys just die you can spawn on me okay okay well i'm dead oh you're acting is that you falling yeah that's probably me nice dude sick bro sick dude hey story i like to die inside yeah youtube streams we're shutting these guys out right now kind of folks we're winning this entire game this is gonna be the fastest game of battlefield in battlefield history see guys all we need to do is teamwork oh you're right stone that toggle site is really inconsistent remember you say i mean like you spawn one time and you can switch scope from top to bottom yeah yeah it's all uh it's all broken it's rng yeah everything's just rng in this game weapons find me some enemies to kill find me some enemies to kill if you get a team that is like locked in and actually playing utilizing all the vehicles it's pretty hard for the enemy i can just trap myself in here i'm contesting uh foxtrot what okay that is so good that was a little bit bug okay there it is oh world breakfast victory ever six kids record some eight minutes game sub eight minutes let's go boys we're playing call of duty now folks oh he does have it it's actually a call of duty match will the emp disable my c4 though my c5 will it do that otherwise that sounds like pretty good pretty good idea i emp the vehicle then then quickly switch out bring up my c4 again trigger it it's game over i like that that was a quick game very fast very nice did you know you can open the container doors for the like the containers i did know that yeah and then bust through them you can hide inside them buster rhymes yeah that's the fastest round that i've played so far like the team enemy team didn't try and contest us i saw a couple guys walking up the hill swapping their attachments on their gun for like a solid 10 seconds the third person the third person plus system is so comical when you're watching someone customize their gun yeah i love it i don't even really noticed it yet it's so fun it looks like they're just like doing weapon inspector modern warfare but like the upper torso animation is so stationary oh yeah it's very stagnant static i wonder what it looks like remember like the uh the modern warfare 2 games where you looked up in the sky and your character would like his legs would be perfectly straight but you're from the waist point your character would be bending like a like a right angle almost and you'd run around with your kimbo model 1887s looking at the sky and it just looked the dirtiest thing ever can't relate boys nice yeah [Laughter] [Music] classic off the time stones like oh what did i have on my sandwich chat oh yeah yeah a bit of ham you know and i'm like talking and there's just no answer justice for tomorrow i say i need some more g fuel man kotomo good timer oh wow you actually said it didn't try and compete i'm not used to this well you know it's not a westie you're always like where'd you start this debacle on twitter or something [Laughter] i've had an idea for my next one i'm gonna like photoshop uh g-fuel over three bowls of porridge in a goldilocks animation oh this one tastes too salty that'll be studs this one tastes too chill [Laughter] just right go tomorrow that's classic i just spawn into man oh what's this i've got i was the turret i chose boris we've secured sector charlie i definitely did not choose this class but i am playing it now i'm gonna plonk that it's two guys down in front of you yup they killed my ass oh god hello oh my goodness yes hold three to selfie when i'm dead okay turret it's teammate yeah they need to have unique colors for the different operators to get on the roof yeah get them like half mckay but change his outfit you know have a russian outfit have a us outfit yeah i don't think you can no i don't think you can i was talking about that earlier i couldn't get it didn't seem like it went through at least the fence thing yeah i'm pretty sure i shot through something the chain-link fence by the water i don't think that that one at least found out you can just punch them with your fists and they break oh that's cool yeah yeah melee melee's always broken fences and he hasn't always didn't didn't in the last game i don't think only battlefield 4. three i remember it did that company too it did battlefield before i know i'm pretty sure you could do it oh man what's my idiot sense there it is it's just too many sensitivity sliders in this game dude it's just not organized very well yeah all the ui and menus are kind of weird even like the um tab to look at the leaderboard you guys like this no i don't i don't like this way it doesn't display enemy team yeah bring it up and i just don't even focus on it at all it gives you no information like i mean it gives you your squad i guess that's kind of cool but what oh my turret is owning someone on a1 they're recording a vehicle i'm going back got an assist on a1 okay is it oz it's us before you can knife fences yeah yeah what game couldn't in recent memory it was one or five then maybe five i don't really remember five all that much to be fair though i don't even remember melee fences ever so i don't know like i got a rocket launcher on my side i just walk right through them i'm so jacked this this hit marker crosshair thing gets really frustrating it goes away as soon as you get a kill yeah let's be real it's time whoa dude he's back in the conversation love that just i mean i'm just saying that tom's probably gonna die before he gets a kill and it's going to reset anyway the first time dude you know what i'm really glad that you elaborated on that it wasn't me i am playing i am playing running simulator right now dude like i'm just saying yeah you said it we heard it i'm glad you said it we heard you say it it's a guy on the minimap here wait can you get behind this no way i'm running running that should be the theme tune for this game i'm running running and running running and running running are you up here tom yeah yeah you is it was enemies before there was enemies one next to you i'm underneath oh oh he's got a dog oh and i'm being sure yeah the hell he's also been brutally okay the scope on the pistol is kind of the revolver is kind of nasty actually that's good yeah right now it's the good or nasty bad good pretty nice yeah there's not much drop on that how are these shots not connecting man wait now i'm pinging people hold on two hundred dollars i just think it's annoying bro i'm pinging people now my little mouse is ping it's working if 240 ping i got oh my god 200. hey we're connected today something then because i'm still 130 can we please just leave yes we can leave i haven't had a server below 150 ping yet this entire time the last one was maybe it was good minutes long it was good for me maybe the match was seven minutes long it wasn't good we're backing out then yeah let's back up i can't play like this lads no yes and that server pinging was working though i was using my ping button and the red dots were appearing over enemies the ping was working if you double ping it'll work sometimes no not the double ping i know what you're talking about like if you double ping it puts a red indicator down if you single ping the ground a yellow ping will go down but this was me hitting the pin or maybe maybe it was somebody on a drone that was that was marking them but it looked to me like i clicked it and a red dot appeared a proper ping are you guys at the main menu yeah yeah okay well battlefield 2042 i've got the splash screen i don't know if that technically counts uh i think i'm in i yes i am okay you sure check it again here we go it's going in standby i'm just talking about here my game crashed all right good because this is a bad server anyways we're back back out it's all server issues for us like it's fine it's fine it's not fine oh everything just pretend that i have a different sniper when the bullet velocity changes each game that i play it's like that meme or uh the guy's sitting in the room and it's on fire and he's like everything's fine yeah yeah as everything's burning down around us i think most of the um the visual stuff is server-side anyway right like body's not despawning standing still when they've been killed parachutes above players it's all server-side which uh apparently they've fixed but it just it it does make the game look a bit messy yeah yeah i don't think about a server today below 150 ping which is shame yeah it's unlucky what happens when you just get like hundreds of thousands of players trying to try the game for the first time we're still in your lobby corner yeah you are i'm just waiting for you it's done i'm joining get over here just connecting the services oh everything went black they fixed some of the issues in the beta was it still just as bad they're not going to fix anything for the beta black falcon like whilst it's live unless it was a massive issue like obvious obviously the server problems in terms of ping and stuff and keeping them live they've unknown error being on top of i sent me another invite we're in one okay i'm 24. we're back on the west coast tom have you moved to youtube you want to find a different one youtube's always been home man uh you just want to play i just want to play this okay it's not over 200 no so i don't need to do that redeploy thing again because i don't have a weapon in my hands i'm going to get a i'm going to get a sick sniper gameplay with more of this revolver bro that thing was nutty right here 50 bomb occupied only place i've heard people say nice things yeah look man i did i have second thoughts after if you watched my first beta video like this isn't this this doesn't feel like the same experience that we played early and that is because of the server issues like i can't express how clean that game felt when we played early but that's because if you think how many content creators there really were in that test we had that we had those servers all to ourselves and now with all these people queuing into the game for the first time the servers are ass so uh it is affecting my experience i mean you can tell from the gameplay you can you can tell when someone's enjoying themselves and i think in that video you can i haven't it doesn't sound like i've enjoyed a game that much in forever i had a lot of comments about that you could tell that i loved it and uh it's a shame that this experience isn't why it like people aren't seeing the game for the first time the way i did which is unfortunate and i just hope that they fix these server issues and clean up the obvious bugs and when the game is fully released you guys get to play an actual good experience because there's a lot of bugs at the moment it's hard to sell it based on this i'd say but it shows there's promise what they have fundamentally the mechanics are in place for a fantastic experience you just gotta remember that the the battlefield beta was a million about your forebear was a million times worse than this one oh that's any excuse but at least we're playing you know and i can't talk on the netcode because i haven't had a normal server yet or may and now 158 in the top right if you've been looking for the ping i gotta jump out huh i don't know we'll see have patience it's tough i know fundamentally though like it's an enjoyable experience i've had more fun than i have bad times but like yeah this is probably my worst experience yet in terms of server issues i have to try and lead these targets by so much yes predicted that one perfectly a long range sniping what's shooting me and who shoot me where from there correct anyone on that roof huh hey glenn glenn b is that correct thank you for the five pounds man i appreciate it can i make you say uh no you can't you can't pay me to say stuff i appreciate the donut though man if i if i said yes to everything then about shout outs people would have gotten by now i do appreciate the support dude had to reset it i just think that might be quite offensive bugs will not win don't let them win accolade the bugs will not take us he's putting the recon again i want to try and uh hang on helly snipe yeah ellie snipey that's what i'm talking about hit him with it hit oh i thought i killed him oh thank goodness teammate you just saved my life i love you wasn't a panic revolver battle with somebody what the hell inflatable piece thanks for the 4.99 yeah that's funny this guy's just pulling my walls down listen thanks for the photo both just running around jumping another message i won't be reading that sniper whatever oh my god that guy just got popped i was kind of the bobbidim that was me i think he spawned behind oh there's the helicopter oh yeah he one shot me where's this guy there i didn't even get a chance to shoot oh my gosh that's estimated inside hanger delta one yeah why would he repeat in this beta how dare dude i want to just get out of here they're pressuring delta one too hard right now i gotta get play range go star and dang it and try and get some distance oh my god that guy got operated this guy's using the tank just up on the hill there's two tanks way up there can someone call it a precision if only oh ow what was that noise vehicles uh on that hill oh ho ho ho did that guy oh dude i got my lobby it's mine there's a guy oh my god it's right on my jeep it could be further from being mine i don't own it one landed on delta one roof yeah i'm gonna try and uh do the thing help get some of these tanks out uh what's c4 on the the drone yeah yeah yeah how can i tank behind delta one there oh that's just a jeep i got a good shot acolyte hell yeah i thought that was a thank you you have to find like a weird angle to shoot the the gunner out yeah he's kind of like at the center of the truck huh thanks for watching greg i appreciate it so you can snipe them out from the center all right where are we going you want to push the top i got a sniper so i'm not really built for that guys in front over there oh yeah hit chris ed nice wait were you shooting i didn't hear your shots are you kidding me i'm not even surprised why the game wait what he's shooting a nerf gun you know ammo refill refills the sniper uh or i mean excuse me refills the gun the stem gun oh i hit that guy parachuting let's see get him maybe we should just sit down here check the objectives i mean it's pretty good so far but i don't think we're going to win oh by me at the time guys you know i got one behind the dumpster there right on me yeah i'm dead not too bad of a run there we're actually doing pretty good objectives charlie one with tom yeah i'm gonna spawn on tom all right i need hail there's an armored vehicle there i think anyone's in there though they're behind it one's dead there's a tank behind us oh good lord i'm going to sit in a bush here oh the tank sees me ate it need it nate dude i don't know if i can get an angle if i spawn it moving left a little bit oh i got it nice stone the nade worked yes do decent damage your uh your pistol can go burst burst fire if you didn't know what i did not know the glock on the glock the glock oh no i'm using the revolver oh no wait a minute i was like this is just like rapid fire you know how that gun works right there's just you can use it as a shotgun at the same time imagine how fast the revolving system would have to move in order for it to be a burst the polar hammer mccree style yeah this feels great i actually like the forex on the sniper better the optic is kind of janky but it's a little weird for some of these like close mid-range fights it's a lot better yeah i think the slide in this guy at the rocks where we were with the tank okay yeah i see him there he goes yeah he's dead i used that i think the slide in this game should be halved at the distance wise all right let's go get d throw down an ammo and see if it gives me an extra frag it does yeah it will so i checked the two frags and then i chucked down the ammo thing and you can pretty much blow up tanks quickly yeah that was awesome oh wow those tongue's still there guys you also don't lose momentum for jumping so if you're getting shot out it seems like that might be the best thing to do rather than slide yeah i don't know if that should be nerfed or if they just should just increase the ball velocity because trying to snipe when people have this type of movement is insane yeah it's very and like they can you can move back and forth very quickly too yeah see pinging doesn't work anymore now it's not pinging him maybe he's leaning ping something oh maybe you got a lead but i'm talking about like pinging enemies like i i swear i pinged these guys and they there was red dots over their head i couldn't believe it it's kind of like yeah i don't know it might have yeah i don't think so either that's what i was surprised and maybe somebody was using a drone at the exact same time i was trying to mark them though pretty good at playing the objective here uh this is a death crossing this is nev we're never going to cross this if i need to cross on my drone you think yeah oh god parachuting up ahead oh come on where just up ahead towards the missile silos he's uh and the bush is running right come on drones he's he just took a zip line at the bottom of the tower the right scaffolding tower oh yeah that's as him he's going up okay what's my amp lock did he go to the top yeah he's going up oh that was a shot he's zipping oh that was another shot you shoot in shots guy got him nice shot there it is so i'm talking about teamwork all right let's cross cross over here people never see the range of this thing is insane there's a connection no no no no oh my god dude i try take care let's find that thing around for so long your gun down see that guy oh d2 guys d2 loads of guys to your left oh i see him i see him there's two of them sniper yeah i hit the right one once left one's looks like he's dead come on gang this guy down in the valley to your left here i'm gonna frag in it they're both dead hit hit hit hit hit oh i must hit the vehicle yeah 160. ammo is down i don't mind this yeah the frags are super good with this and just the constant ammo supply the frags are yeah i think the strongest they've ever been looks like we control it we're late to the party we're very late there's somebody here though man this building is just it's getting so destroyed is there a range yeah i imagine there was a revolution like a tank on this i think that's where they made it ammo down on me as well ouch sniper on the hill where we were sniping around earlier oh they missed like moves there's a lot going on yeah i don't know where you are there's like a dj i get sniped like a dji mavic mavic drawer on this let's get up on the crates there yeah and the storm coming in makes it screens getting wet did you shoot me i'm with you huh why come on to the right oh our team's coming in though they might they might wipe them with us here tom what happened to me is your football glitch oh no what happened this guy was going for the save on me i spent so long preparing my drone and then it just exploded or something oh you got shot what it must have been shot by someone i'm coming no i'll bury you i'm back all right dude i could have already respawned so many times rather than just wait i know that's why i just don't even bother yeah the other thing is the waste wastes resources right so that's exactly yeah it's not good for the team to do it come on dude behind back again yeah i still played a battlefield game before he's just he's pretty close he's just on the other edge of this thing how did that miss the russians it's kind of weird it says like wait i trade my guns oh come on find another gun here come come here it's fine i can't use this oh there's a sniper actually wait here we go i have a sniper or a dmr oh there's a guy there nice what the heck i'm coming back towards you aculate i'm seeing a tornado in a while i'm flying this game is relatively close right now come on guys hold on i'm gonna hit on a you playing my own game boys did you go up i'm coming up yeah i'm going up what's your average ping corner uh generally get about 85. okay you're good stone no one's camping oh yeah i like the sound of that yeah there are guys around here i'm over the low oh no i can't i picked up a gun off the ground and i can't customize it now the t-system isn't working really or maybe it's oh there we go i i think it might have been because i took the zip it's a little blur around this scope kidding me yeah when you with like the forex is it tom yeah on the uh yeah it's the same thing with the dmr too like the depth of field around it is just so aggressive oh jesus oh my god oh no i could raise you i could have written it yeah i'm trying to predict the pings i'm not just trying to i'm jumping mommy's body's gone it's just gone like there's a guy up here with this i jump down i'm not up i'm taking the zip back up though yeah roger that you with me tom yeah i'm right behind you battlefield 2042 it just works good luck teammate there's a guy coming up the staircase i think well let's frag it then i was there for a moment i don't know if he's still there or not i saw a parachute so it's kind of a dead giveaway i know right like the parachute just floats over him come on just want another heli snipe dude just give it to me i'm craving it i'm hungry he wants it i want it hey i'm out here for you you want a frag it's helis man holy i know you have to be so precise as to where you want to put deploy the drone it's crazy what's the guy that's going to promise no my drone oh my god oh my god oh my god i'm revive stick with me boys legend of the stone oh my boy i saw a little revive timer that time when i was raising you that was the first time i've seen that yeah so it's over the actual dead character it's not on your screen which i don't like no i i was the person i've even seen it what happened is that my drone oh down over there 400 meters i did a live tag on it roger that i see visual all right we got the lead i'm so confused are we shooting at the same guy i don't even see it right there this prep time takes so long oh my god oh yes then i get in the drone and then die immediately nice i like that we should swap sideshares don't yeah where'd he go come on buzzards oh there's a guy i know next time on the roof guys the helipad helipad yeah oh i don't have a cool zipline acolyte he's dead nice uh a little bird honest though yeah i'm just gonna no scope them nice do it for the concrete is under attack for the content can't damn it i'm desperately trying to i think more of them landed up here uh little bird find you i need you guys to protect me okay i mean we're traded we treated i straight nice straight i'm coming grandma stone running back over to me got you bro as long as we play split and one of us gets the trade-offs i know the parachute is serious this is so long i hit him i'm dead he jumped back down he's coming back upstairs now upstairs you're nuts i picked up your gun hold on i will do this stay with me oh it's teammate oh my god it didn't show up i would cry there's a floating dog no come on tom just hit it we believe why do i have this kit guy up zip right zip right zip copy copy copy bragging over this okay my bank frag oh money money we'll say take it all the way i'm just so confused dude yeah so if you want grenades to maximize them like make them have something something just hit me electrical unit here two i think we should go play an objective man we're not doing anything up here i guess actually we're defending no there's not an objective up here is there sometimes it seems like there is and sometimes there it seems like there isn't where are the helis there's a tank hopefully it's not changing they don't rotate i have no idea but i don't see it actually i think you're right they do it's just it's hq here it seems more doable and it's definitely it was bravo one last time one game i need speed momentum on the left tower left of the um big tower sniper i see that left of the launcher tower hit right target dead assist nice come on come on in the front losing connection no oh i got the other guy too oh my god i think there's one prone in the front as well if i'm not trigger oh yeah he's prone to the front there accuracy oh yeah okay okay trigger head nice dude i got the range on this oh my god i'm insane that's what i'm talking about aculate take them all out let's bring this dub home nothing but headshots please zip them up what's wrong with this game do you like me on the first day down on delta two now multiple streams change the batteries c5 go burr it says on the on the display tom literally dude some of the some of the optics need wi-fi actually you got to check the wi-fi signal i think it's the 4x on stone there's a guy okay left tower again our teammate's up there and there's a guy prone but he doesn't see him oh my gosh you're right oh my god he was just right next to him i just saw that i just saw that this scope is so much blur oh this is it this is what are you using the forex or are you using the big one on the uh on the revolver big one big one let's just go bigger go home what's up my kit i don't know how i got that kit to start with oh tornado rocket's taken off the tornado there it goes what if the tornado hit the uh rocket i wasn't that team is up there with a rocket launcher just no idea what life is let me show them behind guys he's just having a good time we're going to the nato helicopter landed up here are you are you dumb whoa yes look at the bodies like sticking out sticking out of the helicopter i'm double fragging the helo right now he just took off always go in the tornado connor i had to jump all right yeah but is it coming this way because if it's coming this way then there's no point in me going over to it you know i don't know you can see the path on the map but you can't see the map in the game so that's the catch take me tornado i'm ready ready to serve you nato overlord i'm at the bottom of the tower right now actually there's a couple right side of the road the main runway i should say there's a doggo out there as well ruined by heli i'm ready tornado oh i'm gonna get on this vehicle oh no no oh no what i couldn't even hear him this guy was literally punching me in the back and i didn't even realize it he's running behind me punching me and beat me to death without me even realizing that that happened nato snipes what you're shooting on me this guy oh shoot i'm getting ruined by an ai come on these shots are hitting game you know it yeah i'm also getting room in there oh there's a guy on the roof connor yeah dude i'm in the nato throw nate they call me tom tom nato nice i see you spinning around on the mini-map oh shoot it flung me out oh we're going back here we're going back that thing's about to swap me in the face come on take me away baby come on later take me away so much more lead now it's not him so the trick is to not touch anything when you're in there just let it take you yeah take me nato i killed me i think a fridge hit me on the head freak i'm at a combat zone afraid hit me on the ad boys yeah cow hit me take me into the air the whole emotes of the combat take me away yes made it back okay someone else stole my phone that's going away bye-bye can't tell if i'm close if i'm missing it's crazy this guy in the water there stone yeah i know he just zoned me healing and running hit him hit him hit him the dynamic weather is pretty cool on this map isn't it yeah it's nice another one up ahead shoot me jesus dude i don't i much just leave these guys 170 on that kill and reload while sprinting so it's like you can really run and kite people around where oh he's on the left oh with the girl left no left left yeah like very close if you were by me though oh no you're there oh good lord you're right holy crap they're literally standing right here and shooting and i i didn't even hear them yeah i don't know if it's the tornado like audio gets worse or well i hear the music where there's another one on the beach okay are you accurate yeah dude like super accurate yeah it's very good the firing is very good you got you do sometimes have to be close to him but where'd you die from there's a guy on the rocks here with me if anybody get out of my balls what the hell they're inside the ball gotcha roger one's in the crates i hate when people stop to shoot and then one second later when you go to shoot them they start running then they start yeah i gotta show you this clip from the other day i went to the revolver this guy point blank number i moved a millimeter every single time i couldn't hit him all right how many kills did we get oh geez i think it says it before it switches to this round total screen i think i said it shows you when daniel thank you so much for the uh the 4.99 man appreciate it tomorrow for life sponsored by john deere powered by yeah it's crazy how many people want another lawn mowing simulator video it's actually mind blowing no cap and uh swag swagato swageeto with the five thank you dude thomas thanks for the awesome streams of videos dude uh don't worry if you can't say my not on mute no context either okay i think that i think youtube's chopped your message in half unfortunately classic imagine playing blake foot breaker on this map with tornado and rocket launching i'm actually having such a hard time trying to land these snipes if i use anything else i'm just pissing in the wind gotta wait for people to stand still the first time we saw a tornado in a couple games though it is yeah well we saw at the end of that seven minute one but yeah it was just starting to come in i'll be right back [Music] uh would you look at that look at the weather what's happening what did i click oh come on i don't want this yes hope uh let's hope the bait is better tomorrow when they fix some of these serviceability issues are they changing it tomorrow i don't know but it's all server side problems i'm having i mean to be fair you are hopeful to be fair to be fair if fair most people have this issue because they don't play with friends who are as far away as you guys hmm we still have the same issue though because we have to re-find new servers because it's putting us in the wrong ones yeah okay just be careful because my heli just 360s this is what happens i'm not touching anything yeah just get out if you want oh wait he died never mind we win imagine much more i pretended to be dead hop out hop out for 10 minutes no stone oh it stands with me i was like i lost faith well you should yeah my my hellies are bugged faith ages all right i gotta try this single fire m5a1 oh yeah i need to go back why why would this help at all though medium to long um i had a really nice clip where i like picked off four or five just because it's more spammable than the dmr you land more shots oh tanking coming no thank you choose your grenades i don't know what's gonna run me over oh no i hit it's on fire oh another he's out there two on me killed one assistant one i'm dead i can't see him there's too many pushes got you stay with me thank you oh let's go wake up there you go hey we're on a good time he's still in the bush shut him stone dead again yeah if you die i don't think i ever got refreshed did i yeah you caught rez hello i'm coming thank you he's my friend too dude if they just run at me in a straight line like they just did i'll have no problems don't have to leave for anything but then you go to try to predict their movements yeah right then it does become problematic this guy playing halo what the is this movement it's a radio here someone there's a bushwick up on this mountain here in front of me fish wiggy yeah  wiggy what do we got oh it took someone why don't we get up at this mountain here look someone else's kit again any of you using a vector by mistake i don't know nope pretty far i'm not bothering with the tank i give up somebody else can deal with it yeah i'm stuffed i'm gonna go to d [Music] be nice to see which which is actually d like with a map or something but maybe in the future rockets yeah sheesh oh my god i found their team we'll see lmg like the lmg is pretty fun uh or like where i think it would be called i'm behind you here there's a few downhill from me let me try and play some of these close quarter options and one's gonna be like in this goalie i think and one beyond everything the vector doesn't stay in damage yeah i'm getting the hang of this sniping is now under our control what's my playing on this one oh my god i'm dead yeah yeah yeah right next to the right i've got 95 ping on this server yeah this is a good one that's what i'm saying hold on all together that's huge for me dude he's still down there literal peashooter dude let that other guy go he's downhill from us never mind fine got one is there a tank anyway we're getting ruined see if you can run uphill further throwing some frags back and we're down yeah they're coming up downhill on the left there looking for an enemy tank hit him okay sorry we're in our own little battle here i can't find the d oh there's a tank that's a good joke never heard that one before got him oh my god so original chad brilliant i said better ones in the mirror in the morning okay yeah see there's a wi-fi signal on the 4x on the m5 from the integral optic oh i'm dead not me too i franked my feet before i died though oh you got a kill i took them out took them out took them with you so you could be olympus you're cold oh i'm taking them out the dinner tell them how nice that frag was that i just threw out his feet it doesn't chase very well does it why do you run off to nah surely you're not trying to do that how do i go first person with my tank c oh yeah c crouch mode for tank feeling the snipes right now i like it oh yeah buddy i'm missing a lot but i'm also hitting a lot so oh you got a nice big magazine keep on laying them out do you guys prefer the uh making you just spawn in a tank at the spawn or do you have to call it in yeah no you have to spawn with it i think yeah do you prefer that system yeah well if you could just drop it anywhere that's kind of cheap you have to remember to check it yourself right it's been weird dropping it on yourself instead of going back to spawn but i got a helo this reminds me i need a doggy yeah i have not even used that like calling system i've done it a few times now it's it's okay i don't understand when i get it or don't get it yeah you have to be on yeah let's be on the flattest surface of all time now you have to be looking down and spam it because it it takes away the menu from you weird it's just another bug on the list save teammate got you brother so far my favorite thing has been the vehicles even though they're super broken same from the typing pretty good feels like my first time really using well i'm being the driver not a big fan of the uh assault rifles and stuff though yeah no really i mean they're they're good but it's just it's not really not it's nothing special i don't think i don't know that's fair maybe i don't know like it's fun to get a couple kills with it but it's not as i haven't gone on any like crazy flanks or anything with it that i pulled off like i have with the helicopters or even like hanging back with some of the snipes like i tried the lmg and i can get a couple kills but i still just get roasted before i can really do that much there's so many bushes and angles that people can get it's just it's a lot easier to do with a tank and the helos now yeah these are fine where am i dying from ask myself the same question john left turn left getting shot to the right do 360. i love that love that for me it's just a new thing isn't it oh pick me up stone right below you coming down for pickup standby where do you want to go wherever you want to take me there he is eric you go up the zip and i'll get i'll cover you from the top oh i like it probably ai let's do it give me a sec to get in position here what the hell hit me something over there you're clear to go you're clear to go we've got two birds watching this watching the top it's not clear oh nevermind it's clear there's no one up here right now someone yeah it's showing that's clear oh helly above that's ours nope there's another one here some more armor at the front i'm presuming oh that one yeah okay i didn't see that one yes damn it he got me no i was flying too slow there i was trying to uh dip back down and go under him we got one on obj this is the back of my head isn't it transport aircraft's two of three but i can't select it maybe there's a personal cooldown with like getting the helicopter again no it's just mugged oh it's just about yeah okay [Music] i feel like that should just be common by now yeah no it's no it's not you it's the game it's actually the game can't go too far this way i think the game is going to kick me out reverse reverse traverse traversal danger danger i'm in danger read all about it there we go keep forgetting i can toggle between third person what we're doing what am i like the tanks self-heal or someone repairing me because yeah we'll sell phil over time crazy can you stop moving so i can shoot you please ah you've been so inconsiderate enemy honestly this guy's up on top tallest let's change my vehicle sense all right got the bird back coming back yeah i'm doing all right it's a teammate oh you're in a tank are you yeah you gotta get the repair tool with the tank it's nice like self-heal you need to pick up whoa i wasn't sure if that was going to work a little lower that's called tank moment c2 boys we need to get c2 hold on i'll come to you i'll come to you i'm not coming to you it's the one oh is the other side of this hill hold on there's one guy in the balls got him there's also a tank up ahead here though and i'm 4 hp yeah you're you're you might want to dip nope did you explode yeah blue no oh i didn't even have my repair class anyways someone's climbing with a ladder it's another tank i could get but i'm gonna wait to get another helo it's only tried the jets yet but do you want me to get the helicopter that's got the gunner's seat on the wall the whole time if you want let's see if i can snag one it may not pop though i'm just running around sniping i'm liking this yeah yeah that that scope yeah the blur on the outside it's really tough for peripherals so the irons or um that 4x with the revolver isn't it let's get some more water that's a teammate where's the teammate you got an enemy on you yo am i muted uh no i'm good now sure i'll be in shot from the left oops let me do that guy over here somewhere it's the doggy me a dog always getting into trouble i tell you what i really want to use this gun on an infantry map which one vector yeah i had some fun with it at the tower but even so a lot of those fights are not close enough let's go where do you need some support uh down on d2 i think delta d2 delta 2 delta 2 all right coming over every time i go to shoot this guy he's just moving let's go team i can't shoot out lights oh my god look how dark i guess crazy okay i'm hitting shots i'm just not hitting head shots spawn is broken on c2 they always spawn in the water okay what yeah yeah okay the movement's just too insane for sniping man velocity i love the kill sound though yeah see i think somebody's using a drone here and i love them no yeah so like you can apparently you can change the kill sound stone to the bf uh one kill sound which i'm definitely gonna do i don't know i kind of like this one if one is actually pretty good kill sound on that one too though [Applause] a bunch of hit hit markers here but can't kill anybody i might have to swap off the snipe a clickbait thumbnail i'll still do some chill streams on twitch but youtube is my place for um covering content quickly that doesn't need to be a youtube video uh when it comes to let's plays as well it's more convenient for me to do a live stream and instead of rendering multiple parts i can do like a whole hour live stream of a playthrough or a new game i want to check out all right i'm moving up no so close there we go i'm getting better so if you're too close to them with this you got to choose which of the cannons you want to shoot with the little bird yeah i'm going to try and hit them with dudes oh they got a helo here they got a havoc right in the action yes they do man down i'll try and get up behind him oh dude someone can just are you sure no one's just in your heli spotting for you like look yeah you can oh you're in my heli yeah we get a spotter at the bottom you have a scope right like a sporoscope yeah but i didn't tell you that got him are you spotting for me right now yeah yeah there's guys on the roof watch oh that's a huge mark are you kidding me that's huge guy right bullets here double hit him that's all you i don't know i don't have guns i can only spot for you can you repair me uh no i don't have a repair tool if you did though could you oh probably oh my god sit on the side repair did you just kill that guy on the roof oh we just went through the ground on my screen i thought it was you guys ah do we he just 45 degrees flick shot head shot at me and then he got blown up on the rooftop i just love that for you what do you guys think no i don't know okay that was super sketchy good to go though all right i'm on top oh it's like glitching me out a little bit i can still fly but it's like oh what the hell is really weird it's shaking i can screen is shaking yeah i'll hop in from uphill you got a lot of friendlies around yeah you got heli trying to attack you now oh he's dead someone sniped him nice oh i'll stop shooting it then somebody can get in that if they want him to just blow it off awesome go check out charlie there's a bird heading towards charlie right now everything is awesome i wonder for the tunnel again are they trying to take d1 you spot below on charlie one yep look at them all thank you thank you thank you yeah i can't see like anything when i'm in first person with all the rain actually like keep it somewhat straight oh he's down to her left i do like the gunplay yeah i mean i think it's the combination of the gunplay with the movement that is the biggest problem for battlefield veterans like i've had a year or so of like i kind of replaced battlefield with warzone when that came around because the f5 you know didn't do it for a lot of people and the live service was stopped for the game um but there's actually there's like more real it's like there's a lot of recall in the game effect is a bad example uh maybe not i'm a pc player though like controller players i don't know maybe pc players just find this too easy to control it's the default recoil i'm out of ammo so i can't actually demonstrate i wanted to demonstrate it's gonna show you with me pulling down and with me just firing it it's fun it's not perfect but it's enjoyable it's addictive enough but you know i'm not having enough for the moments i want to have with post quarter fights and stuff it's all long-range sniping and the sniper that we have in the beta isn't a good sniper i mean it is good like it's a ball action one hit headshots but biggest issue is the velocity these leaves keep blowing in my way no no no no nope there we go want to get this tank damn it tired of vr yeah i've got a bit of br burnout you guys see the uh the ghost recon how's the tornadoes here the ghost recon frontline trailer from ubisoft big yikes what are they doing to the ghost recon franchise you kind of neat it's better to have a passenger for the uh did you see the trailer yeah ghost recon uh the battle royale frontline yeah yeah i don't know what they're doing i mean i don't understand like what we are what it is why is everyone so upset is it because they put tom clancy's name on it or because it's not ghost recon is it like ghost recon fans want the old experience exactly like majority of the comments that i saw on it the people getting mad were like man this isn't a ghost recon wild like we want like a story game like we want our game of what we expect from it and it's the same thing like when when call of duty came out of the war zone they didn't be like hey we're not doing call of duty we're just going to do warzone they still came out with call of duty they still came out with zombies they still did all their stuff and then they came out with a horizon on top of it right great point's still active and it's actually gotten a lot better like miles better it's a really good game now for a lot of those fans but it's still not the best ghost recon experience right yeah yeah that game was horrible when we played it in the whatever it was the update over the offer so many bugs yeah that was pretty buggy yeah but um not as blanky as this one they just because they own a franchise or a name like tom clancy and ghost recon like they don't need to it's just make some new ips stop milking the ones you have and just strapping that name on tom clancy's not improving any of this stuff yeah if they change the title based on being a new franchise in general you think it would do okay i mean well if if it's free to play it it literally looks like it's ring of elysium from what i can tell that's what i'm saying it's ring of elysium on a new map yes but different gadgets i suppose there's a market there someplace the extraction is there's everybody all trying to get to a helicopter and you got to get up the helicopter that's how you win oh okay i don't know if there's going to be respawning in it or whatever either but it looks like it's one life squad you got to get to an extraction point which is a helicopter and everybody's all fighting to try and get into the helicopter a 1v1 revolver off how's my fps been it's not been that great today uh axo why am i spawning in as a pilot i've definitely had better days with the fps [Music] all right let's get some water water up water up water under the bridge [Music] okay chat name one good thing you like about this battlefield game and one bad thing your favorite aspect and your least favorite aspect all right please no rain okay we had like three games in a row give us some sunshine this is called warzone a lot of people are comparing the gunplator warzone i like the mechanics that are there i dislike how effective they are in terms of uh how much speed the player is given doesn't feel it doesn't feel as grounded bad server back out okay oh my god yeah goodbye it's about 30. yeah i was at 190. i hate the specialist love the look it's a very clean looking game isn't it there's not as much grit it's not in the water i think so i'm here okay you're back out yes i think this feels a little minion graphics with warzone better gunplay hey john good thing it's a tornado but i think it's the grapple the grapple needs a cool down two or three times as long as it currently is i think things like the sliding need to be reduced you need to lose momentum on the slide not keep your momentum so like so you you slide a hundred percent and then by the end of the slide you're back down to one percent movement speed whatever the default is uh i don't mind tactical sprint being in the game you get faster movement but you shouldn't be able to run around with it unlimited and you shouldn't have an option in the menu that allows you to only run around with tactical sprint because then you're always running around at the fastest which is what everyone's going to do and it is faster than the default run speed but the ready time of the tactical sprint is exactly the same as the ready time of the default sprint you can chain together the movement a bit he's way too way too quick i think my two right now are like i do like the gunplay um but audio isn't the best it's actually probably the not the worst i think hardline maybe wasn't that great um but a massive thing about the um about immersion for battlefield is the sound design and dice have always done such a great job with it and this is very muffled footsteps are terrible that's my two probably gone plays good audio's bad the server issues i'm not so worried about i'm having a bad time in the beta right now i just hope that when the game goes live they obviously have more servers available and when i play with my friends i don't have to have 200 ping on any servers yeah that's what's trying to do sunset though you shouldn't keep your momentum when you've done a slide and something i also think should be in warzone you shouldn't when you do slide i think you should only be able to slide when you're in tactical sprint just a default run shouldn't put you into a slide and i think this the the uh i need to redeploy so i get my weapon yeah the tactical sprint or this reversal sprint whatever they call it in this game um there we go um what was i saying it should have a cooldown i might throw on the scene what's up oh i got a helicopter oh okay all right never mind fine let's do our thing again yeah so uh it's my tactical sprint is there a point whilst i'm doing this that the game goes hey you've sprinted you've run for too long in this mode you need to slow down for a bit regain stamina no i can do this for unlimited amount of time i can just run a full max sprint so why why would they have this option off is my normal sprint slower than this which is unlimited so for most casual players they're not going to that option is there and they'll be running around like this and watch the ready time of it that's the ready time of the normal sprint before my gun's ready to shoot and then this is the ready time when i sprint it's exactly the same exactly the same so this should be slower it should be on a cool down maybe 10 seconds you can run like this before you've got a run like this for a while before you get the boost from that again which again is unlimited and you can just turn it on permanently here so whenever i click sprint i'm immediately in this mode for an unlimited amount of time what's the point in the default sprint they need to decide which one they want or have a cooldown system in place like it's just ridiculous is that aspect of the movement so how are you shooting i mean i think tom and i are trying to take the roof right now yeah you want in on the helo tom uh which one are you in gunner's seat i got the havoc or whatever he's us uh yeah sure kelly's man the attacker is talking about the attack one yeah attack one it's a lot better if i have a gunner dude yeah i'll spawn on you oh okay peeling off pretending to pick you up no that's the enemy's point yeah size of the map is massive that is way too big even for 128 players but like i said earlier it's a great showcase of everything this game has available every kind of vehicle you've got the spectacle of the rocket launch which is good for clickbait okay they're jumping down on delta here just all right which they love one on the roof just ahead of us i haven't chosen this for the map design i've chosen it for one i've chosen it for how much you can showcase you've been shot from a jet from behind yeah we got a little bird we got a little bird on us blocking them once let me know if you guys need me i'll do my best hit one i'm trying to keep you an angle it wants i'll find it oh what the oh we crashed we might have crashed we're looking up too long uh we might have crashed tom you kept you kept me the angle for too long kept you locked on for too long just looking up and we were slowing down and uh we were we're going down we're looking at we're going down spawned an immediate run over by a tank it's great nice love that for you dude why is that why is everyone killing each other in this game then an enemy over there let's do it you got a guy right on you here that's a squad man squad member seen this assassination thing is so inconsistent and i died around a rock hell def nothing how i don't hold it you just tap it uh no i mean i i've done it a few times now it works i mean i mean i held f to bring the knife out to then stab him yeah you don't even need to do that you just need to be behind them use melee yep ah i stabbed him in the back dude it's just super glitchy man it's so glitchy i don't like the third person animations either but i wish no i i don't like that either i wish they brought back the first person stuff it doesn't seem to be a pro animation in the game either like if you go to assassinate someone who's prone just makes them stand up and then you do this at the animation i'm gonna throw the suppressor on this so i'm off the radar the radar oh gonna stop this bringing back some eminence this one doesn't have a gunner okay this is just the regular little bird it's probably pretty boring to spot for me those guys in this building there was one that was approaching there i don't know if our team killed them all because we capped the objective yeah look at that as well chad look how fast my grappler's recording just holding the rooftop here i can already use my grapple again and it's based on how how far you went with it so because i kind of cuz over by the uh missile i got it back instantly because i didn't travel very far if i do this it loads i don't know here comes a little bird pbx seems to be the way just like the pbx holo oh my god great shot what's my ping on this one hundred sorry had worse can't tell if we're winning the damn it dude objective or not i should have just kept with the other one they're on the corner i don't know where they are there's main roof memory foalie just playing the helipad okay now on there enemy no teammate can you grapple people you can i actually posted a short on that yesterday youtube short you can kill people with it but you can't grapple and pull yourself to them it just hits them and then the wire you should try the first smg i'm liking it i'm even using the suppressor on it yeah sure i think i prefer the vector oh i've used this one yet but let's get over here only get 21 max so very low recoil but also equally slow jesus guys in there equally slow rate of fire no i have 31 shots in it you must be using a different mag okay use the first meg don't you second one's probably decent too but like 21 yeah it's low it's too low damn doggo oh wait i did throw my my motion board just doesn't animation it's weird it's like the grenade yeah come on now this this gun does nothing wasn't enough to beat the m5 let's be closer inside them i think the rate of fire the vector is just giving me too many good memories so many memories made other oh jeez he's outside as well no he punched me out he's t-backing me all right this guy's on the list put him on the list he's on the list yeah it's it's a it's much better medium range this gun for sure but it doesn't have to stop in power be better i agree it's not bad i mean there's not many bad guns in battlefield games so the benefit of using this though over the like the ar is you can like running jump hip fire around corners and it's like 100 accurate yeah that's what i was using the vector for the hit f5 was insane i was most mostly running around at medium range just beaming people from the hip it's an enemy healthy it's gonna be a crazy like holiday season of all these games like halo being free to play multiplayer as well that could be interesting to see where people go it was gonna be sick yeah i don't even want to play it yet oh my god it's a lot of dudes coming to a theater near you okay i'm off this roof i like it here what's that sound stop get some help sound of enemies dying screen's bugging out yeah there's a lot of bugginess going on here yeah right okay the beeping stopped my screen is bugging out hard holy recoil thank god those last few bullets hit oh that's a tank don't go mental dude i guess i was so much fun yeah how did the guy one shot me with a sniper up close and did he kill you he did one shot i mean did he die is what i meant to ask oh yes i also murdered him he didn't even hedge me did not kill the guy with a grapple switch into rocket i can't spawn on you you're permanently in combat hang on gaming elsewhere there goes prawn damn he is probably just cool further back he's spawning now can i you back here no this isn't our other teammate ready trying to contest this point oh my god i'm being shot up from every direction so you can spawn on me now i'm uh i'm already on the resources it's not going to hill somewhere so when you're on a point are you just permanently on radar i think you're is that how that works you're visible if you're if you're contesting it it'll tell you how many people are on the point no no i mean like on the minimap because i've seen people on the mini map they're not even shooting or anything maybe attack oh my god he fought an rpg donation i can't do anything about them i need ammo yeah another thing they need to add in the game is the comros flash yeah we need to be able to ask for ammo he needs to be able to call the comrades right i think if you have asked for ammo health and all that stuff um that's cool like i got a game done he did get game done grappled his ass and then hit fight him well you can't grapple teammates oh come at me damn it he did but i wasn't ready all right we're taking it wait let me show you something oh i was saying when you get when you get to the top of the zip it's going to throw you off press f again or whatever your interactive is because the hell he's blocking it okay so you have to hop back on it after you've already hopped on it and i'm dead from another heli where's our gunners man yeah well there's one of our ellies i said wait afk in the sky man i'm telling you is there no one up here enemy voice brief stars stars man when it's done well what's up you're right what's up yeah i was trying out the jet didn't do very good with that back in the helo doing good with this that's tough doing the uh attack tarkali or the buzzard no just in the bird i i need a passenger if i use the attack ellie gotcha it's too um it's too inefficient no i'll spawn but just don't reverse the ground i can't really hop in with you i mean i guess i could do that i guess i could not crash into the ground for you that might be good i just got blown up the thing is if somebody if there's two people that are using anti-air um equipment and it's really hard to live in the living room yeah it's really hard but if they're paying if they're not paying enough attention or if nobody's spending the time to be anti-air then you got to get away with a lot that's happening to our team right now oh my god they're all on uh i don't know the point yeah d2 yeah i know i keep trying to get over there i just keep getting ruined by helicopter can't stay on the point long enough all right i got it let me come pick you up yeah go for it all on the i'm here like 990 meters away you're shot from where top tower got some out in the airfield ahead of you yeah a couple good tags on them oh lost control there we go i'm back sniped over there i'm dead i'm just scoring i'll spawn on you fly somewhere else i can't get the assist on the one that killed you can we pick you up that's all right stone's in the heli all right he's a gunner i am the gunner now roger that all right uh does flying low still work effectively as is that perk you think no i don't think so i just do it to use the hills to block line of sight no but you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah it was um i'm just saying if you're low enough for that yeah yeah it was it was it could be i don't know yeah obviously we can't even look at the menu of what any of it is these guys capped charlie too earlier this is where i was killing a lot of them there is one here we'll check the roof [Music] oh my god they're all on d1 everybody just crossed oh second floor there tom right ahead of us at the flag he spawned on his teammate all right i'll keep us close enough dessert make a cap here oh rocky below though looking for him let's get up on the roof i don't see yeah he's out but he's over by the water left of that water now i'm gonna go get us a repair first okay our forces wobbling most sectors our repair is actually pretty fast dude it's one of the map we've got blowtorch time yeah oh tank no no no no um just dodged that one right below yeah reload him copy keep and hide over him so he can't look up it's just here feeling that he's feeling it it's done for it's on all right we're fully healed up as well reloads elo right up ahead little bird oh yeah right under us i'm gonna turn this around oh hits he might just disengage us completely i'm see if i get a lock yeah he's out nice when we go on the server not enough to tell you if it's 128 our own team shooting us that's fun um if you go to players you can see there's above stone brief yeah that guy's trying to find him maybe not my jump he's on the radar for a sec i maybe fly to d2 instead okay bringing us up the hill i'm not a big fan of the blue filter on everything again it's like bf3 yeah everything's very blue yeah it's okay when the rain's not here when the sun's out it's okay no i mean uh like hud-wise like if you get a vehicle it's all blue oh yeah the yeah the hud is a little much all together yeah you can change color points just hover right in front of ya yeah you can't change the color blind options have better colors in the bright blue and stuff but i think the cap color is the same as the the flag cap color is the same as the point anyway so you don't know if you're capping a point or not somebody was locking us on this hill it's really hard to see where they are though when is the better and better ends between the ninth and the tenth i'm not entirely sure it's i think it's region based they're on charlie one i think they're on charlie one shot's going on top the hill though see uh had he in front stone abby can't look up high enough nailing it oh no tank yeah dude please that was crazy it's a pretty good run though that's pretty good i'll do some flying tell me wait and get another one you can go play i could go i can get another one for us i think we need to try and cap some of these points to be honest they're gonna turn the tide of the fight yeah we definitely gotta cap some might even be good to take the tank actually can i call in oh great i'm taking the roof hell yeah connor yeah that might need some help they've got so many points ahead of us all right i'm just gonna grab a little bird then and come help oh crap cover me i'm reloading it's not a teammate or an enemy oh yeah i'm loving this veto just flying in here like he owns a theme with a vector and they try and go on a little hip hip fire spree no i'm telling you use the other smg is that the same no it doesn't you haven't even tried it i've tried the other smg it's the same it's the same hip fire like profile no no but long range you can use it better yeah no definitely but i'm not fighting long range but using smg then i'm gonna use it up close but you don't always have the opportunity is what i'm saying i create the opportunity by only going into that just create your opportunities live your best life for everything by going in that bunker where else is there gonna be long range in that bunker everyone just loves group they love grouping up in there honestly you go in there you'll find like 10 people they're taking down they've had they've had a good cap on us they've bled us hard there's four on delta one right now the only one pressuring it i might back off it i'm going that parachute glitch is so busted for an enemy who has it i feel so bad damn it if they're like behind cover you can see where they're moving yeah it just follows over their head going up a staircase oh there's a helicopter on me that's what's killing me yeah man there's also a tank over there don't spawn in that tank anymore it's not working for me either later sucker you took out the heli didn't you i see it i see it spinning you're shooting soldier nice they're on foxtrot as well oh yeah they are bleeding us hard gonna take that thing out it's dead i'm gonna go down the slide oh tank is indeed dead the turrets all the way over here two on uh foxtrot one come on game why can't i call this in we're capping it quick oh right i forgot i had to unbind all my keybinds i can't drive vehicles there's the cap we got foxtrot back why can't you pressure coming up on acolyte here yeah we're we're bringing it back we're bringing it back this is good no we're gonna get their birds it's like a race you can call it in first assuming that hilo's dead i don't see it oh there's one oh lift stone you need a lift no i said thank you oh i got you somewhere it's gotta be level enough i'm gonna go for flank on delta caffeine a1 again oh three on delta one second a1 i think you are permanently on radar when you're on an objective i really do because these guys are finding me jesus really fast that was messy we lost goatee dm there's 57 you playing around the tower yeah i was using the smg a lot yeah not the vector not the vector yeah that thing's garbage compared to the first one on top of the pbx what it's called the pbx the smg oh of course yeah i like those helicopters though they're fun the site is called the same thing though is it no it's called a pbx hollow right it was destined to be on that weapon though i'm telling you it's not called the pbs oh yeah you throw that bad boy on there bring it over from college yeah yeah yeah oh that's the stuff lovely how old are you guys um i'm i'm 27. connor's 26. i am seeing a black screen stone is 28. maybe 29 now just played it it was horrible hard to get a kill i feel like hackers already in beta there are a few vegeta yeah um i don't know how fast dice are acting upon that but it's it's tough dude because like they're trying to showcase too much in one map and the matter i think i gotta reset my game the map does have it all but like yeah you should be able to join on us or we can back out anyway um i'm not i'm not even in the game right now yeah i can just invite you i think son manager [Music] yeah they're trying to showcase too much so you've got every they've got way too much space for 128 players which sounds crazy like they haven't catered it to 128 players bigger doesn't mean better in that regard i got nine hours played on it right now they can have 128 players on the 64 player maps you know the pacing would probably be really fun i might have been afk for some of that too i think that's where 2042 should be they're taking a modern step should uh with 120 players that's a huge leap for the battlefield franchise but this isn't the best display of it i don't think i've ever seen more than 20 players on my screen at once [Music] there's obviously maps in other battlefield games where you're like whoa yeah i'm looking forward to seeing some of the maps to be honest you guys all met in person before no none of us have met i think we would have had the opportunity with um okay if covered hadn't happened we probably would have met already so i'm joining you guys some sort of event yeah i'm 140 ping though so i think we are in europe i'm 283 so that's not okay that's not the case okay don't worry australia i guess we're leaving this is joint party oh you guys join me oh okay yeah that's fast if you want to see the whole scoreboard you have to press escape squad and players and you can see the whole list yeah yeah yeah what the hell it doesn't show you like details though it just says players it doesn't show you how many kills desk or anything like that it just shows you whose players or just how much ai there's a glimpse of it there or accidentally misclicked that's a shame i would have i would prefer the full scoreboard i'm sure it was a lot of information though if it's 64 v64 you gotta like scroll through everything yeah hey thanks jeremy cheers appreciate the uh the five dude thanks for the solo content you guys are great i'm glad you enjoyed it man but you it it would be nice because like you can't even you could always tell like okay this guy's 120 and zero with the tank on the other team let's go try and kill the eye on last match that's a shower you don't have that anymore through yeah you can probably check with that squad system all right how many let's try this uh let's try this god tier smg that acolyte's using the semiconductor god tears some of the pbx i'm telling you that's what i'm talking about right there vector it's the same thing with warsaw there's like loadouts for guns that just carry over yeah it's completely trash compared to the first gun i get you tom the first gun's the best that's what i'm gonna use i mean you can just like longest longest barrel grip red dots it's like the same same uh formula to create a gun last barrel unless you're pushing a point then i swapped to the suppressor yeah and i use the second side yeah i often just stick with the suppressor i don't change it too you lose too much damage damage damage damn damage here we go 50 bomb right here this is the gun you put this gun on you get a 50 bomb just like acolyte guaranteed that's what i'm talking about right here let's see what i can do you need to sit on the roof i'm already going about though oh is that what he was doing he was just camping the roof the whole time wasn't camping i was defending i was tactically positioned i was actually positioning actually here's an ammo box actually what about did you use the close range mag thing uh no heck that one okay yeah that's only 20 rounder yeah that's the long range one huh i killed myself and losers yeah it's a 20 rounder that's a joke yeah absolutely the fact that the vectors are fourteen forty yeah that's what i mean the vectors you if you manage gonna be way better than this thing this thing's garbage though don't spew it how did you even get any kills with this you guys are freaking animals i don't know i'm just spending the i'm just running right now so don't don't spew your ammo all over the place you know that's my problem though a lot of times i'll just blow the load quick and then there's just i guess i'm gonna do it after that there's no not even got no choice nice thing is i do have that secondary mag if i want to give it a quick swap you don't need some extra ammo swap it over 102 ping on this server not bad had worse 220 bro yeah screw you so euro we're the yeah it doesn't go based off of the the host the host yeah all right uh pick the suppressor i'm on b1 is this his name enemies what's up with this freezing spray going out uh that's from the the ball things right what's inside this building over here the ping oh baby i see myself a tank oh the help that was weird yeah this thing is rough welcome to my world it's literally a different game when you have firebase i know welcome to my literal existence let's just don't even register like bro this is a no i'm not nope i'm backing out bye yeah okay no i play half the bullets just didn't even hit yeah well welcome to jesus my game not even can you not play one game and let me have some fun for a change no i have no idea i'm not dealing with that noise bro catch the next floor my bullets didn't even go into the into the i hit him i put that's why people have been complaining about hit registration yeah because they're being put on these servers but they don't know where their ping is so they have no idea what's going on we'll be complaining about hit registration in a minute yeah when when my fist registers in your face hit me baby one more time [Music] got him that's my bones you back at the main menu yep oh stop back on it [Music] standing that's just so beautiful oh god damn it round of applause thanks chat that was that was chat because they just can't get enough of this content running running simulator 2042. what are you talking about i had 50 kills where are you i'm in uh i'm in some sort of loading screen right now like where where are you going that's what i want to know i'm having fights i'm just saying there's a lot of running in this game you can't sit on a roof and then say because there's no way to run on a roof connor i run everywhere on their roof i was i was playing the objective everywhere there's a reason why we lost that match i was running between everywhere you sat on one roof and shot people going upstairs and you i bet for i bet you were on that little spot as well weren't you grappled up on top of a radio tower where people didn't know where you were no i was not yes you were no i was using an smg i run around literally sent me a picture yes yesterday was like guys i found a spot it's so sick though stone you gotta see it i was like yeah i thought i was there it's actually sick what's your what's your ping stone uh 160 tom securing 38 200. it's because tom's leader i'm not though didn't you restart acolyte and tom was later yeah but i invited you guys yeah it says lobby that's what i mean it's like it doesn't matter it just it's just doing it random servers huh yeah that's the issue that's ridonkulous you can't choose either in the main menu there's no i'm okay with my thing right now but it's still not great hmm like for tom to play a decent game i kind of have a little thing what's yours right now how about 114. okay that's that's decent yeah it's still not great shots don't register all the time still but this is the lowest mine's been the entire time i've had between 150 and 300 consistently you might want to play some solo get the true experience of this game but my boys i mean i get it i'll play i'll play some so it's more i'd want to play with me too okay wow our gun ocular i'm just joking okay huh gonna hang around stone way too much uh huh me you can't blame this on me yes i can i'm getting good this smg's on the one i would have hit way more shots because that guy was with the movement in this game the vector i mean i'm clapping right now i'm clapping and slapping if you get them in a limestone this one beats the vector but when people start doing the the modern warfare 2019 slides you get way more shots because the vector keeps up killing me it doesn't believe that's a great it's a great beam smg but like why would you not use the m5 the m5 beats this thing so you can be in this game no there really isn't i mean let's see you not use the meta in war zone in this day and age i always not use the meta in war zone yeah and where does it go wins hayneville fire up off the roof if you're behind me yeah you did one more one on roof yeah you got me sort of the m5 that's why you won don't um don't put the suppressor on it i've noticed i don't know what i'm looking right now yeah i think i've just got the uh whatever barrel gives me the most most juice the last one oh no i was using the suppressor yeah take it off it gives you more accuracy and range that's not worth it accuracy you lose accuracy and range by putting the suppressor on it it looks like the suppressor that's on the uh m5 looks like a mono suppressor but it's just an extended barrel i thought the other one was some sort of compensator it doesn't even look like a suppressor it's a funny looking thing it's ribbed it's funny in it yeah slider needs to be nerfed i think i don't know man you need to lose mobility along like something as you slide you need 100 100 of that slide speed and it needs to decrease over time to one percent of your default at the moment it's a hundred percent like you slide you have the same you just keep that momentum crazy you keep momentum when you're jumping too yeah you can slide down hills for days and you can reload full without slowing down too yeah so that's what i've been saying about sniping because you so i think sniping the velocity needs to be increased because of the way the game plays and how fast your movement is like once people figure this stuff out yeah you're not hitting any snipes my turret's owning them howdy's upside down oh come on thank you i think he's still on that other roof through an earthquake i think it's gas going out by us right now yeah if you're on this building with us well do you have a long gas underneath oh tacos gotcha just beans nothing else just beans so i noticed you sent you showed a picture of your breakfast one time tom is that like that's normal over there right you guys have some beans for breakfast i'll be baked beans are different in the uk than they are in the us they're in like a creamy tomato sauce and they're a bit sweeter than whatever you have um yeah i know that america's always like what the hell you have beans for breakfast it makes sense it's a nice uh so nice some breakfast beans it's a nice condiment what i call them breakfast beans what are you gone isn't that what you just said eating breakfast you said breakfast beans beanie breakfast the baked beans damn do this smg actually collapsed i just told you man we would just have this got like a 40 meter kill yeah when you have good ping it's even better can't relate um nice 160 pingum oh my god i'm actually hitting shots now this is so nice there's actually an earthquake going on get in the bathtub bathtub you know where you're supposed to do i don't know i don't think so tablespoons no you don't put something like over the top of your bathtub you get in uh i mean i guess if you've got something to do that maybe i think you just get under a table or something though dodging everything i sho shoot at him there's a couple guys up here yeah i'm trying to see ahead of you but teammates might have killed them yes it does appear to be that way come on there's a few downhill from us everyone's jumping out the holly now would you shut me in the back oh my goodness six hp in a dream i see you killing their stone yeah i went in dude i went in got followed me up the zip though and got me i'm a gold game please feels nice to land shots point-and-click right yeah haven't found it yeah yep it's insane how much of a difference the ping makes in this though yeah yeah it's definitely normally like 120 is like it's laggy but you can still play the game um one guy gets so sick and tired of me that one came he just knocked it down he didn't care i love the revolver in this game it's so good yeah it feels nice uh i'm away from you or else i would if you jump down to me i guess i'm right below you over by the buildings ammo's there dude my game like keeps freezing this is weird it's the thing no it's like it's like it's losing my mouse control for a second and then comes back where other shots coming from just up ahead here close killed one okay i don't see any movement the tank's still out there right here hard left out front see i see it's running behind the shot on me on you on you yeah yeah on me on me i got the guy that was on you nice vehicles coming through oh behind you behind you yeah okay come on game how is that how has he not killed himself oh that's their headquarters there we just went into their headquarters that's where they spawn what oh it is yeah it's hq we've got two different points i guess it's because the objectives change yeah they change points because there's one on the roof now that you can cap in the last game yeah i don't like being upside down get rid of this so like does it rotate is that how that works yeah the points will change our home spawn is in the middle now [Applause] she well there's a ray gun in this game whoa i heard that special unlock special unlock oh my god i've got the double rocket fire again that guy needs to jump out he hasn't jumped out he's killed me literally took a lifetime to reload my rocket and if you have a c4 or a grenade you take that tank please i cannot i can't spawn anywhere it has to be b1 this is what i'm eating oh come on voice with the double rocket launch you guys do that if you have the rocket yeah the second one doesn't count though it shows the hit marker doesn't it they've occupied can i spawn hq wait did we take their hq yeah it's become awesome no we're just sitting up here we're just we're just in their spawn is all nope can't snipe from somewhere the tank out there what are we even doing here we can't we can't win yeah just kill him technically that'll help playing tdm here this guy is like jiggle peeking let us know tomorrow where the hell did he even go oh that's a teammate someone's a blue dot it's just literally a blue dot doesn't show the name shooting toes now well yeah this is our hq now yeah yeah see we capped it and made it ours where is this sniper man it didn't show like a a point that we could cap there's two guys in the other building the k3 building there were three assists okay i'm fragging over there you want me to heal you i'll just go over i can shoot heal you there you go oh just heal me thank you what's under me many enemies can i have another heels there you go yeah that works that worked that's kind of cool it doesn't show me that you've hit me with it or anything no it doesn't show me that i've hit you either i don't get any points for it either yeah i don't like i definitely should is this game on ps4 this probably just hasn't been added to the game yet oh the game isn't on ps2 that's because there's no way this is like this isn't a pretty rough state so it's kind of hard to judge exactly like what should be added which shouldn't be taken away or whatever yeah you can't judge the pace on the game on this map no it's a jack of all trades allows you to experiment with every gameplay element but um see it's got a little bit of something for everyone but not enough to keep the players who force end on one particular role occupied throughout an entire match dude what what were they thinking when they wanted when they added specialists but didn't change the faction outfits maybe it's maybe it hasn't been added yet like like we said you know who knows we have two hq's but the operators have three operators have a very specific look like we need you know i know halo is obvious with it like enemy is red friendly is blue i love that about halo yeah so easy to disability is incredible in that game visibility is decent in this but it just needs you know you need to stop second guessing yourself when you're close to a teammate too they literally have a tiny little blue dot above their head when they come into your camera for the first time yeah but it's only like a second second or two later and then the name pops up yeah yeah that's a lifetime in a fps i'm falling these heli's really love me yeah i've had some pain with heli's like every time i spawn there's one on me you won't be running around constantly in the full game liberated mind this is just like battlefield has big maps and this is just one of those you know not far guys on the right hill as well how is this guy literally dodging every one of my shots like that there he goes one come on it's the bullet velocity as i tank my own me put me up there too jesus i just got a gamble just try and guess which way he's gonna strafe yeah like i'm not a big fan of this map but um i've said multiple times i understand why it's a great way to show off dynamic weather the rocket is a great centerpiece it's a spectacle the tornado spawns on the map and in a way that doesn't disrupt game flow because it spawns in massive open areas i just hit that guy saw blood not like a network for instance um even though it's not ideal like you can't really use smgs very well on this map but there are at least some places where you can use them effectively it's just that it's boring to stay in one spot the entire time wow he actually killed me picking fights with me yeah literally feeling you thank you i guess i missed the first one why are you talking to me it was an enemy teabagging you killing you healing yeah again i couldn't tell if it was just a few friendly tea bags i really want to have to fly the rally over me i like this healing gun though i like the healing class a lot i really like it but i i wish there was a way to res your teammates easier medics need to be more prominent i think they've nerfed that medic yeah well they too only difference is that you you res people full health right yeah it used to be quicker or anything it used to be a revive gun yeah like it was shown in the uh the first trailer that you could shoot someone when they were down and it would revive them i think i was just healing them maybe everyone's looking at this room i just don't remember i don't know only a few seconds left before the russians have it all guys 370 tickets to go oh my god that guy's so far high so far high yeah so what was the sentence coming i said it he's high come on there's a sentence i don't know what it means what are you talking about tom there's a guy so far hi shoot that's crazy in other words he's high in the sky sheesh and i'm really liking this smg dude i'm telling you it's good actually it's like you know what you're talking about have you tried the vector dude no it's garbage now try the vector now you've given that the thing out of here now that you've given that one sometimes though and try the vector yes seriously try the vector and you'll see exactly what i'm talking about that's only good for close range there's a bit of recall they have to pull yeah if it's an smg not a sniper this one works close range though and it's working far too that's the same exactly yeah thank you so you can control recall right well i mean i am the best so yeah there you go knew it doesn't kill me just pull the opposite direction stone you can do exactly the same with a vector i have a high rate of deviation that's the issue you have deviation yeah got him from the conversation because i know i'm right oh i didn't know brother swan and back though it's literally faster for me to just spawn back than it is for the two second rez timer anyways what is this spawn in the water man this is terrible we'll shoot this guy frag this guy and i'm gonna drop another um ammo pack down here was that him controlling it i sniped him oh i think i hit the vehicle yeah get a hit marker on that too yeah i'm playing keyboard mouse uh timeview oh no time care stone yeah bragging ammo pack down here grab yourself another frag twice it again with frag oh no the bullet went over killing you thank you there we go again the left autumn a pilot you got him nice i could i couldn't tell if i was hitting you or not so i shot four four darts into you that was mental bro i was just rapid fire you were constantly healing me though because i was taking damage between those doors yeah yeah i i was just spamming it i got so many of them plus i refilled fruit i'm dropping another ammo pack here nice refill the nade uh we need to go to a1 we fill my heels three three guys on a1 yeah copy that how can you tell if you look at the point already oh yeah one enemy uh one friendly three enemies i know that shows when you're on the point but i didn't know you could see it when you were not on the point too i wanted to reload chuck yeah he got out oh my god yeah there's two of them stone he's running back towards the truck now he's prone nice got one of them ah i went for the mag swap i should have just gone for a reload i think damn damn son where'd you drive my max my other mac was empty or what well you can switch in the thing can't you for a yeah i went for the hot i went for the hot swap mag just adjacent to us connor yeah just go up we'll get him after we'll beat him up there i'll go shopping behind anyway great get me in the game there's actually some uh if you spam the sniper like that you have to wait for the recall to settle i should probably probably shouldn't do that let me out there again no oh mother nature's bringing the heat away they took sector charlie what points do we need what smack that guy in the back of the head a1 is the biggest one we're fighting over tank on the road if we get c1 and c2 yeah i can't spawn here i really want to check my map it's just not a feature how do we become friends um when i first started my channel i met acolyte when he was about a thousand subscribers i had about 300 we're both playing a game called dirty bomb and i'd seen a game uh video from him uh he's doing like a sniper video on dirty bomb and there weren't many creators on the game and he just seemed like a cool dude and he was obviously very skilled at the game and i was brand new to pc gaming so kind of needed someone to show me the ropes a bit and uh yeah he did that for me and then we sort of hit it off been playing a bunch of games together since pubg was the one that followed after dirty bomb for us it was like the first uh first game that we had real success with on our channels um and then obviously because of pub g's blow up stone was looking for a squad to play with he just started pc gaming connor's videos were doing well right now so he reached out to connor um i'm just spawning in and the rest is actually this is a really close game guys yeah i'm gonna go back oh we're capping a i'm going to go for bravo i'm going to wait for the a1 cap and then see if i can go down to c2 okay earl just spawn on tom he's moving fast i don't know what's going on here yeah day bomb was a great game i was parachuting oh okay you're moving way faster than everyone else these guys are up on the hill it looks like yeah everyone's dead take them out a little bit don't let him pass yeah get one yeah i died the one guy on their team turned around i think i got them all are you progressively [Music] there's more if you look on the map loads of them oh did we win yeah let's go win how did we win because we're the best we're so first match of the day bonus love that yeah first match of the day big hype up in here sure all right boys that's the last one for me oh yeah oh yeah okay all right i mean we had some good games amidst the horrible server silver pink it was good fun i got to try more out today than i have in on previous days you have two then stone um yeah okay so if you stay on i'll play another one if you want to call it like a couple screenshots or something yeah i'm gonna dip ggs boys all right man bye-bye all right chat another battlefield stream in the bag i think it just makes more sense for me to show the game this way whilst it's in beta than make the videos that i have been why does the game go into a tiny little screen when i walked out from it it's really strange um yes we have been live gabriel and we're now finishing the stream welcome and goodbye uh yeah i mean i might post another battlefield beta video but um i'm not sure i've kind of squeezed we've kind of milked it dry haven't we to be honest there's not much left to do the beta is kind of designed for people who like casual players who've maybe got two to three hours and they can do everything in that time uh it's not designed for full-time content creators who you know trying to really deep dive on each aspect of it so yeah that map is a bit painful to play on for long periods uh it's a good-looking map it shows off the dynamic weather the rocket launch is cool you got the tornado you can really play that map however you want but at the same time it's just way too open there's too much running between points and it doesn't showcase 128 players look at this screen like i haven't seen a scene like this once all of those players on screen on the left-hand side there i just don't see it here doesn't happen in-game even those 128 people it's crazy uh but it's fun ultimately i'm having fun with the with the beta it's kept me uh kept me engaged regardless but at the same time like i said there's just not enough um going on and some of the server issues i had today like that was the worst the worst experiences experience i've had server wise but yeah thank you all thank you guys for watching um whether you're watching it as a stream or as a vod after the fact i appreciate you being here and uh thank you to nvidia and scan for sponsoring this one um yeah you can check out the link in the description to a view scans range of 360 hertz monitors in preparation for bf5 dlss will be coming with launch of the game and you can turn on um you can turn on uh low latency mode and video reflex in the beta one more day of this so yeah i might play some more tomorrow you might see another video if not i'll catch you in the next one whatever we do got some more far cry 6 to stream at some point um but yeah that's gonna do it for this one guys have a good day or evening whatever time it is for you appreciate all the support as always i'll catch you in the next one bye bye catch you legends in the next one let me say it before people get mad
