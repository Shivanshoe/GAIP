car 98k with scope mount i love the sound of that let's go you're gonna die straight away thomas no jack i am a goateed sniper man did you hear rhys um what's her name snap somebody what do you mean what's her name rhys witherspoon no with the knife [Applause] oh god you walked into that one hello everyone and welcome to an exciting new fps called enlisted and a special thanks to enlisted for sponsoring today's video so enlisted is an upcoming mmo squad based shooter for pc xbox series x slash s and playstation 5. set in world war ii where you play as an infantry squad leader tank crew or aircraft pilot and you can get immediate access to the closed beta with one of the founders packs by visiting the link in the description of this video and participate in the game's ongoing development the weaponry soldiers uniform appearance and capabilities of the vehicles in the game are all in line with historical facts which adds a level of immersion and authenticity that i love they've really taken care of the details here and you definitely feel as though you're participating in a real military battle of course there are some more arcading mechanics here that helps keep the game fun and high action throughout the rounds and though i'm sure it's hard to tell how the game actually feels if this is your first time seeing gameplay take it from me there's something about the weapons and gunplay overall that feels quite addicting and fun with some fine tuning and polish there is some real potential here and i'm excited to see how enlisted evolves in the coming months but what better way to show you how the game works and plays and with a full round teaming up with my past study and this was definitely one of the more close quarters in infantry focus maps that we played on but lots of fun nonetheless so with that said remember to check out unlisted using the link below thank you for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one russian fields is that the name of this map russian fields yes where are you where are you going let me spawn oh my god it looks it looks insane dude god yeah this map looks nuts lots of trenches though this is sniper heaven it's a shoe to my left up uh down yeah all right let's go i think uh yeah would be really nice if they added a little green marker for your teammates yeah i would see you on the map at least that's an enemy thing that's a tv teammate he is absolutely plugging up yeah why why are we wearing white camouflage by the way oh snow isn't that aaron well you see this patch of snow here so i'm gonna stay in that i'm gonna stay here for the entire game kill this guy oh yeah yeah yeah small probably probably yeah we can do a bit of parkour look huggable pog ugly yeah but you're gonna stick out like a sore thumb no no look now we're on the roof i'll blend in with the roof right oh yeah yeah yeah i look like i look like a patch of snow if i go brown yeah oh can you see me i can't immediately invisible yeah i can see you on i can see you on the mini man sure he'll do for now oh god that's teammate good i think once you learn what the different enemies look like it's a lot easier yeah because you you don't have to like stop and think oh is that an enemy or not i like how there's like a cqb version of your iron sights if you just tap do you say more hip fiery i guess but you still move slowly oh my god absolutely been i found a weird angle on this window ledge but the smg's do not mess around either just as good as the rifle yeah they sound like ars you go a bit deaf when a bullet goes past your ears what yeah the smg yeah the ppk this skull is fun man okay i don't know if i should push up from this position there's an enemy plane in the sky as well so be careful there's so many little hidey holes that i will say yeah i found like six different hiding spots in the building smg's are actually nuts using the ppk yeah it's crazy i'm gonna be careful i'm hitting my carrying them but i don't want to get too involved i know what you're saying i'm trying to advance up this right flank here jesus christ teammate i gotta go dropped yeah if they missed a shot on you they are instantly dead there's like a beast of the smg class that's nuts let me get up here it's absolutely caning them from behind oh my god this is a spot the yeah this is a spot [Applause] oh yeah baby just tap throttle from his window by the way it gives you a little red marker tell you where your shot from there's some decent info on the ui oh no i'm being shot at though oh god i need more ammo just used all of my reserves i've only got one reload left how do you get ammo back close window oh my god that's nuts next gen window mechanics oh yeah i don't know how i get ammo my mag i think it is actually taken into account magazine count yeah yeah i've got one mag with 18 and one mag with 10. i loaded one of my old mags and had three rounds in it got a knife i'm going to stab this guy always see me you believe in me oh i need to pick up someone's gun believe that i can stab this guy yes i believe he's just okay i stabbed him but he died before he did so just shot the guy that you understand bastard i'm going down i've got fullness i need weapons man i've got literally nothing left now i've got nothing one bullet i'll have to head shot someone that's a teammate that is you take guns he's gone he's gone give him his gun i grabbed his gun i actually didn't realize you could do that after all this time but one dead i'm dead the mosin is so satisfying man taking my old building oh god there's a guy peeking i've got me bums car me mum's car yeah get me up this ladder start i've got one shot left to make up my mom's car your mum's car got him one shot left oh i'm actually completely hammer you've got to find someone else's get dead i feel like an actual soldier is there guys in the building i don't know which building you're in i think i'm next to you i'm running after you now this guy this guy said this yeah i'm gonna have to stab him i'm gonna have to stab him what the choice do we have stud oh he has no idea nothing left oh stabby stabby you guys again i do now right you need to get me a gun you need to kill someone again okay okay come this way this guy's over there coming come in coming oh i've been shot from the right from the right dead close right no no i'm fine i'm fine i don't see the guy over here this direction killed one but i don't think it was the oh sick dude yeah we got so many kills then i'll see where they're going with this bit more polish and this will be absolutely poggers yeah it's that perfect like line between more casual hardcore yeah hard cash because when it's too hardcore it's did you just like right yeah no fun to be had the fact that you can get you can res yourself basically yeah i like our feature right now actually quite like the mad dash when you you're totally out of ammo and you have to pick up someone else's weapon yeah that was because we got a really nice flank on their spawn there so yeah there you go i've literally just been shot and now i'm resting myself going this far right flank again going to my left are you number four um no i'm three i guess i'll see you on the mini map oh no got big gloves oh there's a guy there what number are you um i think i'm one okay i'm either one or three i think i'm three oh god they just bought my building that was a loud explosion kill the one outside your building i guess it's actually one of those games the movement's a bit clunky once you understand it you can learn and find ways to capitalize on it use it yeah i actually don't mind that in games when there's a learning curve all right i've spawned on you i think killed the guy that was shooting to your right that's nice guys the guy that says resin yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna go grab their gear because i need it i'm running out of ammo time for the mad dash is it charlie come on let me land this shot oh god i'm gonna die i got i just ran into one by accident he ran into a shot took his gun oh he's got a gover 33. nice what's that this medkit is sick dude especially me if you don't get hit with a critical shot you can just revive yourself hop off son oh the moose and carbine oh my gosh looked in the distance and i'm seeing where they've spawned looks mental performance is nice i think i have at least 100 yes yeah there we go this is it you might just win this game stud and i'm dead so what we've already we've already played four different maps so far this one actually weirdly even though it's quite flat is actually one of the better ones yeah i like this map a lot a lot of places to hide there's lots of cover builders themselves feel like feel pretty well you can hide in the trenches if you don't want to be running out in the open as well because i know i've seen a lot of people just run the open but they're not taking the trenches yeah a lot of places to hide in the buildings i think i'm just behind you i'm running into a building there yeah people hiding in there yeah i'm not leaning enough almost either i'm going to i'm going to head down the trench on the right and just go on the left side of this building we win we win we did it boys i'd love if the rounds lasted a bit longer even if you're memen well i mean i guess we played the objective pretty well there held them off yeah it feels like that was that was a difficult push for them on their side of the spawn yeah look at us look at us damn how did that one guy get 26 sister kills he wants to be flying the plane oh the 20 yeah i think that because that's the guy in the plane i'm pretty sure yeah [Music] ggs [Music] uh
