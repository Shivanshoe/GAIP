so i recently made a video dedicated to the clean house mission from modern warfare 2019 and in it i spoke about my appreciation for the immersive sense of realism and methodical gameplay of that level and i was looking through the comments on that video a few days ago and i noticed that a small number of you guys had suggested i try a little known game called zero hour now i immediately recognized that name and it turns out i actually had the game on my steam wishlist after hearing about its development a couple of years ago and i guess when it finally released it just never popped up on my radar again and i totally forgot about his existence however zero hour has just had its one year anniversary and has evidently come a very long way in that time and in august of this year a couple of weeks ago at the time that i'm making this video the game had a fairly substantial update with new maps weapons features and bug fixes which has brought with it an influx of new players so after doing some research watching a few youtube videos and checking out the very positive reviews on steam i decided to purchase and download the game for myself to see what the fuss was all about the developers describe zero hour as a serious slow paced tactical shooter where good teamwork tactics and planning is important and in the last two days alone i've been recording footage for this video i've played about 13 hours of the game already and i can now say with absolute certainty that this is one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played i only wish i downloaded it sooner because games like these just don't come along very often it's not perfect by any means and there is still some work to be done before it leaves early access but even now in its current state i genuinely think that it's one of those must-have games on steam and it's an absolute steal right now too remember that badass rainbow six siege world premiere trailer from a few years ago when that game was first announced yeah you know the one and how different the gameplay experience felt when it fully released even more so now while this game is that experience there is no crazy destruction here that allows you to tear up floors and ceilings and walls like siege does but the game does have a lot of other things going for it one of these things is procedural prop placement where entrances and hallways could be blocked by furniture that might not have been there in the previous round and objects that you would use for cover so chairs tables couches can all change position between rounds another cool thing is that the maps themselves are also real world scale and what i mean by that is typically in video games corridors and stairways are designed in a way that gives you as the player plenty of space to move around to evade shots and duck for cover in this game however these areas are intentionally claustrophobic with very little cover so if you want to run back down that staircase but your teammates are stacked up behind you then you had better be on comms with your team to let them know you need to fall back he's down this game does not hold your hand and it won't even let you cue into a multiplayer match until you've proven yourself worthy in the shooting range you need to set a respectable time for yourself in the training course and show that you have a basic understanding of the game's mechanics you can customize and save loadouts before entering a match and once in the game you can make any adjustments that you need to during the planning phase every weapon can be customized to fit any situation or playstyle and there's a great selection to choose from here including one of my personal favorites the as val customizations include various sights rail attachments and muzzles and each attachment will affect how the gun behaves things like recoil damage and the weight of your gun attackers can't equip night vision goggles and hit the breaker switch on the map which causes a complete blackout for all players and as you can see from the defenders perspective it does get very dark indeed so you will need to use flashlights to find your way around flashlights themselves are a direct counter to night vision goggles since the attacking team won't be able to see your silhouette very easily when you're shining a bright white light in their face and each team has a unique selection of utilities the attacking team for example could bring a flare frag flashbang or c2 charge and even an underdoor camera to check behind the door before breaching defenders on the other hand can bring with them all of the grenades that i just mentioned but also door trap c4 a door wedge to prevent a door being opened or my personal favorite a deployable spy cam which you and the rest of your team can cycle between alongside the pre-existing cctv cameras i've found some great angles with these things which have enabled me to make crucial call-outs for my teammates and act like an extra pair of eyes when i'm the last man standing you can see him on my spy cam right now i'm in third floor two of them this camera is sick oh my god three of them three of them coming in the room now i can flank them hold on you're on the perfect flank another one in the room is so good shoot through that door oh my god that was beautiful you got him i was always a valkyrie main in rainbow six siege so this makes me very happy he's going for the fuse now if you can get there good good good good the game even has an anti-spawn peak period during the planning phase where defenders cannot leave the building by opening doors or breaking through windows you can leave the building 60 seconds after the attack has begun but by that time the attackers have probably already entered the building uh two confirmed dead west stairs and the matchmaking system itself is seriously robust for a game like this too including steam guard so you have the choice to only queue with other verified steam users and get this optional skill based matchmaking with penalties for leaving a match features like these are honestly so refreshing to see and as we all know hard to come by in modern aaa titles it's not the prettiest looking game you've ever seen but it's not ugly either and sacrifices visual fidelity in favour of performance which i appreciate and so far the game has been running really well for me with zero crashes or freezing if you can't already tell i'm really excited to play some more of this game in the future but if you enjoy this content and you want to see more of this game on the channel then let it be known by dropping a like on this video with the basics out of the way and instead of telling you how the game works i figured i'd show you so i've got a full match here that i think you're really going to enjoy i also think i did a pretty decent job with my commentary in this match as i tried my best to explain every feature that i encountered which should help you to understand how it all works and considering that this game isn't all about kills i kind of popped off in this one too which is a bonus with that being said i really hope you enjoyed the video and i just want to say a quick thank you for all of your support on the variety content i've been posting lately your continued viewership across all of the games i play really means a lot to me so thank you all for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one oh damn it there was a guy in my right i could have clutched that all right night vision on boys okay all right we're going to do the m4 i'm going to put that viper sight on as well suppressor ads pad got the foregrip on there and go with the infrared laser for my night vision goggles bring that underdoor camera as well all right so this is the planning table the bomb is here where that pulse is and we'll choose the front alley to spawn i'm gonna go through the window into downstairs and then i'll get the clouds yep sounds good goose i'll stack up on you all right we're in let's do this yeah so this is your typical round-based 5v5 competitive match cool all right get that power up upstairs bathroom clear [Music] get the power if you can stuff yeah yeah work our way down i'm gonna go back the way we came right scrapple up be careful of these windows you good copy moving up to you now eyes on third floor she must the guy he just killed hammers out living room and he comes another one downstairs roger take him roof i think the enemy can get up there stuck up on goose here camera down above your head oh yeah let's forget about that one check my magazine there's a trap right there free look in this game as well oh [ __ ] hello enemy down power is on by the way what's that yeah i need to reload everyone's in the room to the right if you go through that door there's no trap on my screen but okay confirm that kill this is sketchy as hell just heard movement on the right hand side let's go flash in there hopefully that rebounds yeah i didn't see that i was really confused yeah you like on my skin you just walked through one and nothing happened it was still different oh i've got the nvg glitch i had this yesterday do you have mvp i have night vision goggles on here permanently i mean very beneficial for the vendors i got this glitch yesterday but the whole team had it instead that camera is so broken look at the spy cam i've just put up that looks down the stairs that's sick i've got top door covered sounds like they've just repelled up here yep they're open one enemy down top door [Music] i'm farming these guys the fourth repellent might have got him oh no he's off he's up top floor i'm dead jesus he's top roof just watch the spy camps on this i deserve that he's coming in top four now making his way down from roof access yeah it's now on third holding third just holding top stairs now looking down to third i think he knows which level you're on he's throwing a grenade oh my god the perfect frag good plan of action guys i like that yeah it's good good technique did you know that spawn spawn killings actually against the rules in this game yeah yeah i know it's good that the maps are designed in a way that prevents it i don't know why well there's a big problem in siege i think it was because of the siege i think goose has got an underdog camera here all right shelf room looks clear nice ready when you are if i press f like that it taps him on the shoulder to let him know that i'm ready i think he gets an audio queue for it which is really good if you're not on comms i'm going for power i'll see you oh i'm good i've got him power's down but i'm flashed and shot from second someone should be the c4 do hear a c4 don't know where man downstairs yeah i got him kill confirmed i got really messy [ __ ] once right at the top of the stairs right at the top like next to the door he's confirmed yeah i'm gonna try and make my way to the roof repel up i know there's a door here that's closed though taking roof now eyes on objective room yeah watch out right literally right through the door that's where he is that was risky could have got shot from that window there if i got any grenades yeah i've got a flashbang enemy down reloading and moving in yeah i think it's the we do yeah i think so need to clear these stairs bombs behind that door enemy down that's one left and if you just go upstairs and push in yeah got no flashbangs left it's going to be on point isn't he somewhere i don't know like that's all of point blank range pretty sure that was an ace as well that was a nice round they got to the stage yeah flash in [Music] lots of shots one down enemy down third floor running for objective room oh is that an enemy i think it was there's movement uh first floor below me yeah you got me moving to second goose nice that guy just took a head shot i think you might have like just hit the frame of the railing would definitely hit him as well because i saw the blower yeah maybe i'd stop the damage stop most of the damage i think yeah they really like the hostage rooms that's likely where they're going to be there's always at least two of them in there do god donate snake man he's right room in the kitchen whoever's on the stairs this guy's got ryan shield he's gonna have a difficult time with our team stacked up behind him [Music] yeah i'm lucky dude nice try last round boys let's get this dub let's get it match point yeah so the weapons have uses in this game no night vision this time yeah i can't use night vision now so i'm going to pick the mp7 for this round with a hip fire laser instead of a use the ir laser bomb main office it's a hard room to push i think we immediately take roof and work our way down to that first floor staircase don't really want to repel on that side so play those rooms good luck boys let's get it done match point now so whoever wins this round wins the whole game let's be careful of these windows hmm oh onto the exterior door be careful if you're repelling on my right hand side it's on the other side of the door you probably spray through it and kill him i need to do this myself one down behind the balcony door you see his foot sticking out i'm breaching balcony door cover me if you [Music] i can know if that's a kill i think i got one i could be wrong but he's a little happy the way i've got one in the hallway that's two down potentially three i'm moving in down like this bathroom clear hold an angle your visual got killed from hostage room the kill goose this guy uh in the hostage room i died from the right hand side of you now yep through there i'm glad goose is at least on comms [Music] not getting a whole lot back from my other is what teammates is there are a lot of players in this game who use comms i probably say 70 of my matches i've got at least two or three team members using comms is it 1v1 goose it is yeah yeah so the reason you have to press f to confirm your kills is because if you see at the top there you can see it's a shows goose's health he's the blue icon and there's two red enemies but that one enemy hasn't been confirmed yet i'm really sorry if i [ __ ] this up now you got this goose i believe three minutes 20 on the clock take all the time you need that door is open on the right if you want to use that yes dude let's go good game gg hey look at me down 13 and 14 we've popped off that game and we did man look at us go that's high kills for this game you clutched it too [Music] you
