okay let's get the mirror gun under the door no but oh wait where have you come from i blast him through the door surely i must have gone yes oh my god please put the gun down let's try this again hello there um hello why was he standing like that let's just open the door okay i'm dead already assuming this goes outside then yeah okay get down now hands up there's another outside oh my god i'm dead here this room's clear oh no not like this are you kidding me send the boys in first this time come on let's get them okay great job let's just restart shall we hi everybody welcome back to ready or not it's been a couple of weeks since i last played this game and i had the itch to come back to it they've actually updated the game recently for the supporter edition hence why i'm playing solo today because none of my friends own it but all of this stuff should be coming to the standard edition very soon there's some new weapons you can see here the r7 launcher the mk16 and the mk1 carbine which i believe is a supporter exclusive so i'm going to be showcasing this gun today let's go full auto [Music] not too difficult to control the recoil that foregrip is helping but let's try and shoot without pulling down on the mouse yeah very little horizontal which we like we've got the speed reload and the normal reload i don't usually use full auto when i'm in a raid but the recoil still applies so yeah lots of cool stuff in this update they've actually made some map changes as well there's three new test maps i believe and they've added five new game modes to the existing maps which you can see here i tried to play active shooter on my own and it was so difficult you can see i've got an f definitely need to bring some friends along next time today though we're going to be playing raid the suspects are highly dangerous they will not be so easy to give up and your rules of engagement have been loosened as a result prepare for long engagements and a lot of firefights sounds like fun doesn't it so we'll be playing on twisted nerve which is one of the new newly changed maps i should say but let's get right into it and here we are so this bottom sector that i have spawned in yes i do have point um this is entirely new so you might have seen or played this map before you'll definitely recognize it more in just a moment but this entire area has been expanded so it's a much bigger map now follow the lock let's get the guy's turn clear breach with a shotgun in position okay i guess he's dead good work bingo we found the mess one more to go some behind the door drop it don't go down this door was causing me a lot of problems earlier okay hello i'm awake now all right we're clear it's currently 2 am so uh this game is giving me the jump scares i do not need i did try recording earlier in the day but didn't really work out for me there's one he's dead i wasn't gonna shoot until he shot first i don't know if there's civilians about let's make sure he doesn't come back as a zombie secure his gun real quick and we keep moving don't like this house but i don't think he can get in that one this is where you probably recognize the map if you've played it before the older version i don't know if there's people on the street so did not like how you were running at me with that gun in hand has expired that's your problem not mine all right the hell who are you shooting at oh god they're on the street as well yes boys love that came up on the flank i didn't even tell you to do that awesome friendly ai is actually pretty smart in this game they get in the way sometimes but i do like how much control you have over them it's really cool okay check mags we're good time to enter the house let's breach with a shotgun again use a shotgun on the door then click on that sir boys are moving up into position they see someone through the window oh shots fired shots fired get in there lads shots behind the bookshelf might have got the kill there i think i did get behind me lance come on i'll take point living room shut this door get the magic wand under there looks clear check this door as well give myself some light buy them let's kick this door down eyes on that staircase moving clear let's get the guys to cover it i'm going to work on this door holy that's a good job i got him to check it that guy must have snuck down the staircase right as i turn my back on him notifying trailers i could have got killed there trying to send the boys in let's get this door open we're in my god i should be dead that was a bad breach on my part you're just hiding in here right mirror time this room caught me out before there's someone hiding in this corner clear next door how did you die oh wait it was me the other one who shot me from inside i guess i killed you then notifying trailers good work tom and i got the one behind the bookshelf twins with apparently all right let's keep moving moving corners clear footsteps you know what boys i got this moving clear moving up excuse me right i heard voices let's get a flashbang on that door actually the footsteps are in here cancel that open the door clear it all right roger that copy that locked okay breach with shotgun flashbang deploy flashbangs we're clear she was pointing that gun right at me that was a split second decision and she's dead now probably could have got her to surrender but it's a bit too late for that isn't it oh well you can't dwell on the past in this line of work all right upstairs here we go split the team into two now i'm gonna keep two on the ground floor two come up with me moving steps on the right as well worry about this building for now shout behind this boat case we're good so intense this game never know what to expect let's get mirror under here room on the right line to the cover on the left there is a guy there i'm not putting anything down on you are you are you civilian oh my god i almost killed you i thought you were holding a gun i could have gone so wrong all right let's get a mirror on that door mirror for suspect and then i will mirror this door got the mirror here get two simultaneous updates kids room clear no traps one connecting door no traps here copy one suspect i'm gonna get the guys to breach this one reach with shotgun hopefully get him to comply and flashbang deploy shotgun and clear gonna hold this angle sounds good yes good work lads get on the floor get a sworn off as well good job is backwards to the door get out my way he's reporting great work keep it up one suspect armed looks passive but if i crack this door open and she shoots she's dying it's over not worth the risk put your hands up why did you sure you could have lived we've got a dead suspect here i should have tried to get a flashbang through the door actually i would have been the better player still my life for yours in that situation and the enemies kind of have aimbot in this game sometimes which is another thing they're changing in this game they're making it so that enemies have a an accuracy bonus give you more time to react she had a gun i'm not taking any chances i've died too many times today trying to get enemies to comply i'm gonna change mine this house is massive you chose the wrong door to stand behind what the hell swan is he dead now it's a good job i gave you a right shield isn't this one would have blasted your head off suspect has expired all right first house clear they've actually made some makeshift bridge here that connects the two houses this one's being fumigated by the looks of it that was cool when i turn my flashlight on their flashlights turn on ram the door deploy flashbangs copy that switch to the team cam you can see that point of view busting down the door now we're in flashbang out corners are clear good work team steps on the other side of the store let's check it out shall we all way clear they're in that room door locked all right boys kick it down clear it down clear the room copy that let's knock this i've already been shot up quite a bit so gotta be careful leave it to my man prescott to take point this is the door wait there's a tripwire there but there's nothing attached to it we'll cut it anyway it might be an alarm system or something right let's have a look what's going on oh two arm suspects and a third potentially armed ah you know what deploy screw it then flashback we're going with the c2 charge shock and all i'm gonna hold this doorway as well fire in the hole in place good luck boys no you don't what well they'll die to the safe oh my god has expired the explosion killed them the door just crushed that one woman wait where is the third body oh here oh my god this has been a pretty messy raid let's be honest in the best way there's the meth as well more steps yeah copy that oh my god that was a crazy breach broke so many rules there they're all on though i think yeah yeah all three of them had a gun i wasn't sure about the third i didn't think she'd be killed but big yikes okay the other side of that door looks good all right let's go one more kick nice get down i want to see shut the store behind me who are you seeing my god nice work boys stay in position uh get the mirror gun under that use the mirror we'll take care of it switch the team cam so i can watch the guys on the stairs can't see through the door this time no need to worry there aren't any traps here all right copy that let's get it open of course it's logged it's a good job i'm an expert pick lock lock picker i don't know all right let's get in there room clear one door probably a bathroom or something oh hello have you come to die the boy who lives nope sounds like he died oh my god we've got a dead suspect here yeah he's dead alright holy continue that kick was insane all right moving to ground floor one suspect get on the ground i'm dead finally someone surrendered what are you doing god he was ducking and diving all over the place i assume that corn is clear otherwise someone would have run out we've got a dead suspect here keep those hands up yeah well you should have thought about that one door to check clear all right then guys i think that's going to do it for this video we've completed all of the objectives and we can leave whenever we want but just want to show you this lower expansion one more time really cool that they're willing to add to the current maps and change them up a bit definitely ask for the experience and there's a lot more that i haven't shown in this update so if you want to see more let me know in the comments drop a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more and uh yeah we'll probably revisit this again with some friends in the future but it's equally fun playing solo it kind of offers a different experience when you get to command your team i think it's done pretty well so if you are a solo player definitely don't write this game off there's plenty of content to explore on your own and i think the game will have a single player story at some point so keep an eye out for that let's see what our ranking was for that mission looking pretty good so far i don't know how many penalties we're gonna have though one trap triggered i don't remember that but we'll take a c ranking that's not bad at all all right then i'm off to bed i think thanks for watching guys i hope you enjoyed that stay safe and i will catch you legends in the next one
