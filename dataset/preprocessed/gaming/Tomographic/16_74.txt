so after my last zero hour video went down so well with you guys and i had a bunch of requests to play this game with some of my friends i was able to convince fogler acolyte stomato64 and jack frags to each download the game and squad up with me and yeah let's just say it went exactly how i expected it to oh i didn't even get it okay it makes me laugh every time dude every single time he gets right so if you right click you can put markers down so i'm putting a marker where the hostage is you guys should be able to see that in the game no what jesus you see where the pulsing thing is stone no pulsing thing it's a pulse stop drawing penises everywhere this guy down here oh where are the enemies i died around [Music] [Music] oh boy i'm sorry guys this is gonna be awful thankfully though acolyte was there to clutch it in our desperate time of need so you left connor let's go yeah yeah there it is how did you see him guys oh my god we played a little bit of the game's multiplayer but i thought it would be best to first get the guys started in the co-op game mode which many of you guys suggested where you fight against some pretty clever ai combatants with a few objectives to complete along the way and if you have a competent team all working together to clear rooms and eliminate targets in an orderly fashion this mode can really scratch that tactical shooter itch what you're about to see though is five mates who apparently find it very challenging to coordinate effectively at all even in the most simple of scenarios just know that this is not an accurate example of how this game is supposed to be played alright we're just idiots drop a like if you like subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one is your team damage on fire is on oh yeah i'm gonna have a game boys outside what kill him i don't wanna take all the kills oh whoa do you even know if they're hostiles this is a hostile environment power is to your left jack press space power steel what's this tripwire here behind you okay good disable that ow why did you shoot i killed a guy what's going on right i'm on fire right i've what is numpad five i don't have that i don't have anything either where my comments are like this oh [ __ ] there's a tripwire at the door i haven't had any time to explain to you guys what's going on because you're all just okay so if you see someone you don't have to you don't have to shoot them if they're on their own if you press x you'll get them down and you can arrest them okay no it does as they're putting their hands up you can shoot the weapons out of their hands uh make sure to clear rooms completely because they will be hiding in covers and stuff okay so we can only change our controls from the main menu this that's good the keybinds yeah at all yeah you can change fob oh come on guys oh my gosh i could use some assistance on the second floor guys i've been dead for like a minute he has been there for a while he walked into a truck and got shot i didn't i was on the stairs there was no two bar on the stairs and i think his night vision goes dark don't have mvgs you don't have night vision press caps lock over one of their bodies connie you might be able to take their mvgs over one of their bodies yeah what is this they'll check their inventory you might be able to take the night vision goggles that way do they have a uh okay we're turning power on for this one because kind of forgot his night vision idiot idiot literally the smallest yeah 12 seconds well we're dead on the stairs oh he's got dropped dead wait oh i just okay when you go around this door to your right there's a hall to your right in the hallway you one tap me bro no no right yeah this way this way boom boom boom boom oh damn i got him oh it's him all right sick did you throw a grenade no know i don't have grenades on me i was checking if you had one these are the cameras there's cameras yeah so like siege there's cameras around the map but they aren't going to use the cameras well i'm doing it so you would question it oh it's the camera you know yeah i've watched your videos i already know it's stuff that's true jack it's true all right i've got 10 hp all the way through four adds as well bloody hell i just don't know hey i opened that where this hostage is going to be because it told us in the main menu but youtube has drawn penises over everything oh he's cheating he's cheating dude i was trying so hard to find the location of the hostage on the map it was just like scribbles over it hold on we can go straight into the multiplayer if you want but like i think no no no no no no no we're not ready for that we're not ready bro okay double let's double here i'm going to double here we go again dude then this side this side all the way up all the way up if you uh i want to make some uh something there he goes here if he plays games like this is what he lives for right i knew he was going to do this the moment i realized you could draw on the map there's actually a blank canvas over here so and you can draw every light lit i need more i need more length i need more length you know what i'm saying team effort it's like you trail the trail of the [Music] the roof press space when you're at the edge of your wall i can't turn my flashlight up there's a light there's there's it got it clear it should oh it only yeah no it only uh wow i got a good arm it only turned over to my abs you just sniped somebody you put how'd you do the repel thing dude i don't know what the hell anything is i just wanted i just explained it you have to understand i wasn't listening there's an enemy in there tom nice that's a hostage if you're shooting a head on the left okay i'm shooting the guy on the right just shut down tommy how do we get through this oh i'm bleeding it's procedural prop placement jacking watch my video so sometimes that's blocked sometimes it isn't i don't know i thought i'm a swat operator how can we his head off i thought he was in the other room hostages there's two hostages okay there you go right clear rooms play rooms i think we already cleared this right go back to where we spawn then the left door is blocked by a door wedge if you look that's a gadget that the defenders can have in the multiplayer kick it open don't worry you can you can't get a jack jack yeah you can't whack it i'm wagging this one keep kicking it oh yeah i need to fall back i'm getting blasted open up your pass here we probably should have sat the hostage down outside because he's still tethered your hostage is just walking in point point she'll meet chill will he jump over this i can't jump over this table no you can't vault furniture the hostage won't follow me guys it's procedural placement so that's blocked yeah i remember you mentioning that in that video oh my god 10 hp oh oh i just saw you go down sir yeah you can't go in on a man taking a poop like that tom you should know better he's in the cupboard there's so many bad guys down here we're owning first floor can you wall bang stuff yes i'm going to take a [ __ ] in this bathroom over here much if i just [ __ ] my pants dude oh my god that was the truth i don't know what's going on wrong look for tripwires on the bottom of doors i just died the same way come with me buddy you're probably going to die you have better odds take them he won't follow you he's not going to follow me where's your hostage stone they won't jump off he was up there you left him on the roof oh here's one maybe this is him i think he knows where are you yeah that's something on the ground dude he's doing something i think he's putting dirt in his eyes oh there's a screen marker press f on him fm i can't f him dude i already have tomorrow here i am earlier bro yes five minutes let's go okay all of you go and stand on the green point he's just putting dirt in his eyes i don't get it you might have just done it because they're
