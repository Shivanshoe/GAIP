if you're not already using the swiss sniper in warzone uh you're doing it wrong raven have been showing a lot of love for this sniper rifle and the pick rate for its closest competitor the car 98k has seen a pretty significant decrease since the swiss k31 started to receive some equally significant buffs i mean this gun has already been buffed like what five times already in a couple of months and it really feels like they're trying to phase out the car 98k which is definitely still a preference for some players anyway i've got an absolute banger of a match for you today one that really showcases the power of the swiss when you learn to play aggressive and can use the increased mobility and abs time to your advantage this is my updated build for war zone focusing on just that and is proven to be very effective as you're about to see before that though a quick word from today's sponsor alienware who were gracious enough to send me one of their new alienware m15 r5 ryzen edition laptops it's a powerful little machine and one that combines an 8 core amd ryzen 9 5900 hx with an nvidia rtx 3070 laptop gpu how i said that in one breath i have no idea the rtx 3070 enables you to make the most of great features like dlss or deep learning super sampling as well as the more recent introduction of nvidia reflex helping to give you the advantage in competitive games like warzone by reducing and optimizing your system's latency and the real showstopper for me personally is this amazing 1440p 240hz panel games look fantastic as you'd expect and are obviously very smooth but it didn't take long for me to adjust as i already play warzone on a display with the same specifications but the fact that you're getting desktop performance in a portable small form factor is outstanding and i think alienware have put together a really solid package here i've really enjoyed my time with this laptop over the last couple of weeks and if you want to learn more about the alienware m1505 then make sure to check out the link in the description below and a huge thank you to alienware for sponsoring this one so with that being said let's get into the gameplay leave a like
