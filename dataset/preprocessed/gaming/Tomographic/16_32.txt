[Music] [Music] wow [Music] nice [Music] [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to rider's republic and boy am i addicted to this game at the moment it just has no right to be this fun i mean seriously i've put way too much time into this game lately so if you're watching this video now then it means that i finally found the motivation to edit all the footage so if you could drop a like on the video it would really help me out now they have added some new gear since the last time i played like the freestyle snowmobile and this bad boy the electric jumbo bike look at the girth on those tires it's enough to make a grown man cry and it's surprisingly agile as well unlike the neanderthal you're currently listening to all right so the plan for today is just to have a bit of fun play some of the new mass races and career events and essentially show you what this game is all about if this is your first time seeing it it's been out a few months now and personally i think this game deserves so much more praise writer's republic is easily the most enjoyable and polished aaa game that i've played in recent memory and there is bucket loads of content to sink your teeth into so how's about we start with one of my favorite aspects of the game the mass races baby time to tune in to the first round all right gamers this is it this is everything we've trained for let's get it it's time to make my mother proud and we're off look how many people are on my screen right now this is a 64 player race with three rounds and i need to do the best i can each race it's a multi-sport race as well so we're starting on skis here but at certain checkpoints we're going to change gear completely like this one here so these are the speed skis exactly what it sounds like it's a pair of skis with two rockets attached to them you can see my speed in the bottom right chasing first right now desperately trying to hit trees oh my god that guy almost took me out oh god the pressure's on into the rocket wing these races get pretty crazy i love it i mean this thing definitely doesn't exist in real life i feel like people have got close to creating something like this but it's always failed everyone has different level gear as well so the more time you put into the game the more high level gear you're gonna get you're in first at the halfway point it's good this is good there's someone right on my ass though looking at that timer in the top left oh god the tree good recovery there though [Music] there is a rewind feature if you crash like that but you lose like three seconds when you do it so stop it i could have landed closer to the ground now it's okay though just gotta nail these corners this guy is fast i don't know if i'm catching name him over he's got the legendary helmet too with the the smoke coming out of it that's one thing uh you can grind for in this game you get stars with every event you do and that guy acquired 7 000 stars to get that helmet [Music] that was the final switch okay last switch gate so we're staying in the rocker wing now i like going in first person with this because it's a bit more controllable i can see the obstacles more clearly come on i don't catch enough that guy is really fast go through these risky but i'll save the time where i can i don't know someone's overtaking me i'm not using my boost enough last corner okay hit the boost hit the boost at the boost yes what performance that was i think i came second i'd be happy with third but come on i held second for so long at the end superstar your top three okay nice second place i get two stars for coming in the top three actually let me check what rocky wing this guy had oh yeah there's no chance i was catching up with that that's an elite rocket wing okay on to round two here we go all right into the next round i can relax a little bit because i came second in the first race that doesn't mean it's gonna be any easier get ready it only means that i'm in a better standing if i fail which i'm not going to do these first moments are crucial you need to get out in front early because if you get stuck with a pack you'll just get knocked out so quickly eighth place right now let's see if we can catch up faster lines rock a wing next high speed low drag awesome obstacles on the way careful of those nice work now put the screws on and get into that top three yeah those guys are flying man okay i think it's pike next yep here we rash and go for it that's the beauty of this game though everyone's at different points in their careers so if i spend more time on the bike than most people then i'll be in a better standing in the bike portion of the race yes okay there's a big rock coming up now i need to be careful so stay on the left side oh yeah there it is again careful of the trees this time it's just so fun this game man i love it for the trees okay oh no i clipped it oh i've got to rewind too that's three seconds gone and everyone's overtaking me oh god it's all gone wrong at the end oh man the last obstacle are you kidding me what a point to crash oh god you know it could have been worse that's just how the mass races go sometimes this is the last round go for it oh what's this one i haven't done this before oh my god we're doing the bikes the jumbo bikes look at us that's insane oh this is gonna be a fun one let's go time for some savage ravage oh my god this is gonna get hectic this is an all-terrain electric bike with massive tires one of the new vehicles that had recently but this is a whole new track that they've added so i don't know what to expect this is so sick oh god that tree i'm just on my front wheel i think oh and then a massive rock out of nowhere i can't catch a break oh my god come on man why you gotta do me like that game 35th now keep calm riders victory requires patience all right that's good advice it's good advice okay yes we're on to the skis i have a good pair of skis so hopefully i can catch up now yes get wrecked massive pileup of players there [Music] i put a lot of time into the ski races in the in the career mode so i have an elite pair of skis that should help me close the gap this mass race is causing a storm just the way i like it let's see what you can bring to the second half okay halfway take this guy on the left i'm a little nudge as well little love tap miss that red arrow there if i go over these red arrows i get a little bit of a speed boost okay back to the jumbo bike [Music] i've realized too everyone's on an even playing field with this bike because it's just put in the cabbage it's one of the new toys so it's just the same level for everyone so we're all going exactly the same speed the only way i can really make up for time is hitting these arrows when i can and climbing the corners perfectly so not like that what is that corner who designed that it's like a perfect right angle sorry we're still in it i'm surprised i didn't fall off there to be honest [Music] i was very lucky just took the full force of that corner i'm on your ass big friendly ginge move over yes come on i'm gonna take him oh no i messed up i went so wide why have i done this ninth place okay that was crazy not bad at all nice work yeah ninth place not too bad out of 64 players will take it your riding was on point today hey we came sixth in the end still came top ten so i'll get a nice bonus for that not quite the podium finish i was looking for but congrats to these guys i guess that guy dancing on the left i mean look at me i've really got the moves career level up as well i think that was the rocket wing but i only got 2 000 bucks that's annoying you can get new gear whenever you level up but sometimes it just gives you a cash bonus all right i want to do another jumbo bike race if i can find one that was really fun uh jumbo edition i've done that one already let's do this one yeah so this entire map is free where i'm like it's kind of crazy it's a really diverse looking map too there's loads of different areas but there's honestly just so much content in this game so many different events and multiplayer modes really good fun with friends this one i mean if you want new gear like you have to do the events but there's still a lot of fun to be had with the free roam okay let's do it we'll do it on elite as well i need to finish this race in one minute 45 i think so i really need to floor it i don't know how long this course is going to be but i mean this bike absolutely flies so i don't think it'll be too much trouble as long as i don't mess up i've said it now these track points i love the sound of the bike on the snow sounds really good whoa almost at that rock big jump coming up quick spin why not that's why i heard they actually to get the crunch down for the snow in this game they just like crumbled up polystyrene there's like so many movies in games i guess that just use the most obscure things to recreate sound effects this course is really long actually i might not do this i'm 78 of the way there one minute 10 seconds in 35 seconds to go i'm surprised i haven't come off yet this bike takes a lot of uh absorption takes the full impact i should say oh wait there's the finish line oh we got this easy four minute 30 we're gonna do this in yes and we got all of the secondary objectives complete this bike is awesome you'd really struggle if you just had a standard bike going down the snow like that jesus look at me it's just such a massive open world i'm in the northern region right now but to the south there's just like open desert and canyons and stuff it's really cool what's that sound oh god there's a freaking bear ah okay everyone i think we're gonna call it there for today that was really fun though i hope you enjoyed that i don't know how much of this footage i'm gonna use because i've been playing for like four hours now but time just escapes me when i play this game i start recording and i just forget to commentate it's definitely one of those games let me get this collectible real quick and then i'll do my outro i don't actually know what you get for finding all 500 but there's a lot to look for anyway that's it for this one i think there's still a lot i haven't shown you about writer's republic but it's just too much to cram into one video but yeah if you enjoyed it drop a like subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music] you
