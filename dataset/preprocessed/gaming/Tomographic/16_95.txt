all right hello everyone and welcome back to sniper ghost warrior contracts 2. now we came from this direction in the last episode and we ended around here somewhere and i believe we have to go up to the right climb up this scaffolding here i think our next objective was to disable some sort of radio antenna i have eyes on the antenna array that must be it raven received disable it and let's open this country up to the 21st century i don't understand why hellstrom wants to wreck this system with his skills i'd just exploit it earn a few million hmm apparently you don't share his political philosophy i don't have a political philosophy did someone say collateral speaking of which we've got a rebellion to start noted i'm oscar mike i'm tom i can't wait to see how the people react when western news starts to spread control out i had to get the collateral there you know i did mark these guys there's a sniper up top there's another one behind him can we get another collateral though place your bets now definitely got one of them surely not no i was zeroed 100 again i need to do this fast oh that was the money shot really threaded the needle there it's not too carried away that guy's gonna get found easily if i kill him in the road i need to play the waiting game it gives us a chance to scout the area get everyone else marked it's a sniper up there oh big chungus is on patrol go down here binoculars and another scout over there this is the tower that we need to disable though i think it said in the briefing that we need to shoot these lights in sequence it's three lights and three separate motors attached to the tower so let's get over there find an angle for the first one if you guys are keen to see more videos on this game by the way make sure to leave a like really helps the algorithm lets youtube know that i'm not just a warzone channel i do play a lot of fps games i try to upload some variety here and there and uh the response to the first video on this particular game was overwhelmingly positive i was reading some of the comments earlier today and you guys are great so if you could give this video the same treatment that would be awesome if you find yourself coming back to the channel frequently then make sure you're subscribed the next few months are going to be very exciting indeed okay let's try to do this in one breath raven take your shot don't push it yeah i know three in critical control first motor is disabled lovely can't hit the other gear motors from here acknowledged move to second position moving standby not sure how he was talking whilst holding his breath i do need to get over to that side of the array oh there's a scout way up there look at that guy take you out first otherwise he'd spot the other guy zero to 300 it's a lot of wind come on tom bingo never gets old oh perfect shot sees binoculars rolled down the mountain all right you're next now do we zero at 200 or 300 it's 250 meters out let's go for 200. i was risky i went for the head shot but i just caught him in the chest i think maybe the neck didn't spot that guy before it's a few on that platform i actually don't know if the enemies with binoculars can spot me at this range it's a zip line here that i can use so we've disabled that one got two motors left i think the plan is we'll save that one till last because i probably need to be about there to find an angle the second we need to be at a higher vantage point there's a lot of enemies in my way so we've got some work to do this guy seems like an easy target only to zero [Music] can't go down now this guy is going to be a problem i need to bait him onto the other side of that road barricade come on i'm throwing rocks by the way i don't think i was able to demonstrate that feature in the last video yes that's a good boy he's in the ferns as well no one's ever gonna find him there i'm sorry is that a mortar not sure i want to find out swear to god if there's anyone any higher than that guy i think we're all right okay this guy could probably take out but this dude will see it i'll have the cleanest shot on these two right now has to be this guy gotta be quick oh no that's gross oh my god he was just about to see that that was my last bullet too these guys moved all no where are you going i'm still zeroed very nearly shot him whilst i was zeroed at 100 again that's a mistake that i make far too often the bullet always goes over them so i need to make a habit of checking that i'm not still zeroed from my last kill wonder if i missed anyone down here is that just a flag blowing in the wind what is that there's more guys on the road don't come down here jesus that was close it's another one as if you just drop down like that that's actually really cool this guy's dead anyone else hiding good that was bad scouting on my part i missed two critical targets that could have seen me dropping their friends below them i think they came from uphill a separate patrol this is a pretty large area so large region i should say enemies can arrive from patrol at any time the jic i do see i'm really paranoid now there's someone i've missed i think we're clear risky shot i was about to take it i was about to take it i need to switch to armor-piercing rounds to take out big chungus over here currently patrolling the main entrance to the antenna should be able to take him out fairly easily it's whether or not this guy's going to see it there's three of them as well where are you going still there we go look at the size of that bullet thank god i seem to do the trick okay i can't let anyone find that body now three guys on that catwalk if we get three man collateral i doubt it i had a split up oh no i need to take the shot [Music] okay those guys are moving back to position no no no no no no please go back downstairs don't walk towards the juggernaut guy turn left yes these guys keep changing up their patrol patterns it's really throwing me off guard oh that goes up there now as well i'm gonna go for the collateral on these two and then take that guy out the angle's not perfect but if i do this correctly the bullet will pass through the first guys cranium and out of the second guy's neck that's it almost a perfect lineup i called that and this guy didn't hear a thing oh that's funny that was a good stealth run though i think that's everyone all right let's take the uh zipline down i did get distracted a bit there and uh kind of neglected the objective well i thought there might have been an opportunity for a three-man collateral but if this is the guy that i thought it was yeah the one that we saw patrolling this side of the uh the antenna who very nearly cost me the entire operation had i not spoiled him when i did he definitely would have spotted the juggernaut just lying there on the floor what's this hide no way i didn't even know you could do this all right i'll keep that in mind yes that's everyone accounted for now we complete the objective take down these motors and move on to the next one it's gonna be really tricky though hopefully i get an angle on the bottom light here there we go 15 seconds second motor disabled easy nice shooting one to go that one's kind of tricky i should have done that whilst i was up there let's so that there's no one i've missed down here pretty sure it was clear yeah we're good i was tempted to try and make that jump then but that would have been the dumbest thing ever looks like we can cross over here it's precarious log all right i should have disabled this motor the last time i was up here so let's do it right this time what do you think 200 meters 100 meters and is there a 100 and hope that we've uh guesstimated the distance third motors offline oh yeah all targets splashed excellent work i wasn't totally sure i could pull that off me neither buddy well we picked you for a reason head to one of the extraction points when you're done here we'll do sean bean challenge complete raven i have a new target for you head to the mark location for more information what's this bounties and rivals when you're moving through the region there is a chance that you trigger an encounter you need to check the map where the bounty is located search and kill the target each bounty is crucial because he carries important information but wherever the guards okay i guess the uh the video isn't over we've unlocked a side objective here this bridge is sketchy this hell struck no way i'd sprint over this in real life what about him he really is dangerous as you portray him i don't think anyone knows he's here looks like he's scared hellstrom is our main target no he's not scared the citadel protects his data he cares more about that than his own life oh you're here to end lucky me minefield i can see the mines as long as i'm using my mask which is going to run out soon oh my god oh i can disable them what do i do just release e oh my all right we made it out of the minefield unscathed absolutely no issues whatsoever oh no the sentry oh saved by the cave what is this lead here we go should be just through here you went to the bounty area locate and kill the target losing each bounty is crucial because they carry important information we've been here already pretty sure yes this is where we ended the last video we sniped many a man now it did say that the bounty is protected by a sniper i don't see anyone of thermals but the bounty's just down here i need to keep my eyes peeled though okay i have a plan it's a very bold plan but since we've cleared out all of the enemies most of the enemies in the outdoor part of this region i think we should go loud for this one it's shotgun time sniper we baited him out he's uphill somewhere a guy actually had no clue like what the hell why is this sniper then he hit me hard jeez look what i did to that guy i need to bait him out he's gonna kill me if i'm not careful there you are the one place i didn't look didn't know you could get up there 105 meters you get one shot tom and you've smashed it just like that guys cranium long distance relationships really are difficult sometimes the hyena has been put down the hyena good work hostile killed you can export safely now check your map well that was absolutely crazy and i loved every second what the hell is that a vehicle oh no what's coming oh a tank well we've got that to look forward to in the next episode all right so we've got a couple of objectives left to complete which will probably get done in one go in the next video we need to eliminate hellstrom who is likely in this large base but there is this smaller one that we've just seen where i believe we need to sabotage these water pumps so that was really fun i hope you enjoyed that as much as i did i love playing this game for you guys and uh you really seemed to enjoy the last video which made me very happy i hope this one delivered also i think next time we're gonna maybe mix it up and go a bit more aggressive john wick's style but that was a good stealth run i really enjoyed that if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one you
