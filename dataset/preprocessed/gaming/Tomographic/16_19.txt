yeah behind us is gonna kill us dude i'm just gonna try and get us into the main area yeah oh my god we're getting hammered by another ship yeah we're getting freaking cremated i don't know if we're gonna make this dude i'm going really slow now i'm gonna die i'm trying there's a ship above us that's owning us abandoned ship we're not moving i bought how do we afford we need to find the escape pods to help the tactical nuke from modern warfare 2 [Music] airlocks down here this way this way i found one go go go yeah we need to get inside quick get out of here man oh just in time should we try and board this ship over here then the big one where i am if you see me yeah yeah i see it i'm breaching i mean yeah we can try here i'm running about about we gotta not shoot each other i'm on the other side i just opened the door now where are they i see one i mean like i can't really help you they're freaking owning me killed one okay i killed one as well you sprinted yeah is that you over there legs no no it's not me it's not me i'm in the main area now okay you'll see a dead body on the catwalk oh i think you're directly across from me are you yeah yeah yeah that's me okay okay we'll go over here and i heard steps that's right right down here this is the biggest ship in the game dude i see him oh good thing we're here then i have no idea oh no he killed me welcome everyone to marauders a new first person luther shooter similar to the likes of escape from tarkov but set in deep industrialized space you play as a lawless space pirate and embark on daring raids for valuable loot crafting new weapons and gear and salvaging what you need to survive all while facing off against other players in immersive tactical combat myself and my good friend acula were recently invited to check out an early build of the game along with a handful of other streamers and content creators so do bear in mind while you're watching this gameplay that many of the features and mechanics are subject to change and will likely be improved upon aside from a few harmless bugs here and there we actually had a relatively smooth experience we had some fps issues at first and currently there is no ffv slider which definitely took some getting used to for me but for a game that hasn't even hit early access yet there is some clear potential here especially if you love the idea of tarkov but hate how complicated the mechanics are for new players marauders is a much more casual experience but still has some really intense gameplay moments which i personally really enjoyed which again i'm sure will change and evolve over time but what makes tarkov so popular is the gameplay loop and i think marauders takes all of the right boxes in that department you've got the loot management player stash different merchants and quests to accept all the trimmings that tarkov players will be used to with the main difference between the two being that one game is set on planet earth and the other is set in space and just to be clear i don't want to make the game sound like a complete talk of ripoff because they do play out very differently in their own right i mean you don't fly around in spaceships in tarkov it's just a very easy comparison to make because we don't get very many hardcore luther shooters and there has been quite a demand for it since tarkov's inception and i think the main reason why is because players want more experiences like tarkov but without the insane learning curve and that in my opinion is marauders target audience there's no confirmed release date as of yet but you can pre-order the game to get access to the closed alpha and play between may 4th and 9th if that's something you want to do i'm not sponsored by the way i just want to give you guys all the details and i know i'm going to get questions about it with all that being said i'm going to show you the very first round that myself and acolyte played mostly unedited so you get a better understanding of how exactly a raid would play out in this game bearing in mind that of course this was a limited event and because of that servers were rarely filled to capacity i'd love to hear your feedback in the comments below i'm sure the developers would appreciate it at this stage in the game's lifecycle so drop a like for the algorithm subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one it's nice and quiet now can i fly yeah if you want to you can use the turret behind me as well oh okay how easy is it it's really easy control is to go down and then spaces go up okay that sounds like a space battle below us there he is deadhead what's that guy ahead of us here what's he shooting at oh i have guns too yeah i have to leak quite a bit oh hit him nice good shots cranking 90s on sensitivity is wild for me right now yeah i changed mine i haven't changed the vehicle since i think everyone's trying to figure out the controls still oh yeah oh yeah he's going for the tunnel he's going for the tunnel absolutely smashed him just absolutely pepper in this man can i like fully blow the ship up i think he's dead i think we killed oh he's done oh we really oh my god he's done is this the entrance yeah yeah you can go in there okay he took his nice pod that was nuts okay cool huh yeah man so it just destroys the ship but they can still use a pod okay ah it's here come to me okay we gotta open the airlock open it up you say f me [ __ ] you in the game or [ __ ] you how do you do that double time f1 [ __ ] you [ __ ] you so if you press it once it's a whisper yeah [ __ ] you no [ __ ] you no [ __ ] you [ __ ] you all right let's go so you can just it's like it's like tarkov that way you can disagree with it yeah yeah attack attack attack attack cover me cover me follow me are they yeah when you sprint okay there's a box here can we loot this i knew you'd love it i knew you'd love it immediately come on man all right go left go left hang on it's rewinding my crotch button to see whoa my sense is like oh my god what the f i changed the keyboard to c instead of control and it's ruined the whole game yeah same here same here yeah those guys are guys are bored oh my god okay yeah the footsteps are loud i don't know don't don't don't that's mental [ __ ] you [ __ ] you how do you search um how do you um identify something uh maybe middle mouse no this place is huge almost sounds like my footsteps are behind me yeah there's no way we're making out of this because i've i've already lost there's no map i don't think so there's a location in the bottom left there's your x and y did get here this is where they were fighting okay just be careful i see many dead guys over there look they got here on the stairs they go to your left two big guys to the left it's a freaking massacre i don't like that they're just gone i'm gonna take the loot anyway there's a market up here oh yeah directly ahead of me yeah i hear that they below yeah killed one nice the other guy's directly below me that's a lot of recoil i don't know if i killed him it's very low did you run i think so yeah he came right now nice are we clear i always thought too okay i need to bandage oh wow i've got 10 hp left you had a well rot no way damn i absolutely lit that guy up too this guy has some stuff on him he had a lot of gear brother oh yeah yep hear the good stuff already we love that i'm just going to discard all my stuff and take his yeah i'm going to look different now so don't kill me copy that got a tommy gun i also look different yeah you do should we just try to extract i don't even know how to feel like a fallout character i believe now this is a drop pod or we'd lose our ship no no we gotta go back to our ship let's probably got a key card for the captains yeah we all have one okay i wonder if the map is the same all time yeah definitely i doubt it's going to be a procedurally generated map it's massive how have you had to be moved oh god jesus i killed him yeah it was probably just an ai more steps another one to my right it's definitely ai there's a lot of recoil on this gun it's got a flak vest do you want this guy's vest i've got a um panzer rig armor which is 10. oh shoot mine's a nine okay yeah i'm just more crack than you clearly i can't believe how loud the footsteps are when you sprint that's actually pretty good but it just needs some work in terms of yeah i think for now it works yeah potentially steps to the left that guy i think this is where they came from don't move nope i heard feet killed oh across the way did you show the knife us dead jesus blew his head off yeah these are definitely ai hey mr stompy morphy quit making so much noise i have more steps in front of you this is a player no it's an ai okay murder him dead lots of open spaces around here you search him i'll cover all the guys in the pod bay there lots of enemies around more ammo sick wait isn't this where we just killed them yeah we've done we've done a circle dude okay cool good that's good though it's good to double back sometimes so you know we're learning is this ammo should we try and find the ship uh yeah let's just head back okay just stick behind me because i think i remember oh you're going the wrong way already no no i'm just checking because we don't know if this is clear or not i'm using this staircase instead actually yeah yeah i'm just running shows your health and stuff on the bottom right too if you didn't know cable how's the pistol there as well if you want it so the luger i'm full up okay just torch here like at four feet ahead this way it's gotta be ai probably let's see if this loops around got some coins is it ai yeah oh you can also just drag him or two oh remaining oxygen we have 10 minutes left yeah is you down here yeah yep i must have laid you out steps and the boy didn't want to die i really didn't think we might have been too late yeah there was okay we need to make it out yeah i'm assuming x we have to get to zero requires below torch can't go through that well there was a torch dude i found its worst earlier i have i have a torch a blowtorch is different oh how's the flashlight to help in that situation jesus i think they're respawning yeah i think they do yes we need to go up until we get to the main a larger opening i think we go over to the right this way i'm right yep because the bar is this way again eight minutes left i like this got no bandages 18 health here my guy i think around there thank you okay so we this is where we originally came their bodies are here where we got the first loot so if we go down here and right oh right over here i think no i don't know if this leads to a ship but i hope it does no ships of this dock ours is low so we go go left and through here i'm really low on health do you more uh yeah here thanks okay yeah so ours is more well the downstairs is here come with me come back yes so we get down here look there should be like a we were in a long corridor that was quite lit up yeah this looks right almost we need to be down here look it's where we were uh no the other side the other side six minutes we'll be fine left six minutes fast man through here and then to the left again right i think yeah we lit a couple of rooms like this it's gonna be off one of these stairs maybe they're both leads the same place you you came down this one this is us surely wrong airlock dark 4d is here for that one no ships of this dark our ship could have been taken dude that means we need to find a pardon unless there's just more docks around here i am so lost i went further right of where you were this one right here i found it yes i'm coming follow me there you are i see you down there how do i get up follow me you're right i think yeah [ __ ] you i love the whisper i think the whisper is my favorite one you know what [ __ ] you you know not thank you there could be enemies around no we have time for this [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you pretty a d monitor yeah you can't swear in the first minute time to fly where do we go uh there should be a gate oh yeah to your right to your right look at this place it's weird where we are it's like we're not really next to any planets yeah but we're kind of in a ball of space in a way yeah i know you're right it's more of a bull you're right it makes you feel like you're in a ball so you should be able to just go right up to it and it'll escape us will that pull me in i believe so hell yeah i'm just a turret now humble turret i lost my ship there you go it's very bad bones yeah extremely barebones good concept though good foundation i do like the idea though because you can go and crash on other people's ships and stuff yeah i wasn't expecting the the ship element flying ships around gunning ships i'd like to have some more of that gameplay it's cool oh yeah so we should have taken their the captain's key cards i took the keycard okay i didn't didn't take any of them what does it do well it'll allow us to uh take their ship right if there's a ship of that dock i see that's good because then it doesn't matter which one you go to [Music] you
