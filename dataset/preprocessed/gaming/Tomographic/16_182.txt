hey guys it's tom here and welcome back to more warzone so this is the cr-56 a max build that i'm using in today's video alongside my trusty karna ak i'm playing quads with jack frag study and orb in this one so i'm sure you're going to enjoy seeing this squad run some games together but before we get into that i need to say a huge thanks to nvidia for sponsoring today's video and for hooking me up with the new geforce rtx 3080 graphics card i feel very lucky to have this gpu in my system and it's sure to give me a huge performance boost when i play warzone as well as other future titles like black ops cold war with features like ray tracing dlss and the introduction of nvidia reflex which can significantly reduce latency in competitive games the rtx 3080 is up to two times faster than the rtx 2080 ti which i used previously and so i'm now playing warzone on a 1440p monitor at 240 hertz and as a content creator this gpu allows me to record at high settings and live stream simultaneously using nvidia's nven encoding on the same pc and still play at high fps which is a godsend and in video actually introducing even more tools for content creators with nvidia broadcast including ai green screen noise removal and automatic reframe and these features are all seriously impressive i'm so excited to put the rtx 3080 to the test in the coming months especially with the release of cold war and future warzone updates and this gpu is going to allow me to bring you videos at an even higher quality so again a huge shout out to nvidia for sending this out to me and thank you guys for watching seriously opportunities like this would not be possible without you so i really do appreciate the support i'm gonna leave you with some gameplay now but drop a like on the video if you enjoyed it subscribe for more like this and i'll catch you legends in the next one you just stick a load of shaving cream in there and slap it really hard oh it's a classic out of context joel all i
