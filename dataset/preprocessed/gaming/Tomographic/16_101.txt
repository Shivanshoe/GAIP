yo what's up everyone and welcome back to some more warzone now before we get into the gameplay today i wanted to take a second to introduce you to someone so this is slo-mo the sloth or mo for short he's kind of been the mascot for the channel for a few years now as some of you will know especially on twitch but i recently partnered with makeship who make plushies for all of your favorite creators this isn't a sponsored video by the way i just want to let you know that you now have less than 10 days to pre-order before they're completely gone this is a limited run and we need to hit our goal of 200 sold for them to go into production so your support would be awesome since this is a crowdfunded campaign and this is something for the fans i've decided that 100 of my own profits will go to the sloth conservation foundation which is a non-profit based in costa rica helping to safeguard a future for the world's slowest mammal in a quickly changing world someone's gotta look out for these little guys haven't they so let's do something good you know i don't really smudge often as you guys know so this is just something cool for you guys to get your hands on and help to support a great cause you can find the link to pre-order in the description below but with that being said i've got some gameplay to show you now just messing around with the boys and having some fun in
