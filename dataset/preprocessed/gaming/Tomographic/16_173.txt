[Applause] aiming down isn't it it is it's because it's so unnatural to do it like when you're pointing down at such an hour you can't you can only look so far so yeah like poking down it's oh uh fire station being slammed oh we got inside did he he's on yellow again oh yeah you guys aren't finished broke i broke him broke him i broke i'm definitely driving towards us what's he thinking definitely

we hold the blue building yes or do we wait for [Music] them okay this guy's got gold javelin i have to use it for my video content i finally unlocked gold on the java i used the javelin again after that one match i unlocked gold on the javelin i made another javascript video because it was popular round okay i missed the shot i was too distracted oh it's a miss the stability damn one on the left okay over there i had a nature valley granola bar earlier and i just keep it's just crumbs on my mouse pad god damn it dude you crumb yourself get off i crumbed myself and a crumbing in the boardroom never eat a nature valley granola bar nature valley missed all those shards just behind us on the divot on blue round there's still a team that we're here a lot of them study on the quadi oh not quite oh they're going to hold us out study playing quads not if we snipe them first though sorry on the quad [Music] one down the spr is basically cheating in war zone confirmed i'll tell you what i can make him move no no no no see or is there a high point in their warehouse oh no pro karma broke armor let's go baby it's probably not got long left we'll have to push them quick it's time for a moida i can't see for the angle i'm stunning bound oh my god look at the circle let's get to westy everyone gets a westy yeah take these trees that's so annoying the only thing is uh people have cheese dude second floor blue second floor blue uh i feel like i don't want to push it don't fall south or unless truck truck wait we can just hold this guys we just hold this we win it's coming for you tomorrow yes it's scary but also fun nice last minute or have we already got no no we've got to fight the entire server now you ready yeah they're all coming together just gonna run at us most wanted it's zombie mode shots whale they're on board everyone has to run to us um can someone cover the south side that's where we're going down one there oh that's uh that's right for a sniping that vehicle oh oh guys rushing south yeah repositioning that one once nice could follow this one found another one finish run down one [Music] hold this position no no no no no we haven't can we at least have the zone for now if we push in the open we'll kind of get ruined okay it's still somehow another four players in two different teams i think those guys in orange still like i don't like that area got one a calm now 433 four v3 and the other they're up here up here aren't they i think so yeah i guess we could we can we can push everyone it's just risky that's all well it depends on how far you know what's going on before you know what's happened before where where lachlan is is as high as you can get unless he goes out so they're just over this hill i'm pretty sure one two two and you just finished now and we're done i mean what was that that was why i literally didn't miss a shot in the end zone though that was an spr game are we ever gonna use any other weapon this season until this gets patched i mean like it's gonna be all of my content is with this gun right now spr it's either this or nothing i'd rather see nothing right two back-to-back just sniping endings like completely dominating not a time [Music] you
