so today i wanted to showcase my new go-to loadout for any and all engagements in warzone so i finally maxed out the ffar and you know it was really hard for me to step away from that deadly ram 7 smg build that i made recently but yeah i think this ffar build just about beats that ram 7 at least while the cold war attachments are still so broken meaning that the meta attachments in warzone could change again very soon so this is the ffar build that i found the most success with in warzone coupled with my deadly accurate khan 98 class setup that you may have seen recently with the new addition of that precision comb stock which essentially means that whenever you ads the cross set is always dead center without even needing to hold your breath this is definitely the meta khan i8 build right now so i've got videos coming on the lw3 and pennington sniper rifle soon as i know there's been a lot of khan ia gameplay on the channel lately but i'm not apologizing for that i'm actually thinking of setting up my eye tracker again so you guys can actually see where i'm looking and sort of understand my sniping process a bit better so yeah suppose i'm trying to gauge your interest on that so let me know if that's something you want to see jumping into today's gameplay though i'm playing with jackfrag study and westing this one and you can expect plenty of memes as usual as well as some action-packed rounds and the second match in this video we just seem to have so many downs as a squad but just couldn't finish off the kills due to being in open environments the entire game you'll see for yourself soon enough but thank you very much for watching as always leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it and subscribe if you haven't already i really do appreciate the support you guys are the best and i will catch you legends in the next one milly milly it's millie by lil wayne that's it is it actually my little one it's lil wayne no no they're right there i mean they're really in

remove that ping i just penned him you could yeah if right was actually safe to be fair i think ryan might be the player but instead of just staying in this building i don't know we might have to push police i think and then hold the wall of police all right coming back there is people here though take it back now y'all if you could not hear anyone steps inside yeah if you can knock anyone that was on the hill i can use uh what's the cool precision need to down one of the people up on the shed if we can i don't hear any footsteps in here window of shed wind dive shed wind dive shed it down one

self i only got one of them down it's the same team we fought before and before we get pushed by another team on the wire i got on a plate it's got no fans got another round he's gonna try and go and reside he's dudes landed i'm he just landed i think and i hit him too i don't see him anymore i think he's done confirm three there you might have dropped this elimination on another uh airport what a push you got a king here yeah there you go down the ground atc king is still underneath us okay he's full sending that tom he's gone in the uh the gap whether just snipe me again the gap i can stand if someone comes with me yeah i'll come with you son all right atc again guys ready yep stands under it's going on the ground i see the guy atc smash the doors over here he's on the far right side stud nice well done more money i can't we're guys we're running in the open across this road earlier i'm moving nobody needs to see any more scenes over the back there somewhere oh yep or or almond one think that was the driver i'll buy an ammo box up here okay no hit he's still shooting truck yeah yeah atc is shooting at him as well though i see atc's head is shooting at you guys yeah i can't live there running out loud yeah come down here let's get them initially i'm over here the team that dropped out from the heli earlier we might have a team pushing on the roof whilst we left it so just keep an eye out you want to go back up it's probably an easy way though we're just gonna yeah i just feel like we're gonna be fighting atc for the rest in the low purple window there's a team of down one found him down the guy that was peeking jack found his teammate there on purple yeah looking somewhere looking that's two down i've got where's this going to i shimmy where's his body [Music] hills again hills with pills oh that's annoying there's more teams over here to the east if you want some snipes if i had the height on him i could have confirmed the downs you still go you're going up jack yeah yeah if you have an angle on purple window jack i'm down two um they might have backed off though i assume they went around the corner and got rezzed to the left all right got sniped from atc yeah i see his sniper hanging over it just don't see his head player dropping on the uh on atc disabled the vehicle they're running right across one in the window of the house behind it yellow there i can't mark it except too many pings anyway looking oh yeah it's gone out the door there's people fighting everywhere here there's a guy beaming from red marker westy i just heard shots from there he just tried to spot it found him lovely that was the one from yellow building thomas yeah just keep pushing along maybe watch out for atc though they got cyanus from there yeah this is the problem sticking through it i don't know what happened to the team that were below atc in purple yeah i'm not sure what happened there well after this zone we're gonna be screwed well maybe we work our way up towards northwest on the hills yeah if we want i feel like that's the only on the roof you can actually get on the roof here jump out the window and does do a 180 grab oh yeah yeah no easy that's very close that's close from bottom here bottom of this bottom of this building brought my blue yeah bottom of blue was he on the outside okay outside on the left traded yeah i think that was a trade push [Music] he's got another down what happened just stunned me stunned me personally thank you if you have a gas mask you can buy plates in the buy station last second i've got play box by the way guys so i've got three tommy i can drop you some yeah i'm just trying to grab this man box are you clear there are they still in yellow i've i i killed two it's all about that i don't know i just got sniped from atc [Applause] we have to take it because no one else knows that it's empty or do they are they below going up to die to a team that was underneath him yeah no but no idea about oh there may still be a claymore up there to be careful look at all the gear in here yeah wait there's probably a team right here orange down top of airport coming up broke his teammate's armor purple ping he's resting on that corner broke armor down one behind the cover tom yeah he's dashed off the left down here he's deep what is that i saw an animation for him on the zip line yeah he was like flicking up and down yay that's where we need to run is there people below us i think we might want to go now i can go first i'm going first a peek in perp heading this way that's fine i'm underneath the bridge on the on blue on blue yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna plank now so much damage we're going to take that guy's position take that guy's position yeah he killed the guy under the bridge take red marker that guy's a mentalist and then it's going to be positioning online yep absolutely no there's still a guy down there still a guy down here over here the guy on the roof still guys dropping down yeah right skin underneath my skin underneath jack be careful we might need to go tunnel we have to go somewhere i think yeah yeah i think so otherwise we're around the open see if we can kill any more up here though we've got 18 seconds gas mask stuck on my face there was a rose skin down here yeah yeah we have to take blood bomb any gas masks no i can't even get you armor here on rose skin i say yeah that's it this is just okay camp remember we're gonna have to seem like was it just one it was just one guy yeah we're gonna have to come out and go back right here i've got a new gas mask i'm pushing up i'm on top it's our gear's still here from earlier he's there there's there pushing pushing pushing his tv i'm just making sure another stun going left going left yeah going right that was such a sweaty game you positioned it dude just constant downs that's insane now well done lads that wasn't easy that was not easy oh my god again we had so many downs that game yeah a game of downs that was like if we got the credit for the amount of downs we had mental kills like eight downs 57. [Music] you
