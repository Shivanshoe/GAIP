hear a vehicle oh my god my heart my heart okay here we go again let's try not to land at someone's base this time all right welcome to scum everybody it's been a long while since i played this secure communication with human asset established greetings human asset welcome to scum island tutorial protocol provided by the tech one corporation my designation is dual energetic entity neural appliance ardena if you wish to activate the tutorial please do so on your journal interface secure channel close i know what i'm doing dina it's like when you're building ikea furniture you know i just don't look at the instructions oh there's a bunker right there definitely need to check that out i remember there'd been some really high tier loot in those but i don't know how big that one is check these boxes where am i on the map i'm right down here um okay what's a full-scale ak doing inside a small box like that oh my god look at this thing awesome as if i found an assault rifle so soon maybe there's increased loot on the server i'm not sure what the hell is that oh my god it actually obstructs my vision look at that thing how do i sit oh i can lay down uh so dumb i just someone comes along and just sees me lying there doesn't seem to have much for you so just leave on the steps for the next guy what m16 i need mags and bullets not slugs for shotguns check that one or is it the same okay it's the same item same blue box pistol mag for an m9 well i look badass but you know what uses a gun without ammo okay i need to loot this area quick it's getting dark out and this game does have zombies oh pistol 1911. yes i need that magazine are the bullets in it nope go figure it's one less thing to find though please tell me these are the right bullets yes what why is that not fully loading drag you onto you no load ammo okay now we check the magazine hey looks good to me i hope guns don't jam in this game i don't remember if that was a mechanic or not i don't like this what oh god hands up hello goodbye i think that guy just loaded into the game he was next to his partner claim kill think that boosts my fame points there we go the top right there you have to use those points to respawn so the more you have the spawn location you get oh how much stuff do these guys have uh yeah i'm a bit small of a choice here um i'll drop the ak because i don't have a magazine for it hunter is chamber fed so i don't need a magazine you see that guy pull the bow on me that was so funny oh first spawn freeze put your hands up i won't shoot you can take the rest of this loot where did you find a gun with ammo that fast is that the same guy i just killed like two minutes ago come back to avenge himself and his buddy i got a full sender back there spawning sector let's go where the heck is that compound it's there right yeah that's it my character is feeling pretty cold okay i totally forgot that was a thing you have temperature you have to keep on top of in this game but um time is off the essence oh no oh my legs how am i alive i've still got 100 health somehow and no fractures gonna run in and punch him out oh he's being chased by a zombie oh he left some stuff behind took what he wanted and bailed did he even touch any of this like there's so much left on the ground like i've got a flat backpack right now it fills up as i get more loot freaking car battery like what am i supposed to do with all this stuff i'll take the clothes because i don't want my character catching hypothermia especially after that skydive the sides of my screen were starting to freeze okay zombies chasing me just gonna sit in this building for a sec hopefully he can't break down doors oh my god he's breaking through the wall see if i can melee him through that little window what the hell [Music] that's a weird zombie noise i hope this works actually okay i've got no i arrows to marry him and try and keep my distance yes come at me zombrow you want some of this he's dead it's reanimated there we go and that was my first fight with a zombie he was a military uniform though actually get some good stuff of him yes that's not much durability but it'll do might help deter someone from shooting my head still cooking my check yep we'll load it cool let's go back out there oh yeah you can chop them up for me can't you i don't know why you'd want to do that though maybe you can sell it i definitely wouldn't eat it personally not really into cannibalism anyone watching me i knew i heard shots i was about a mile away from the compound and i had to come all the way back because people started shooting as soon as i left always right there try and get a bit closer stopped no way that wasn't a head shot oh crap it's another one oh my god there was another one up the hill they just sandwiched me third time's a charm i refuse to die anymore let me try and go back to that bunker ah there's an entrance here oh hell no this is way too sketchy wait well they didn't take everything off him is that a chainsaw i'm definitely taking that better not be anyone down here i don't know who killed that guy died right by the exit so i've been a zombie they got him there's another one this place is scary wait this is my stuff did those guys come down here and die right these are the guns i had and the bow i need to get out of here this place is a maze oh wait i might be able to find some better armor down here i'm in too deep now this game is way too intense some beef goulash oh [ __ ] play nice mr zombie the gun jammed that was a lot of blood holy crap man that was a little too close of comfort why did my gun not fire there i don't think there's a jam mechanic in this game i think i just if i didn't reload i don't know man i'm on edge now there's like a constant intensity with this game because you don't know like who you're gonna run into or if somebody's watching you okay this is an actual exit i'm glad to be out there never been happier to see daylight how we doing i'm ready to go back into the big world i haven't even left this compound yet like the entire time i've been playing this game this map is massive oh this is one of the um like crafting benches drill press i think you can make certain stuff here where's the harmonica i found did i not take it is that it yeah i want to try this play okay how do i do this just spam a bunch of keys uh oh oh i get it so good what the hell [Music] that's so cool i have to use like ijk to like play it that is awesome okay let me uh take this back oh no oh god i thought it was stuck yeah we're good man i'm loving this i'm such a good time bang headshot someone heard me playing the harmonica you know what for a game of this scale the wind effect looks really good seriously look how big that map is i've only explored 0.3 of it okay took a bit of a detour found some sort of train yard i want to see if i can get in here oh you can i need to find water somewhere vending machines okay we've got food but i need some water get the coffee machine away there's literally a water machine right here yes i need to hydrate all of the hydration give it to me you can see my basic food and drink stats in the bottom left but then there's this that goes really in depth you can see my water intake in the top right i need this in real life why am i still dehydrated wait if i take a piss then i can drink even more water i need to urinate yeah i'm already on it bud i'm letting it flow i hope there's no splash back on my gun that's disgusting i think we found the meta [Music] oh wait what's wrong my stomach is full and i'm feeling tired vomit oh why would i go first person for that i wonder where like the best lou is is it even like good to search these tiny places like can i find some hidden gems or is there like high tier loot areas wait a minute one of the best prison gadgets out there in professional terms it's called mr smooth little entree offers every prisoner of fun and not so rough time oh god i've been looking for a car spawn for so long now just can't find them oh looks like the zombies are spawning in zombie down someone's definitely gonna hear that though i think they're called puppets in this game actually the zombies oof not a bad looking game at times is it i mean it is unreal engine 4 so it's going to look good for a few years still [Music] oh boy that's a gas station could be a vehicle spawn don't see anyone might be camping on our second floor though oh wait forgot about these i found some night vision goggles in the train yard very cool oh i missed it that sounded like it was coming from the other direction that's so confusing i'm just going to take a gamble and hope that this is clear i really want to get to the main island i've been stuck here for a couple of hours now i wanted to gear up before i try and cross the bridge though i'm gonna try and steal this bike please tell me this works okay we're moving front wheel looks a bit buckled the back's not great either but we are moving would have been great if we found a car there but i'm pretty sure that guy took it should warm up nicely and i've got a lot of clothes on and this bike will make it easier to cross the bridge too [Music] [Music] need to get some of my stamina back been flat out pedaling for a while man i wish i'd found a motorbike a car would have been great but i really want to try the new motorbikes they've even got planes now which is really cool oh what the hell was that ow yeah what's going on what the desync what who is that you're scaring me dude that guy just flew out of nowhere and just started teleporting around me now my stamina is absolutely ruined again ah what was that man has he got a little base there on that hill that scared the crap out of me where is he trying to get back on the bike no what what is going on get away from me you mad man there's a naked man running at me what he killed me how he must have made me bleed out from stabbing me i'm so confused by that what happened i'm diving straight down to where i just died it's on the side of that road isn't it oh shoot cool shoot [ __ ] there we go there we go oh no no no oh [ __ ] i've broken my leg oh and i've gotta do all this how did i actually how do i break my leg that time but the first time i took that impact i did no damage it looked like a much more severe fall okay find rocks i need to make a blade i need more i don't have the time for this man he's probably run off already with all my loot craft what a fail that was i'm not supposed to have a reputation for dying to full damage ah okay cut that into rags and then i can make bandages out of this freak my wounds see i've got a broken leg in the bottom left there which is great probably going to die by bleeding out before i make any progress i've still got to get i don't know like 200 meters in front of myself to get to where i just died man and now i'm chilly yeah no [ __ ] i just cut my clothes up into pieces so i could make bandages out of them now i need to wait for my limp to fade off before i can start running again oh what a nightmare hello are we friends now i'm gonna kill this guy i suppose you've got a crutch so i can walk easier you ruined my bike ride you idiot stupid [ __ ] he said shh oh god into the tree gets us through he gets to the tree he's gonna shoot me he's teleporting around again this is just oh my god he's coming he's on the bike i can't kill this man and he knows it hello my friend pleased to meet you my name is dimitri could you show me how to play game i like your bicycle my parents bought one very similar for me when i was little boy stupid [ __ ] idiot [Music] no way okay so in recent developments this guy's killed me a few times now but he actually recognizes me this is so random this has been such a strange interaction probably the weirdest i've had in any game ever and now he wants me dude i can't take all of your loot yes i can give it to me right now this feels kind of weird dude not gonna lie you're just stripping down in front of me i mean talk about the perks of being a youtuber you should get your enemies to hand over everything they have oh he's off goodbye my friend i won't forget you wait what was his name again look at this he had a stacked mp5 with a suppressor hey what's up dude hell yeah i can hear you now were you talking or was that just the radio you're not giving me a car surely i've actually been looking for one of these for ages take it dude how do you have all this stuff and how do you keep finding me what is this why are you being so nice dude you want me to loot it bruh you can't give me all of this how am i supposed to carry it well it's been fun dude you take care now and put some pants on also i've never driven a car in this game so if i crash in like two seconds then it was nice knowing you bye have a great time thanks for the car man and all the loot i appreciate it oh my god this sounds insane the vehicles handle so well in this game really well first person cam as well hell yeah i love the driving man it actually feels so good can i cross this bridge just about fit man look at this i notice the speedometer isn't working on the dashboard but i'm sure we'll get around to it hopefully no one's waiting at the end of this bridge [Music] about to blast me trying to keep my eye out for deer produce some food so i traveled over to this island because it just seems like a safer area to set up base there is like building in this game which i haven't really dabbled too much in oh god no no no no no yes okay we're good took some damage but that could have been a lot worse i need to take this fuel tank and run all the way down here and i can refuel at these pumps been driving around quite a lot i've explored most of the southwest part of the map i did see though uh where that power line is there was a decent amount of land that i think i can build on found out too the car actually has an inventory all its own i could put a ton of loot in there so super handy i want to keep this car if i can i think you can find padlocks to sort of prevent people from getting into it i need to do some more looting though before i can do that i've already been playing this game for like six hours now it's absolutely flown by but i've really enjoyed my time playing this it's been a while since i've like got stuck into a survival game and this game is still in early access so i'm excited to see where it goes but still it runs a lot better than dayz for me yeah it seems i'm in the floor there we go i could definitely build something here it's a lot of space might be a bit too exposed okay this car sticks out like a sore thumb so let me try and hide it in one of these bushes make it less obvious to see from afar uh it's still pretty obvious isn't it maybe this one on the right there here my headlights yeah it's a bit better okay where do i find shelter there we go craft so this won't craft it immediately i need to place this blueprint down put it here if it lets me there we go okay i need all of those materials so i'm gonna have to chop down some trees and some bushes let's get the axe out need to make sure i'm not cutting down trees that kind of provide me with cover so i'm just going to try and chop some trees a bit further away not bad animation hey there we go kind of wish i kept that chainsaw i found earlier now okay i think i have to carry the log in my hands that's cool look at this what's over my shoulder i hope this is the right kind of tree yes it is all right we're almost there just need some more sticks and i need to craft some rope i think that's the rope i need but the rope in the shelter and hey presto we have a custom spawn point look at those snowy mountains over there so much of this map i haven't explored and it's like changed completely too since the last time i played it damn you need the right clothing to go there though i think i'd freeze to death if i went like this i don't know what wildlife you can find up there probably some bears so pretty man oh i see it [Music] there we go ah just gonna sit here and watch the sunrise [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] you
