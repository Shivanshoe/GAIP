hello everyone so i've played a lot of warzone over the past year or so it's been a saving grace for so many of us during lockdown and i've made some of my fondest memories with my friends playing this game but personally i don't think i've ever been more frustrated by the meta in war zone yep even more so than the dmr14 meta which actually got me shadow banned for a period of time before people realised just how good it was so when yesterday's mid-season update dropped and seemingly changed nothing about the ffar and org two weapons that absolutely dominate the game and have increased the time to kill a war zone immensely well i think i speak for all of us when i say that as a community we were left feeling extremely disappointed and disheartened by the changes we all love the experience that warzone is able to offer at its best right but this meta has become so incredibly stale for us all and now more than ever we desperately need some variety in the game again before it's too late i understand there will always be a meta some weapons simply perform better than others and clearly outclass the rest and that's fine especially when there are so many offerings in terms of weaponry in this game but in a battle royale like warzone the first of its kind in that it gives you as a player the freedom to choose your own loadout before you even enter a match meaning that whenever a new meta is discovered at its peak everybody is using that exact same class setup for weeks on end it quickly becomes very frustrating and it needs to be addressed sooner by warzone's current and future development teams we've seen lots of meta weapons come and go since warzone's first inception but none have been quite as popular or as problematic since the cold war integration and now here we are one year later with more than 80 of the total player count using the exact same loadout with no indication of when the ffar and org will be fixed i've personally avoided using the org since it rose to fame at the beginning of season 2 and i didn't want to draw any more attention to it because of how insanely fast the org is able to down you at most ranges and when you factor in the tick rate of warzone you often get downed on your screen before the second burst is even registered by the server which is just insane i do like the idea of burst guns being viable in a game like warzone don't get me wrong but there is a major difference between a weapon being fireball and overpowered and the org is definitely 2op in its current state and the sooner it gets fixed the better i rarely voice my opinions on this stuff but with the lack of communication that we're getting about balance changes and updates that we just seem to expect will address the things that we complain about the most as a community when an update does happen we often set ourselves up for disappointment because changes aren't being communicated properly and it just keeps happening we need better communication from warzone's developers raven software infinity ward whoever ends up taking the reins in the long run communicating with your player base keeps players engaged it's that simple and things just aren't happening fast enough and i know the devs are probably fully focused on the new map and that's great but if the core gameplay isn't addressed first then the game is going to lose players for good there's no question especially when updates for the game just seem to be getting bigger and bigger the game has so much potential to be great and deliver content for years to come and when it does work it's a fantastic experience that we all love right there really is nothing like it on the market right now but if they wait too long we've seen it multiple times before a competitor will come along and threaten warzone's place in the battle royale genre please warzone don't get too comfortable you have the players now now it's time to fight for them myself and my friends have honestly become so tired of the lack of variety in war zone at the moment that we've mostly been playing the resurgence mode on rebirth island it's been a great change of pace with players using more than just the meta due to the smaller map size so i'm going to leave you with a full round playing with stoddy westy and the tactical brit i'm using a very competitive loadout that includes the amax assault rifle which i have set up like this and the gallow shotgun which is really making waves at the moment because it actually has a faster time to kill than the ffar up close with that said though leave a like if you enjoyed the video and subscribe for more like this let me know your thoughts below what has been your least favorite meta in warzone but thank you for watching and listening as always and i will catch you legends in the next one oh god there's three beloveds hit him um heading over i thought jump that ap mindset he's put mine down yeah you put a mine run along the roof drop
