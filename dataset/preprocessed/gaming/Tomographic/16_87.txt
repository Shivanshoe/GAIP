rebirth island everybody come on what would we do without this mode in these dire times for war zone i don't know what's going on with the game right now but it seems to be in a really weird state i'm seeing more complaints from the community than ever before in my youtube comments on social media and it has nothing to do with any broken weapon or a new bug for instance the game's actually in a pretty balanced state at the moment but there's not a whole lot going on in terms of content to keep the game moving forwards we're just taking one step forward and two steps back all the time and come on the lack of anti-cheat is just so embarrassing cheaters are just range hacking lobbies because they know that they aren't going to get banned even when you come out and say oh we've banned 50 000 accounts what does it really matter when your game is free to play and those players can just create new accounts and start all over again we can't keep waiting for months on end for you to manually remove cheaters from the game i just don't understand and there's no communication to tell us why this is the case give your players the anti-cheat that they deserve and ban the cheaters that don't deserve to play your game you don't need me to spell out for you there are plenty of activision properties like overwatch that just have sufficient anti-cheat that works i didn't want this to be a ranty video i was going to touch on cheating for like a second and here i am still going on about it but i'm just frustrated i love this game but it's tough to love something that doesn't love you back as cliche as that sounds i'm in the same boat as you guys and i just feel like i'm preachers to the choir a lot of the time since warzone's release there's just been so much room for opportunity but it's just been wasted and that's honestly heartbreaking because i mean this is the best battle royale i've ever played and it's like my favorite genre and it's done so much for my channel too i would not be where i am right now without warzone season 5 of warzone is going to be crucial to the game's success i think especially with games like halo infinite and battlefield 2042 on the horizon maybe that competition will give warzone the kick up the backside that it so desperately needs but let me know your thoughts in the comments down below what do you want to see from warzone and what do you think about the current state of the game and i'm going to leave you now with some rebirth island gameplay playing with study and westy and as i said at the start of the video rebirth island has just been the saving grace for all of us i think because you don't really find many hackers in the game they're mostly playing on vedansk where it's a lot more open and their software can sort of track players a lot more easily i think they just find it too overwhelming with how many chances players get to come back in resurgence anyway if you're going to enjoy the video make sure to drop a like and subscribe for more i figured i get some questions about the loadout so i'll pop out on the screen for you now i'm using the m4a1 and the gala shotgun but with that being said thank you so
