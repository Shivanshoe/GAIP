there's there's the guy in the window i miss it's okay i don't oh nice you like boy i just hit the most insane snipe of my life i just hit the most insane snipe of my life holy [ __ ] there's a guy on guys how crazy was that sniper shot i don't think i'm ever going to top that in warzone again anyway today we're taking a look at my updated m4a1 build i had a bunch of comments in my last m4 video saying i should use the corvus custom marksman barrel over the grenadier barrel which is what i was using last time i mean on paper looking at these stats it does kind of look like the grenadier barrel has the slight edge on the corvus marksman and it does in terms of damage range but i never really built the m4 for that reason like if i wanted a ranged weapon i'd use like a 3x optic on the m4 but no i like to use my m4 as more of like a hybrid ar smg and thanks to codgunder.com we can now look at the deeper statistics of all of the attachments in this game so when we look at the corvus marksman barrel you can see that the ads speed is significantly better than the grenadier barrel and if i'm going to be full sending on people at close quarters then you know i wanna ads as fast as possible because most of the time i'm using this weapon around close to medium range i don't typically lose my targets in the iron sights so i think this build is pretty much perfect like i'm a huge fan of this assault rifle now and it works great with my playstyle anyway i'm gonna let the gameplay speak for itself today because i mean this is probably one of the best games i've had of warzone from start to finish we had a really action-packed round i'm playing with stomach 64 fogler and study in this one who by the way i mean i've done if you guys have seen this but stod's got his own
