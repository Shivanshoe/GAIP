got him jack oh no you died it doesn't matter because we won hello everyone and welcome back to another call of duty battle royale video now it's not war zone and it's not blackout but it is in fact cold war's answer to the battle royale game mode however they don't refer to it anywhere in the description as a battle royale as i'm just guessing that they don't want to steal the thunder away from themselves and you know compete with themselves in the battle royale space warzone is dominating right now and there's no reason to promote another battle royale in a game that not really many people seem to be playing it's a bit of fun it's not exactly going to save cold war it's not a super popular mode but it's definitely some fun to be had here you don't need to worry about loadouts or any of that sort of stuff it's all just ground loot and whatever you can find around the map so i'm going to leave you to enjoy some gameplay now playing with jackfrags aculi and stonematter64 but with that said leave a like if you enjoyed the video subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one are we doing island or purple i think we do the island again well look i want to go to that purple ping yeah yeah oh purple ping there it's like something weird all right thing there's a castle is there a graphic castle all right i don't think it's a castle jack it's a big um monument oh yeah that's kind of cool oh look tom you're running in the middle oh you're on the here you are jack it's you and the flag cap and there's me yeah there you go all the boys hey look i'm here did you land on it oh i got a k-swiss man i'm about to quick scope somebody you got a case with oh man i want a case sounds like a pair of sneakers i'm going for the dive boys i'm going for the dive here we go don't do it man be careful here we go i don't even have anything oh wow yeah belly flop didn't i oh now i'm in the gas i'm dying oh hi oh well that was a very sincere joke oh god we are deep in this radiation boys it's not very easy to figure out how far away you are from getting inside the zone mm-hmm full team is just there's two underneath it as well there's two teams fighting and there's a team to the left oh my god there's so many historian what the hell get him thumb all right well i'm down i'm one of those dead one out survive okay i don't think we're gonna even outrun the zone here i'm up in seven you're nuts tom there's a bike everyone get a bike you're the only two alive i got a bike i'm driving okay good comes back in do you think it's weird though like these um crates they have the radiation noise that we open them and the bridge over here yeah i don't know see him yeah it's a strange thing for sure on the green building one more here of course he had an rpg didn't he stop shooting me why did i hear someone scream then i had a grenade launcher just turn my bike into pieces that guy okay yeah that guy that would be the guy it's that's so unfair oh my god that is not fair yes i need to wait for a wave there's something coming over here of course it's distracted by the package we're alive i'm gonna try and get it oh there's a squad going for it oh yeah let's get up hill yeah yeah i'm gonna go up there yeah shoot down on them they're on it a restricted area oh yeah this is not good why can't i hear screaming casually someone's screaming outside my window it's fine yeah what was that oh i thought it was the guy who's killed me you're being mad it's just someone in my basement oh okay this is just really low that one nice there's only there's only one left he sounded like that goat in the clip yeah he did maybe it's just i'm so friends i'm all self-rest yeah i got fists i'm dead okay we didn't have enough bullets to wipe out a squad should i come help i'm sending it boys probably not but not out we have respawn tickets i'm not coming i'm going to this building the lodge there's other guys landing there connor there wasn't any loot there when i live on one of them oh what is this this guy's in this building tom yeah that one oh my god you take a lot of fall damage commencing redeployment squad strength there's team outside they're pushing the lodge now [Music] your respawn tokens left yeah i gotta do i've got no place i'm here how do i just stop that side stone at the tree yeah there's a full team other one down those bushes got teammate lit one in with us he's got a sentry gun just put it down next to me got the one out here last one's over here there's one inside this building with me got him yeah no idea i have an airstrike this is so weird like i feel so disconnected from this game yeah it's crazy it's so strange i don't know it's like you're right someone else is playing it's like a far cry dream it's so strange you just don't feel connected to it at all dude it's weird it's very floaty the way everybody just keeps respawning too it's just it's it's kind of weird yeah like almost like it doesn't matter it's like research yes unless you get the full team wipe then they are out so that's at least nice you don't even know like i don't know like even where the zone is going or what's going where we need to go uh but we're gonna get on that connor yeah i can i can he's got the great launcher still he still has the grenade launcher he's on second floor so overpowered dude he's on the second floor somewhere but he didn't finish me okay cool collapses so weird in this i like how the plates just fill up one he's over here yeah he's got the right still broke him oh i'm dead how does he even have that much ammo i was just shooting dude i'm staying back here when you guys are done does he still have so much ammo for it dude it's just one oh my god dude i even had a war machine nothing i got a nice jack i think you have a big i got it thank you screw that guy my god he's been ruining us every single day it's not his fault like why did they put that in the game screw that guy i hate him i'd use it thank you oh my god oh my god this is just the gun can i read ow ow ow ow guys it's fine i've found one up there i've got the machine thing yeah you just fired at me and set me on fire let's see where he is i understand what's going on does this work hey they're so friends i'm rainbow guy in the roof yeah right here he put up a century okay knock down century destroyed sit down on me are you kidding me let's find the vents here the selfres is the most stupid thing ever there's a lot of plates here yeah look at all these blades three times faster than you can in warsaw drop your combat bell though i can carry i had eight shots with it i downed a guy up on the rooftop yeah it says one alive you're right yeah watching his ex fails while we're messing around over here oh he's real close oh my god stone i look like aimbot dude that's legit how does this guy get the best play this guy's ass is grass we dusted them we won that's the top play i did better my top play was so much sicker dude exactly surprised they didn't give it to the guy with the grenade launcher hey you just wiped out so many people i guess because it's a kill streak and not an actual weapon it doesn't register it skill this yeah yeah it's like uh it's like rebirth but with more toys yeah like vehicles yeah no loadouts too yeah that's true it's a bit of fun isn't it [Music] you
