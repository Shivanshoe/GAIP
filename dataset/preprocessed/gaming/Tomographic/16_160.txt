yeah i think we did a good job avoiding yeah we have one team with us for definitely no there's another team here yeah it's a multi-team oh god yeah this is mental they're going for tomorrow oh my he just absolutely destroyed me dude i'm sure you're doing that they're all inside already yeah he killed me with a pistol we're very split right now i've got a red access keycard if you want to do it run run you want to dip run run south go open it tomo's got five and a half k jesus christ it's got legendary crate he's packing okay so in the gulag we have rose skin i got big money boys yeah but there's lots of people fighting me here super big window every one of my goo lag is a rose again got one down yikes any chance you could just get to the buy tomorrow just bye yeah because then like literally just throw it out here you drop money there yeah and i'm coming over now let's go just thinking if we just buy and then drop money got your money yeah we'll buy and just run somewhere else and there it is hey lucky's back acquired just right over there by the bus out of here there you go look all those people shooting this one there we're just we're just beaming away popping under the shelter go to the blue yeah yeah i was gonna say just here just here we got the buses there's a bit of cover lovely okay man is here hello big man man is here growl is here is here man like lachlan yeah uh absolutely man like plates plates plates no cap well anybody um no place yet that's no cap for me you want to just get a bouncy and is that right are there any here no why did i just see one of you collect cash weird got a big two thousand dollars on my screen they went have no place or ammo no yeah i got no place i found an ammunition box on let's sit on big brown title of your sex tape i hate it oh look it's nestled nicely in the grass title of your sex tape going out i'm upset what's wrong lucky i can't believe that's just happened to me what a medical syringe just popped out of the box and it was glowing blue oh he thought it was a sound and it stopped glowing blue yeah oh oh they're coming they come in this way what is this and they see me on purple one the one that's sniping back yeah they've got something one's here one's on the flank on perp hello how was i here dude come on also preemptively saying i've got him down there was a guy on orange running right wasn't there tommy um yeah you there there he is there he is oh my god he's gone we need plates um that's the dumbest mechanic dude yeah is it intentional yeah i don't like it don't worry about that don't worry about that focus on the team if someone starts the res you then have five percent crawl speed this is insane defensively they were literally just down the bottom here right over here right over on blue man bro oh my god he was so well headed in the shadow there nearly had the jump on me these all the same team or a different team do you think we've played we've played these people what they don't know we have played these people today have we actually have we played them already thank you we have played this team already they're kind of a system like that play surely just got no plates he neither surely not we're not allowed any apparently well i had money and we've got a buy station towards this apartment so we could just back off yeah let's just go back just go back this way you want to back away yeah yeah well yeah i guess did you swap sorry i should want it back yeah yeah i'll switch okay well i mean incoming over there over the way on here of course of course they're incoming 300 meters away let's go back on the loadout though on the loadout one across the way at downtown him god there's like five at downtown down the other oh my god both sides are now around him hold on guys well done his teammate can get up a ladder there to raise though and they all on that roof over there not all of them but yep we need to cross into hospital well we might as well go now because otherwise they're going to have full view of us so just scoop up what's here and let's go yeah let's grab my ghost loadout oh yeah they raised the guys we just killed yep and oh i didn't get my ghost oh westy come on got time i'm trying to go yeah i know it's more the fact that they'll be looking at us that's all i think we've made our presence known we are the gucci mane we're peeking at all not right now could be a good idea to use the train and get a little bit of distance oh yeah we could actually we could use trains yeah we can at least get around it finally put it to you shall we on the roof on the roof dead nice that's the team that's the team headshot sound effect will never get old in this game that's not their team because there was at least five red markers yeah yeah they're still shooting there's still people there running boys still people there crossing the bridge let's jump down into the basin man is here it's gonna be a really hard shot to land oh nice everyone's got a sniper in this lobby the sound of concentration completely we can actually stay on this oh yeah of this journey train came in clutch there this was a brilliant idea because it's literally getting us out of all of the yeah areas well they literally one of those teams must have picked up a king because look right on the edge of zone over there it was the guy we didn't finish it's a nice one in it yeah in there i invaded someone who vaulted over me once by going under there the poker express is there where's the ammo box the hell oh it's there yeah i mean we could go all the way up to the atc if we wanted really six they're chasing us ah it feels good oh yeah over here got off the quads it's abandoned yeah yeah it's got off it yeah it's gonna be behind it oh my goodness me what are people doing like are we that tasty looking all three of you are looking to get a head shot that's all i'm saying helicopter helicopter over here where are we planning to get off by the way do we want to get on yeah we should jump out we should jump out yeah i'm going well what about the guy that's on the left what about the guy we can take as well take the munitions and place them i've got munitions place it down it's atc then we've got it let's take the booty spot position in game 101 at this point because everybody is cdl sweat so yeah this is a pretty insane lobby 34 players left if there's two zip lines in here why can't two people use it at once not allowed well once we're going half westy and once we're going down that's how they have it that's too logical tommy i don't want to hear that no one ever uses a zip line to go down either unless it's internal in a building and there's someone right at the top and you're running away this this is basically it then isn't it this is it yep this is where we spend the rest of the game taking shots at people never confirming oh actually i'm just seeing someone that i'm purple at the top yeah right up the top it's in the garage currently there he is yeah i know beyond that rock isn't it does he have to move he does he doesn't have to move he has to move he fell off the thing he has a sniper as well since you have to guess enemy dropping into the air and we still drink coming so we're going to land above us lads there he is broke nice and he's dead so this is warzone there's so much war in the zone whoa oh that's the guy who was up on the quad he's self-rising good and that's the kill confirmed oh truck runway on the runway we want to take this house i think here or oh disabled vehicle so rose skin here we go oh lucky went it's gonna finish south you know what i love gone into the plane what's that i love it when um the you you run upstairs after the plane's gone and then for some reason it still kills you after the plane's already gone past after the strike's done yes that's a favorite of mine i love that and across oh i just got sniped now north directly no i found the guy in purple yeah i just saw that glint just as uh gas is going to consume him now there's a guy in the plane dead i think so yeah i think this guy's still in the plane finally the man has been slaying this one tomorrow right yellow yellow house it is then nice thomas thank you for that you saved my life there i got you did i save their lives i'm not sure i'm not sure oh they want us they want us they want us i was just went down yeah i downed him there's a guy lagging directly above you live right here got him down nice lovely that's the same guy i'm gonna try and get the finish oh yellow building he's not got plates he's not gonna place in got one of them can't believe we've only got two kills here yeah right here jump down he's gonna run on the wall now let's see in purple hangar don't see them at all i'll drive nothing on heart he's if oh yeah someone's got one of the boxes furthest back on blue down him this is mad dude that one nice was insane right there's a guy down on that red mark i'll run still one here at the front still one at the front i think yeah i'm gonna run around the side he's run oh he's got the d50 on he's gonna mp5 from dead he's got like some sort of orange traces got him get him got him not team right there another one here one here moving here hey good job boys have we got enough money for tommy we've got enough money for tomorrow because there's a buy still in play oh my god where are these from we have to go back on the strip guys they're here on concrete i'm literally sitting behind oh god there's a guy here too and there he is you're a legend yeah i think he can go on blue marker hit him again he's literally one shot one laying down on the stairs here one here one here on the on the red mark on the far right side far right side orange marker orange marker as well down one down to one i've got cellphones oh i came from directly from the south from south yeah yeah yeah they've aired tommy oh god oh my they're running they're running out in the open now behind me played to us the only place you're right you're right what money dead i need to grab that guy's plates oh i don't have a gas mask oh lucky can you drop one please oh it's too late it's too late oh it's too late oh it's nice i can get the rest i can get it okay this is going to be 11 seconds it's 4v2v1 hit through probably that's the one i think that's the one behind the concrete dude the one fighting out gas is consuming me he's being finally that was is most mental sniping game i think i've ever had because it was just like it was not start to finish my spr spr spr yeah that was insane boys insane the dog to end it good job ggs lads top plays today that was hard work but yeah it was ggs that was good fun though good fun it's always the final game or the first
