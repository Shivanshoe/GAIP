so today we're taking a look at the groza assault rifle in warzone yes that's right believe it or not there are other viable options aside from the broken dmr meta which is currently plaguing warzone at the moment you guys know i'm not the type to become a slave to the meta in this game and i'll always do my best to prove that but simply speaking there will always be a meta in war zone there's no changing that and there has never been a time where the weapons in this game have been balanced there are just too many guns available to even attempt to bring them all to an equal level especially this late into the game's life cycle so i've got an absolute banger of a game to show you today with jack frags and study but before we get into that a word from today's sponsor z-league so z-league is the world's first skill-based warzone tournament platform which allows players like yourself to compete against opponents of similar skill levels for cash prizes z-league doesn't use those annoying kd caps like you may have seen in some of the recent warzone tournaments they actually had a former google engineer build an algorithm which essentially uses all of your warzone stats to rank teams into divisions so that you and your teammates only compete against opponents with similar skill levels so that means whether you have a kill death ratio of 5 or 0.5 you will only ever compete against teams as good as your own it doesn't matter if you're a console player or a pc gamer z-league works for all players and scoring is based on number of kills with additional points for placement you don't even need to stream or take screenshots because they have a live scoring web page so that you can track just how well your team is doing in real time so if you have a passion for war zone and you or your friends want to compete in fair tournaments with a level playing field then check out the link in the description of this video to register for the next tournament and if you do end up competing good luck so back to the loadouts that i'm using today we've got the big boy grozer grotzer i don't know how you pronounce is a consistent close to medium range assault rifle that packs a serious punch and it's one of my favorite cold war weapons that moved over with the recent war integration oh and i totally forgot to mention my shadow band has in fact been lifted since my last video and i can now play warzone again just in time for the new year so uh i have to say thank you guys for having my back apparently someone activision was listening and i was freed from the shadow round within a couple of days i did enjoy some time off over christmas though so it was nice to hop into war zone with a fresh mentality and i'm prepared to full send with the content in the new year so with that said leave a like on today's video if you enjoyed it subscribe for more like this and i will see you legends on the war zone one landed on youtube yeah i know absolute mentalist i'm being beamed already i actually won a melee fight for once in my life oh my god in guam i just quick scoped and downed someone threw his teammates directly on my body what so i just i think i just
