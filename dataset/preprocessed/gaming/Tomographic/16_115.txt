all right so today i'm using a weapon that is a little less conventional in warzone certainly a loadout that i haven't tried before but i've been playing a lot of the resurgence game mode on the dansk recently and it's a great place to try out some weird and wacky builds due to the nature of the lobbies that we've been finding ourselves in skill-based matchmaking just doesn't seem to exist in this game mode and you usually find a nice mix of players all using a variety of weapons so today i thought it'd be fun to try out the a-12 shotgun otherwise known as the jak-12 in modern warfare and warzone i wanted to make things interesting though so i decided to use the eight round slug mags to increase the damage output and just have a bit of fun now this build is very hit and miss and i mean that in the most literal way possible due to the erratic nature of its recoil pattern i did find though that if you slow things down and wait for the gun to settle before taking your next shot you can do some serious damage with this thing aim for the head and you'll be taking people down in two shots or less it can be really effective in some situations but you do only get eight shots per magazine so you'll find it hard to take down more than two to three opponents at a time good fun though and really satisfying once you get the hang of it gameplay today is with study and westy and you can find the full loadout in the description below but leave a like if you enjoyed the video subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one his man friend is over here oh god i'm probably dead
