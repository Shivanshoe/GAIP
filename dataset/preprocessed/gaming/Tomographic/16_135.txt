to spare yeah yeah here's two thank you guys well they're probably gonna be looking this way now what's this chucky milk meme that people keep saying in the chat yeah i've seen it at lowe's recently just someone needs a chucky milk i don't know um it's just a comforting thing that you might have is it when you're upset you need a chunky milk because i feel like that people said that years ago yeah like people would say stuff oh okay you're a god um he was heartbroken he's got the ghost mask landing on us landing on us literally landing on me okay standing here fallen off too many times i didn't want to peak because i thought there was two of them and he was as british as it gets my god oh no one remember where's todd it's not thunder dude that was a different team apparently it is that guy had the uh the double gas mask whatever it's called i'm gonna oh durable gas mask i'm going up i hope there's no more teams here yeah you must have uh must have gone after we did you good stud i i'm good chucky milk make the pain go away that's something you'd say chocky milk make the pain go away well that's what it is apparently chucky milk make the pain go away it does maybe we should just drink chalky milk the entire time that we play warzone yeah i don't want to get sponsored by g fuel i want to get sponsors email what about chalky milk g fuel oh that could be delicious jack use code thomas do we go right and stadium or do we go forward i'm just checking below because those guys might have come in and grabbed their stuff but follow us hmm tommy's going we would have heard them drop in oh go go move it team bravo six going dark going parachute take them out or let [Laughter] yeah i think they've all got up so i'm human like the spice they are they're in here they're either in there or in there moving position yeah i hear them opening them they're in blue they're in blue it's not going out in the door they opened the door oh it was done oh that made no sense he was shooting you while he was down that's his teammates that yeah i downed him and then i took like five shots to the chest yeah they're above us here stud huh they're above us here i have one broken let's go uh flank left yeah i wish there was another on the roof yeah on this route yeah they're on the roof okay i mean there should be a repel up there or something right another way the main way is to go up that building and parachute over isn't it there's a guy on fire station as well that one ladder is not enough if you're on the ground nope oh i see these guys one ladder is all it takes even if we down one we need an airstrike take this yeah someone's in a vehicle maybe i can't get to you guys though because i have to run in the open yeah vehicle's driving towards me and johnny you'll be able to down one of those oh i downed one yeah fighting now okay i'm kind of in a bad spot here yeah because there's a there's a team in front of me as well where do we go though they they don't have to come down either can we move away from these guys if you push into green jack and then come out you'll be all right i don't think i'm gonna get that i'm moving i'm trying to cover give any assault ammo as well by the way yeah a bit going down and sniper ammo yeah everything is good oh god oh god okay they said no they're not going to you know they're shooting random people oh there's one here bright and blue i'm blue and blue blue all right right there yeah i'm watching he was just he's on the up a bit but he's right definitely sort of run around the corner they're gonna have to jump off i want you might team i can only assume there's one here as long blue they're fighting near that truck but there's also people on the top so i don't know um do we want to start moving now because they're busy two teams the gas is going now mm-hmm do we hold them out because they're all coffee they're on coffee taking shots from fire station i'm still behind i'm dead he's coming he's coming yeah yeah right here someone will shoot me on fire yeah they're dead you get in the zone can we get him come on tom thank you very good yeah let's get the wall get to the wall warzone is a relaxing experience no one else behind us no we're good i need ammo i thought you got it two stacks i'm just going to take this lower that's perfect we might be one of the few three man teams left just being i'm dropping uh ammo here so you can get tacticals checking up here yeah that's how it's called those huge wanna get on the roof wait is there a place can no no okay how many do you need i've got eight i've got i've got two i've got two three two extra thing this one's fine there's only five people left any visual attack sorry no i haven't seen anyone yet five people between three teams i don't think there's unless it's 3v1 v1 on the other teams and one in that window we want to push left right broke his teammate hit another guys we have to push left i think and be on the other side here marks marks dropping down pushed on the left on the left there was that was you i was you jack it was here uh that our guys crossed over to the building already got down on one and broke in where that ladder i bet there's one below us right now it's gotta be is anyone on the right they're in here yeah there's loads of people in there i already saw someone crossed from frankie and benny's found dead teamwork nice i'm gonna parkour into here coming back to us guys yeah we got the zone we got zone there's a guy there's gonna be someone below us jack i bet you roof two room i'm using my gas mask hello you guys here nice uh he's going above i think sod ahead of me animation roomy [Applause] that's beautiful man gas masks ruined me with the animations there but that was good that ending was pretty nuts dude damn daniel how many kills we get right then yeah that's a good game well played like that's the right kind of competitive for me at the end as well yeah like i felt like that was uh evenly matched positioning was good and i've done it without choking milk it's all about the choccy milk [Music]
