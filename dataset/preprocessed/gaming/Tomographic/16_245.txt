do now oh I'm looking at my settings yeah well when you're done doing that it's done okay all right so yeah what we're gonna do is gonna start over here a yellow mark and if I hold here there you go back over here down yes yeah yeah we're gonna do a loop-de-loop like that hang on yeah you do that and then I'll be there wait I'll do it wait I'll do this okay and then stone knows what to do oh okay okay I'm looking at the map yeah so hold alt finish yep I'm in the right place what I'm gonna do yeah what you can edit oh here we go okay so I'm gonna move in a in a different procedure while you guys are moving up top down around I'm gonna move up towards the North right I'm gonna go flanking position to here then I'm gonna connect in Raleigh family oh good good South formation and it just reaches out really far to the right yes really far and then we'll rally up at the top here and you know what yeah Tom you see this yes we're gonna move out boom brings the game plan I'm playing with children all right now let's get some loot and make sure that plan comes to fruition I got to keep changing my settings okay have fun Tom's about to drop I'm wearing the dark zone oh I'm in it no no

and yeah Oh No we'll be seeing you GG well played well if you see one of those things get the F out that's right yeah that was bad we gotta get everything just followed us everywhere we win random by the way ya know I see that stream of luck randomly targets streamers every time we've got stream sniped by a player unknown himself yeah this is one of the more the tunnel ones yes that's what we need oh this guy sent two of them gofer flank for one I'm not it doesn't look like he's shooting what's going on here I don't like this blood thing this is actually bugging me it's down the far end isn't he oh my god my left is all grown up in smashing your face they're dead hit him with that flank Tom wall done the stuff you see that corner yeah I saw that oh it could be close good flank Tom I don't not seeing any blood like what happened to the blood it's it's really minimal now there's no big like cloud it's just the little paint effect if that makes sounds like I can't even see if I'm hitting anybody he used to show like a big cloud of blood but now it just shows the asura fact that my shots aren't registering that's weird yeah I was like a mist I missed like one of my favorite things about the alphabet man huge pink yeah huge with a car 98 or something oh yeah yeah hell yeah now they're just diminishing it even more what's going on yeah you really need a DMR on this map mm-hmm
