this gun but this time around i decided to test it out with the vlk three times optic you know just to see how manageable that vertical recoil pattern is and it actually worked out really well in practice sure the lengthy reload can be a pain at times and for that reason i'd probably recommend that you carry something like the mp7 as backup but rarely does that reload time really slow me down all that much especially when you have 100 rounds to work with like i said i've done a full class breakdown of the mg34 before so i'm not going to bore you with the details a second time but if you want to see more of meta builds like this one in the future make sure to subscribe with notifications turned on so that you never miss a video cold war season 1 is just a few days away now which means we'll be getting an additional 30 new guns to play with in war zone as well as some new exciting changes including rebirth island which looks to be an alcatraz remake similar to the one that we saw in blackout and more recently cod mobile but i'm also hoping that vedansk will also see some changes and we can play both maps during season one i think the current matters are becoming quite stale for all of us now and the juggernaut exploit which is plaguing servers at the moment is getting totally out of hand hopefully we get a fix for that issue before the next major update but we'll just have to wait and see anyway i'm gonna leave you to enjoy the rest of today's gameplay now but do leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it thank you very much for watching as always i really do
