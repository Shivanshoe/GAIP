my god is that far away 1 400 meters there's the target he's going under the car lift adjust for wind speed it's all over we just turned him into a human pancake hello everyone and welcome to sniper ghost warrior contracts 2 and a special thank you to ci games for sponsoring today's video now i'll be honest when this one landed in my inbox it was an instant yes from me i mean i don't accept many sponsorships on this channel unless of course it benefits the content and as you guys know i love me some sniping in an fps game so come on i mean how could i say no what i wasn't expecting however was to fall deeply in love with this game and play way longer than i needed to for this video humming my character to the teeth with new weapons gadgets and skills so i could show you just how much fun this game can be and i mean props to the team at ci because you've made a fantastic game here and i've thoroughly enjoyed my time playing so far there are so many different contracts that you can do as well as challenges to complete within those contracts which earn you more money and skill points to upgrade your character i'm going to be playing through the first mission objective on mount kumar in this video taking out bad guys and shutting down enemy jammers which are interfering with friendly comps now it looks like i'm going to be engaging the enemy in a large wooded area for the most part so i've opted for the m10 sniper rifle with a suppressor of course a medium range scope along with a canted holographic sight and some armor-piercing rounds just in case you can see the rest of my loadout here but i don't want to waste too much of your time i know what you guys are here for and that's to see some killer snipes from your boy so if you do enjoy the gameplay and you want to check the game out for yourself then make sure to click the link in the description below leave a like if you enjoy the video and let me know if you want to see more of this game on the channel but with that being said thank you very much for watching and i will catch you legends in the next one this is raven received send sitrep i'm on location a couple of clicks out from the citadel wow hellstrom's data center is impressive but financed with stolen millions and focused on acquiring more your last message was unclear the transmission is poor what's that view it's the satellite jammers comms will be weak till you disable all three first target is ahead roger stand by all right damn this game is so nice to look at it's a long way down what's this that's bambi's mum that's one of the relay towers hello two tangos let's get a bit closer shall we how do you get to be one of them you have to go through the training it's not sounds like these boys don't get to work outside very often well i'm sorry boys but you're about to spend the rest of your days inside a that was a coffin joke i'm sorry sleep now i think i go this way enemy sniper down it's a good job i killed those two when i did got a nice double take down there but if i'd have done that any later i think that sniper might have seen me let's keep moving i'm gonna try and get up in that relay tower loot the guy just killed and do a bit of recon surveillance oh because god raised beautiful control radio check over weak but readable raven i have eyes on the first jamming tower look for a control box near the top of the array you can disable it from there understood so between me and that tower which is my objective there are a lot of bad guys hello how's about we put a bullet in you first oh dramatic bullet time let's go oh threw his eye oh my god the other eye i can't put that on youtube jesus right up main street yeah i'm definitely gonna have to censor that one that's for sure the exit wound was in a much too convenient place i'll say that much i'm never going to unsee that all right let's deal with these two first less than 100 meters away so i don't need to worry about the wind too much where's this guy going stopped at the ladder take you out first that's one that's two lovely okay so spent a couple of minutes watching their movement that guy was just walking in the same trifecta pattern no other company got two guys who keep walking up and down the trench here so i think the easy kill is this guy because he has a radio it's important to take him out first then you and you clean if we can keep this up we'll be absolutely golden three enemies down by the jama tower which is where we need to go next could take these out up close but we're in a pretty good spot right now clean lines of sight on all three targets let's do some shooting oh come on man jesus there's nothing left of him definitely getting demonetised wait i'm lost oh there you are it's also a sentry gun control i'm approaching the first jamming tower hmm technology hostile numbers should be low but watch out say again still jammed keep an eye out for patrols always do all right we need to fix this signal and not get spotted whilst doing it so my plan is this we use my recon drone fly really high real quick so don't want to get spotted by that guy i'm going to check the inside of the bunker there's a guy there fly inside the hatch and this is where it could all go wrong or exactly how i planned it [Music] now that was perfectly executed that sentry's still up but we don't need to worry about that one now let's climb this ladder and fix the damn jammer one of three i believe there's one over there as well i've already taken care of a sniper going to worry about him let's hack into the mainframe beep boop beep raven i'm looking at sar data from satellite imaging there appears to be some kind of tunnel network in that sector could be heavily guarded there is or could give you a faster route to the objectives roger is that it we have no intel on the layout you make the call control out all right well thanks for the tip but i'm not quite done yet 158 meters bingo this is so extra oh but it looks so cool oh my god his gun just flew at the enemy's feet over there imagine actually did damage to him that may even be cooler than bullet cam ah who am i kidding this zip line's way cooler just wish it was longer that's what she said all right this is raven coming up on the next jammer seeing other structures in the forest do you have intel negative but they're likely relay stations or signal boosters for the jammers an elevated position might be handy i could set up an op from one i'm one step ahead of you i say again i may use them to observe patrols understood your call okay targets marked let's take them out oh i see a collateral opportunity a two for one special coming right up and there it is kill two enemies with a single bullet complete should get a nice cash bonus for that we're clear oh no i'm still zeroed in holy that was so close i was still zeroed in at 100 meters and that guy was like 60 so it went over his head oh god a second later and the whole base would be on my ass now this is a zip line that was fun right let's loot these guys that we've just killed see if we can get some more ammo and stuff some special ammo would be lovely nice all right let's try and loot the guys in the compound and peekaboo we missed the guard at the entrance radio check oh no he's found a body raven hostile forces are stronger than intel reported that's a century raven i have not understood your message please say again i say again your intel is off enemy forces in the area are strong raven say again gotta kill these jammers i really do [ __ ] that's two very close calls now almost been my cover it's a minefield here there's one scan those with the mask which is nice up we go jammer number two i choose you to get shut down control another jammer down how are the comms good job repeat that please still terrible say again raven still too much interference one to go what happens if i release ow all right i need to get over there somehow looks like there's a few options but i'm gonna take the less conventional route we're gonna make this jump here raven intel from our recon team shows a sniper training camp just outside the citadel hellstrom's obviously a fan of your profession good to know receive with caution scan all positions raven radio check are you receiving control it's weak fare you're drifting in and out the sooner i take it out the better okay uh this is tomo2 control i was engaged in hand-to-hand combat could you please repeat that all right well control left me on read maybe i can make friends with this guy okay looks like we've got more friends in the compound below that's an armored target i'll have to use the armor piercing rounds when it comes to taking him out let's get everyone tagged up though there's another guy there and one in the tree line to my left it's a lot of enemies oh there we go there's guys below me as well oh hold on a minute i think we have to do it don't we look out below oh my god that's sick that's the first time i've done that i didn't even know if that was gonna work that's so cool let's get back up top all right i'm in position sniper at the ready see what these guys do stand still oh wait he's left the compound witnesses man down we're clear oh this guy's getting close let's take him out nothing but head that's such a satisfying ping sound when you re-chamber love that really like this sniper sounds great suppressed too right with this guy we need to change to armor piercing rounds aim for the head and go down let's switch back to our standard rounds for these two and it looks like they are perfectly lined up for another collateral let's see if we can find an angle wait there we go i think he would have had a clean line of sight on these two guys you seem to be in deep conversation got the line of sight now wait for him to lean oh that's the money shot right there that guy flew one through the cranium and the other through the back of the neck shattered his spine let's get the recon drone out can't get too close to the jammer otherwise yep that's gonna happen rip little drone i guess we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way that's one that's two schematics that's three i don't care about your schematics control look at the schematics of this guy's head oh my god there's what's going on in the more gotta say sniping in this game is just so satisfying i mean you'd hope so because you know sniping is the core aspect of this game but they really have done such a good job i'm gonna hide this guy's body in the grass just in case i don't know how many enemies are left so probably a small move this has been a really clean run a couple of close calls here and there but it's been good oh boy just blew his headphones off uh it's little details like that man just makes it so much more immersive i think that's everyone you know nothing left to do but disable this jammer and then we can x fill looks clear to me she'll put a c4 on that tank i might as well go loud at least once right we've played the whole mission through very stealthily let's go out with a bang final jammer disabled good stuff control last year sorry to interrupt control excellent work i reached [Music] well guys that has been just a slice of sniper ghost warrior contracts too i really hope you enjoyed that as much as i did that was an absolute blast leave a like if you want to see more and uh maybe we'll continue this thank you very much for watching and i will catch you legends in the next one you
