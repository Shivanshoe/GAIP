everyone want to take a separate alley we'll go double heading oh triple heli yeah we could go triple heli you want your own jack yeah just the 18 they're on that building oh yeah they're there and one's at the soccer ball oh god oh he did not just oh god he just smushed him he just jumped into the blade go ahead come on you get that tight i got this side stand inside oh my goodness i'm just gonna fly into this dude i jumped no jesus jack helly oh god you should chase it i tried to get it i tried here we go oh my god another one another one dude you got two of them i jumped out of my heli and sent one into theirs yeah that's a sick idea oh god the timing on that though i had one hp left in the heli that was sick that worked out way better than i thought it would all right let me be the first to say it best warzone intro ever tell me i'm wrong that entire segment was just crazy and it does a great job at setting the tone for the match that you're about to see which is just beginning to end in non-stop action playing with my boys acolyte and jack frags genuinely it wouldn't surprise me if you see this game on each of our respective channels because the match that unfolds is just insane i'm using my old but definitely reliable pkm build that you may have seen on the channel before why this gun isn't more popular among war zone players i still don't know but you've got to try this build for yourselves if you haven't already this snatch grip attachment too which is completely unique to the pkm adding increased recoil control and aim down side time which to my knowledge is the only foregrip that actually increases ads speed in warzone the main downside to using the pkm is that lengthy reload which is why you want to use an smg as your secondary and despite my reluctance to use the meta in warzone i've had a lot of requests from people to at least try the mac 10 as a secondary so i'm using that in this video and this is the setup that i'm using i think a hipfire version of the mac 10 might actually work better for you because you'll only really be using this thing at close range but it really does come down to preference it honestly really surprises me how underused the pkm is in warzone i don't see it very often but it hits so hard the recoil is so low and you get a default 100 round magazine like what's not to love this weapon is perfect for wiping squads in warzone i don't want to ramble on for too long today so we're going to jump straight into the gameplay but thank you very much for watching as always leave a like on the video if you do enjoy it it really helps me out subscribe for more like this thank you all so much for the support and helping the channel to reach 300 000 subscribers it's just insane so yeah without further ado enjoy the gameplay and i will catch you legends in the next one shall we have a go at the prison meme just so we can say we tried it wait prison looks different on the map yeah because it's occupied by zombies i don't know where the terminal is no no like the actual layout of it it's uh like at the top of the you go down the stairs then through the doors then it's right there between the stairs
