[Applause] over here somewhere i can't see anyone killed what's she doing another one up ahead put your hands up at the gate he's getting down he's getting down oh my god he fake surrendered he's fake surrendered he's down he's down that was sick did you see him put his hands off and then just go yeah i've never seen that before this pool looks pretty real what paul oh oh my god that just scared me crying it jumped so much oh my god dude he's till my sound effects falling down that was insane what the hell over instantly jay i thought what there was a guy right there why would it be a trap i mean he was probably setting it up when we came around the corner what's up guys so i recently played the new ready or not update with my friend jack frags and though we had an absolute blast playing the game and checking out all of the new content our lack of knowledge and expertise when it comes to approaching missions like these especially as a two-man team proved to be our greatest downfall regardless i thought it would make for a funny highlight video so please don't take our gameplay too seriously i feel silly making a disclaimer before this video starts but i think it's pretty obvious and goes without saying that we are not experienced tacticians and have no prior experience with real world firearms and tactics outside of video games we're certainly not trying to disrespect the heroes that do this stuff for real so please forgive our lack of knowledge and if anyone with real experience wants to show me the ropes of how you would actually approach real situations like these i'm open to an invitation to see how it's really done but again no disrespect intended here we're just a couple of content creators trying to create some entertaining content so if you go on to enjoy the video drop a like subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one is that friendly that's a civilian yeah well that was close you've got to remember that the bullet comes out of your barrel your time there was i hit the guy squaring their heads off did that in 40 seconds yeah but close quarters i came here there was the last target and i shot where the guy was and because the bullet came out the barrel i shot the movie clear in the shoulder like that yeah i mean mine nearly hit the shoulder i think yeah but it will never go where you where your aimings you gotta be really careful that's so cool though yeah they really are go ahead dad he literally b-hopped and shot from here another one in the courtyard you get him i don't know if i got them i'm not no i'm dying i'm dead come on i can't even see that guy i have to be honest with you i don't see him either i was just shooting where the shots were coming from dude the ai is deadly man what the oh my god just give me a break mental say i don't mess around jack you got him you got him it was just one that one guy yeah they'll mess you up you can keep going if you want through there yeah what here outside oh he's got freaking speed hacks jack where is he he went right oh oh my god is this actually pvp he was like crouch sliding literally just a rose skin slim past the door i didn't dude that was so quick i didn't even see it i hear steps directly on the side of this door okay we can't not clear this jack come on rum yep ramming now four time lucky yeah here we go i'm in shots fired shots fired oh my god what are we fighting ah oh what [Applause] remember your training oh jack don't spin round in a circle and shoot that's bad okay okay look at this nice bar that i've drawn on the wall yeah hang on i need to drink some water in real life don't die i mean you're okay it's just a water mechanic a drink water mechanic in the game for the sake of it well it's not tarkov jack is it that unrealistic considering you could drink coffee staircase on the right and there's a if you've checked the door on the left there's no one there okay yeah we're clear left side then watch that case i can't my mouse doesn't work oh no got him got him going i need to stop bleeding that really hurt yeah i got shot in the leg oh boy bedroom when you're right i'm gonna wedge this double door behind us see two ways oh careful oh my careful um why do they shout like it's a warning to you i don't wanna know that they're gonna open the door yeah i feel like in real life they wouldn't there's a lot of things we've done this play session that people wouldn't do in real life jack well theoretically this way should be open right on the left oh that's a good point it's open now i can actually see you in the picture in picture of the mirror tom you definitely took a hit there didn't you okay so we've not been down here we don't know what this is like no idea i'm absolutely clueless from this point got a door on the right left is looking pretty clear what were you saying about the mirror gun oh just in the mirror gun there's like a little there's a picture on it and i can see you oh wicked like it's got it's got a camera feed on it oh yeah the in the um in the first version yeah but in the first version of the game you saw what was on the other side on that on the gun itself it didn't put it on your whole screen okay i think i think they changed it because it was like a performance issue like rendering the game twice you know i like it you have a shotgun does it make you feel safe go on your right go on your right kill i didn't gonna flash him rebound flash drop it look away look away okay there's another one at the back you got him you got him you actually pen this guy through that other guy i think no i think there's another one tom you reckoning around to run through here yeah i think he run through clarendon you're right you're good dude he literally came out after you no where was he he came through this door this was closed i thought he just opened this door i thought i'm completely safe tom's just come from there ruined i don't recognize it i don't recognize it this map is massive oh tom that's that's right down the far end we've also been shot from that way here we should move this way hang on he's pushing us killed i'm gonna shut this door and wedge it quick another one on me he's reload he's pushing me he's pushing me through he's gonna run through this door in a sec left side right or left side left i've got no flashes left i do i'm gonna flash ready yep flash out let's go that's a good flash oh there's a big space there what massive and there was another massive space the other direction we haven't cleared that was sick like the game play in this game like why aren't more people playing it it's mud it puts people off you can mirror a gun if you want or i can blast it step straight inside yeah bust it oh my god could be a civvy wait wait all right i'm going i'm going okay okay there's another on the left killed one with a shotgun you've got any flashbangs yeah try and fly throw on a rebound off the [Music] he's not dead he's not dead right side he's got body armor should be on the right side holding the wall i see that he's dead he's dead can hear him sometimes it's so difficult to see with the smoke no it really is did you break this door oh you did i wonder i can close it oh it's actually broken definitely broken tom did you see that yeah swing yeah like after you've broken the door though i guess i broke it with my battery no way was there another guy there yep just right where that last guy was jack why was he making zero noise just stood on his friend's body it's fine but did you die as well dude he double killed us oh my god there's going to be a lot of fighting on this i can feel it already clear right long line of sight on this yeah you brought your flashlight yes there steps left steps left no eyes moving he's inside the building i see a civilian oh no he's got a gun yeah we need to get a little closer he's not going to hear us over the brain the clearing right getting the evidence you're clear on that hard left oh it's up behind you fine he came through the door tom oh my god see that's why you need the wedge in it yeah i don't have i don't have any map knowledge of this one really so i'll close this off for now securing that gate blends in so well though yeah i didn't even see that uh this gate's open did we come in this way no the jump scares the real dude yeah yeah if you can if you can whenever you do mirror gun if you can read for me and just say small room big room just helps as i'm going in behind you i don't know what big size the room is big room all right what's going on with the bathtubs footsteps on the left just that stuff in breaking bad well where they put the bodies in it yeah dissolved them maybe through the house oh that was a good episode was maybe we should see to this after you've married or does it look good big room looks clear okay i'll ram it then yeah yeah go hit it oh upper how's it looking um what do you see small room clear okay yeah clear yeah oh tom i've got video recorded evidence that there was no one there were there any doors on this side jack did you see we're clear now yeah we're clear thank god he's going in that corner okay i've not been hit once this raid it's been great right let's go this way have you not um something inside my head just beeped oh you did that like i was dying i know i'm red well like i just rammed you don't do that again i didn't think i'd do damage with this it went and then i'm ruined no yeah it wasn't doing anything to that guy in the uh training area after you in the mirror okay sure all right these containers i don't know if we need to check no it's not check left that's payback and you mirror gummies yes yeah it's clear okay big room yeah maybe i'll expand you know a little bit longer than two seconds just to fully scan the room big or small big okay just watch we've not already done the hardcore i'm basically dead he shot me through you i'm basically dead right now i'm fine after being shot the crap by the other guy we need to focus up here um on my last leg jack can you focus up i've never been in such pain inside a video game it's your back clear oh god yeah the slowest pan it's fine there's a uh there's an office door here i still don't my vision is still blurry as hell from when i first really got here i don't know how low i am you look fine tom this door's open oh the other side of that gate somewhere but i don't see him how are they doing that outside he was trying to shoot my head on top of uh um there's like there's a loading bay on the other side of that door i'm just gonna ram it open now but there might be someone in that office building i don't know oh my god shooting through it he's opened it jack you want to cover it oh my god i literally didn't have a chance to read it killed me he killed me do they see flashlights do you think i don't know like i don't know i was shining my flashlight uh at the door but it was clear and he just came through and like was already shooting me i didn't have a chance to react uh i just want to hear the beep one last time it's a good sound effect now do you dead like that yeah all right gg tom gg's mate get today
