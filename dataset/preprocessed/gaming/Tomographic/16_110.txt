i need to get faster use this cover of the smoke i guess could just run out left to right smoke the head i've smoked the head i'm winching on winches you need to stun that shirt guys tommy's gonna do it wait something hello everyone and welcome to hood outlaws and legends a truly unique multiplayer experience from sumo digital and published by focus home interactive it's available for all major platforms pc ps4 and ps5 xbox one and xbox series x it's a competitive pvp ve or players versus players versus enemy scenario set in a dark and gritty robin hood inspired universe which i absolutely love and a big thank you to hood outlaws and legends for sponsoring today's video you can click the link in the video description to check out the game for yourself so in hood matches play out like heists you and an opposing team of enemy players spawn on opposite sides of the map be it in a castle or stronghold of some sort and it's up to you and your team to race the enemy to finding and stealing a key from the sheriff who is impossible to kill and can only be stunned once you've successfully stolen the key you need to locate the vault use the key to open the vault and then slowly lug a chest containing your riches to an extract point once there you need to slowly winch it out of the map to claim your reward all while fighting ai and battling the enemy team who are also trying to do the exact same thing and can halt the progress of your extraction and even take over and steal your precious loot for themselves so what ensues is a chaotic and intense tug of war for a treasure chest where players and ar guards desperately try to stop you teams are four versus four and you can choose one of four characters each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as their own special abilities all based off the original robin hood characters there's john the heavy who has a big old hammer for dealing massive damage he can also take more damage as well took who is more of a healer clasp but has a deadly flail weapon and kind of serves as a heavy class in his own way robin who as the name would suggest has a bow and arrow and is one of the more balanced classes and then finally there's marianne who i spent the most time playing sneaking around in bushes and taking players by surprise performing a quick assassination from behind it's a lot of fun and interestingly you can play as any one of these characters and mix and match them if you want there are also capture points that you need to contest and fight over in order to respawn closer to your objective instead of spawning miles away where you first started the match and keeping these points in your possession proves to be vital during the end game when everybody's trying to fight for and extract the chest it's hilarious fun and you never know what to expect though the main objective never changes no two matches feel the same and each game is full of surprises you also get a home base that you can hop into between matches and it's here that you can mess around with your friends enter matchmaking together and with the money you've earned from previous matches you can upgrade your character's perks and buy new and improved weapons as well as cosmetic skins for your characters it's all very straightforward and easy to understand but it's also meaningful enough and gives you something to work towards i've got some highlights from one of our matches playing with my friends acolyte jack fraggs and tommy from two angry gamers but with that said leave a like for the algorithm subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends and outlaws in the next one steal the vault key find the vault extract the chest that's my intro down there tom thanks so just run into the smash people then i was
