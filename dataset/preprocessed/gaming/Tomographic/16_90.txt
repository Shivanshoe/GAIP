i'm on approach to the cooling facility raj hellstrom servers are chilled from this facility take out the pumps and you'll take out the cooling thermal issues in data centers are normal so the system may not flag the problem until it's too late i guess the water further up the pipes will mask the change here you're smarter than i pegged you for i think i found the control panel for the pumps confirmed you'll need to do it manually to make sure [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] oh my god [Music] control first pump is down good work two left right i'm on it control sit rep all the pucks are down raven acknowledged move on to the next objective the data center may notice the loss of cooling soon i'm still a distance out from the citadel on the move good luck control out okay i wasn't expecting to see this when i turn that corner [Music] that was a cool little side objective actually there was a lot more to disabling those water pumps than i was expecting but we're now on our way to the citadel which is the main objective in this region control come in this is raven go ahead raven approaching the citadel any idea why hellstrom calls it that from his side profile he's obsessed with acquiring knowledge about his enemies and citadels usually command a great view of their surroundings wow plus it matches his twisted sense of humor given that it's mostly on the ground well all castles need doors time to knock on his metaphorically speaking okay sounds good still these two first did he just ask if that was a body when his friend just slammed into the ground beside him impeccable awareness on that guy's part oh no we've got some turrets out the front we go up here maybe there's so many different ways to get to the objectives i might be going a long way around but we'll get there all right this is the place right yeah it is you can't miss that giant concrete facility apparently i can't mark these guys for too long yep you see that this area is fine but there's a jammer in the main in the main base i guess is preventing me from marking people permanently like the enemies at this checkpoint just sneaking around don't mind me i need to take these guys out one by one disable turrets killed the power to something down here the citadel's defense grid is split into three sectors you've cut power to sector one the other two must have similar fuse boxes okay try following the cables got it two more sectors follow the cables to shut them down right need to switch to armor-piercing rounds to take down big chungus over here there we go intense bullet time engage he was on the phone my bad oh no please don't tell me he radioed in i think he has yet says searching in the bottom left okay i think we're good look at the size of this place i think i found a way in an open grade near the bottom of the wall what are you doing report back when you're in the facility raj all right it's not going to be as simple as walking through the main entrance it seems there is an open gray there though so that is an option just gotta be careful of these guys all right we're gonna take our chances try and avoid that armored vehicle gets that hole in the wall and then hopefully take these guys out up close where is it it's probably here right there we go cool where to left or right let's go right okay so this is sector one which we've disabled the turrets for as you can see and then over here is the fuse box for sector two wait for that guy to look away turrets in sector two have been disabled somehow that guy didn't hear a thing let's drop down here i'm gonna try and play this smart and stealthy if i take the close fight then i don't need to worry about sniping people range and their bodies being found there is an underpass over here that we might be able to use to our advantage yeah i mean the last thing i want is for a body to be found and for this entire base to be looking for me there are a lot of enemies as we've seen what do you even call this place it's like a water treatment facility right this is so sketchy turn around don't turn around don't turn around ow dude that was brutal it's that guy didn't have to suffer where's that camera caught in 4k are you kidding me look how many enemies there are oh my god there's more of them they're all crammed in there like sardines and what do i do okay i'm gonna try and find a different route this way this guy's in my way look at the bullet count with this one that's sexy that really turns me up peekaboo i choose you oh jesus a slow-mo neck snap is that really necessary can i get a rock up there yes i can that's it you follow that rock one oh no what it was literally on my head okay so i'm assuming i need to get in there but i can't get past those turrets until they're disabled go through there might be a way to drop down up top somewhere we'll find out does this go through this door looks like a useful huxfield point okay raven say again just talking to myself hey i do that too i'm doing it right now it's very weird hey boys you uh just chilling let's not get spotted okay you can have that you can have two of those sorry to drop in on you like this uh here we go disable the turrets release you more okay i want to clean up the rest of the outside bit here big chunks are still on patrol wonder if i can kill two birds with one stone literally see if they take the bait [Applause] that's it a little bit closer and bingo you didn't see anything right okay yeah he definitely saw just gonna hide in this box for a bit all right a couple of them have walked past me i think i'm good let's take these guys out why'd you step two down one to go him with another brutal takedown animation [Music] disgusting knife to meet you okay big chunkers it's just me and you now and i'm a piercing round with your name on it there it is beauty don't even know what i'm looking at but it was beautiful okay now what nice alienware laptop there control do you copy raven roger 5x5 i'm at the entrance it's locked tight five by five sweep the area look for an alternate access underground doesn't 5x5 mean loud and clear military speak i think so all right it wants to go underground there's not a lot of headroom under here but apparently this is where we're gonna find hellstrom who's our main target what is this i hope this isn't a bad idea this is a terrible idea you would not be able to slide down this so elegantly i mean this guy's lined up for a takedown which i love so i'll take it but okay that was sick i love that control sick rep oh no way go for control i'm inside do you have eyes on this no way roger that's a lot of computing power nelson's operation is larger than we thought this place is huge i think i see an elevator confirmed that'll take you everywhere you need to go including the mainframe once you have the access card okay this is weird i just spotted hellstrom he's on b2 there he is that's a poor angle for a shot i'd improve your elevation before trying yeah i will make it easier the knife up close might be safer though okay so there's evidently many levels to this place control this is raven i have eyes on the mainframe b4 you need helstrom's key card to access mainframe level terminating then proceed to the control room to upload the virus copy that oh this is crazy before you oh these cameras man stop catching me in 4k it's not allowed what is this place dude who's talking cortana oh love that take down animation let's just uh deal with this guy there we go two more over there oh i might have done it i might have done it come on oh you absolute beauty love those collateral kills so satisfying i think the symbol for that mark is yeah it's another big chunks oh my god can't go missing them like that oh this is bad god he likes to talk this guy doesn't he oh my god a hole in the floor just saved me from getting spotted oh great die camera dude we freaking own those two guys let's check the security cameras the ones that are left i probably shot out like three of them already oh they spotted the body big chunk of snow of course there's like 10 men in the area where i thought there was just one what is this i'm just gonna have to fight him oh here we go let [Music] i love this shogun well i got a little bit spicy didn't it right elevator time which floor are you on v2 there isn't a b2 so i guess we'll go one four above i just can't believe the scale of this place man it's huge look at this i genuinely thought it'd be over once i'd finished clearing out the enemies on the top surface and halstrum would just appear out of nowhere control there he is i can see hellstrom's office but i can't get there via the elevator dude that'd be a crazy shot find an alternative that far on the ground every room needs its own air supply try the vent system defense system it is let's go the hell what's katniss everdeen doing down here just turn the reverb up on my mic all right here we go through the head okay his head has been destroyed just popped it like a watermelon i don't know how the enemies aren't hearing this by the way the shots are so deafeningly loud even with a suppressor i've made it to some sort of server room oh is this the ventilation system i guess because there's a guy standing at the bottom of it oh that's sad it wasn't lined up for a takedown that would have been sick still cool though i like the slides is that another security camera what stay dead hate those things okay hellstrom's office is right there a juggernaut outside of it good job i had my ap round selected didn't even pay attention there i wonder if anyone could reach it it's like he knows i'm listening who's nakamura if i say i want something done today it means i want it done oh my god you sound like my mom nah it's the last [ __ ] thing on your list it sounds like a ball right now okay i need to clear up the surrounding guards if there's any of them left there's one there i love it when their berets just fly off their head okay we're sneaking up on him oh no someone found a body oh hey lars so nice to finally meet you stop talking over my jokes oh my god do you have his key card shot the grenade on his belt all right give me that card cheers lars i need to use this ladder yep definitely using the ladder yeah i'm going up nothing to see here it's fine just almost got chopped up by the slowest fan in the world but besides that hello lovely didn't make too much noise apart from this guy who rudely opened fire let's look these guys up and then head to the mainframe level can i go this way oh it's just a little half wall what's this okay oh another slide oh i know where i am that's where i murdered all of those guys earlier v3 let's call the elevator down all right going down to b four mainframe that is a lot of servers control this is raven i've reached the mainframe try it carefully we'll go can you see the access terminal not sure wait definitely see a lot of bad guys the terminal must be in there surely i do see a nice collateral opportunity here these guys are having a chat there it is perfect lineup what the okay we'll just pretend we didn't see that drop down on this guy good night parkour parkour there's a guy right there yeah it's a problem all right did that guy just throw a grenade himself dispatch all squads yeah the spatula squads see what happens is this guy going he's going to join his body at the bottom of the ladder all right let's hack this terminal before everyone else shows up time to introduce the virus doing it now okay that's not good it doesn't sound very good does it give me a suit the system is down but i've triggered some kind of alarm the facility has gone into lockdown oh no i've had enough of lockdowns the security chief nakamura can reset the alarms get a key card how do we find her hostiles she must be out there copy that i'll locate her it's getting spicy now poor choice of words you won't prevail what kind of name is admire anyway am i a joke to i have nakamura's key card this is definitely dead now you can bypass their lockdown security now the lift should be working once you do okay see waving out let's get the hell out of here man we are a long way down huh he's zero all right it's done the lockdown has been lifted hey look down's lifted fast all right everyone that has been more of sniper
