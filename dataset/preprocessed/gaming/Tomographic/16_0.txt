i'm literally wearing the same outfit as the ai i didn't realize this is great the enemy's gonna have no idea which one's me oh i suppose i do have a sniper rifle on my back i can hear him he's this way somewhere making a lot of noise right now everyone is converging on his position [Music] they're gonna follow me down the zip line oh there he goes look he's on the smaller zip line let's get my breath back is he gonna take the zip oh he's got his binoculars out that's not my sniper okay we incapacitated him that's good i should have zeroed and got the head shot but should be able to get him when he self revives there it is oh no organs were hit but that is a that's a shattered collarbone that he will not get back up from and the victory is mine [Music] hello everyone my name is tom and i'm not afraid to admit it okay i'm a little bit addicted to invasions in sniper elite five so what is invasions i hear you ask well it's essentially a game mode that allows you to invade other players whilst they play through the campaign either solo or with a friend and the objective is very simple track down and kill your enemy before they take you out first invasions is an exciting game of cat and mouse where patience and knowledge of each level can be your greatest weapon and scoring each kill is incredibly satisfying but it's the thrill of the hunt it keeps me coming back for more and i absolutely love it what more can i say so i thought i'd take this opportunity to address the developers who you know might be watching this video so look rebellion please if you're listening please make invasions a separate competitive playlist one that plays q into expecting to be invaded right now the gameplay loop just leaves a lot to be desired with most players not realizing that they even have invasions enabled so rematches are rarely ever accepted and many players just refuse to take the l and end the session mid bullet cam to deny you claiming the kill the limited number of people actively playing the campaign just doesn't give me any hope for the longevity of this mode you know you've actually brought in some new players who maybe don't want to play the campaign but are really interested in the concept of invasions and i just don't want to see this mode fall by the wayside you know you've got a huge opportunity here so some communication would be fantastic anyway i've got some gameplay to show you now that i think demonstrates invasions at its best when you find a player that actually wants to play the campaign to attract invading players and of course with each kill gained i take one step closer to unlocking the ghillie suit and becoming the ultimate hide and seek champion this guy's already shooting everyone up on site i get up here no i think so it's one of the slides isn't it he's close oh god oh no yes let me revive i'm dead it's over he had to drop him he's so quick there see if he accepts the rematch oh yes no one ever wants to rematch once you've killed him i don't think many people realize they have invasions on so nobody's really playing for the pvp which makes me sad it's just so much fun this mod oh that was quick that was a really fast round surprised i spawned that close to him he'll take it he can accept another rematch though yes he is [Music] i wonder if i can actually blend in as one of the enemies just pacing up and down this road that'd be good hiding spot this actually isn't a bad strategy because if they're trying to play stealthy they're not going to shoot me which allows me to get closer i think this is the mission i played in my last video and it seems he's already cut the cable here so that's him on the other side of this wall that was a lot of recoil i got him though first time i've used the type 100 but it's an absolute bullet hose fair play this is really unexpected usually everyone just quits when they die i rate it can i put a pressure mine at the top of this ladder i know activate but i might be able to shoot it it's right below me this is great because it keeps spawning me on this side of the map where he's basically just started the mission i can hear him time to go stealth i want to try and get a melee kill so if he comes up this staircase i'm shooting out that window isn't he sneak mode activated oh no he's coming yes we got it oh my god this guy he just won't quit what a legend that was him for a second just shout myself let's try and take that roof again that was really good oh no he's down there shot me right up main street i was dangerous that window didn't realize how exposed there was i have the high ground now and again yes that was great the old bait and switch let's go again buddy i love this guy's willingness to persevere through the pain this is so cool man i really like that we're just fighting over this area constantly was that an ai running around or is he shooting over there [Applause] keeps trying to frag me see if i can frag him back [Applause] that wasn't very effective [Applause] he's trying to bait him out of cover enemy shooting in that corner if i put him on high alert he might try and push where was i him oh [ __ ] up the zip line he's still in that corner that was messy i didn't go down straight away that was weird i've had too much fun this game i love that this guy keeps accepting these rematches oh my that scared the crap out of me i didn't think it'd show cut scenes from his perspective on my perspective he's taking the tower down now though which is uh he's progressing through the mission i want to try and get a long range kill from this tower i'm like he's not in the same corner he is all right time to play the waiting game the key to a good sniper his patience bingo on the way i hit that first time oh my god this poor guy he hasn't killed me since we first started i'll try and keep him in his spawn this time if i can get there fast enough it's not gonna be over there already is he oh crap he was he got me he finally got me oh fair play well done well done my friend oh wait he got his kill that's all he wanted and ended the game you know what he stuck it out and i respect him for it okay this guy's done most of the first objectives he's blowing that up anyway this is going to be down here i think it's the only way to get there so oh i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead oh wait wait that's wood oh it's brilliant oh sorry mate at least you know you can penetrate stuff now wait for it there it is he's kicked me from the match what a game [Music] you
