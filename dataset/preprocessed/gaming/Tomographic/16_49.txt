other guy spot on you i'm blow torching him okay i'm in the vehicle i'm blowing talking i'm killing myself and him get wrecked that's amazing such a prolonged fight like just wanted it to end you know [Music] so world war 3 is back a multiplayer tactical fps game set in a modern global conflict now you may remember that world war 3 originally released back in 2018 but inevitably struggled to find its feet due to bad performance and server issues three years later the game is re-releasing and is currently in closed beta on steam early access and will eventually be free to play in march of 2022. unfortunately and i'm having flashbacks to when world war 3 first launched all those years ago because once again players myself included are struggling to even play the game due to constant matchmaking errors and server down time and it sucks the most because world war three is genuinely so much fun to play i was pleasantly surprised to see how far the gameplay itself has come but it's only fun to play when you can actually play it and that's a huge problem right now because well unless you're paying attention to social media you never really know if you can definitely claim already at the bottom of the stairs oh oh my game crashed my game crashed wait no it's a servers ah fetching data already mom spaghetti matchmaking issues are to be expected since this is a closed beta and lots of people are excited to try this new version of world war three but it doesn't make it any less frustrating especially if you're trying to play with friends as the squad system is just straight up broken at the moment there's no other way around it myself and acolyte spent a decent chunk of our playtime in the menu screen and we're met with infinite load screens disconnect sometimes the game would just put us in a match and then pull us right back out again we also noticed that matches never really filled properly since there doesn't seem to be any autofill functionality at this time so teams are often unbalanced and won't fill out during a match which definitely needs to be looked at because the game can feel quite empty at times with just 20 players on each side servers aren't the only problem though do not get me started on the vehicles in this game you think bf2042 is bad just you wait it's right i have an rpg far left side 25 here won't hit me and i need ammo soon oh my god i just said that oh my tanks right next to me isn't it yeah there is a tank right next to you oh tank please you've just killed me once was it on oh [ __ ] i have stolen an rpg hit the tank once i get an ammo up here reloading it's 21 damage has ruined me right in my head that hit didn't even register dude another tank on me here pretty low there's so many tanks take a move oh what the f no tom i don't care anymore all might join the dark side there's no going back yeah oh it's so loud oh my god i'm laughing up yeah it's pretty bad there is a scorestreak system that can help you deal with tanks and other armored vehicles but if you put a good enough player in the driver's seat they can easily survive the entire match now i know some of you guys were disappointed with the release of battlefield 2042 and therefore are hoping that world war 3 will somehow help to fill that void and what i will say is that the gun play in this game is good like really good far better than i expected and unlocking new weapons and attachments feels rewarding and addictive i mean the customization here is some of the best i've seen in any fps game so i have every intention to keep playing world war 3 but the server instability so far has been very unreliable for any early players and it's even more disappointing for those who bought into world war 3's early access three years ago the developers have actually made a public apology about the state of the closed beta and are responding well to player feedback with regular updates on social media so i guess time will tell if world war 3 can do a complete turnaround and hopefully the open beta will allow players to enjoy the experience without any of these issues you know second and third chances don't come often in the gaming industry but the foundation for world war three is so strong that it might just be enough to keep players attention this video was originally going to be sponsored by world war 3 but we had so many matchmaking issues trying to record footage for the game that i just didn't think it was in a very promotable state at this time you know i value your viewership and if the experience that you guys have in the game isn't consistent with what you see in my videos then i just don't think a sponsorship is worth accepting regardless of how fun the game can be when everything is working as intended so yeah hopefully i've laid everything out on the table so you can make your own informed decision about the game and if you can't wait to try world war 3 after watching this video then you can buy into the closed beta on steam with that being said i have some highlights to show you now from a full uninterrupted round playing with acolyte so if you enjoyed the video at any point do consider subscribing and drop a like for the algorithm it really helps me out stay safe and i will catch you legends in the next one i'll just get the broken wall there's so many broken walls dude please over there on the red ping over there i seen the broken wall the giant broken wall yeah i'm by a giant broken wall but it's not the one that you're talking about hmm it's just a giant broken wall tom you can't just say broken
