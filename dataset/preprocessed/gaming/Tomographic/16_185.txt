so this is the thin loadout that i'm using in today's gameplay alongside the new shadow tracer mp5 blueprint i've built the fin for longer range engagements this time around so we're using the long shot advantage barrel instead of the adverse barrel which i used in my last video the advantage barrel is much easier to control at range and it also hits a little harder too which is always nice i was trying the 100 round belt in the following gameplay but i don't really think it's that necessary for any other mode than quads so you can switch that out for something like the range of four grip if you want to and some of you guys actually informed me in my last video that the movement speed increase of the merc 4 grip was actually stealth nerfed in the last patch and so it no longer gives you that four percent movement speed that it used to but actually decreases your movement speed by one percent it's still a great attachment don't get me wrong but i do think the range of four grip has a slight edge at longer range so that's it for today's class setup thank you very much for watching leave a like on the video if you liked it subscribe for more and i'll catch you guys in the next one okay oh no oh no is this a good idea no we'll find out we're going to find out in a minute on today's episode of i hate my life sniper behind on over here oh no the stun we're being snagged oh closer closer right on us his was there you are there yeah he was always there i had no choice but to leave him finish that one around the corner he made flanked right yep okay with c4 there we go there we go lads well done there's a gas mask if anyone would like it i'm good also the stop and power rounds i learned in the fin similar to the uzi it actually improves the recoil instead of increasing it oh interesting it does it's only the fin and the easy stop and power rounds improve the accuracy it improves the accuracy yeah that's really interesting it's mad it's massive vehicle they did oh they're on the roof of uh yeah on departments [Music] maybe no just explosive stuff put one down in there and finished sounded really weird there's a guy on blue remember it's still going down blue yeah give me the trophy run well always run away multiple choice question uh well they might have ghosts or they may have run away one of the two find out the answer after the break i haven't got him on heartbeat i hear first steps on maine's below okay well i haven't got heartbeat he's just waiting in the stairwell see below me one down is that just one two not a team like then he's inside on here there's another one one more one dead yep i'm gonna try and pinch him i'm gonna come down there how wait stuff what more more more no that's me how did my c4 not hit him uh no hit

vehicle broke plates it's on your side nice good stuff there was a guy look he was just tom i was just standing here yeah i just saw her in the road yeah just chilling do you want to push to this by tommy that's probably a good like this is where they bought just in front of us yeah these guys could already be there in that building tommy yeah all right behind us right here of course and he thirsted me instantly my playing style live painting he's just on the end of the plane another one very low further back [Music] good to go i'll tell you what if those guys were less aggressive they probably would have won that was close yeah maybe you're right rest over there now as well wait they just attacked us one by one just full pistols team there's a team here on this roof team on the roof good eyes no plates on him nice well done i'm flanking wide right to get to my loadout this barrel is so much better for range dude my god i'm struggling arranged somewhere i'm not liking it it's better for range though this barrel if you're gonna use it for that it's better but i wouldn't i wouldn't use this as a ranged gun personally it's not brewing 2.0 no not at all no it's not kilo either no it's it's real decent in multiplayer but oh yeah hip fire multiplayer is yeah yeah it's insane found him nice top of the dome piece oh yeah uh we need a better position i'm gonna go rocks maybe but there's people to our right as well there is people to our right okay we want to just flank all the way around he's up maybe they died probably ghost maybe these hills are going to be back keep pushing right yeah yeah oh yeah we've now got a fairly but what about the people what's up has anyone got a little bit of sniper armor they wouldn't mind dropping can i have all of mine thank you
