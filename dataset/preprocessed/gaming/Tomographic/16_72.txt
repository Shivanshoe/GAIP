is this the variety content you asked for no literally no one asked me to play this game but look at that face is that the face of a man who cares no so put your seat belts on and let's play lawnmow lawn mowing simulator but seriously please leave a like on the video really helps thanks oh and please do subscribe so that i feel validated i know real grass was harmed in the making of this video okay bye okay company name what should i call myself my company how about tom moe tom oh or two mo it's a double entendre okay we need to do a ground check first otherwise i'm gonna completely ruin my lawnmower oh is that a newspaper that dog poo oh it made a little squidge sound that's disgusting oh this is definitely this is definitely in the way it's a rocket okay we're done oh look at this thing didn't even see this before i wonder if james bond lives here all right it's time let's mow this lawn now this this is gaming that is a man who is determined to cut some grass so we can lower the blades like that let's raise that first because that's gonna be dangerous do some severe damage straight away okay we're off the trailer let's find a good starting point shall we i feel like i'm probably just gonna go around in a giant circle for this one so wait what's that over there should we start there instead oh my god this place is huge going over here right let's start at this point i've got a recommended finish time of 26 minutes oh crap i didn't realize uh okay moe it's your time to shine you're about to lose your lawn mowing virginity okay ease on in there there you go get those blades started and we'll switch to first person cam here we go let's mow this lawn nope oh for god's sake your performance during cutting will affect how much money and rp you make yep you need to find the balance between speed and careful driving avoid damaging the flowers or lawn while cutting quickly to earn a time bonus okay we gotta get this done quickly oh man this is a tight corner i i'm like bumping my mower here how am i gonna do this cleanly okay oh yeah i've got these black wheels to worry about let's reverse a little bit oh god oh this is messy yeah oh yeah there we go we're on track now those little entrances are going to be a nightmare careful of the flowers we've got all this to do in 26 minutes let's go i think if i keep that right wheel on the outside a little guide wheel i will know not to go too far over okay now now we're in a bit of a predicament how am i going to make this turn there's a single blade of grass right there i thought he was gonna get away without being cut i'm a professional lawnmower and there's not a single blade of grass that's gonna survive today all right this is my plan we're gonna lower the blades and then start the cutters and then slowly nudge myself back in form line up with the side of the brick here and we keep moving forwards that's how mowing is done i'm pretty sure that's what rocky said so oh baby that is a clean looking cut all right let's do the same again reverse onto the pavement here don't crash into the house pretty sure delilah didn't say she wanted her kitchen mode so we'll stick to the lawn for now i don't know if she's called delilah but this this garden looks like a delilah kind of garden you know what i mean let's watch out for the flowers here nice and slow there we go we're back on course tight corner here oh yeah this game is so satisfying seriously what have i been doing my entire youtube career first person shooters first-person lawn mowing is where it's at we'll do the finicky entrances later i'm gonna stick to the borders for now and then come back i hope this is proper lawnmower etiquette and i haven't got any like die hard lawnmower experts are about to rip into me for my questionable techniques okay so the board is done now we're on track to do our second lap so we'll lower the blades and we're off to the races i need to pick up the pace a bit though if i'm going to complete this in time i'm going to put my foot down [Music] how has it been 25 minutes [Music] okay you know what that might have taken us way over the time limit but that is a good looking cut i mean there's a few trail lines but i mean i'm trying to build up a reputation with my customers you know i'm not gonna do a half-assed job otherwise word of mouth isn't gonna get around and in the countryside like this word of mouth is like twitter i mean there were a few damages i'll admit two pounds for a flower destroyed it's fine i did crash into one of her archways so that's on me but overall i actually made more of a profit than i did losses so honestly that's a great first day on the job all right new location let's go now this is going to be interesting i've got to be careful of the blades on those paths oh that's a big old area too all right let's do it now before i get all my mower we saw a few uh a few things are in the way there we go got a rocket what's that come on lady delilah nah that doesn't like a house that a delilah would live in victoria yeah that feels more appropriate oh there's a lot of like this is not a very level garden i'm gonna probably overthrow way too much just five objects i need to find that's a tennis ball one more object is for you another poo jesus victoria you need to learn to control yourself who was that hey lady have i told you about my lawn mowing services tom mo incorporated i mow your lawn so you don't have to that's a terrible catchphrase what the hell was that that's not a cow surely sound like a tyrannosaurus rex all right let's get this mower started right uh lower cutting deck we don't want to do that just yet because yeah that's going to cause some damage when we get off this ramp just ease it off the edge there we go lovely all right what's the starting point for this one this starting point looks a bit easier i drop this in here start those blades all right we're gonna try and do this one in time wait i've got to check between six and seven centimeters recommended finish time 26 minutes okay just a general cut they want sure i can do that so let's change the cut height in the bottom right there between six and seven how's that looking behind me yeah that's good just let the lawnmower do the work follow this around got to be careful of my speed here don't want to do any ground damage and that path is going to be a problem for sure okay this is actually going to be a nightmare didn't quite finish that cut there we go okay then lift then drop it back in then start i mean i did choose one of the most advanced law mowers that i had available i could have chosen something cheaper more easy to control perhaps but this one looks the coolest and has more features and that is what gets my money ah communism i think i prefer first person really allows me to get those edges it's a beautiful garden though very nice we're gonna stick to the edges like we did last time make sure we get all this okay raise i actually did a bit of damage to the blades there start of the motor again and we're off it's a very relaxing game not one i ever thought i'd be covering on my channel i saw the trailer for this a couple of weeks ago and it was just in the back of my mind this whole time i thought this could be a good meme and it is a good meme it's actually very satisfying to play and maybe watch i don't know i don't know how well this video is gonna perform you'll have to let me know but uh you know i said i post some variety and this is definitely that i might do this i might do this lawn in different parts you know it's already cut into segments might be easy to get my head around if i just do the different sectors one at a time i switch back to first person shall we first person mowing this is gaming in 2021 yeah you know what starting to think cut on each individual bit is a better idea yeah let's make a turn let's do it sector by sector i mean this is a level two job i think so how hard is it gonna get by level five i must run over that flower imagine the terrain obstacles are gonna be much more difficult i don't know if i'll ever see this game until the end but it is surprisingly addictive i've never driven a ride on mower in real life before so this game is allowing me to have that experience and i'm thankful what am i doing i've just realized how much of a dad i'm becoming i don't even have kids yet i think this lawnmower is called a mulcher so it like it cuts the grass so finely that i don't need to do any cleaning up afterwards which you can do in the game if you have a mower that isn't capable of doing this there's no like grasp in thing that i need to empty on the back which is great because i'm lazy i don't know if we're doing this one in the a lot of time just like the last one 27 done oh yeah oh the cleanest cut you've ever seen perfectly calculated and that is sector one complete raise the blades lower the blades blades engaged it's a big old job tell you what though tomo incorporated is really going up in the world look at this look at the scale not running any flowers over this time let's take a look at what we've done how we're looking fill fuel change cutting blade i need a whole bee there we go got new blade on fuel's looking good recover what does recover mean just get on it oh what do you mean you just teleported you know what i better recover is if you drive into a bush or get stuck it'll teleport it back into a safe location we don't need to worry about that i'm a professional crap i stalled there it is i actually get a bit of motion sickness in first person after doing that for so long oh yeah this is the life still have so much grass to cut oh one half's looking good though you can't lie i wish that cow would shut up for two minutes it's constantly moving at me unbelievable there he goes again careful as flowers nice oh no you didn't see a thing honestly that flower just had a death wish like it just ran out into the middle of the into the middle of the grass like it wasn't my fault on the home stretch now so close to finishing needs to get rid of these final patches what ground damage you've managed to damage the ground destroy some of the grass ground damage caused by turning your vehicle at full lock for extended periods of time why are you only just telling me this now game is that why there's these turn lines all over the place and you didn't think to tell me earlier i've been turning at full lock this whole time alright this is it the last piece of grass you ready wait and it's done mission complete we've smashed it and we drive through the gazebo oh no does that count as a collision surely not that was a pretty high curb don't tell me i just finished the job and then collided with that gazebo of all things that's a yikes from me let's get the hell out of here you can send me the money on paypal all right we did it job complete look at that it looks glorious three pound 26 in penalties and fines flowers destroyed collisions 225 ground damage zero point what i need to pay one pence that's nothing what did the customer go outside to examine my work and just found a little scuff of mud and thought yep that's coming out of his wages okay well i hope you enjoyed that folks it's a a very different game on the channel for sure never posted anything quite like this but it was a good meme i enjoyed myself at least a fun game to check out i appreciate you watching all the way through if you did leave a like for the algorithm and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music] you
