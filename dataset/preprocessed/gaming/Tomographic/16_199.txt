Lord what these guys doing oh my god why would you give yourself up like that it's over it's over yeah yeah we got the slam kill that's the content we were looking for was this guy going lost him I actually lost him in the gunfire sorry cuz that go-to sacrificed himself killed a lot of people in farmland so you probably cut them off as they try and come back in zone oh there's one it's Clint Eastwood I cut it again sorry I'm really sorry I really sorry I had to do it to you joking or popping a wheelie there it is don't see that every day look at that oh my god oh oh my magic if that killed me video over roll credits so quiet now I was a sniper on that building know what I'm going into downtown and they take the skyscraper behind him jump off hopefully slam see if I can pull this off and go into the top then I don't want to see any hassle from you guys in the comments all right without some good clean juggernaut fun today it's another guy in here as well see I'm running around on my roof so Claymore sup as well how cute this could be an ambush there he is don't be serious he actually tried to take me on like those guys are still on my roof let's go for it just quite the stretch don't think we're high enough to slam I couldn't pull off the slam but we did it alright back to the salt my dragon on a mission a mission for content oh we might be able to slam some on zones me then I spot him I'm going for it there is enemy spotted at the bridge it's quite far out though I'm coming in too late again too low to the ground sorry boys not to do it to you cutting off his own oh yeah keep fighting lucky dunno I'm coming so much trying to snipe me there he is Oh No and he has to come this way Oh on down he's behind the bus station she just stayed where it was ouch so much of right on my screen when I got shot I will get some more health back from my kill and then I assume this is a full squad this sounds like they're in a fight [Music] there's one other rock it's another Geoghan or dead on the gas smoke people have a lot of airstrikes in this house one down there's a page feedback from this guy and I will push this coke or sell fries maybe yeah yes oh no got revived and melly this guy I love it so much this is my favorite game it is this the juggernaut content you wanted guys just satisfying your needs it's a vehicle they're probably faster no miss the opportunity to gun this guy down yeah missed opportunity so much fun did so much fun all right we have a hill that's pretty good another juggernaut over there here's our zone all this could be POG a lot of people coming out sir now I'm come to me run the roof of gas station as well come on mate are you doing Jesus juggernaut is just trying to snipe me and I've actually got a sniper to impede

blasted oh my god how many airstrikes people have in this game thing we're good there we go another judgement this way shrunk it that guy where's his teammate down I'll be shot off mother go in the hill there Oh No ass big damage it's gonna revive his buddy I really needed that kill for health nice he's got self rise I'll pay itself price nice guy I still got a lot of health yeah being shot from all angles now it's been fun come on Jojo yeah solid effort I was too out in the open air guys that like fair bit of help as well if I could get the kill on the guy that I down then I would have got some health by fourth place I mean up with some decent Juggernog content I'll fake it I'll take it 21 kills 7,000 448 damage seal this one plays out it's gonna needs to cross out in the open now it's exactly how I felt it's getting smashed how's it gonna come out of this one alive she'll be moving to cover of that rock there there's do some decent damage to be fair these guys just aren't landing their shots it's three V 2 I think well 2 V 2 V 1 you know this dude's only got a slither a health thing like one more HD her shot and he's dead as a down he's doing it always doing it got some decent hell from that it's about a full squats worth of hell fair definitely another chance and the zones moving towards them it's not using a cover very well Oh is he no you're gonna get sniped stop peeking
