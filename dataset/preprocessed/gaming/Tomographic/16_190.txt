okay shotguns i'm out of place come on it's ridiculous yeah oh guy here i don't know how he shot me what um he might you got him the guy that killed me he was cheating so blatantly that guy that first guy you you killed tom he thought he got sniped oh no i mean he basically did blue blue this is good stuff hit the other one he's gonna get rezzed by z maybe i'm blue ridiculous good tom yeah yeah it is that's the team of course i'm good this is this is modern warfare launch 725 shotgun edition you made it my god stone you're a god how did you do it no i'm so superior in my hearing abilities like this i'm excited assume it's one dude before i heard that he knew what he was getting hit by he had the perfect range on it what it was a hip fire he wasn't even ads this game's ruined oh it's real ridiculous range so yeah the famous is completely broken in war zone right now but more specifically speaking i'm referring to the underbarrel shotgun attachment the famous itself still kind of sucks so what appears to have happened here is that with the recent season 5 update the fr-556 got a pretty decent buff to its range but as a knock-on effect this buff has also carried over to the 12-gauge deputy under-barrel and so instead of this thing being a one-shot at very very close range you can now one-shot anyone within a 15-meter radius as long as you're aiming at their torso i mean i've barely made any progress unlocking the fr-556 in modern warfare as to be honest it's just not a very competitive weapon but if you played modern warfare during season 2 then you might have unlocked this rather conveniently named code breaker blueprint which was available at tier 100 in the battle pass at that time so i played a few matches last night with my friends stoddy and stoneman64 and we ran into a fair number of people using this particular blueprint as well as numerous other players abusing the underbarrel shotgun attachment thankfully though we've already received confirmation from infinity ward on twitter that a fix is already in the works for this issue and it may have already been patched by the time this video goes live i'm gonna leave you now with some gameplay using the famous alongside the kilo 141 which i have set up like this but with that said if you enjoyed the video then make sure to drop a like subscribe for more and i'll catch you in the next one uh that's there's like two three teams going for this stone ruins so many words for me why just never hear them the right way again [Music] [Applause] oh yeah look at that parking my god i've seen that before
