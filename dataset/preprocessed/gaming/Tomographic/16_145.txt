hey guys it's tom here and welcome back to the channel so i'm returning to the modern warfare m401 in this video alongside the cold war lw3 sniper rifle which is just a really solid choice for long-range sniping i think it's actually knocked the hdr off the top spot for range so you know i might do a dedicated video on the lw3 at some point maybe when the cold war attachments have been fixed but for now at least this is the build that i've been using if you wanted to try it for yourselves with that said though we're just gonna jump straight into the gameplay today i've got a couple of matches to show you here playing with stoddy westy and benny central some good banter and some really great rounds in this one so make sure to leave a like if you enjoy the video it really does help me out and you know if we're being transparent it helps to get these videos noticed by youtube's algorithm so i appreciate the support do consider subscribing if you want to see more videos like this one in the future and i will see you legends next time what a show oh my god it doesn't kill you now how does it not it doesn't kill you anymore no that's boring that's why it didn't kill me the
