got any stuns can't stun can't I wanna throw me on the book let me blow up Beauty hit me once so in today's video we're finally taking a look at the Odin assault rifle I've had so many requests to try this thing out in warzone so it's about time I go around to it so the build amusing today includes the cluster suppressor TAC laser the okay three times optic commando four grip and thirty round mags this build works great but I think the final build that I'd recommend with include the 810 millimeter barrel in place of the commando for grip reason being is that the perks of having damage range bullet velocity and recoil control are really gonna help you out of those longer ranges now this does significantly decrease your mobility I mean look at this thing compared to my character model it looks ridiculous but that is also the reason why I use an mp5 as my secondary weapon with this loadout I use the Odin for any medium to long range engagements and the mp5 for any close core battles and I have the mp5 set up like this these two weapons work really well in tandem and I highly recommend you try this loadout for yourself the Odin has some serious stopping power but you do only get 30 rounds to work with maximum so dealing with multiple opponents at once can definitely be a problem if you're accurate an aim for the head you can absolutely destroy with this build and in the right hands the Odin is one of the best performing weapons in warzone so with that said thank you very much for watching please consider subscribing with notifications turned on so you don't miss out on any future warzone videos and I will see you next time someone else is definitely going for this just below me not if we get there first I'm not dead mama found him another one chasing you any of them drop ya one dropped off one cup of cool guys we got a load out let's do it pretty cool dudes team moving towards in there yeah you're moving towards I'm coming you want to go up the tower yeah yeah there's one there's a guy there I don't know if he's I don't know if he's at matok below now he's finished right that was one one underneath me I think there might be one underneath me we can make some noise everyone on my side my side my side my side yeah looking now us one my boss on my side I think they're gonna go for it is gassed so his gas is underneath the stairs oh my god the lag yeah this lack man how's he gonna be in this he's running all the way down are you gonna chase him stop take the zip I'm meeting the bomb I know I meet me the bottom to jump on it this is a joke he can't jump out at it see he's coming he's just waiting for it to stop it shoot she's so dumb Westie why did we do this fair play to fair play he needed a little marathon sprint before he was about my team let's take him in I'm a bit dizzy from that I was so dumb that's the dumbest thing I've done in war zone so far this is the dumbest thing I've done in war zone I'm gonna drop it here stud literally the only way to win a building fight like that is if the enemy team is actually bad any plates can you buy me some plates and some self roses or made me play I suppose I could actually do you want to get yourself raised yeah keep the change your filthy animal alright and then Westie he gay I'd love some plates as well do you want a fight surprised I didn't get the kill for them you just wanna automation did a lot hit markers there and they get five plates please and I hit markers there oh yeah I got the Savior did you not get like an assist councils kill no interesting do they do that occasionally welcome to call of battlefield player in front on blue never enough cash he's just run across left to right okay not sure where that is they're morons on the big roof yeah I'm building okay I got to push back knowing a good spot he's got fifty second orange orange tie guy broke our guy he's got fifty seconds more for us to jump just wait there's a sniper on orange as oh I down below it's just here we're just here on blue laughter cut say hey m13 stealth beam i see his laser all no find you it was like down here I can't I can't mark it started looking to your right in that little corridor down there one lip that's got Tim above oh dude sometimes an absolute hit marking machine back up here this is just hitting Marcus it sounds me then I'm sure the c-4 nice thank you for Houston roofers are indeed I can't get my gear can i he's directly above me okay running and he just saw me a little bit late but we still got time so good side right side yeah finish teammates behind him his team's behind him quick I'm running my I stop the the p90 is literally a hitmarker machine don't ya like I literally I sprayed them for a good like three seconds like the monolithic I've got ya next time arranged you've got a barrel saying on it in the barrel again this building yeah right on edge of zone in lads scouting for girls nothing for lads anyone oh yeah broke other one that you like boy David Yoda -
