so the zrg 20 millimeter bolt action sniper rifle has finally been added to warzone and black ops cold war and it is a lot of fun to use it's not the prettiest looking gun i've ever seen actually reminds me a lot of the craba from apex legends but it does pack one hell of a punch and does some serious damage based on first impressions now you can unlock this bad boy by getting two long shots in a single match 10 times in either black ops cold war or war zone which is fairly straightforward i am working towards maxing out the zrg sniping myself but once i do you can expect another video showcasing my ultimate class setup but this is what i was using in the following match alongside the ffar and i hate that i have to use this thing to have a good game in war zone right now but it's true i don't think the time to kill has ever been this high in war zone and sadly most guns just can't compete with the ffar in its current state i really like the zrg sniper rifle i don't think it will be a meta anytime soon but it can definitely compete and will easily be a favorite for some players it's got a really fast bullet velocity and bolt time and it's just a really cool gun it's just not quite as flexible as the kanai ak or lw3 but it is a solid pick for long-range sniping we played this match around midnight uk time last night which is pretty rare for us but we wanted to get some gameplay as soon as possible but we had a lot of fun using the new sniper and just membing around for dance as always and you're gonna want to stick around for this one because we absolutely pop off with that said though leave a like if you enjoyed the video and subscribe for more like this thank you so much for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one all right boys let's go stadium yeah we could do a pog i mean there's no there's no loot room there anymore is there no we can go port or a support poggy port there isn't a buy station directly at it but there's one behind it so yes we can make that work oh god oh god it's throwing skins online might as well dispute roy skins online.com oh my god they both they both ran straight into me and just went for the punches yeah of course they do because it's the most powerful weapon in the game where are they why am i not dead yet where are these lads somewhere i think there's a guard uh i've just seen one right here what happened melee oh no we need to push this i've won it i feel like we need to push this stud no longer right on me they're right on me that's good to know at least you're honest about it

right now you can rogaine starting off over here in the vehicle in the vehicle in the bacon i'm getting highlighted and right [Music] make sure you break the windows because the snipes um don't one shot three windows yeah what if it protects us from this thing no no because because modern warfare's will gilly and they've got no glint default hdr scope does have glint default car 98 scope doesn't it's variable right yeah very fair he just stopped running over here he's in the building just stop running as soon oh one there two snipers oh yeah there's two two on the one i'm gonna hit what the other one i've got precision if they push them we can try and get the money you can right pick them right he can laugh that looks like a headshot what why did he put it there put it right on you it's put it on me sometimes if there's like a wall right in front of you okay then he's outside behind the building on the left yeah i'm pissed dude 33 players left oh come on dude i hate opposition right now might go around the silo yeah push super far or they might just be holding peak they might just be holding them and there's one sniper from another i've angle car 98 by the looks of it yeah i'm a hit i'm gonna run that way but we've still got the angles they're gonna have to run around i think we need to work on regain instead of kills right now yeah but what i'm saying is these guys have my money yeah but they're too far away from us to loot now let's let them get closer at least we're fighting them on the edge of the gas i'm going to get their money they're they're coming right here

stragglers out here sons tons of players left some strugglers sun's out guns out money oh great now that you've got a buy oh i've got no buy do you reckon they should um add a thing to the game where you can have a mobile buy like the apex thing yeah that must be moby that'd be awesome and you have to call it in obviously it causes a big ruckus so yeah and the reason that you're calling in
