really happy to be showcasing this game on the channel again first off though I wanted to say a special thank you to focus Home Interactive for sponsoring this video the game of the Year Edition is now available on ps4 Xbox one and PC as a full standalone version or as a paid expansion for existing owners and there is a bunch of new content included with this expansion including a new class new maps new weapons new special zombies horde mode and cosmetics it also contains an entirely new chapter for the campaign set in Marseille France which makes for a really great backdrop to be slaying zombies in and I'm actually gonna be showing you the first part of this chapter in today's video I think you'll be pleased to hear that I'm playing with a cue light Jack frogs and sacral in this one if you want to learn more about World War Z and help support the channel in the process then feel free to check out the link at the top line of the video description to find out more this game still continues to amaze me with the sheer number of zombies that can appear on screen at one time and it's actually kind of insane how little the performance is affected by so much happening at once so
