red bull rampage where renegades are born what makes a true renegade pushing the limits [Music] 720. square and twisting the hips for that nice whip onto the 360. [Music] [Music] lots of creativity on that front flip [Applause] stopping that rodeo [Applause] okay guys look i'm not afraid to say it riders republic is my current game of the year i really mean that you know it's surprising to play a game from a triple a publisher in 2021 that just wants you to have fun i'm sorry but that just feels so weird to say out loud there is just so much personality and love that's been poured into this game by its development team and it's clear to see the passion behind every aspect of the game's experience the social element when playing with friends free roaming or playing some of the multiplayer game modes is also super enjoyable with modes like 64 player races or even 6v6 trick battles and the simplistic gameplay with just enough new ones to make the controls feel addictive and motivate you to improve sure it's not perfect but that's what makes it special anybody can play and pick up the basics pretty quickly but if you want to learn some of the more advanced tricks and maneuvers the game allows you to take off the metaphorical stabilizers from the get-go if you like extreme sports games like ssx skate descenders or even steep maybe you haven't played any of those games but there is something for everyone to enjoy here from downhill mountain biking to bmx freestyle riding through breathtaking landscapes and racking up points as you attempt to pull off some crazy tricks the world of riders republic is your playground and the sky really is the limit it actually reminds me a lot of forza horizon with races and events happening around you at all times just on a much larger scale i guess it makes for a really fun setting and whenever i step away from the game for a few hours i quickly realize just how uneventful my real life actually is anyway my last video on riders republic was really well received by you guys and you wanted to see me play this game with some of my friends so that's exactly what i did and i was able to get acolyte fogler and stomato64 involved and we had an absolute blast there's some really great moments in this one and it shows you what writers republic is all about so if you could do me a favor and drop a like on the video it really helps me out subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one just beaming me oh yeah i see the beam yeah we're beaming each other oh we're tethered in the social area that's cool yeah so this is the mass race if you want to meet here we can ready up whoa whoa look how many people are gonna be 64 players in one race and it's
