oh oh my i love that sound so much the a10 warhog in this game sounds incredible yeah that is amazing oh there's two guys far right side oh low there go on that uh like shack building if you can get that where the sandbags are in the open in the open [Music] oh shoot i'm on the red marker oh my god i just sniped the driver out of the vehicle well done oh and then slide the gun off the back let's go yeah first strike double kill triple [Music] holy [Music] [Applause] that's right welcome back everyone to insurgency sandstorm and a big thank you to focus entertainment for sponsoring this video now then if for some reason you've been living under a rock firstly i mean come on that cannot be comfortable unless you're a starfish then it's probably fine secondly did you know that insurgency sandstorm is finally available on console playstation and xbox to be exact the game has been available on pc for a while now but it's about time you console players got a decent tactical fps to get stuck into let's be honest tactical shooters like these are seriously lacking on console and this one for me strikes the perfect blend between hardcore realism and accessibility you're not overwhelmed by a million different keybinds and overly complicated mechanics which makes it a pretty great matchup for any of you controller players if you've been following my channel for a while you know just how much i enjoy insurgency and i've been on a bit of a tactical shooter kick recently there's also a pretty active community on this game who love to use the voice chat which is always super entertaining [Music] i really do love the audio in this game just generally they've done a really good job the a10 warthog that you heard at the start of this video and then some of the weapons just sounds so powerful everything feels like it's got a kick behind it you know it's not going to be very believable if you want up someone from across the map with what sounds like a nerf gun now is it anyway i've got some gameplay to show you now just one mostly uncut round from hours of footage that i recorded with aculi so if you want to see more let it be known by dropping a like on this video the round you're about to see though just shows what insurgency is all about finding flanks behind your enemy and just wreaking havoc while attacking or defending an objective if you want to get the game for yourself you can do so by clicking the link in the description below but with that being said enjoy the gameplay and i will catch you legends in the next one i think it's about time i bring out the british made le-5a2 or the a1 i think it's called the a1 now it's definitely the a2 the a1 was like the predecessor to this gun ah i don't think the a1 had a rail system at the front like this one does gotcha gotcha i pressed middle mouse button i managed to pull out a smoke grenade right click throw it up into the sky and then swap back to my main weapon with one button oh he's gaming gaming yeah something's off i don't know what it is but uh your brain i'm in here yellow d looks really good on this map yeah now this game's gotten much better visuals this map is nice the lighting oh this feels so much better i can't believe my sensitivity was so off [Applause] that was the issue yeah i've played second floor do you wanna try pushing up left inside this dumpster right here oh yeah he's trash is the front right side of be careful there's a strafe straight oh here we go he's in the top i don't see anything redrums holy sends shivers down my spine that sound can repair my eardrums dude [Music] i don't know if your buds are the way to play this right now why are you still using earbuds i might be able to get a cheeky flank here as long as they don't spawn next to me oh oh yeah here they come i'm inside upper floor okay i've got four down outside oh my butt oh no he's right in front of me there's one guy up for one lower timing jesus that was crazy feeling so much more zoned in now they've got my sounds fixed feeling better oh yeah i'm gaming i'm glad you got to fix too buddy i've been playing these guys like a fiddle this round the other guy was upper dialed in okay oh no they've just spawned in it's like a million footsteps near me oh the guy up there he's looking down the guy on the left is it what you're dead died and i died and respawned all at the same time oh i finally died finally died that was such a spring i feel like i don't see this guy and then i just die i don't know i don't know where he is he's got a nasty angle careful teammate uh he's on your left knee oh he's just stood there he's dead don't worry moving on i think we're getting air support oh my god that guy just got obliterated holy it's my chance to get back to where i was probably hiding inside that is the nastiest angle i have ever seen dude i got the guy was he crouched behind some rubble yes yeah he's dead yes thank you sorry it wasn't sooner oh it's okay i need to catch that point really they just spawn again wave left this spot is nasty tom i'm in hong kong you may not be able to touch him i'm just going to do this that's fine you know they added a well rod to the game yeah like six patches ago i didn't know this what the hell bolt action pistol how do you even reload this you don't oh boy sorry i was afk towards the end there couldn't call stuff in very well uh oh it's one prone outside main entrance oh my god i got to stop he did himself right side he died he died just killed two that looked like our own three that might open him nice i think you can capture from up above as well as long as you're directly on it i'm going to play out front so you guys can cap it but what the hell is it that's that heli isn't it that is such a nasty angle yes oh we've got zero waves playing temple run an insurgency right now pretty accurate analogy you tell my teammates oh we got him pinned here god damn it what's up oh no it's behind the desk no way oh my god i [ __ ] that up he's gaming it's been such a crazy round dude love it freaking door oh no should have kicked it let's try man let's try it you're killing it up there i was gaming you fixed your sensitivity and all of a sudden you're just slapping open the door 22 and two damn it he's killing it this guy that was a good round that felt really good gotta head out guys ggs i'll play guys good
