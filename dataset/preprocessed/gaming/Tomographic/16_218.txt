thank you game oh yeah Tom was hitting some nasty shots the cover while you're pushing there was just hmm yeah DX 50 is gonna game-changer you using the X 15 oh yeah okay I need your loader I'm gonna try this thing that's insane I'm gonna try this thing go 17 Connor how did that happen I don't know man what did they come from I don't know okay so I guess I was wrong about the ax 50 in war zone I posted a video recently claiming that the HDR was the only sniper rifle you needed in war zone but I've been using the X 50 a lot this week and I've come to the conclusion that this thing definitely deserves a place in your loadout so the HDR is still my go-to sniper rifle for ranged engagements but when it comes to the X 50 you really can't play with a more confident and aggressive playstyle at most ranges and this is mostly due to the high mobility and snappier feel that comes with the ax 50 and if you like quick scoping then this is definitely the sniper rifle for you so this is how I of my x50 setup you can swap out the fully loaded perk for the monolithic suppressor if you want the extra damage range and sound suppression or even go with this seven round mags from my last X 50 setup video well I'm trying to max out the 80s speed with this particular build so there's definitely a couple of things you can change here but for me this loadout has been working really well in game and it's always nice to start out with maximum sniper ammo as soon as you grab your loadout but do feel free to tweak this loadout to your liking and let me know what you think I especially want to hear from you if you've been a HDR main since warzone first released well I'm going to leave you with a super intense game that I had with Scotty and Wesley recently using that growl next 50 loadout I showcased a couple of weeks ago but instead using this x50 build with the fully loaded perk instead of the seven round mags but with that said leave a like if you enjoy the video and make sure to subscribe for more content like this and help me reach that 100k milestone we're getting really close now so thank you for all of your continued support on these videos it has honestly been really uplifting for me during these crazy times that we're living in at the moment and I just wanted to let you all know that I really do appreciate it so thank you for watching stay safe and I will see you
