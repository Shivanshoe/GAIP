hail to the king operation oh boy man he looks so sick holy classic i got the plate oh there he is godzilla and kong have seen each other okay i'm heat rain kong nice i'm doing it dude i'm watching i'm doing it they're looking at each other he's charging he's charging oh you missed it's not doing anything no i don't think they can damage each other no they can't the only downside so far what it's a huge downside because the freaking event is called godzilla versus comedy yeah just godzilla and kong versus uh versus godzilla what was this when did these two become teammates literally you haven't seen the movies i've seen the movies and this doesn't happen well actually it doesn't matter dude well actually oh yeah maybe a little bit found a plane blast his ass so the king kong vs godzilla update has finally landed in warzone and reflecting on the time i spent playing it yesterday i can't help but feel a little bit bummed out by it all like the friends i've played with bugler acula and stoneman64 they all really seem to enjoy it and not to say i didn't enjoy playing with them because they're my boys and we always have a fun time playing together but the mode itself just got really stale for me after a couple of games and i just wasn't as invested as the other guys were like they were having fun getting kills and i don't know if spmn was enabled in those games but it did not feel like it whatsoever the mode itself was basically just a glorified resurgence game mode where you earn rewards by shooting two massive ai for 30 minutes that's kind of what it felt like so yeah in the first game when you don't know what's going on it's really exciting seeing godzilla and kong on the map and i don't want to take away from the devs at all because holding something like this must be a technical nightmare especially on warzone's engine which is pretty dated now and if you enjoyed it then that's great i'm really happy for you but at the same time there's a lot of people who like myself have seen the movies they know the potential of seeing king kong and godzilla fighting on caldera and how awesome that would be in a virtual environment with hundreds of players seeing and experiencing the same thing as you like there's something so special about that and i'm not making this video to bash call of duty for making a bad mode because it's not bad it's just not reached the potential i think so many people imagined it would i think maybe that's because of the trailers looking quite misleading compared to what we actually got and you could say well tom it's not over yet we've got two weeks of this limited time mode or whatever but how many people do you think are gonna come back towards the end of the event compared to how many played on the first day and i think a lot of people would have reinstalled the game for this event who maybe haven't played in months or are brand new to the game you know we all know warzone is not a small download so if this is what they got versus what they saw in the trailers i can't imagine they'll be leaving or staying feeling very satisfied so i guess what i'm trying to say is yes the mode is decent it's okay but it could have been a great event that everybody talked about for years to come okay so imagine if what we just played was a cooperative event king kong and godzilla spawning at the start of the match the same way they do currently but this time we the players decide who wins that fight between king kong and godzilla imagine a massive battle 50 vs 50. we capture points get kills and still earning the killstreak thing the device that you use to control kong and godzilla by the end of that battle team godzilla or team kong get to see the other team's titan be defeated by their titan how cool would that be and then at the very end you hear everyone on voice comms cheering and laughing like that could have been so much fun and make it like a two-day limited time event as well why do we have to go on for two weeks playing this game mode that clearly isn't holding many people's attention i mean the mode is literally called king kong vs godzilla and they don't touch each other or stand within the presence of each other once pubg mobile did a kong vs godzilla mode over a year ago now which was so much better than this a mobile game this is one of the cutscenes you get to see in that game would you not have wanted to see this in warzone the only way that this can really be saved for me is if they have this big plan where mechagodzilla arises from the ocean and kong and godzilla fight to take him down but i just don't see that happening and if it does happen it's probably going to happen at the end of this event when the hype has completely died down and nobody really cares anymore i've also seen first hand and experienced this bug where basically when you earn the device that allows you to throw king kong's rock or use godzilla's atomic breath like an airstrike essentially that it just places it right where you are and i think i figured it out we've all experienced it where you bring up the binoculars for the cluster strike or airstrike and you go to put it down in front of you but oh no there's a piece of cover in front of you that's stopping you from doing that and you've got to run otherwise you're going to die so in this mode you basically bring up a tablet you select where you want the strike to go and then if you're lucky it will go where you placed it but most of the time it will just place it right where you're standing because there's cover between you and your enemy so my advice is if you want this to go where you've placed it you basically need to stand in the open somewhere where there's basically direct line between you and your target so yeah the rock that kong throws is essentially a reskinned cluster strike and godzilla's breath is just an airstrike it makes sense development-wise it saves them a lot of time but in practice it clearly doesn't work very well where are you at okay i'm gonna put one on stone it's on screen on me i've called it on you blew it kong's wrath is coming stone you put it in the wrong spot no i didn't no don't talk oh it put it on me it put it on me stone it put it on me i'm anyway i don't want to run anymore i feel like this is going a direction i didn't intend it to but look again i'm just a bit disappointed by what we got versus what was advertised and what it could have been i thought that at least be some side objectives or some interaction between kong and godzilla i'm gonna leave you now with a little bit of gameplay from a good match we had which kind of just shows what this mode is all about but it's basically just normal resurgence with godzilla and king kong barraging you with rocks and beams all the time it's chaotic it's fun and it's free but it could have been so much more let me know your thoughts in the comments below thank you so much for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one i got a gas mask let's go you should see my point acquisition right now it's insane it just goes up so fast nice hey it's tech boy where you going snoop where you going snoop come back here right oh he got me i'm pushing these guys i'm just gonna send it where are they i'll kill one and get it right ahead of me here careful of the beam careful of the beam i'm dead you good connor yeah i'm fine stone's not though [ __ ] this god i'm getting so salty in this game mode i've never been to salty before there's so many down there load of no skins guys are everywhere round one oh i might need to reload in the game on me [ __ ] easy cleanup you get him yep that's my boy with a pistol go on right after this morning okay two knocked so oh my god what's this happening down there was it kong are you one as well that's the last of their team they're all dead i think kong crushed him there's a oh there's a sniper right here oh oh my god let's kong the life army broke one i didn't love it at all you know what i'm gonna get us a load out here executed down the guy they're down to you know where his team is this guy's behind us i got a loadout inbound here i'm gonna get this and i'll be with sick oh my goodness look at that generosity there his teammates are nowhere near here where they are though there's some down in factory i'm gonna go for oh he's on roof of factory there it is if you could put some pressure on factory roof i can launch on them hitting a balloon out godzilla please bring anything you got oh i'm gonna follow that guy shots down there green i'm moving that guy's like one hp that i just tagged that guy just died to king kong's foot i realized there was a guy there i don't see this we're just playing our own game right now this guy's team is back still on purple they were hiding in there or parachuting above hey i need to regroup with you guys that's cool oh yeah this place may never mind go kong go i keep forgetting you get placed from picking up those blue things it's going to burn me yeah it's tough to get used to it oh no way that burns me it's so nice between us between us there's a bunker there between us yep zoom in oh yeah they're all in over there i'm down i'm coming but i'm kind of far freaking papaya aim i'm very close trying to get off kong now some down on purple there i'm coming i don't know if you got them if that was the team that rotated oh don't load our headstone behind come with good ground load he's down low he's down love that i love that let's go get him so what's the trick with calling in this the device you can't have anything in line of sight out here yeah it's literally like the binocular issue there's a guy behind that tree he's like see it maybe hit once there's a ton of them over there oh i'm gonna be in here [ __ ] from wherever oh uh like bb oh beam beam that's the image oh he's right above us right now i'm doing one hp damage give up

launches that immediately the way he charges it dude you can just hear the death that's fun isn't it it was actually the fastest one ever yeah it was really quick where was your money accolade wait i don't think money trucks kong's rest yeah right between as well to your left there there you go yeah i see no money doesn't drop wow because when you come back you still have all your money you died

now you can stand all right yeah yeah yeah i'll let them fight a lot i would move over now last team let me see you casual 4v1 and i don't have an airstrike or nothing to use a no no sniper that would have been that would have been a game winner if i had a sniper [Music] come on godzilla drop something on him that'd be so good right now bs man why does godzilla hate us so much honestly hey you got a 20 bomb corner let's go accolade with the 20. you said 20 i was aiming for 20. you got it that's what we love you're that's what we love to see he did it
