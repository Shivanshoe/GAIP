oh the numbers 25. you writing them down are you writing them down no i'm just kidding i don't care oh god what is that oh my god ladies have some freaking respect for your neighbors yeah he was he was in that building broke that must be the guy he's on the airfield now is he crazy two of them what the hell is this he's gonna die now because there he is because i killed him i haven't hit a single shot it's okay i brought one of them uh behind the truck now i'm getting grenaded close close okay don't know where i'm getting beamed from both teams i couldn't i couldn't love that anymore because it sounded you loved it though no i i i quite enjoyed that oh no he's on controller it's not obvious you couldn't 180 that does broke one think of myself i don't think so oh let's go legend the flick shot is still with me getting upset getting shot up by somebody i'm lagging i'm dying i'm lagging and dying where's this guy i'll tell you keep running in i'm gonna try and put you up on the quad bike oh wait he's on the court behind me dude i gotta i gotta push it in oh come on i'm lagging can i push no no i'm about for round two damn it it's not gonna work sorry just just go just go just go realistically you could have rezzed me outside the zone because of hell oh don't shut up shut your mouth shouldn't be this difficult to find money in this game dude i'm very fond of my building careful behind ah i hear mom's going underneath me  you're so loyal how much bloody damage is that guy gonna take dude it takes too many bullets to kill people the ball zone is like a box of chocolates you just never know what you're gonna get i know exactly what i'm gonna get pain it's just a familiar game and there's nothing else i haven't played the game properly in over three weeks um coming up to a month now yeah that's probably roughly the same i took a long break from the game i think the last time i played we all played yeah we just need some new content man i'm so burnt out on the game at the moment if they give us the new map and they're working guarantee cheat yeah we'll be back in an instant we're going up this one it's broken there he is keeping that no just behind the wall oh yeah beautiful load out money somewhere nice it's light right here wait where'd you put it it should be good right can you get that i hope so that's very high up steps you're real with you we might not be able to get that uh climb outside on the roof oh no the gas it's chalked connor what have you done you literally had one job we were waiting for that for so long can we shoot it down wait i have deployable cover you're not gonna be able to vault onto it though i don't know about that like a gas mask yes got it did you get it yeah and it shows the wrong loadout panic stand on the stair railing then jump onto the deployable cover i can't got it dr gas okay we got to move immediately it sucks yeah we're dead going quick okay of course this sucks dude yeah that's pain he's in the window no he's in the window he's not worrying my friend i am your shield i'm gonna work yeah this is uh we had the horrible position in there nice we got a load out sooner you should just say you should have let me get on the quad because it's driven away i tried but i mean oh wait you still feel good yeah man we win these hell yeah i thought you uh just kind of read my mind because of the direction i was running like if anything i was going the wrong direction if we were going to come out of that fight alive yeah i thought you were going to come back to me and just back it up or something i don't know we'll get a better start in time was it worth it for that calling card to get that win uh winning yeah no nothing's ever worth in this steps of your position oh my god next time though just don't eat our loadout on top of a roof that has been known to be unacceptable listen i haven't played in like three years a week can you not do that next time that'd be great thanks three weeks me too and even i was like what have you thrown on this during those three weeks i've tried to forget the game [Laughter] okay yeah it's not that i accidentally forgot i was purposely for trying to figure out right that's the difference deliberate amnesia yes okay i was thinking about the other day it's like i'm so glad i met you guys i know it's corny to say but it goes without saying like we're very comfortable playing with each other whoa dude pause this is why i don't open up to any of you guys i just keep my feelings deep inside just push them right down not the only thing you keep deep inside apparently well you know because we're just comfortable like we can make those types of jokes and always have a good time playing even when we don't have a good time playing legit yeah just meme we meme instead yeah gaming fun we'll have fun and then we come out when we come out on top we're just like tom loves being on top okay dude how long are you waiting for that one there's one this one in this one blue container over there i don't know okay love that freeze would be cool for this mode i think yeah but the thing the reason they didn't do that is because you can't 1v3 true you just can't yeah you need a good good team of everyone using comms you need at least two people to 2v3 like to get those kills that's the only way because you can't even well you can't even 1v3 in apex you can it's just very difficult you have to be on form with your ability usage whereas this game yeah it's basically do you have a stun grenade he's coming up broke him down them nice that one's further where further uh east 105 or something nice he's so mad 150 150. i have to push across dude this is not going to be fun we should fall sand on him we should full stand on him there he is yep eyes on on the rock yeah i see oh dead you take reduced fall damage it takes you twice as places yeah of course you'll be good you'll be fine you just know there's going to be someone sat like in this building or like oh yeah sit right on them oh my god they are no way let's get in there it's outside broken very low very low there you go that'd be where's his teammate maybe it's too late for me to try to do that are you real with you you can't you can't use that excuse when you're playing with me at this it's 7 30. this hour it's half past midnight now yeah you want to go to bed now happy birthday man happy belated birthday well it's not now it was it was yesterday crossing yeah what's happening i can't hit him it's nothing do we trash did they nerf this thing do they nerf me this tomographic oh frick he's pushing he's pushing left at the rock steam is down that's why all right still there yeah broke climb a tree now he's running inside position oh my god oh my god yes oh he just smashed his mouse now we have the positioning and i got an smg we're gonna get pinned oh this is perfect mounted somehow that was very awkward that was my thermal oh okay i threw it miles like sky high took forever to come back down sky guy to the right 67 degrees behind the bus sniped head shot he's hurt hit the ground killed through the wall so you pan him through that whole bus van the whole thing he's gone we're a terrible spot we're gonna have to put them all this way heading this way okay yeah stay where you think right it's better take the roof of their building my attack sprint dammit yeah i'm dead i'm dead oh i'm dead every single person i wanted to fight there would not fight me i just peaked the top of that building and a guy with a shotgun peaked at the opposite yeah and that's for our frick sticks please don't hop out that window thank you are you killing him i did murder him why is his buddy oh he's here we're playing still broke him fully clapping my cheeks he's flashed solo dude yes okay that was his teammate i guess last bullet why does buddy just leave he dropped his better krieg for a worse it's not very creek-like krieg trick am i saying it wrong or are you saying it wrong it's probably just craig doesn't really matter because there's so many words that we mispronounce anyway because yeah you guys are always wrong over there in the eu over there in the eu mate you ever heard of brexit i've got an eyelash in my eye it's really annoying trying to blink it free yeah so what you need to do is use a different eyelash to dig that one out right it's like when you have glass in your eye a pair of tweezers get to use more glass have you seen anyone should be kind of strange yeah this guy in the middle of that field that's not engaging there's two of them i can precision i mean what do you want to do do you want to try to call them or you want to murder them see if they're crossing yeah they're crossing targets you're cleared off i think they're going for that quarter just on the road yeah come on oh freaking away put it ahead of them he was not happy about that no doubt he's running go for the building it's inside that first house now that's toxic let's kiss i'm going for a vehicle so it's like yeah you put it ahead of them right yeah so they didn't get the notification nope that's why he's like how did i get a precision strike bro like what i know the voice is taken in that window i could just take the quad uh do you want to yeah you drive like do you really okay we don't die quickly we did have to hit everything got it okay wait do i got it we need to get a round prison so stop here maybe you can quickly fight you want i don't know we can try i was gonna go up a little further yeah but there might be like people love gulag so the prison yeah they're fighting there now i don't want us to become the meat chicken behind us the prison i'm most afraid of the wrapping ring though down closer very low behind that rock nice dude we're high threat still there he is that that one guy's up there said that one guy's up there his teammates gotta be close i guess that's the person and if you see that position is it he's gonna kill me he's very low on yellow okay oh no oh it took a lifetime for my lmg to come out oh yes you got zelfress let's go you think i should have him here he's kind of screwed oh it's lucky he gave you to shoot with his head holy what was he shooting at me with he almost had me huh you can buy if you're fast enough to get to that first man in the west yeah i switch from my calories to my stoner and the weapon switch for the lmg's is insane yeah because you can just swap and then you need to cancel it yeah it's got an ads in time the timing on that yeah he did take some damage there that might be him finish the job someone just died okay no way we're in here by the way we're still in this game oh my god uh i'm not gonna have any weapons though i don't know what to do i don't know if there's there's no weapons anyway yeah that guy didn't die today so he's very revolving he's there yeah might be guys closer on us because i've got shot yeah he's close right that's right it's if you want oh yeah you can drop a plate for me yeah yeah thanks all right this is all on youtube trust me find that find that log there suppressing fire oh yeah dude we got um hold on i think the stim almost saved me there gg you guys had circled that circle really helped i'll say we're trying to actually we'll play it guys using as your main weapon when you first played this we using sniper and then we just pick up ground loot yeah but i feel like you need a good build you kill somebody you think they're smg everybody's running an smg you're right you're right everybody yeah you're right you're right and there's golden smgs all right dude stop it listen i know i'm right you're okay i just gotta keep talking okay even further okay stop because i love hearing you say that i'm right okay then i'm gonna do restock swiss is my main yeah no i gotta go okay well me on gg
