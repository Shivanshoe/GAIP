well these guys got one life between them so it should be an easy round let's make it fast oh my god i hit that the jumping quick scope fade away i'm built different pilot explosive bullets as well oh my god i did not just do that to him to end it so the call of duty vanguard alpha is currently live now on playstation and there's a lot of mixed opinions about it flying around on social media so i'm here to share my thoughts and feedback on what i've played so far which at this time is about five hours in total now the only mode that you can play in the alpha at the moment is champion hill which we saw teased recently and from my own first impressions it plays out a lot like the gunfight tournaments mode from modern warfare 2019 i know that myself and my friends all really enjoyed that mode so it makes a lot of sense to me that they would want to expand upon it with champion hill it's certainly not going to be for everyone especially the more casual audience but i think a lot of people are judging the game too soon based off this one mode which is just a small fraction of the game this is just a glimpse of what the game has to offer and not everyone is playing on their desired platform me for example i was playing on ps5 with the mouse and keyboard plugged in so at first i had a really hard time getting into the game i started off playing with a controller and i haven't played an fps game on controller for about five or six years now so it certainly took some getting used to but once i got everything dialed in i really started to enjoy the game it certainly has its flaws and some glaring issues which hopefully will be fixed by the time that the game releases i think the main complaint from people is that this mode in particular feels very campy at times and since there is no overtime objective like a flag to capture to force campers out from hiding you will find that some players just want to sit back and try to conserve lives which can be really advantageous in this mode the entire focus is maintaining lives while taking away the enemy squads lives with the last team standing being declared the winner so you can see why this might be a problem the mode features a cache system similar to what you might see in counter-strike or valorum that allows you to buy perks equipment weapons and kill streaks including a v2 rocket which is the equivalent of a nuke and ends the round immediately i haven't seen it myself since it does take some commitment to acquire but there are other more expensive kill streaks like the flamethrower for instance that are extremely powerful i'm going to show you a match shortly where i get the flamethrower later in a game and it is devastating trust me overall i think champion hill as a concept is really good it's super competitive very fun and i'm sure that the developers want this to be a hit it just needs some fine tuning here and there the biggest issue that i've found personally is on one of the maps if you have a sniper rifle you can just spam click during the countdown timer and get a free kill instantly which in a mode like this where lives are so important to your team's success this is a huge oversight and i'm sure is an easy fix they just need to stop you from aiming down sight before the countdown ends another issue that became quite distracting for me is that the way that champion hill is set up there are four different arenas and they're all pretty much side by side which means that you can hear other people having gunfights next to you and maybe this is just an issue with map knowledge but there's been a few times now where i've looked a different direction outside of the map thinking that i'm being shot at when in fact it's someone else fighting in a different arena i just think the audio from the neighboring arenas is way too loud and needs to be turned down a bit the visibility past like 15 meters or so is also very questionable there's like some weird haze depth of field effect going on i don't know if this is a design choice or if having it helps performance but it just doesn't look good graphically i think the game looks great it's on par or better than modern warfare 2019 i'm obviously not playing on pc here so i can't change the settings i would be able to to make the game look as good as possible you know you'd expect it to look good on ps5 and i'm playing 120 hertz here as well so no complaints on that front i also think the shadows are really well balanced in this game i haven't really had much of an issue spotting people in corners or hiding in deep shadows like rose skins in warzone for instance i've seen a lot of people online saying that vanguard is just a reskin of modern warfare 2019 and yes obviously it's going to feel very similar to that game but it does feel different enough and the more you play the more you see those subtle differences i don't think vanguard being on modern warfare's engine is a bad thing at all i personally love modern warfare and the way that that game felt and it's infinitely better than how cold war felt in my opinion the gunplay is really fun and the weapons feel super punchy the sound design isn't really there on some of the weapons for me and the footstep audio is non-existent it's like everyone has dead silence but in my honest opinion i have been enjoying the game and again this is just a slice of what the game has to offer so i'm excited to play the full experience multiplayer zombies campaign the whole lot and if vanguard just isn't your cup of tea it's fine you know a new call of duty game comes out every year and this holiday season we're all going to be sport for choice anyway we've got call of duty halo infinite battlefield 2042 on the horizon just chill all right it's a good time to be a gamer so without further ado as promised i'm going to leave you with a full round on vanguard champion hill and one of the first games that i played so you get to learn along with me and see some cool snipes and flamethrower gameplay there's a nice mix of everything in here so i hope you will enjoy it thank you so much for watching as always leave a like for the algorithm subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one welcome to champion hill friends we should do gestures in this alpha your team has a whole bunch of lives can't do them lose all your lives and you're eliminated last team standing wins all right here we go first round champion hill end all other teams for the win roger that should be a extra life token up here there we go it doesn't look like it gave us an extra life though because we already have 12. one down get another play there as well anyone over here was close look how dark my screen gets when i get shot at it's so bad definitely to make that not as visually intrusive it's really hard to see oh no teammate down it's one life gone just spray into that wall you got 10 seconds that was a stun grenade all right i get it jeez how much you want to throw at me that's it there we go we won that one two kills to one and we only lost one life so it's going to face us against someone else with a similar new opportunities a similar score i guess let's be a parkour there quite a bit of recall on this gun that's a good thing too many smgs perform like assault rifles in war zone on that cache such a horrible effect wait where that ain't coming from oh sorry jesus oh no i'm dead i'm so dead let me vault game please you got 10 seconds back into the freight for that extra life token in the middle careful there you go yes oh my god in the nick of time match draw as well so no bonus cash there that was a tough round i need to upgrade my weapons asap gonna rock this for a little while teammate i got you okay where are they gonna spawn some of those crouch slides for you oh another one down [Applause] i don't want to be up here teammates dead let's go over there oh you should have killed me team easy's been eliminated you got 10 seconds i should have been dead a million times over that round we got it though two lives above him as well team above us has 10 lives dog squad got by around here here we go resupply and stock up so i want my spy plane i don't need any equipment weapons there we go i want the three-line rifle there's like two different instances of this of this uh mode one way you get like a car 98 one where you get a three-line rifle so the weapons aren't always the same definitely getting that ah the spawn peaks blocked off this time oh baby you walked right into that one my teammate died that's a whiff oh come on tomorrow ten seconds there we go just threw myself at him two one that's it hey all right we proceed we're gonna fight now well these guys got one life between them so it should be an easy round let's make it fast oh my god i hit that oh the jumping quick scope fade away i'm built different pilot team george explosive bullets as well oh my god i did not just do that him end it you might want to hit a buy the wall to station yeah i might want to do that i'm tempted to get either the flamethrower or the franking gun it's gotta be the flamethrower oh look at this i didn't realize it's a juggernaut suit as well right so i can walk through my own flames i don't know if i'm gonna take less damage but oh baby this is gonna be fun that looks sick or is it oh there we go you have to wait until the countdown oh of course the vehicle would explode on me where are they highlight here we go range is good nice teammates there too let's get him roasted this thing is crazy it just feels like a guaranteed win i've gotta be on this end surely here we go oh we broke my visor there i think that's a sign they're about to die or is he that's it take down the hell did he go away fast one well that was insane i definitely took more damage than i was expecting i shot the crap out of me got so blurry arranged i can't see a thing let's get up top it died slide thirsty how could i not hear that guy can hear my teammate behind me where is this dude there he is oh here with that clean clean head shot i've only got one life left now i think he's going to spend the rest of this match hiding isn't it take their lives good round another buy round resupply and stock up we've got fireworks this time this is the last phase isn't it that's versus them i've only got 300 left to spend in the bottom right so i still have my full armor from the last game so that's good let's get a thumbnail just youtuber things these fireworks are cool all right how many lives does this team have three and we've got four wait they didn't have three before they must have bought extra lives during the this ain't good there goes my armor oh no this is intense i hate the scopes in this game they look so weird what is that effect in the middle of my screen [Applause] he may have died i need that extra life in the middle it's not already gone there's one we've both got three lives each now oh come on should have hit that sense isn't right in this game oh no make it count what did he kill me with it's at the bar with explosive rounds these things are so dumb give it your all right last life this is not good because we both died at the same time [Applause] teammate i'll get you ahead let's help him out standing oh my god it's on you soldier oh that was so horrible get back out there we had such a good lead 19 eliminations there as well close that's a good game ggs to these guys though they knew what they were doing they bought some extra lives as they went into this match because they were on the back foot that was fun though [Music]
