the 10 round mags can shoot through every single building every piece of cover without fmj and do the maximum amount of damage possible um it's very broke it says in the description that these rounds have increased to the penetration but it doesn't go into the detail but the reality is is that i could shoot a guy on the other side of this building through this building through another building behind that and that one and do maximum damage but the falloff is pretty high so like the bullet will drop before it would get that far but that's that's my point i could shoot through all of this and do maximum amount of damage no fmj oh running away right here fabulous another guy another guy on green yeah that's him i'm a hit oh is he running through to the right yeah as well yeah right side
