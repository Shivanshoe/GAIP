okay so i need three quick scopes in 15 different matches this should be fun that's one that's two three oh that would have been so clean do it for the clip [Music] no there it is yeah we'll get the blueprint i better look sick and platinum camera though okay i unlocked platinum camera you already know we gotta try the explosive rounds though it has to be done capable of demonetization [Music] she just got deleted oh my explosive rounds are nutty dude what is this explosive rounds in war zone oh they're from who's goo lagging jack got him oh oh right here oh yeah oh my god it's almost look how much his head is gone oh no i took his head clean off he's coming my head yeah or karma down nice hold on hold on dude thermite's the one this is sick i wonder if it's a good idea to start one of these early a new contract the stop clock yeah because then we'll get free self rights well what about that one let's do it but don't forget you have to run miles to get to it so someone we could grab the heli as well yeah see this is it this is it this is it man all right jack can get the heli because he's so obsessed with them just don't fly into an enemy team i'll go for the the stop watch oh like you do it every team fly to an enemy team 400 meters away don't get in but only get in if you can't get in but if you do get in don't get back in stoddarth where are you i don't go to work you jumped off the roof who were getting picked up from i mean there's going to be there's going to be people there with like that's the ruins they spread out a little don't spread out jack and droppers off one by one and bait around in the heli i'm going all right all right got an ak i've got a scoped eagle okay is there no one here don't believe it okay yeah all right so selfres purchase free it's free you can only buy one thing oh i didn't know oh someone's got a recon contract here just spawn that's a pretty good way to start a game let's come back uh so we so we don't know look at what should we just hide like yeah at all in the moment everyone stay quiet everyone stay quiet where are they coming from open things but only open things you can't open things listen isn't the heli going to be a bit of a bit of a giveaway no no i'm up here where are they i don't know i can hear can hear people wait don't don't be don't be question don't be don't be they'll see you just stay people near me okay okay are they coming through your building oh we see me focus armor found him his teammates there as well i'm down i'll stop myself touch me break him break him break him just hold still another one down nice there's that one okay we did it good job is that everybody yeah it's everybody and now we've got money there we go there's a loadout yeah boys that is that is strategy that's peak strategy i mean it didn't work but we've all got sell friends what do you mean oh you mean the helicopter strategy yeah yeah yeah come back for it free self rest at the start of the game yeah do i just get the amr usually people are a bit split amr yeah i'm doing it i'm doing it i'm doing it don't take the writing right maybe we should go back to downtown and finish the fights we were gonna fight finish the fight let's do it we are like team wife just 360. into the seat why did i just get a team wipe yeah i did i did 360 to see it looks so unnecessary it absolutely was what if we stayed in the heli and all just fired our uh right exam kill each other probably no velocity would be a pain in the butt all right get the hell go go go chase it oh you want to chase it in the other heli come on this sword i'm pretty okay we're good we're good hold on get in oh i'm out of sniper ammo no disabled there's a team here on the slow down oh yeah yeah they're moving why don't they have a sniper ammo it's a joke oh god right get no get up high again get up high can we buy an ammunitions box please yeah let's do you on your own bye come to this buy what's this buy why would you go all right dropping money you mean we haven't been playing seriously anyone want that i don't think so okay oh wow i got fully beamed i don't like this thing i like this i don't like this no i don't like

want to shoot one's marked behind us yeah closest oh he's flying towards that one's just lovely we'll just crash one on two let's go through one two underneath don't bother with that one oh it's dead now we've been getting beamed from where that house in the house on the left there we go down the chopper and it's coming right for us right in front of us just be careful i love mantling rocks it's my favorite pastime why do i feel like we are the most action-packed game even though nothing's happened it's because you don't usually fire that many shots yeah actually has gone down by like 90s oh perfect it's perfectly perfect that's no fun that's no fun okay so we go back then down and back we can see my map look he's trying to shoot us oh there he is this is spamming the crap is that is that right too it's right 2.0 you're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off calm down what from where from the window i think i don't know that's right i'm right here there's one behind us as well you might have to push that immediately i'm not going going the tree here is low okay it's done we're having too much fun here guys have plates it was him that was the guy head down southwest oh eod headshot boys that's a nice shot is fun isn't it hey you guys got good as well yeah i destroyed one and then i got the other one that was on the right hand side i don't like the right tech anymore well no jacker i think this is the last day i'm ever gonna use it ever it doesn't make any sense it's no hdr can i land on you uh yeah one in front of him it's almost stuff i think i killed the one
