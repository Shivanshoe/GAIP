right here on yellow two guys yep hit the steps they're pushing up to the truck right on the truck right here okay distracting him he's pushing up to the wall he doesn't know what's going on another one by the tree for both oh my god legend here comes man so welcome back everyone to player unknowns battlegrounds battlegrounds yep it's a stupid name don't know why they changed it but welcome back nonetheless and today i'm playing with my canadian compadre and dear friend connor better known as acolyte which i'm sure many of our og viewers from back in the day will be very pleased to hear it's been almost six years now that i first started covering pubg on this channel and i've known and played games with acolyte for even longer so i know a lot of you will remember the days of old when me and conor used to play duo's together on this game and honestly i think the friendships i made because of this game and others that followed is why pubg will always have a special place in my heart and you know despite the game being much more hardcore than its competitors i think it's important to remember where it all started games like warzone apex legends and fortnite simply wouldn't exist if pubg hadn't laid the foundations and set the bar for a new genre of battle royale games so let me know in the comments if you remember pubg in the content during that time as fondly as i do and with all that being said i've got some gameplay to show you now which really demonstrates the brutality of this game it's mental torture at times but when you finally get the win there is no other battle royale more satisfying than pub g battlegrounds enjoy oh there's a team there's a team oh god i see him oh god i have no hp if they won't hit me does he see me oh he sees you no no no no he's running away he's running away he's running away now he hasn't seen me yet oh no oh god dude at the next building over okay be careful uh southeast east it was from manchester united that's one nice

sandwiched no yeah i agree i agree our spot scope is crazy that's so busted how long does it stay up for i just keep repeating them wow you can't see me through the fog anyways so it doesn't matter oh you're firing without actually seeing the person yeah i was a vehicle from team you run me over check the c4 come on come on come on no i got knocked that c4 might be a little too close for comfort keep going yep dude that c4 we're good we're getting it's on top of the bridge i don't think it's gonna get us yeah but it's a massive is it that big yeah it's a massive radius that just broke my microphone i actually turned my uh go xlr down preemptively we gotta move to the zone now my greatest fears have been realized yeah oh no there's another vehicle it's not going to hurt that much one you're insane it was so low no one's in the other side i just got knocked in the other guy looking for him dude it's so foggy i actually don't even know who hit me all right screw it we ride together we die together oh maybe there's spiders scoping if he moves his left side we're both dead yep that was on the right yeah dude spotter scopes are you kidding me that is ridiculous man it was funny

scope freaking insane further uphill yeah yeah where is he hit once right by my tree i'm going to push him out hold on [ __ ] him wait what don't press yeah bring this guy over you should be safe okay i'm gonna head up two quick scopes yeah you're nuts those guys vs skip annihilated pretty much yeah no i'm good now i'm knocked i don't see him okay should be as safe as i can be but that's rough touch i'm dead i can't i literally can't i'll die like i didn't miss a single shot yeah yeah rip dude that was rough i am 2v2 maybe i was a foreign aide man mm-hmm that's where they're gonna be was that yours too yeah on that thing yeah i'm needing timmy's gonna be there as well isn't he peeking that same corner should be good perfect nade here's your thumbnail bud yeah oh you want to do a quick reload and hold alt free look oh wow i've been sniped out but uh range adjust height adjust should have an angle here knocked one on orange mark yeah let's go for the rise right now damn just a little too far man again nice shot i see him back out of house behind the wall he hit me i'm always right on him oh i just got me should be low there backside of the house oh got the kill i burnt him out with a molly okay i'll take it well done it was a good fire fight knocked one uphill there's one closer to the rock recoil killed one oh i think i'm gonna get knocked did you yeah oh i got it off no way nice dude it's a dead guy inside inside directly downhill 320. yeah he sees this as well how far can you throw c4 i was only underhand i don't know what the range is going to be like on that like the right one nice on the 313 in the smoke yeah spraying into it kill us you just killed us 20 seconds later after i forgot i've thrown it are you kidding me why did you chuck a c4 of all things i got him moving sabotage 20 seconds later after i'd thrown it i advertised seconds connor unbelievable oh my god out here trying to win a game you know what it's fine honestly because that'd be a [ __ ] win yeah that was a terrible win anyways at least i got some content out of that you know killing myself with a c4 i didn't clue in until it started beeping a little bit faster i was like oh [ __ ] he chopped a c4 earlier five seconds left nice we love that oh man i'd play this game so much more if there wasn't such a wait time between matches yeah i feel that it takes so long to get into games yeah there's just too much down time if it was like everyone joins 20 seconds i'd be okay with it yeah exactly even if it doesn't fill a match but it's just not pain no best there's a level one in the building i left steps on grass pretty sure it's a blood yeah that lucky didn't it that's sad if that's the case let me just see if he reacts like a player uh that looked like he did another one same spot oh maybe not oh he's off to the right different guy yeah not part of the same team look no yeah like it is a bot did you see him just change directions right he shot that mk12 i think oh my god yeah this guy was a bad dude she actually told you instead of constantly guessing if when they change directions surely that means that's indicative of a player no he was do he was just crawling this way immediately when he did crawl this way right and then went behind the like his movements were very bot ish there can't mark it that's a player i think i just kept calling after though zigzagging a lot yeah perfectly cooked made it's in the building oh the beauty beauty emergency pickup in the zone like perfect in the zone i will even work oh we need to spike belt the bridge that's what needs to happen oh my god do you have one i have one oh my god i love that for you there's a bunker over there now on yellow is there like a world war ii bunker yeah oh wow oh i mean shot other side of the bridge yeah that's bridge zig zag zig i got no visual right now zag he's on outside bridge uh right side he was just on the road like running he's dropped down on his teammate now i don't see that you know he's so low he's on that right side on the catwalk right there on that ping i mean maybe i don't want to push up more oh yeah they're both up i can push up i guess you got visual on them at all yeah right there you hit that was a hit notes one you're sick one's just uh in front of the truck falling back to his teammate now go for the rest i think [Music] he's just picked him up nice i was waiting for an easy headshot he picked him up did he carry him yeah he was trying to carry him he's truly trying to get him i just started lighting up his buddy [Laughter] probably trying to get him back down the uh the stairs that's funny i got a nice little shot yeah that was great thread the needle right is he uh passed can i see his head i have an emergency pick up too so i can only pick up so much oh yeah of course it's a lot of weight thing weighs a lot i really hope somebody comes by it'll happen trying to think of the fly the plane though like remember how i said i haven't played a rain game in a while i took it back i was like i don't want this anymore rain maps on this anymore well look at this come on the vehicle's gotta come you planned it out so so nicely yeah there's no guarantee though even even adjusted for the distance that they would slide yeah because i've done it before she that's not far at all it could come from the other way coming towards us on the bridge a few times he's flipped okay come on get some cover make sure you're not exposed everyone's behind the vehicle there's living uphill right here at the buggy perfect thing perfect playing pretty much i might try and move that to the lighthouse somewhere oh he's mortaring dude i think he's not that tree i don't move up there further yeah be careful let's go in the lighthouse i smoked the tree just because i don't know if he's yeah he's still there he's still here moving away maiden i need i don't want to make it the other one made it up yeah okay got him good nay dude that was just a questionable one i should have gotten knocked there like way sooner i gotta start tap firing more uh there were shots where we're getting shot we're gonna show that from where uh the shots over there oh hill 50. oh he's on the rockstar you see that do not headshot me oh nice shot nice shot but he's just to the right of that on the same hills email i see it you check those guys for loot by the way a little bit nice shot it keeps peeking did you see if they had a sniper uh no i can check again though just let me know if you're nearby because i'm still using this mk 12 oh my god smoke grenades activate way quicker now that's why i haven't repeated the brook it was teammate was left of that where did i kill him oh they're both right here it's time to repeat sks m16 okay three bag 6x i'll take the 6x he sees you trying to suppress him didn't any shots on you uh yeah hit me once good i've had these guys a lot man should i just drop the emergency nah well you think we might need it to like cross the water or something my house is six very very bottom i dropped it don't think you have what's there did you pick it up i have it never mind yeah i was gonna say i am lying cute should we just take the emergency over freaking stifling it doesn't work like that though it's annoying it just takes you into the zone but we don't have a zone to go to right that's how it works moving let's check out miners i think they're both crossed there now right to left yeah oh my god i see gunfire way out there what oh frick oh 10. he's at the edge of zone 10. he just died never mind i'm not gonna do that am i lots of shots down that compound oh there is right there it won't oh my god 340 at a rock that 340. a shot okay at a rock 345 okay tagged them once in the foot i'm looking for this rock museum just zigzagging 340. oh look at that flop where more shots are on there when they're on yellow way out there dude oh yeah you see him there it is oh that was close too damn it man fall off of this mk12 is not good shot out from red houses north here once they're both picking a window huh yeah i hit him once do you see it yep we should move rotate left now that's why i was saying we should probably take this emergency we couldn't though that's not how it works like there needs to be a zone for it to take you to and i think we're maybe too close now he said the reason why it's not working is because it has to give us some travel time and at this range i think it might just take us into the next zone and not i don't think it's worth it honestly like it's a free kill on them if we parachute down no we can't take it we literally cannot let us yeah yeah i'm just saying anyway like even if we could it's a gamble isn't it yeah see a gilly 25 he's got a three helm distance 30 uh i marked him he's gonna be going up the hill you're going way out there on that ping this team might pick us i don't think so though just spam vault stuff mm-hmm right below us i think yeah yeah he's there get him down dead nice man that's the gilly boy yeah the ace is really good so right here nadine this hill don't trust below you he was insane no knock his teammate i'm sure was off somewhere no no he was insta-kill no not oh i saw a guy like off on yellow then it's 2v1 i thought it was his teammate oh what the hell get your head in the game tom i must have killed him we're in the end game now oh my god dude this never happens for us i know we never get to play the game did you get stuff for now no just seems a bit risky oh i got smoke you got smoke i'm just gonna leave it you're crazy yeah we're both crazy okay i gotta just throw them it's gonna grow if you want yeah oh i see him ahead of us 115 at the ice cream truck oh yeah you would stop moving once twice three times he's literally one hp come on i'm kneading yes how many kills win a winner should we just get with grenades chicken dinner broski let's go skibrowski we did it again we did it get your thumbnails thumbnails for youtubers thumbnails right here get your thumbnails get your thumbnails nice reload shoot reload hey we did it man i can't believe that guy didn't die in the end you know you just know you've done enough damage to someone and they just keep living why are you still living why are you the way that you are we can still do it we can still do it it may have taken 150 matches i can't believe we won our first game back dude tommen acula duo is different that's crazy and tom didn't die in the first two seconds of the match just crazy dude no one ever saw that one coming wild [Music] you
