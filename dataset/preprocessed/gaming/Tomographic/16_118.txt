sbms ruin [Music] it's a casual game or is it really carry on this map looks the same hey guys and welcome back to another warzone video today i've got another k31 swiss sniper rifle video for you this time using my mac style class setup i finally got this thing ranked up and this thing dominates man i never realized it at first but once you get the lead down and stuff you can pull off some insane reactive shots with this gun it's a lot like the car that i ate in that regard you guys know how much i love the car that i ate i've used that gun for so long now but both weapons have good and bad things going for them i mean the k31 swiss has a really nice reload because obviously you get a magazine instead of individually feeding the rounds into the car 98 which has definitely gotten me killed numerous times and once you get into that flow it's definitely a contender against some of the meta snipers in the game right now it's a lot of fun so this is the classic i've been using on the k31 swiss give it a try for yourself it works really well in game and of course the loadout is listed in the description as always thank you guys so much for watching leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it and subscribe for more like this gameplay today is on the dance resurgence mode with study and westy and resurgence is so much fun in vedansk we've really enjoyed our time playing this mode over the last few days so please raven don't take it away with that said enjoy the gameplay and i will catch you legends in the next one okay well i don't want to know what i don't want to be involved oh my god didn't even react to me it was like i was on his team i've got nothing i murdered a man we got him tomorrow we did it together i wasn't scared did not hear me scream it's fine goodbye we killed everyone i killed a couple the one difference between resurgence here and rebirth is that you don't get swarm protection i'm leaving a sniper yeah oh yeah of course you snipe people out of the air yeah go here oh player he just stops let the player stops ragdolling yeah the mid-air take down by the way there you go oh and the in the open that much round dead yep let's go to the boy jumping
