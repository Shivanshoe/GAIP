okay welcome everyone to ready or not we're back it's uh it's been a little while since we last played this game but they've just had well they've had their biggest update yeah which is why we're playing it today uh is it a good idea for me to be going live during the uh the xbox showcase for all the game reveals today probably not so if you could drop a like it would be really helpful boost me on the algorithm a little bit but i wanted to get on this early because man i'm excited to try this out when i say it's a big update i mean let me show you largest supporter edition content update yes this is just for supporters at the moment it will be coming to the the regular version of the game soon uh but if you own the supporter edition then you can play this now but we've got two new maps that were originally white box maps meaning that they had no textures but now you can play on those um physics so you've got stuff like curtains and beads on doors and stuff you can walk through that react to your player now new clothing on for the ai um the ai update is insane it's actually crazy i haven't played it yet but the stuff i've seen behind the scenes is uh honestly it might be some of the best like ai systems i've seen in a game and i think it's going to really surprise you guys um just how realistic it is because i genuinely think i'm going to get outplayed by ai today um i certainly couldn't get a squad for today all the guys are busy but we'll definitely be doing some squad stuff soon lucky for me though the single player in this game and the way you can command your like ai teammates is really really good um so yeah there's a bunch of small changes in here which also like you know help the quality of life of the game but they've had like reworks of maps um new lighting and yeah honestly i think the biggest thing is the ice ai system that's what they're sort of shining the light on the most um but i wanted to scroll through this quickly for anyone that wanted to pause it see what they've actually changed um and yeah there are some stuff i'm not going to tell you about but i'll show you along the way um that's pretty crazy got some new new weapons as well um and like new ui stuff which is really going to help just get your your character equipped with loadout loadout stuff so let's get back into the game click play go single player welcome everyone joining the stream hope you're all doing well and uh yeah if you could drop a like on the stream that'd be great if you're watching the zavod as well this will be up as a video afterwards so if you could do the same that would be awesome but here we are in the game uh the shotgun i have my hands right now is um actually for the supporters this was supposed to be in like the uh when the game first released you can see this has changed and when i click this now i can click modify weapon and it's a lot cleaner like this whole system for attachments and stuff really really good um you can see all the changes instead of like slapping on a bench and trying to orientate your camera to make it work but if you're unfamiliar this game it's a um it's a tactical shooter probably the most like realistic um swat simulator sort of game you can play that is still fun and kind of accessible um but it does not hold your hand so you can see here as well we've got stuff like kevlar now i can choose different plates um so i can choose like a light plate which will help against pistol ammo medium heavy ammo you know it all sort of works it's probably helpful against grenades as well um but depending on the plate you choose it's obviously going to slow down your character and there is a new weight system in this game now uh called it well it's inertia if you play tarkov you know what that is basically means that your character has like momentum so you have to build up to a certain speed and all operators will move at the same amount of like their top speed will be the same um but if you're wearing heavier gear like you know i could wear heavy armor light armor no armor or all if i'm feeling like it not really a good idea though um yeah it'll obviously be a lot a lot more heavy so it takes you a while to sort of reach that speed and if when you come to a stop you'll now take like a couple extra baby steps before you're fully slowed down um it shouldn't impact gameplay too much but i think it should be a good feature to maybe make this game feel a bit less like cod and less of a like a sort of reaction shooter um and make it feel more realistic which is good um you can see here too i can now select the munitions i'm taking so if you're a player that um maybe wants to take more magazines and less grenades you can now do that um i could take like five mags for an ar two for my pistol a couple of grenades or i could go like full grenades and increase this plus and minus and take as much as i want which is really cool um mp9 is one of the new smgs as well uh they've also added a mp5a3 which is like a railed mp5 i haven't seen that one before um but yeah you can see it's like a really clean layout now for uh for your weapon weapon selection you can scroll through all of them or click through them individually i really like it so um should be really good i'm looking forward to this how do you get hrt uh this outfit is only for supporters of the game so if you buy the supporter edition of the game um also allows you to play this update now before it actually goes live on the main um servers for everyone you get some little bonuses like weapons and stuff let's switch back to that shotgun because that is exclusive so i want to give this a go because i've only just had it added it for the first time on this update um i'm happy with those modifications we'll keep those a couple new maps as well so we shall jump into those i'll go test this out on the firing range real quick you're watching nasa's live stream kevin wow oh yeah oh yeah it's a loud one let's check out this mp9 real quick might be worth taking this you know do we want to go loud it's tiny this thing switch for auto [Music] all right we'll give this a go try the shotgun try the shotgun afterwards but um yeah i'll talk you through some of the smaller stuff there's a lot of uh cool changes about a destruction too which i mean not even 2042 has some of that oh wow look at all these new pings um there we go there's one of the new maps vol health house confirmed location let's do it did you play the original swap games and rainbow six siege games i played the original rainbow six games not rainbow six siege um but no i've never played the swat games before i wish i had at the time but um try non-lethal run today yeah maybe could do that let's go loud oh we will at some point oh yeah look at this so this is my ai squad this map looks really nice last time i played it um actually can i any cars about yeah does this work yes so if you're fighting outside you can now like sort of take cover behind cars and stuff i think also the airbag goes off see that the airbag just went off you could break windows and stuff too how cool is that that looks amazing holy i think they were coming now party this way that sounds good to me down those car physics they're so sick all right boys stay on me this way to jane janie's party you get lost yeah they've also added some like world building stuff around so you get a better idea of what's going on newspaper articles and all that sort of stuff mirror blocked okay so we can only breach this door uh so what i can do is reach with kick clear go go yeah copy that yeah the boys are coming down the be stairs they're improved animations for uh your team ai as well there we go we're in finally i've got my team cams as well if i press t top right you can see their cameras really cool feature mirror blocked again so all these doors i can't get through all right boys first time i'm playing on this map oh god this guy's outside yeah they're on alert since i shot the car alarm on my six right behind you get down i want to see here hands up do it now [ __ ] help us hands down drop your knees hands my hands are up all right we're clear uh you can restrain her make him secure okay this one's all secure also i need to be on alert because they've it's only for now everything will be okay they've uh made it so that the could fake their death and if their morale is also um if i lower their morale too much they could even there's there's actually a suicide feature for the enemy so um let's say that i've pretty much killed this one man one man's complete army i guess he might choose just take his own life which is a very very real mechanic um a little bit laggy this map there's a lot going on in terms of textures and stuff i'm playing on ultra but definitely playable check our objective detain any unarmed contacts at the scene uh arrest okay there's a specific guy we need to arrest locate and seize all hard drives um okay pretty basic stuff came through this way so we're fine what game come on don't do this it's the first first three words of the title oh god and then there's your reactions post up and cover roger the guy almost killed me probably should have died there um do i have flashbangs yes i landed in the doorway it's great it's great yeah it's lovely i rebounded um perfectly all right boys i'm just going to send you in this canon photo all right post up and cover i'm on it that was a bit mental he's run off move over there copy i saw it as well might have just killed a civilian i thought that was the same guy they've clearly got me on edge now yeah indeed i just killed a civilian that's great there's a guy wearing the same suit rest in peace man and look you can cuff um this is what you'd actually do if you're in this wall that's that's new you can cuff incapacity incapacitated enemies now not that guy was an enemy but uh that's the guy and they also wear armor which they didn't have before hands up do it now humbly here is kill that civic [Music] barely see outside this window it's already popped off it's already popped off do it now here's someone provide cover getting there now what post up and cover all right roger so sketchy calm down can i restrain this guy this is horrible that they're all outside you know oh they actually killed that guy nice can you see me through those blinds don't think so i can't check these doors [Music] yeah another thing they also have they react to getting shot now so they might hold where they've been shot or limp basically it's like the biggest ai overhaul you've ever seen in a game this level design is really nice happy birthday 18. am i going to pull oh my god i can not too deep though all right come on okay i'm on your six the suspect is yeah remember too they can fake their deaths so uh i gotta be sure i might start like uh the suspect is expired you know tapping there what the hell make sure they're dead by giving a quick head shot i'm gonna go clear the basement level excuse me gets me annoying sometimes when they get in the way but it's a good system where like if you bump into them they will move out of the way i'm sure about this that door just uh moved a little bit clear there we go mirror under this door yes we can looks clear enough let's preach with a deploy shotgun and clear roger that sir should have bought more mags see if you can drown no don't let me walk further into the pool moving up i've also made areas uh more dark as well to encourage you to bring flashlights i think i have a laser yeah okay one i'm just a kid stay still uh they can also hide as well yeah the enemy ai now so if like if i go past i just had a shotgun i heard him going around shooting at those gang members oh wow he actually gives me millions standing by for trailers combs that's crazy roger trailers let's get these guys on this door provide cover get mirror under that actually suspect yeah so if i walk past like a wardrobe or something or a bed you could be hiding under the bed or under the wardrobe it's crazy can't do that sir okay can't mirror under that door um copy that open and unlock and there's my first death to be expected that is insane man you see how quick they react now how fast was that i don't want to go through the front door this time i'm gonna try and find a way on the top level working my way down that's insane uh what was i doing viewer activity switch to that coming to you yeah i'm playing solo let me show this again for anyone that didn't see earlier you can take out tires on cars now to uh obviously take cover if you're outside and also spray glass and the airbag will pop out as well really cool details in this game like they just keep taking it further and further which is so awesome to see oh we're gonna try this door can't mirror these ones can we always worth checking um breach with shotgun clear it roger that sir all right we know civilians are in the area now it's not complete um moving up it's got bloody it's the fantastic legs about me and i mean incapacitated it yeah suspect let's go team trailers restrain nice corner clear i think the side mirrors can be destroyed on the car yeah there's lots of new destruction parts oh my god yeah you're not wrong balloons uh yeah of course they even make a pop sound love it there are certain lights and lamps you can shoot out but very cool okay put a wedge in this door someone can flank me on that staircase the details in this game man mind-blowing uh no traps let's kick this down any steps by the sounds of it yeah drop it now surrendering get down hey you could be fainting though down on your knees can let you pull a gun on me last second come on team contact is restrained nice get his head in that wall do we shut up did i hear him drop a gun talk to high ground oh he did yeah she chucked it keep going is there a multiplayer mod it is a multiplayer game typically the game how's the multiplayer um not for like pvp but i mean i think it's coming at some point soon i think we've got a civilian here hello oh my god what's it done with you was her trap no traps watch her be a um an enemy now down on your knees jesus god put your hands up get the door open why are you keep slamming the door on me uh hey hey over here please [Music] come on keep moving someone else in this room get a flash in there why just bounced off the tit of that statue let's try this again let's get in there moving out hair physics yeah suspect do away what is going on man this is crazy roger that continue destroying this guy in case he's playing dead check this door oh he's in there all right drop it now [ __ ] off drop it now police hands up drop your weapons come on how are you supposed to do less than lethal how do people even do that when the enemies are as non-compliant as that should have sent my buddies in first holy i think what you got to do is just try and like decrease the enemies morale just by making sure that you scare them insane is the update truly huge yes it's a truly huge update suspects have a foothold in this area and they're refusing to cooperate you see this you are clear to proceed with the mission the biggest update yet two new maps some white box maps that don't have textures yet cloth physics for curtains and beads and stuff uh swat officer ai new ai improvements for enemies so they react uh hide under under beds and in cupboards uh they just have faster reactions in general um they have armor they have mt4 9s they carry ars um there's a there's inertia now with movement so you have to like if you wear heavy gear it takes you a while to like build up to full momentum and slow down uh restrained dead they can also play dead um yeah it's nuts man it's nuts there's all the there's all the stuff it's a massive update truly massive can you not kneecap i mean you could that's not a bad shout you can also smack him i should definitely give him a good smack in um you can pop balloons as well i like to let her know i'm coming you know i wasn't even locked that time oh god um oh i'm so bad with these flashbangs man [Music] oh he's not even get on the ground [Music] dude this is just nuts see doors can be opened now that went open before oh no this hands up do it now okay i want the guys to let's just bag this restrain this guy he's lost a lot of blood so he's probably dead but get them to move over there cover me and gone try and pick up the pace a bit hey hey over here please i need help don't make me kick the door in your face again hands off me i'm complying stay where you are those hair physics they're pretty nuts you're right why are you arresting me civilians standing by for truth okay stand on corner i pressed the wrong button i promise i didn't mean to throw words in his eyelid okay this guy was in here last time shoots him in the head get off the ground now true true all right let's make sure this is clear i'm using so many flashbacks okay so with the flashbangs they don't come out the center of your screen we've learned please get down hands up do it now that's some evidence collecting evidence they can't hide in here can they that's me it looks so good this game literally eated her onto the toilet okay this just goes outside there's like full exterior environments now they didn't have these before they just had like it's basically like you're up in the clouds all the time is this anything of use all right nothing down there i can spot that's the pool yeah happen

his needs there aren't any traps here looks empty looks empty okay you go in first cover this area all right roger we'll take care of it i can't get past me so only give me the option to stack up i've gone this can't tell if he's an armed looks like it if you drop a like on the stream guys it really does help i just want to go home spilling cuffed and prepped for evac boost the stream on the algorithm since uh trailers xbox game show is going on i don't think much will be revealed to be honest i mean it's not like we're going to get a new cod trailer because that's called playstation exclusivity so i just imagine it'll be a lot of like indie stuff new xbox titles so many of them outside clear stuck up on this door use the mirror you can't mirror that can we cancel breach with your gun blow the lock and clear it all right roger that changed my mind oh my god boys we've got a dead suspect here you're shot in the face he's good didn't like the way that other guy was panting suspect affirmative energy nice work lads hop on the treadmill real quick appreciate everyone being here though hope you had a good weekend yeah just to uh just to clarify this is only the support

not got someone with a bathroom ram you have a bathroom ram what are you doing okay closing the door copy that closing the door everyone's in here that's my teammate hood those door wedges are really good yeah we've got a dead suspect here talk to high ground roger continue with your mission why'd you raven shield yeah wow the reflections too i think this game even has ray tracing maybe it does came light out beautiful gamer oh my god freaking creeps what if that's the girl we found upstairs i don't think so might be just wearing a different dress uh clearing here yeah they've done a great job with the level design for like world building and stuff giving you an idea of where you are why you're here i guess that was the i guess that was the girl for the it's her birthday party she's like quite young so i'm guessing she was the 18 year old all right come on lads move in and clear it moving up here now copy that into the garden where everybody is move over there moving up oh like this damn i'm hungry those are cheese wheels then just plates what's the device on the table in the weird picture room oh no don't make me go back downstairs am i missing something would be good room for intel wouldn't it what do i need got a laptop c secondary hard drive okay yeah you might be right here imagine i came back down here and someone was hiding in the wardrobe the whole time okay that was a drive oh yeah well spotted collecting evidence good shot man you got tiny guys though like you've already got a search for this stuff i've been in the door there the hunt scene what's up valerie oh they killed this guy huh can actually go in the pool no just walk on this bit we've got a dead suspect we haven't checked the ground floor yet all the might be a basement at a p90 check the perimeter this is where the downstairs thing was there poured him can anyone tell me if any part of this update is also given to non-support game owners i don't think so at this time i imagine this will be available for everyone get on the ground now maybe in the next week or two i'm not sure should have known he was going to kill me right let's try a different level and that is how brutal this game is if you're not paying attention big exposed windows there it was clear when i first checked him and then all of a sudden that guy runs out of his hiding spot that's a really cool level though all right let's see the shotgun let's go loud yeah all this has changed as well um ui used to be very very minimal in this game now you modify your guns here and you'd have to go to different tables and stuff which is cool clean weapon yeah you strip it of all the attachments very good very nice spread choke or break you want a break on it flashlight as well i'd already taken a few hits as well so it would have been um would have been a soft target anti-flash goggles let's put those on just to be sure you know i think my favorite is the ballistic master i mean just looks sick doesn't it look at this shotgun though um what's the other new map prism nightclub oh my god i see a big old pile of bodies us airstrikes are targeted villages housing a notorious terrorist group in northern yemen which has ties to u.s cells one such cell is known as the hand who have enacted a domestic response to the military incursion interesting from a game crasher so hey thanks dan talk reporting suspects have a foothold in this area and they're refusing to cooperate entry team you are clear to proceed with the mission roger look at this place sorry to grab a drink real quick um well this is pretty ominous interesting start to the game a very very real situation maybe a bit too on the nose for some people but damn let's not walk over the body shall we can't report that guy this game is not for the faint-hearted don't think i can look under this door can i be the same as the last house yeah mirror blocked open the door clear it roger that it's open we're good to go moving hey david thanks

what they're doing because they're not throwing a flashbang who did you shoot get on the ground i got a killed one the level design in this game is actually incredible man so good has expired they just keep eating their guns is that it yeah they can hide in closets too yeah the enemy the enemies can hide in closets they can hide under beds they're actual cover systems now don't run from me you're gonna get me killed hands up above your head hands up do it now get us out of here you have to get us out of here standing by for trailers talk reporting roger that kind of roger this is going to be small rooms moving clear all right roger that hands up [ __ ] do something down here [ __ ] okay just help me hands up above your head someone said they could be standing on the toilets oh my arms don't bend that way [ __ ] clearly they do put your hands up hands up above your head just trying to make that call through the crack in the door there i cleared all this didn't i yeah i've been down here i think so unnerving dude look at all these corners i've got a check literally just gonna be hiding in any of this stream was clear wasn't it good job lads restrained targets all done contact is secured my door's locked sorry man that's what i got to do blow the lock and clear out copy that copy move on moving up we've got a dead suspect here low light deployed i remember the days they just carry pistols can't breach this door traps are there no nice onwards kind of looks like the sauna from john wick yeah it does man first you're in john wick's house and now you're in that russian nightclub yeah that's what it feels like oh here we go hands up drop your knees provide cover roger that civilian is d.o.a sorry buddy so i need to trample on you i do this you can't just leave me here like this standing by for trailers roger entry team great work keep going if you don't feel safe put you somewhere else oh sorry i think that's planned here you go i'd make a very good uh copy i never reported the girl in the bikini damn it any plans on making more music i don't know about that i mean be advised i have civilian contact the last song took me quite a lot of time to work on it's not an enemy drop the weapons now [Music] move over there like i had to learn quite a bit about producing and all that stuff it was an interesting process but believe it or not i i made that entire song all within premiere you're not serious i mean kind of has the same sort of you know editing features as something like work keep going logic but you just don't have certain equalizers and all that sort of stuff you still make songs by dragging beats and all that sort of stuff so how would you even fight someone in this room this is crazy it's like constantly being flashbanged calm down they actually managed to get this guy to comply that's the same what game is this this is ready or not in the bathroom yeah i know what you mean i'll go now because otherwise i've got a back trap i've got a back track the entire way this is just insane man just like everywhere you look it's so gruesome they don't exactly need to tell you about what happened here do they toilets were down here i've come all this way and i did report it i'm gonna be so pissed okay reflections did i come down here yeah i did i went down here straight on then left into the nightclub close that door eated her in there so we've done a loop now so now we need to go upstairs on my six moving into your position please get down get on the ground now move in and clear it roger on the move we've got this under control light stick out yeah this was in vr be [Music] talk to crazy team great work entry team keep it up that was the dj he actually had the helmet on like that mouse what a crazy level this is man the details are just so immersive if i wasn't sat here like doing youtuber stuff and commentating over gameplay i would be like so quiet tiptoeing around this place the suspect has expired my life or hers in that situation are you still i just blew your head off put the gun down oh my god i told her to get down why did she run at me like that oh no no no the worst thing that could have happened in that situation the worst thing i'll be playing that one i'm gonna try and run through that like john wick oh no a bomb vest are you kidding me just blew the whole club up why did she run out why coming to you this is shoot the lock then clear copy that you do the ambulance as well off the airbag that's really cool there's only a couple levels too where you'd even need to take cover behind a car i don't need to door wedge that one all right light stick out sir copy that my toss updated nice same i kind of know my way around now move to my front roger on the move hands up now drop your knees with him drop it get your hands up did you shoot her yes i shot the bomb vest i told her to get down she got down like this i was like right there's no way she's gonna like why would she make a run for it what the hell what did i do i heard the guy yelling and then her footsteps sprinting if that was an enemy either shoot also got to jump on him we'll get shot like the reactions of the ai now is just way too quick for me to me to uh panic or like freeze in that situation it's too real man this might genuinely be the most like realistic game i've played like the ai ed so responsive now i mean it's got to be mirror for suspect i'll mirror this open the door clear it roger forgot to report yeah good shout probably did sorry lads you go first all right you get out my way thank you look

on steam trailers never say never though i might come to the next gen consoles at some point maybe the next next gen consoles but there's a bit too much going on it right now even for a for a pc game it's pretty intensive i'm running on ultra right now i've got about 80 fps which is good yeah i just i don't think it would run well on a console you can install mods and stuff too what the hell mouse for toilets some above me or down here provide support on me you've got point hands up drop your knees put your hands up the hell must be above me then there's also so many key lines in this game i

body on the bottom left deploy on the move [Music] thank god we have good team ai in this game i'll be dead so many times in this run i can't really take many more hits like that and they killed him did he shoot him through the wall uh he was there someone's dead behind the bar move over there getting there now sir can't report them we've got a dead suspect here like the guns rogers where's the other guy he's got a dead suspect here left my teammates close that door moving up ah don't close it don't close it why did i do that [Music] zombies jesus christ what is going on civilians standing by for trailers talk reporting copy entry team notifying trailers move in and clear it yeah my team's all out of flashbangs on the move what the hell happened here get through to the lads can't take many more hits and immediately gets hit yeah sounds about right making good progress now though third time's a charm bang dead all right let's get down okay we've been through all this civilian is secured i sent them down this way didn't i uh just loops back around into the club stay on me okay we're with you it's tough now with our flashbangs got one buckshot left three pistol mags moving in clear yeah copy that on the move on my six coming to you sir i feel like we came this way this is the yeah wrinkled to chaos arrest neutralize any contact at the scene obtain any unarmed contacts at the scene so we successfully killed but we were so close before we're missing someone this level looks amazing yeah i think this is the best looking level in the game the lighting alone is so good so we're just looking for civvies i guess definitely can't go through that door when's the update drop in the update is out now for supporters support edition owners um and i don't think they've confirmed the date for spilling cuffed and prepped there we go is that one person we didn't report vote one mission hell yeah all right what we saying what rating am i getting for that felt a bit messy but just shows how close we were to finishing it the last time that one guy just headshotted me on the stairs crazy hey we'll take a b unauthorized use of force yeah i did shoot a couple of enemies when they're probably mid-surrender the bomb verse where is it it was on that character then what do you mean negatives it's not gonna say anything's actually completed safely that time i skipped the last uh the last mission rating that was insane though wasn't it okay let's try for the arn keep the door wedges and i will change my enemy team i didn't give them grenades you have to do this now i guess c2 as well two flash bangs and lock pick gun must be new pepper spray don't have to actually use that we'll see what do you think of the update so far guys pretty nuts isn't it the ai alone kind of crazy genuinely feels like doing pvp fights every time um and you have grenades already right what the hell oh he runs over there why can you carry so much can i do two on the other guys really nice weapon models in this game it will take the flashlight and i think actually i don't wanna flashlight i'm gonna go night vision modify weapon take off the flash put on the ir laser go to helmet mpgs i think these have been updated as well there's a new model for those hey phoebe thanks for coming remember well continuing your membership nine months in a row seven is your lucky number no it says nine for me must be on seven streak though appreciate you you and jack should figure out a way to hunt each other in sniper elite five through axis invasion i mean that would be nuts i do think they need to um improve upon that mode a bit it's really good what it is but like if they could flesh it out a bit more it'd be crazy um so this is a new map and this is a new map we'll do another run on that one but i want to try this map first because i played this quite a bit but apparently they've redone the lighting for it supposed to be really dark now so let's have a look ai curve of progression is dope yeah it's crazy i love the morale system i'm not really feeling the weight too much but i guess because i'm not like carrying too much stuff i've got heavy armor on but i don't have the heaviest plates might be worth taking an extra plate i don't know you can run around pretty quick though if you've got um you know no armor whatsoever but that's way too risky so many shots we took there entry team suspects have taken refuge and are refusing to cooperate remember your roe and secure the area this already feels darker some objectives locate math arrest two suspects rescue civilians i don't think i want to enter that house first but i think we have to i think we're on like some smaller mode because i can't i don't start down the bottom of the uh on the road like usual there's a doorbell can i ring the doorbell no imagine all right breech c2 hang on go go go i'll make sure i'm checking for traps when i do this all right speed run here we go blow that door clear it roger that fire in the hole jesus the lag there how realistic does this look in night vision it's crazy all right light stick away they have like stickers on themselves now like on their helmets civilian inside hands up above your head police hands up provide support on me restrained targets the hunter driven with the 200. all right contact is incredible what is sek our currency name

move drop the gun now yeah they fully reworked this area i wasn't expecting this hands up drop your knees whoa hey i look crazy we've got this under control yeah that screen was actually suspect standing by for transportation scary as hell i want to see this apparently they've added physics to this stuff now all right moving up sick come light out any all right oh we're good how many times has this level changed now what the hell swedish krona gotcha thank you so much and rock the gang with the 20. appreciate you um okay but we didn't finish clearing the ground level i wanted to do that i just want to make sure the top stairs were clear what the hell are we playing right now guys this is just too realistic game looks so good at night time provide cover roger on the move i can't even see through this i'm waiting for this is going to be the map isn't it where the new uh the new hiding spots come into play okay this is lit well yeah this room's changed too might be someone behind that chat behind me pretty dark in here but looks clear actually make sure the traps are clear yep down on your knees hands up do it now download that mirror amazing suspect d away all right boys leave that door locked go through here now that's all clear you said that cam light out evidence collecting evidence there's someone outside maybe this is a smaller version of the map because of the game mode i'm playing i think wait no there's a back entrance handcuffer dead enemy question mark yeah you can do that now it's a real swap procedure just because they look there doesn't mean they are should have checked that for a trap just been added with uh this update as well drop the weapon now huh have they got reactive music in this game pretty sure they do like whenever dude i don't know how big this version the map is because you can get in there in the larger version i don't think it is that big now we're good on me he was in a pool of blood yeah doesn't mean ain't gonna come back come back around i think they do it anyway just for you know when uh i don't you call it when you send in suspect killed the clean up time for their safety almost killed me heal my wounds real quick this place looks horrible are you kidding me moving clear can't be there you [Music] all right lights stick out sir can i find him drop your weapons [Music] report to talk oh debrief it's like playing against players hunter driven thanks for becoming a member buddy all right we're gonna clear the outer perimeter first now that we know that all that is part of it jeez man i need a drink some water to clarify well i might need a whiskey after this you know what's new in the update it's mostly an ai overhaul uh two new maps um and are refusing to cooperate all of this it's their biggest update yet three white box maps which are maps without textures um teammate enemy ai they hide loads of gameplay fixes quality of life new weapons it's huge man like there's so much it's mostly like animation stuff but yeah i mean look at this list just goes on and on and on and on and on you finally uh find the full patch notes on steam but this is the it's only available for supporters right now it's coming out to the main game uh pretty soon if i might go through it no i can't it's annoying excuse me boys get out my way thank you very much amj yeah they've closed off that part of the map with stuff i don't know what mode i chose it's definitely a smaller version of the map though that building is crazy uh yeah outer perimeter first let's go this way can you show the new weapons yeah i've i've used both of them already there's an mp9 um they've added the support shotgun finally there's a new pistol drop your weapons are they shooting someone in the door this one move over there i am moving out it's on clancy mode you know it definitely want to clear this out apart first now they've got like reflector patches on their helmets but it's like it's blinding no traps on this door all right boys let's do it moving in clear all right copy that get on the ground now get a [ __ ] warrant smack them in the back of the head uh you can play with a multiplayer score there's no like actual pvp in the game just yet but i think they plan on doing it at some point i wouldn't be uh i wouldn't i wouldn't be mad if they just full cent on making this experience as good as it could be because right now insane pretty insane how realistic this game is run at me with a knife we've got a dead suspect here this is talk affirmative entry team i want to hide in there were they a little passage to swim away yeah it's like caught multiplayer you can play with up to five other teammates well including you up to five extra on my six god they've fully changed this place it's an absolute maze now this goes into another building come like out i'll come this way later let's check this out oh yeah yeah these my ai squad mates that i can command okay we're good this game looks insane it is man it really is probably my favorite game of uh 2022 honestly it's very draining like the amount of fatigue you feel after playing a few hours of this just because it's so intense if i could play it for hours and hours i definitely would there's like i think people are speed running this game now trying to do the best they can all right back to the main house that door's open now covered this area roger that very sus we've got a dead suspect here look roger that entry team tag him and keep moving he ran at me a knife tomographic after getting milk and hobnobs from the local adventure time

if they've announced the actual date yeah but it'll definitely be coming this month yeah some lag when uh explosions go off but the price you pay for running the game on absolute max settings collecting evidence i'm sure it looks nice and crisp in 1440p on the stream though open and clear all right roger that roger it's open for the reflections of the helmets is really annoying low light deployed so bright isn't it yeah this game is basically the clean house mission uh on crack the whole game is that nothing is scripted that's a civvy hands up i'll bump your head police hands up down

in and out of that game it'd be fine if tarkov was look like my main game but it's just not civilians standing by for trailers i think i safely say this is the uh the most realistic ai system i've like encountered in a game maybe there's others that you guys can think of that have really good challenging ai but this is definitely up there for me i've never had them react so well and use cover so effectively i don't know before tonight we know where this leads proceed with your mission clearly our perimeter first on me copy funny reminds the like the stream i like that even chat's reminding chat now it's a team effort what the hell is this place oh it all just loops around oh no we're back in this room shush shut up skyrim are the best ai yeah that's it can't argue with that civilian contact taking care of it now where who did he see that i don't so many hiding places man please wipe your feet before you enter the house okay we've done all this i've been reported there's someone outside that i missed i don't know why he said that excuse me it's a reverse guys falling behind me i keep is it now possible that the ai mates you just use pistols teammates i don't know i mean i don't know if you can remove weapons from them get your head in that tent there you go get me out of here all right secured talk to entry team roger entry team great work keep going oh that's a shame
