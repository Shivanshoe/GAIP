all right so we're doing some solo spectating today jumping on the bandwagon now i'm gonna try and play out the start of these matches i don't want to hit the ground at the start of a match and you know spectate someone looting up and stuff but you know if it's going to be a good game if i get a good start then i want to play it out but if i die early then i die early we can spectate i've had a lot of requests to do more spectate content after the one video i did semi-recently i got messy real quick had to make sure those melee hits landed the punching air otherwise this dude above me or below me the vertical audio is just so messed up in this game it's gone quiet i don't like quiet wait you're up here how long has you been up here for oh my god i was watching this direction for so long i only got the lucky headshot on me as well come on man in and out come on [Applause] here we go back to the front line all right i thought this is our best chance of getting a solid reset do a search contract and uh try and get my loadout no weapons in here wait that was a guy just my shots at the railing there i have to go for the melee oh my god it's so broken oh everyone's coming for this scavenger contract is he on the lower level he's above me how i'm bouncing better he left me on one hp what is this game everyone wanted that contract i'm just gonna have to get the hell out of here i've got no interest in sticking around everyone's coming back from that gulag i think friendly oh there we go it's not too far away there's a quad on the map as well where's he going i think he's just taken the truck hasn't he relocating the safe zone there's supposed to be much fewer spawn locations for the trucks now which is nice i'm gonna pop a uav and get a self rise i think like uav entering the ao i don't need the loadout money now still farting around that same area there you are my god there we go got the headshot i think i've ever used a fully kitted version of the paddington in this game before it feels really sluggish to use doesn't sound as nice as some of the other sniper rifles which makes a huge difference that's one of the biggest selling points for me if a sniper rifle sounds good when you fire it it adds like 10 bonus points i'm comparing it to the oh where's that guy dropping in do you think let me try and take the staircase i don't have ghost though so if he has a heartbeat sensor then i'm screwed oh these freaking bouncing betty's everywhere man sick of it give me that [Applause] i've got long on the gas oh lee my dude trying to give me a heart attack or what sheesh just flew through that door with his hip fire vector and absolutely ruined my career dead silence as well what can you do i really like the ppsh in the game right now i mean he's actually using the uh the same loadout that i used in my last solo video the vector con i8 combo this is really good in solos big fan of this loadout whoa i think you've been spotted mate i don't know what rocket launcher that was but definitely wants to take the fight this guy's got the right idea he's gonna pull up ahead of him stay in the vehicle like that you mad man got no fear has he this guy does have two stun grenades which might be super yeah might be super advantageous that's the first stun here good idea for the guys getting the vehicle there stuns are just so op he's outlived the gunfight though they both have is he gonna buy are the uav maybe oh selfres of course i mean this guy seems more than capable he's just not gonna get himself into many fights right now because of the position he's in it's very rare you find someone on this hill unless they are sniping some shots downtown might try and get ahead of that be a wise idea i think if you could make it to the bank building then he's in a good good position i think people are going to be playing a lot more slow now because the aggressive players can't use the trucks to you know close the gap as easily i mean there's still trucks in the map just far less i mean look at this little stack up of vehicles here on the minimap people are still going to use vehicles their advantage but they're going to be quite as effective it's a really quiet game oh that's a nice shot there that guy was flash too kane is still extremely good evenly matched for me at the moment between this and the swiss k-31 because the car 98 has the bullet velocity increase which is great for long range like you don't feel the difference at the mid range which is where these snipers shine you know and having the faster reload with the swiss having a magazine instead of individually feeding the rounds into the car makes a huge difference uh but yeah this guy's in a good position right now just checking his corners making sure this house is clear he's got a good spot in the zone doesn't have to move for a while and he knows that there's some people in downtown so he's got that covered and there's a guy on the roof behind him that we've just seen him shooting at this is this solo stalemate that everyone finds themselves in at some point 10 left in the match including this guy oh set up a booby trap i like it i did see a vehicle on the mini map there you can see it driving next to the big building can't get up this way anymore needs to jump on the fence there you go so stupid that they removed some of these like parkour spots that we've known and used for the last year and now they just don't work anymore because the uh the object height has changed for some of these assets for david attenborough want to commentate these solo matches and here we have a wild solo player looking for a mate my amber impression needs some work he's blowing up his c4 he's taking a hit he's in the gas he's panicking you can't fit through there oh god he starts the gas oh no not like this i've just spectated this guy for 15 minutes watched him get zero kills in that time just to die like that oh i'm so sorry mate keep your head up that's who we're spectating now there we go he's got uav there's a lot of people not using ghost surprised get down it's not gonna finish that that's frustrating maybe he should have put his airstrike on it because that guy's gonna sell fresh i really like the new axial just what they've done to the colder optics like making them more like the vlk it's much more balanced easy to control the recall to but i mean it's just another buff to the cold war guns really isn't it they're just so strong right now i don't see anywhere near as many modern warfare guns as i used to oh it's a 1v1 i didn't even realize where's he going to be then if i was him i'd climb on the roof but could be in the tower nah yeah it's not in the tower he is on roof oh you're dead all the thermite oh he's panicking he ran back into the thermite gg the execution to finish [Applause] how could you do that to bruce willis man ballistic knife to the jugular that was an interesting match to spectate for sure uh didn't really expect to see the one guy that expected for the majority of the match die like that it was a very slow match and then uh yeah really built up to that underwhelming climax thank you the guy that killed the ticket the chicken chicken another chicken killed the chicken the chicken boys nice game gg guys weirdly there seems to be a resurgence in cheetahs this week i'm seeing a lot of people complain about cheaters in their matches and chickens right we're immediately hopping on board with this guy now brig knows let's see what he can do oh hang on he's fully descending on this guy and that's a kill four he's up to now ellie's locked on using the buy station movies up get himself as well maybe no self-rest oh he bought his loadout you should get a self-rest as well man come on wait his loadout isn't coming in heading this way you've got a that's the centex mate there you go that's a bit weird anyway he's got his gas mask there a plate box there we go you should take that and grabs this loadout hopefully he doesn't get shot by the heli here all right what loadout are you going for ffar on a k31 swiss all right oh that's all i got on his uav i respect the choice of the swiss yeah he did buy another loadout i thought he did i don't know what caused the first one's a glitch but we can get his ghost or high alert now whatever he's using that's it just quick scopy loadout if i'm gonna play super aggressive i find that the swiss is my go-to right now because i feel like i can handle the close range snipes more easily oh it was almost a headshot yeah medium to long range really big fan of the kanai 8k and the lw3 i think my weapon's a lot more versatile now yeah if i'm pushing and going for like like i just died the full damage on the right i swear i just heard him go ah this guy's scoping out the top of his building here he heard shots up there a second ago he's trying to make the guy peek the window by baiting him out with the ffr which is a good idea gas is pushing though so this guy's going to be stuck in a second still in the building or on it i mean he's probably in his best interest to get to the top of the building and jump off but this guy's ready for it where is he oh he's in the gas oh he died to the gas what are you doing man did he go down the zipline or like run all the way down the staircase he might have done because he was fighting the guy on the stairs let's take it dude i don't know what he was thinking this guy's gonna get a second loadout now i don't think he has specialist actually he's got his second loadout i might want to grab something here though huh i mean he's got nothing out of that maybe he just forgot that he had a second loadout but i mean he's got more ammo out of it so that's a good good idea this guy's playing quite well his movement's good he's got bounty there i think he's probably considering going up that building to parachute over it's exactly what he's going to do but yeah i've kind of got four snipers in mind right now that are sort of the top dogs for me coniate and uh swiss are very neck and neck for close medium um lw3 for medium long range it's a lot more versatile and the zrg or zrg depending on where you're from um that that's really good for long range super long ranges zrg and it's got some versatility to it as well like it's not a bad choice but um yeah they've definitely tried to make it more of like a oh my god what shot that was um i tried to make it more of an anti-tank rifle which is what it is but it's a lot more slow yeah this guy's good he's good with the snipes open up a torso shot there i think that guy had already been in an engagement so it's pretty weak it's not one shot to the torso there's a guy on the lower level of the garage here the gas station or petrol station as i'd call it personally you know gas isn't a liquid that's got the most frustrating thing to hear this guy's got really good movement he's very reactive with his snipes he's doing well i think he knows i'm spectating him like he's just doing some weird weird stuff it's all for the camera isn't it i see you brig knows if that's how you pronounce it hey this guy plays a lot like me i mean i don't use the ffar anymore but it's still still more than viable uh yeah his playstyle is very similar to my own right now he's pretty fearless tries to uh keep his movement up in the open nice shot there oh the lamppost got in the way yeah he doesn't doesn't worry about the cover so much because he knows that if he can keep his movement up and someone misses a snipe for instance he can turn around and take a quick reactive shot with his sniper because his aim seems pretty true you know he hasn't missed many shots yet his only problem is gonna be that he's running around with a sniper rifle um at the close range you know he's probably better off with the ffr whilst he's running around here i've seen someone on the uav and they're going for the loadout that's a really easy shot yeah he's just like me he can hit the most ridiculous shots on people who are moving and doing crazy jump shots but the moment someone stands still he tries to predict their movement and it ruins him because they're not moving i've done that so many times now you play this game long enough you just you you know 90 of players just move the same way sly canceling and jumping it's like you're always trying to predict which way they're gonna go so the moment that someone's just completely still easy to line up and take the head shot you just do these erratic flick shots as if they're going to move one direction or the other and they never do he's got one beat here i'm assuming this is the same guy who's at the bottom of the ladder there how did that miss i'm gonna lie my heart was in my throat for a second there i could have easily been over for him if that guy was switched on dead silence actually saved him big time be nice if we could see when they look at their map you know it's got four people on the radar right now oh got a nice little break on there i don't know if that actually pen the the doorway the door frame nice little down a bit of latency on the server so some people are getting around corners before getting down holy crap dude what a shot he's redeemed himself after that license after the engagement prior to the last one i should say that was an awesome shot that was literally life or death situation there friendly recons online did well to come out that one alive go with the right shield and i missed what weapon he had there but that's very well played i think that's the top of a air conditioning unit or something credit where it's due so going the lower level of this building he's trying to pan him he's had the uavs up for a lot of this game because he started the match with big cash oh no top apartment building with a sniper rifle it's a risky position in here it's exposed behind yeah he knows it there he is top of the stairs he's exposed to the right though like this guy in the apartment building should have a clear line of sight on him right now and he's peaked it yeah though he's trying to bait him again with the far i think that guy in the building is just uh oh he's going for the jump shots i think he's playing it really safe the guy in the building he's probably camping the staircase i know what his next move is going to be who's pushing it all right it's got one b semtex up top would have been a good idea but yeah there he is rpg he went for the rpg on the staircase i could have been life or death for sure this guy is uh 11 kills in 22 players alive he knows of one guy on top of the apartment so we can get ahead of him then put himself in a better position but we'll see how he plays this some nice snipes we've seen something from him so far nice little flick shots and jump shots he's doing all the uh targets mark he's doing all the moves of a good aggressive marksman oh when he's been down snipe from the top of apartments he's gonna hit that self-rest hopefully yeah there we go let's turn around that's still an easy shot for the guy but he's made it around the corner yeah so this is the best plan for him right now get ahead of the guy in the apartment and then when the gas eventually pushes this guy off the building he'll be in a better position to take him out the chest that he can loot in here it's going to say legendary chest it might have been uh looting in this game feel your pain man be huge if he was to get a self-rest out of that but i mean he's close to a buy station whether or not he's going to use it is uh i think he's thinking about it keeps looking that direction but could very well be more people in this area he's keeping his wits about him doing weapons weapon inspect for us loves putting on a show this guy he's been keeping us entertained i'm rooting for him i think he can win this if he keeps this sort of uh style up you know he's getting towards the late game now so i think uh yeah he's he's a bit more passive but that's good you know he knows where one guy is and he wants to make sure there's no one else in the area before getting too close i might see something out of the corner of his eye someone's shooting at the apartment buildings now he's going to use this opportunity to get a bit closer maybe use the buy station is he going to go for the buy station yes he is get another selfres there it is self acquired and a uav recons online and he's high threat i've just realized someone's back from the gulag sat on top of yet still up there it's not the same guy from early though is it over flicking here and guys jumped off it's another guy parachuting above him just come back from the gulag that guy's so lucky to be back in a fight as well because the few legs fully closed now uv's up two people on radar he's got one here back of garages good down just a body shot as well so that guy was weak he might have been playing up he's got a satchel there eight plates back nine targets remain standing sort them out this is big and get ahead of this guy now how's it going the lower level here east come on oh yeah easy beam waiting for this guy to jump might push a lower level himself use that back side of the rock cover of the hill some pretty aggressive players in this lobby must admit obviously the people on apartment buildings aren't going to push up so i'm going to keep that building for as long as they can like i just parachute off now not sure about his position in here trying to take shots of the guy from the uaz i really just called that uaz well that's the first time i think i've ever done that in warzone that's what it's called in pub g it's a jeep using this open by someone died on it recently so it's a risky position a risky buy for sure but he's been keeping these ua uavs up the entire time there we go he's pushing up on this guy in the hill could use the the loadout for cover here oh i think he's starting to panic a bit now with some of these shots but he made sure that one hit let's guide right down the far end of the fence there sliding towards him yeah you got to get out of here dude you take this fight later that guy's got to play up anyway there's an upper torso shot so oh no go prone yeah yeah yeah yeah crazy moves crazy moves oh oh my god if that had connected got the movement on this man right now he's all over the place in the best way possible he's going to check this hangar on a beat well there's someone in here oh no finish the job breaknos brig knows i don't know how to pronounce your name but valiant effort there my guy taken out by a man in a hangar he's actually at nine kills some people having some pretty decent games right now he's checking his loot he's taking some ammo damn it feels bad get the heartbeat out there but finally encounter a player who wasn't you know he was actually ghosted it's been a rare occasion this match some very close sniper shots there may even be on top of the hangar oh we didn't even i don't think he even heard it that close i definitely did but it's weird sometimes spectate footsteps are way more audible than if you're actually playing yeah i feel bad for breaking noise uh he's playing really well this guy's also at nine kills legend is his name i like it a guy prone there we go easy he didn't even need to set a zoom there took that shot mid zoom i think still got the headshot what was it headshot no it's just a body shot that guy was hurting probably playing up at the time he got shot it's a 1v1 situation now this guy is in a good position he can wait here and maybe use the gas to leave when he needs to 10 kills on the board right now yeah he's gonna try and use that left exit i think if it comes towards him that'll be huge but probably gonna go in between them somewhere uh yeah that's not great for him but i'm assuming the other guys in the adjacent building where that king contract is so they probably got an even amount to run distance wise but i think the other dude has more cover there he is top hill surprised he went with the ak beam there but he broke plates this guy is very confident surprised he uh continued to peak that no place now full spray down he's panicking the gas is ruining him now the gas mask animation no oh it's such a detriment it's such a detriment in the end game it would be nice if you just drop your gas mask i genuinely think that would be a great option because of just the way it's implemented right now but gigi's through his opponent there respectable gunfight from all parties and uh especially the brig knows who we can see lying down in front of the hangar there taking a well-deserved nap after all of that running around there's spectating solos for you for those of you that wanted to see more solo spectating on the channel i have delivered you'll have to let me know if you enjoy this type of content i know it's very different i'm new to this but i know that a lot of people like to see uh my thoughts and sort of you know i'm able to constantly talk rather than being in my own head when i play my own solo matches so anyway leave a like if you enjoyed the video it really helps out the channel with all the boring algorithm stuff subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music]
