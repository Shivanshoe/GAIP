so in today's video i'm using something very different a weapon that is highly underrated in warzone but packs one hell of a punch and absolutely melts people at close to medium range i am of course talking about the mg 34 lmg now with it being a light machine gun it can be on the slower end when it comes to ads time and overall mobility but i've personally found the mg34 to be extremely reliable and as long as you're able to aim down sight before your enemy you've basically already won the fight now before we get into that i wanted to let you know that today's video is once again sponsored by nvidia and pallet and we're going to be playing and recording warzone on the pallet geforce rtx 2060 super gaming pro oc and showcasing the benefits of high fps and monster herds in warzone this gpu features a two fan design as well as support for pallets thundermaster software which lets you easily monitor and overclock your gpu to get the best performance giving you 1080p 144fps in warzone along with the added features of geforce rtx like real-time ray tracing and dlss combining your high frame rate gpu with a high refresh rate monitor can further enhance your gameplay experience by reducing input lag as well as distracting effects like screen tearing and ghosting to generate a smoother overall image check out the link below to view palettes range of geforce rtx gpus in your region now then we've seen variants of the mg34 in the loop pool for warzone before but you've likely just swapped it out at your earliest convenience or just completely ignored it altogether as these world spawn blueprints usually suck and for that reason this lmg has probably never even crossed your mind as a viable option in war zone first impressions can be everything to some players but this video might just encourage you to give the mg34 a second chance and it may even become a new permanent addition to your loadout with weapons like the bruin dominating war zone at the moment it's easy to get caught up in the mob mentality and feel like you're at a disadvantage if you're not using the current meta but what makes these weapons fall into the meta brackets so easily is that they are usually incredibly versatile and so they appeal to a large majority of the playerbase they never completely excel at one thing however which is what enables weapons like the mg34 with its insanely high rate of fire at just under 880 rounds per minute the highest in the lmg category as well as having an incredibly fast time to kill allows it to easily counter the current meta loadouts as long as you don't become too overly aggressive you do not want to be rushing people with this thing again the aim down sight time and slow mobility along with an open bolt delay when you first start firing are just some of the mg34's biggest downfalls but as long as you're able to choose your fights wisely and stick to this weapon's strength so you can really start stacking up the kills with this lmg so i'm playing the new buyback solos mode in today's video and so the class setup that i'm running includes the monolithic suppressor for the added sound suppression and damage range which also includes that hidden 15 bullet velocity which is always a nice little bonus we don't need to use a barrel attachment with this build as to be quite honest they all suck we either lose out on bullet velocity or aim down sight speed and none of these barrel options help to control recoil so we can just skip this option altogether i then use the commando 4 grip to completely eliminate the horizontal recoil which there is already very little of with the mg34 but this is also the only foregrip that doesn't reduce our aim down sight speed we then use the attack laser as well as the fss close quarters stock for the most significant increase to ads and finally the gi mini reflex for better target acquisition as i wanted to force as many fights as possible in the following match and i wasn't very comfortable using the iron sights at those longer ranges i'm also running the fenik smg as my secondary with this loadout as it's not something that i wanted to rely on too much but i thought it could be fun to use two high rate of fire weapons simultaneously and i decided to build my fennec with mobility in mind for whenever i needed to cross any open areas overall this class setup works really well for solos and the default 50 round magazine is all you really need for the amount of players that you tend to run into but i would build this weapon slightly differently for squads and that build would look something like this merc full grip for increased recoil control and hip fire accuracy plus that four percent extra movement speed no stock for fast drain down sight and movement speed with the addition of reduced hip fire spread and finally the hundred round belt to minimize the number of times that you need to reload in battle and maximize the number of players that you're able to challenge at one time with that said if you enjoyed today's video or this class setup was helpful to you in any way then please hit that like button and consider subscribing for more content like this

sound another one in this building i've killed them earlier that's a different guy no the hell all right let's get this contract done [Applause] all right lovely drop the armor box and take max plates it's a lot of ways in and out of stadium for this new update lurking in the dark a lot of action going down here still watch the skies let's get involved one above one below that's the guy from up top just hiding no match for the origin 12. i know what you got for me what are you doing can't run from your problems oh that was a ballsy reload midgun fight red keycard yeah i'm not gonna find much use for that at this point a lot of snipes going on let's get a bird's eye view hey what a lot of recall with this build all right chris kyle can i snipe on me there this is risky let's grab a loadout hostile dropping into the area watch the skies almost just lost that fight to melee there's an enemy team hunting for you now i'm being tracked melee is so powerful in this game as long as you have a weapon in your hand i got the wheel the melee damage is ridiculous well i need to grab a satchel so it's a research contract hmm oh my search contract's gone he's taking it right in front of me come on peek that window the drone somewhere here we go he hit me with a shotgun as well surprised that didn't kill me also that spot effect from the drone that's not what you want mid engagement less than 50 remain plenty of targets i like the way you say that i need to use the spy station gotta get plates and i'm hoping there's no one in these houses can buy another stack as well why not found a satchel in a random house so that was nice i want to get out of farmland and towards port wait there's a guy almost got my head blown off oh didn't mean to vote that ow right he doesn't have much cover there see if we can beam him oh yeah we beamed him all right that's about as far as i'd push the range with the mg34 con i8 this bush seems like a good spot to do my nine second reload there's a guy there hello all right let's move up to your ghost i wonder no let's close the gap i know he's right here it's in the bush saw me as well oh this thing's so powerful i don't know why it's taking me this long to try it all right let's get into port try and take the gas station on the right here this building is clear very quiet though oh look at that a headshot multiplier is insane love it it was over for that guy before he'd even realized he was being shot at all right let's make sure i'm safe we'd like to use that buy station if possible oh hang on only 25 left keep up some good work someone might beat me to it anyone here okay let's buy uav and see what we're up against or at last killed someone probably the same dude to be fair just landed on his gear let's see i'm surprised i wasn't shot out there ah there we go not too concerned about that guy over here someone's gonna advance uav oh and that sniper just took my kill just one shot at him all right we're doing okay 13 kills there's one less than 10 remains out that was nearly the death of me and he's not happy what's he using growl and rpg overhead deserve to die that's season three mata mate catch up enemy uav all right that guy did just snipe at me in the tower but he's out of circle so hopefully i can get keep here just some of the only solid cover in the circle where do you come from it's self-rest as well and the guy in the cranes probably moved on zone is slowly shrinking now we're in the end game now boys just need to take out thanos 1v3 there he is it's our sniper friend let's not get too greedy that heart rate right down and finish the mission gas is closing get to the new safe zone it's one unaccounted for oh the last two are fighting what's he using thank you for the airstrike forced him out of cover 1v1 situation where's this zone moving gas is closing in relocating the safe zone this is your last chance finish the job there he is he's victory baby oh that feels good oh that gun is insane man mg 34 don't sleep on it remember the name i had to play much more reserve that game in the sense that obviously i didn't have a sniper rifle so i really had to move cover to cover that's why i used a vector with high mobility as my secondary so that i could actually get the content with the mg34 instead of getting a ton of kills with a sniper rifle because you know i like my sniping i really had to know my range there i don't believe you bought background gg boys [ __ ] how many calls would you tumble uh i got 17 i think yeah 17. good gamer now fit some random guy [ __ ] one of you called on a blackberry no i didn't call in a uh i didn't call him the airstrike i was the other guy but he forced you out of cover so this guy is very scottish all right gge thank you for watching guys hope you enjoyed that leave a like if you did and make sure to subscribe if you want more content like this that was really good fun nice mix up of gameplay i think you'll all agree i'll definitely be using
