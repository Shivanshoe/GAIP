okay let's do this thing my first solo game on for dansk84 all right let's go i want that search contract all right there's a few people coming here i don't think i'm first he's got it eliminate all targets that's messy oh wait a minute i almost forgot today's video is sponsored by nvidia and scan and you can check out the link in the description below this video to view scans range of geforce rtx 30 series products so with the launch of season three warzone now supports nvidia's dlss dlss uses ai to boost your in-game frame rates whilst generating sharp and detailed images the extra performance means that your rtx gpu can now play at high resolutions and graphic settings simply enable dlss in the warzone graphics menu i've gone for the quality option here which works best for me as i play on a 1440p display and boom just like that my frames have now been boosted thanks to dlss warzone also supports nvidia's reflex technology which is nvidia's new system latency reduction feature lowering the time it takes from a mouse click to an action taking place on screen things like tracking taking precise shots and reacting to different competitive situations all benefit from having lower system latency simply turn nvidia reflex on in the game menus and your system latency will be optimized with that said thanks to nvidia and scan for sponsoring now back to the gameplay all right man down we got the kill and i need to turn on my fps camera so that you can see my dlss performance there you go fps counter is in the top left and that will stay there throughout this match uh i was pretty sure there was a third guy that landed with us but i guess he headed into the town there there are shots on the uav anymore loot around doesn't look like i'm it gonna try and push this building i think that's where oh yeah you can see him that was a bad idea let's leave that box quick oh my god [Applause] well open bolt reload whatever the hell i just did almost cost me my life but we won the fight small steps behind me then if you can hear that i barely can just broken glass as well that was a close one windows broke on the building over here he's in that window let's get over there not bouncing bet he just ruined me i love it yeah i didn't take it much did it welcome to the guru i've been here before mate don't worry you lose your fight is overturn is it lovely lovely bit of hip fire there i think i'm just gonna push my bounty he's over this big building actually there's a truck here only makes sense if i don't take it someone else oh there goes my bounty which means there's someone else here is that a guy that killed him we'll find out there is i'm gonna make it inside i guess he did all right good push i should get my loadout now hmm i never liked this area there's so many hiding places but yes it landed in a horrible spot so many places to get shot from here there is only one loadout drop though usually it drops multiple if there's someone else in the vicinity but never be too sure just looking for sniper glints i think we're good the ptsd is scaring me i'll drive okay as valcania sort of rocking today let's check this building i'll leave the um the loadouts in the description if you want to see the class setup for either weapons i've made videos on them before but started listing the stuff in the description now which you guys seem to appreciate so i'll keep doing it okay so my bounty's in the gas station area at the buy station maybe someone just called a cluster strike on him could be his cluster strike actually what are all of my bounties keep getting poached before i even get there he might have classified himself it's a very real possibility there is what's left of him ah solos i just don't seem to see anybody when i play it even when i just full send and put myself in compromising positions all right i'm very bored now i'm gonna go use that buy i need to sell fresh might be my only lifeline none of this loot's been taken i just don't know who called in that cluster strike because no one's come to loot this guy so weird requesting recon yeah no one on uav that's myself i'm gonna grab my truck and then drive into one of the more populated areas i've been driving around for so long now and i haven't seen or heard anyone solos is something else it's actually a horror game you're just waiting to get jumped out at by someone sat in a building or a dark corner for 20 minutes no one in that building is there we're in the tower and then on that building was that guy on top of a ray the entire time i could drive i bet he was the one that called in the cluster strike on that guy on the buy station my god all i did was tag his armor well i want to fight that guy so i'm just gonna full send i think landed around here somewhere right unless he made it all the way to stadium i doubt it no way was in one of those bushes no way i can drive oh you know top of that roof i see you guys stun on that backside both have the same idea there about the as well perfect for solos i don't like relying on the truck but in solos the way i see it it's like a mobile house no if everyone else is gonna camp in buildings then i'm gonna use my truck to flush them out it's one of the only ways to play aggressive in solos let's buy uav oh double semtex is it where did they come from oh this is sketchy i can't use the buy from here don't like this see this is my favorite part of solos it's intense but at least i feel something requesting recon oh there we go uav where were you earlier i deleted he saw me on his heartbeat sensor i don't have ghosts right now be advised uav another one i'm not building rtv for resupply [Applause] where's he up there i'll drive so you want me to find out it's another good use of the truck creates flanking routes oh my god that guy just pooped his pants you know what you could just tell he like swept everything off his desk it sounded like i'll drive it's quite late i'm playing at like 1am right now on eu so i haven't heard many death comes in this match all right we're in the end game now seven players left including me say this building i don't hear any steps oh we're clear that's actually in-game as it was playing a heartbeat it always seems to play at like the perfect time when i peek a corner or something feels even more like a horror game only four enemies remain you know what to do okay it's me v3 i don't know where anyone is welcome to the solo experience again with the music there's a reason why i play with it off i turned it on because jack said it was cool i gotta listen to jack sniper glim there's a guy here that guy was shooting at me as well think he's behind that fence it's not heartbeat you know that much he's gonna have to move there he is i'm so sorry all right taking the truck i can drive only into the circle actually let's push this guy another one dead and the last guy's finished it for me do i take the truck from this point nah let's fight it oh i knew it was a bad decision i should have taken the truck oh no the iron sights ruined me i need to put a geo mini reflex on the uh as val i think a good game i guess it's about as much action as you're going to get in solos these days let me start playing solos v duos or trios definitely offers a different play style though maybe it's enjoyable to watch you'll have to let me know it's just uh it's very campy there it is second place we'll take it i mean dmitry outplayed me there has he got a mic gg dimitri well played now there is well i hope you enjoyed that guys make sure to uh leave a like if you did and uh let me know as well down in the comments if you want to see more solo videos in the future and remember to check out the link in the description below to view scans range of geforce rtx 30 series products but yeah that's solos in warzone for you definitely picks up a lot more in the end game playing game scenario was a bit more fun and uh not so much of the waiting around for something to happen but thank you for watching and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music] you
