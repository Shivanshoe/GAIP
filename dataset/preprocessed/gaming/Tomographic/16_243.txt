buddy the skin oh that's so cool what's this dude doing can you dive into that surely not you absolute pleb oh it's the harvester look at that thing so this is what was falling from the sky if you saw the teaser if you looked up in the sky in season three you could see something falling it's like an earthquake that was caused by that thing landing and it's split most of the map up I think it's called the harvester alright first game of the day first time playing apex in a little while let's do this thing sniper ammo oh yes um I said it was an entirely different class now that's crazy and the triple take also takes sniper ammo instead of energy interesting one of his passives you can just climb right up stuff now and he also Crouch walks faster oh damn fast my legs moving how can he go yeah this is gonna be great for her yeah and the high spots that other players might be hiding at I love it dude make ulti I want zombie mode and not creeper should we try out enter death protection ah okay so you know where shadows if you look at my hands my hands so if we get shot we'll all return to that totem that I've just put down you have to stay in radius though essentially gives us a chance trying a strategy if it fails and we get killed we get sent back ask for his cue for a device that deals damage and disables enemy abilities for 10 seconds so it's like an EMP essentially let's test this okay so you lose momentum but you can climb very high that's like what 7 meters I will go this way as well actually go there back the way we came oh no it gets cut off oh wait what what the I'm dad regardless I'm dead oh my god this is hilarious oh here dude oh my god that is hilarious I can't father what just happened I thought I was about to fall to my death and the absolutely opposite happened I ascended it was great oh that's too good no it's just made my day when I just ruined his all right we get it there's an enemy of that Jesus he's got the nice sniper as well I put my totem down it's not kill don't know how I still have that shot let's test the EMP ok fires like a bangalore smoke they last so long I've got so much time left as well I like the new skybox that's really cool it's like the new atmosphere to be honest I like the old season the way it looked but like it was too colorful for my liking I like color don't get me wrong but it looked too much like for tonight in my opinion now that this thing's landed there's like huge dust clouds in the sky and it's a lot more it's a lot less bright all over the place the snow isn't shadows and stuff more it's where did he go goddamnit it's on the same floor isn't he that's my teammates EMP should stop them from pushing the stairs I love the PK oh here we go new sniper uh Oh No servers have crashed right as I get the new riser get the new weapon yeah oh well at least have cleaned up the squad before disconnected he's good though right Lee into the beam it's an easter egg so just go inside yeah just fly directly into it it's like the Wraith ball and the in the last map this is gonna catch us so hype do this could be so good okay wait you're not you have to fly into it you've missed it it's gonna kill us no there you go it's gonna kill us it's gonna kill us you didn't fly into the right part i season for the company you fell for that oh yeah I can't believe you thought that before doing it Goti you listen all right if you're gonna set something up you got to sell it a lot better oh I sold it week I sold it you would have done if on the soul they has the dirtiest grin on his face you gotta fly into the beam of death dude grab Nick cracks yeah 40 health 40 health on revenant in the back they have purple oh god oh we have accuracy as I missed my shots he's pushing left towards you Tom I'll put a beacon down I'll come hit e on it Oh too late I'm already full sending founder good new bassist Asin here they don't mean half my balls one he's very low he didn't even press the e on it that was his silence okay freakin na service man the matter dude I was like yo so my revenge for you first place like in a minute good yo get out over my bag look it look how fast I'm moving I'm crouched

it looks so funny yeah I can't look weird here I can I can give us the I can give us the dose of totem yeah don't use it yeah usually when we get a bit closer usual when we get here I'm signed in these fools all right what am I supposed to be aiming at here uh enemies two to tango teams disrupter Tim both of them sooo down there's so many people over there oh three down another one over there I got a token there thank you gotta move though Sam actually understand off do we have to I mean yeah this is gonna hurt I do not know the lead on this game anymore I don't know if it's worth charging up but does the same amount of damage we've go go back the way we came it does more damage to shields when it's charged yeah but wasting a shield battery for that I'm getting hit by this Dangs up did he jump off the edge yeah if you jump to come back up he's underneath you should be one left low I wiped one squad and killed one other bro what are you doing under me he's selfing me in there I'd say eight times that down too and great Oh Frick sake oh boy my trunks mine oh my god you guys excuse me I was the leader of the pack out the circle you didn't follow I told you he'll himself you did yeah I have to get the finish though otherwise I would have healed and not got the kill on the guy just heal yourself up to top acolyte and then resume and I'll be in the zone okay I don't know if I have enough time to even it's gonna be close oh shoot their camping it ya know fantastic last team that's why oh my God we're the last oh just just own it just finish it you mean just finish this we'll need this windy yeah is this is this guy even a gamer son what would pick this guy up the hell have you guys done to me I can't even do this look I read the patch notes all you need to do is not die this is Chunkin he's gotta eat he's in a minute more that's more than what we did I mean I was in and then I came back in to help you guys see there but I was not supposed to help me you can get up a creeper that's got gold on you you got these guys good always going to yell stop yeah I can't do that I can't do that that's way too difficult for the first game back plays you know what I was safe in the circle and then came back in probably wasn't the best idea uh-huh she just let you guys die let me die I don't know if I'm gonna use the disrupter rounds though if they can seem a shield in your memory tree and it's probably not the best I found another a consent no no it consumes a battery it's not a [ __ ] cell yeah it's a battery I'm cool saying is she'll sell but I mean saying it consumes a full shield you know it's a yikes for me it just doesn't seem worth it those guys only got blue a while mikono you must be bad I'm sorry you died did his own last round I'm sorry that guy once he's not gone I'm just a beast I saw the craver no this is why me it sounds like a creeper doesn't have visited the bully up there yo your man a beacon us what do we call this all well why you got tonight

just yeah their total to third party heaven Tom if we want to live we got a rind out behind me they baked you let's go dare I try let's go get a man yeah I'm gonna try I don't know if it's not worth using the totem as like an engagement tool though because like regardless you're gonna lose all that health yeah see that's the thing I didn't realize that you could use it as a guy out of jail for 15 seconds slob man yeah I don't think it should be used in the way that we're trying to use it it doesn't count as a or you don't you don't get a user shield with it that's a problem no yeah so it's like we're it's like the same as going in and losing your shield to just kill ourselves I had it yeah I don't wanna live anymore let's reset okay do you have a June of the frag Tom now let's go in the
