hey guys is Tom here hope you're doing well and you're staying inside it's a real life war zone out there right now and I'm wishing you and your loved ones good health during these crazy times oh and if someone could spare some toilet roll I'd be incredibly grateful but onto the topic of today's video today we're going to be taking a look at the org the Aug or the algae whatever you call it this thing is a beast and it has become my go-to weapon in Call of Duty warzone by default in modern warfare the weapon comes a standard as an SMG but you can upgrade it to the 556 NATO rounds which I have with a 60 round drum magazine allowing me to take on full squads in warzone which as you probably know can happen quite regularly sometimes you just get caught in a sticky situation and you have to 1 V 3 and this weapon is great for that the damage per second of this 556 conversion is unbelievable it just puts people to sleep and I mean look at it it's a gorgeous looking weapon Wow I actually have a blueprint here which I got from the bow pass and it gives the org that stealthy all-black look with the wooden handguard it looks badass but anyway this is how I have it set up so monolithic suppressor for the sound suppression damage range you get the disadvantage of AD s speed and aim walking steadiness but it's worth the trade-off for the sound suppression in warzone then we've got the 407 mil extended barrel for the increased damage range bullet velocity and recoil control again we're taking a hit to the 80 s speed here but the advantages of having the extended barrel shouldn't make you question the trade-off we've touched on this already but we've got the 556 NATO around 60 round drum magazine converting this weapon to an assault rifle and giving us more damage and range with a decreased mobility and recoil control in the gameplay you're about to see I am in fact using the commando 4 grip to help out with our recall stabilisation I've recently made some changes and I've started using the stipple grip tape to bounce out the 80s speed with the added bonus of sprint to fire speed allowing me to ready my weapon much faster after sprinting I've opted for the GI mini reflex which is my favourite red dot sight in the game it's a very clear optic with minimal housing making it great for target acquisition and though I use iron sights in Modern Warfare's multiplayer which allows me to invest that attachments law into a weapon perk I often find I'm a much bigger disadvantage against opponents using their preferred optics in warzone I'm also using the HDR sniper rifle and warzone this is my prefer ball action rifle purely for the increased bullet velocity and decreased bullet drop which is super helpful for those long-range targets I have this weapon equipped with a monolithic suppressor for sound suppression and damage range HDR pro twenty six point nine inch barrel for damage range bullet velocity the thermal scope for better target acquisition as you probably know a lot of people are using the thermals right now so if you can't beat them join them I've got the F tak stalker grip which gives me increased ATS speed and I was using nine round magazines before loaded with enemy tears of course but I've recently switched out to the fully loaded perk which gives you 40 rounds as soon as you spawn with your loadout which you can then use to split amongst your teammates or if you're a bit of a rusty shot and you have plenty of rounds to work with that's when my perks I'm using cold blooded which means I'm undetectable to other enemies thermal sights overkill which allows me to use that HDR as a secondary and one of my favorite perks in the game is called tracker which allows me to see enemy footsteps being able to track your enemy or see footsteps through a window or door can be incredibly helpful once inside yeah I see them on truck now let go bro , and one finish that's my lethal and tactical and using a c4 for that increased explosive damage and I'm using smoke grenades which I can dump on teammates when I need to revive I can throw them out across a field smoke grenades in warzone just have endless capabilities and in the last few circles they can mean the difference between life and death but that's it that's my preferred loadout for warzone and I encourage you to try out for yourself thank you so much for watching and enjoy the rest of the video you see anyone learn next to us I don't know one of you guys Oh kill contract mmm already on one yeah yeah yeah I didn't realize that means right there though
