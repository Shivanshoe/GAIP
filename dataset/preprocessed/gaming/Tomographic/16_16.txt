you ready for this man ready when you are are you on heels i'm uh yeah i'm at full health basically okay there's nothing player dead absolutely gamer yeah for left side faint steps closing this door i'm watching her back right in this corner there's someone hello there closing this door jesus you're cracked at your mind right now away gaming i'm so sorry it's fine it's fine it's fine don't worry take my uzi take my uzi i'm so sorry don't worry about it it happens it happens oh no part of the game you were chatting so hard though i was trying to be all accurate with this guy that her head just like popped into frame right as you're about to finish oh that's great oh it was it was wrong my heart just dropped you did that for the content right matt i shot you in the back of the head for content yes that was my intention you saw me being a chad and you were like all right well i need some content on i need to be able to like provide some sort of entertainment for my community let me show there is actually gun play in this game betrayal all right i'm going to play a few with you matt okay but it's currently 3 am so yeah i was gonna say um i wasn't expecting someone like you to be on this late yeah our time zones don't usually align do it granted i also stay up late too i'm a night owl for sure yeah i couldn't sit by and watch you attempt to play this solo well for your first time even though we've only just begun it's a pleasure to have you here it's a pleasure to be here we don't play it in ages all right give me one second to set up my uh yeah yeah yeah do your thing controls they probably do they have toggle aim i hope yes you're a toggle aimer as well i who else is it who is it yes jack jaclynson fragmentation the third yes exactly because we are uh professionals professionals god damn it okay so this way there is some wiggle to this game holy yeah yeah for sure the movement's not horrible but the gun play kind of is that's that's not a great it's not a real glowing endorsement there it's kind of like fallout gunplay yeah it's alpha though so and that wasn't good you see the glowing in the distance i see a glow yeah yeah yeah so like it's kind of like sniper glint essentially of a ship so those are all ships is that you shooting or we no we're getting shot at by a guy in front of us he's got dude is that sbmm in space i don't know you're the only one oh no that's fine that's that's a turret that's a turret you can kill that oh no it's a big ship are you sure it's a turret no it looked like a turret from the front and then it turned to the side he's going through the side he's kicked out he's killed out with basically a full auto turret we're about to be disabled like if we don't make it now oh no just let us in our health is a one hp i don't know if we're gonna make this if we get disabled here i'm gonna be so sad i'm almost in we're almost in come on no he's going out he's gonna laugh wait wait we did it oh my god we're in easy i was never i was never in doubt right we are not escaping in our ship we're just going through the airlock okay there's no way we're getting out now no this is fine i mean actually let's let's take a minute come back yeah let's just see we can repair right yeah because he can't do any more damage right so let's just repair this up to find a fire extinguisher um okay oh yeah no we're good i think i actually took damage from war i don't know my health is not a a hundred percent so oh mine isn't either yeah no cause he disabled the ship like i guess he landed a few more shots after the fact all right let me let me uh eat this choco bar real fast yeah you do that actually i can't eat it what right click use used there we go there we go there we go yeah ah yes the healing effects of chocolate so are we good now yeah is there anything else you have to repair on the ship or is it just that that's it yeah it really is just that okay it's basically like talk of sea of thieves yeah in a way yeah in a way we're just space pirates but okay basically if we die someone could take our press tab you can see there's like a key card slot below where you're yeah captain key card yeah it's the captain key card so they can take that off us and then use that on the on this sort of thing and then get our ship only when we're in here though so if we're on our ship the only way they can get in is if they use an escape pod and they're just on it yeah i gotcha yeah it makes sense i mean they could literally just come this door so be ready in case no one camp stores in video games what do you mean no no we are coming in pretty late though because we were in a bit of a space battle outside oh so does it spawn everyone at the same time yeah it's not like an instance just killed an ai i think yeah it's uh the match just starts at the same time for everyone okay the session isn't ongoing like the cycle everyone starts the match at the same time right i gotcha let me say that guys one holy there's a lot of dudes down there yeah it's all ai i think you dropped him yeah they are gonna hear this though and that's an awkward place to loot that is quite out in the open isn't it yeah you want to be careful sprinting too because it's i mean listen to this is it really loud oh yeah that's clunky that's chunky let's try and look at these guys because you don't have a bag do you no i do not okay just be on alert i'm gonna check this real fast angles on this map in particular kind of nuts should be right to live here at least okay yes there you go there's a sack bag on that guy um yeah it's got a great sack um it's a great sound we had a chocolate bar and some ammo it looks like so the chocolate bars basically is like like the bandage essentially helps with fatigue too okay all right this guy's a well rod do you want a wild rod i don't uh sure seem like a whirlwind kind of guy matt yeah why not or i already have a pistol okay so you said i can like discard so just you can't scrap how do you scrap yeah so just drag the weapon into like just off with the off the ui there and i'll drop the weapon on the ground you can't scrap in raid uh okay well i'll just keep it in my bag does that matter yeah that's fine um so there's not a lot of like looting in this game compared to tarkov like you won't find a lot of loot just lying around like miscellaneous items um okay but but there are small like boxes like these cardboard boxes here you can leave so you're saying it's it's uh bare bones little amazon boxes here yeah that's the key word for this game alpha i think there's a brody helmet in there that should be good for you okay so the top box there yeah should i be replacing that with my civilian helmet yeah i just dropped that on the floor the civilian one's super affordable okay that's an enemy shot oh yep careful my own approach though [Music] just right in here good one sound like it was to our left too maybe but that may have just been my clap of my cheeks it's weird the audio in this i feel like it's kind of like siege in a way okay so bad i don't know if that's true it just feels like you have to follow the audio yeah yeah if there's like an open door you'll hear it there but you've got to find the audio source right i got it i killed one i'm going to check this guy i think that was a player i hear maybe foots to my left yeah just keep you around that door there's no grenades or anything so you don't need to worry about that okay i was gonna ping a grenade around that corner i'm just trying to make some noise to see if that guy will pick the door he's probably just waiting for us to pick up a short hallway and then it connects to sort of t junction goes left and right by the looks of it okay moving in you can loot those boxes on the right too yeah it does go left dead body there man he sounded like he was right next to us so i'm not gonna just yet there's a dead body there did you see it it steps behind us you hold that angle hold this one it's me sprinting i think he's below us on glass now he's next to me yeah i'm fighting him right now coming to you killed you dead are you good no no i killed him it's on the staircase to the right here okay wait that's where his audio was coming from it's weird isn't it uh it's very weird so uh yeah the vertical audio is basically non-existent yeah it sounds like it was right outside our doorway he has an mp40 and 10 dilemma if you need that i hear more steps above us yep coming to you on the angle that's the player for sure if you want to finish him sounds like he killed him he hit me ah he'll peel up i'm holding the angle yeah he dropped him wait i got him yeah yeah he's dead nice good job i mean of course i got him of course you got him because of your toggle i toggle everything i make the joke uh you know toggle sprint and your cheats of course toggle my cheeks this guy's got a radio backpack too you should take that ooh yes hell yeah uh you can search the ammo box here as well there's some ammo in there then if you need it um what are you using uh i'm currently using a a mat a what music i'm using a mat literally it's a matte 49 okay oh yeah this guy had one of those oh he had some luke man was he chunky fill up i'll watch for a sec oh my god this man is he is cracking out of his mind oh yeah he definitely plays fortnite so you can't put bags on bags like you said you can't put bags on bags there's not really like a meta to looting it's all just like there's no keybind to like send stuff over in an instant so it's like really awkward yeah oh did you hear that yeah i also probably need to heal a little bit more he's just outside this door did you get all the loot you needed off that guy yeah i'm assuming so just hold the angle for a sec i just want to see if there's anything else i'm gonna close the door okay wow that's loud yeah it is there's a torch on him that you can take if you want it i'm gonna load his gun too a what a torch a torch yeah so you can put that in the knife slot oh yeah what does that do press uh your knife key which should be like three or there you go there we go and now put your bring your weapon back out okay now it's applied to your belt oh look at that that's pretty cool like it's obvious to see you but it's kind of like the bf3 flashlight like it's kind of okay well i'll keep it on it's kind of distracting as the enemy to look but right obviously it's a huge light source and they can see it's coming from a mile off i mean do you only turn it on or off i don't know yet just killed someone well done maybe an ai you never really can tell um yeah just just take off all right all right i'll take it off the torch i mean um if there was a keyboard for it i tell you to keep it on and toggle it when you're about to get into a gunfight oh don't know how to go oh god oh god okay i can't turn it off where are you i think maybe i killed him i just drag it like into your inventory or on the ground okay uh oh i didn't kill him okay he's dead he's dead that's intense this game you don't know if you're fighting players alright real fast okay we've been shot oh have i been shot yeah yeah okay so you should notice now now that you've been hit already your maximum health bar has been reduced and there should be like a white on the bottom right there it shows your health uh let me get so basically i don't want to die sorry i should be fine clearly sorry steps to the left oh my god have i moved my pistol he's holding the horrible angle dead and if there's a second looks clear i'm not seeing anything yeah we're clear loom if you want doesn't really have much is this so this is an entrance to their ship i think this is ai uh no so the i don't know what you'd really call this place looks like a drop so it's a drop pod so you can like escape it's a pod so you can escape from this place without a ship essentially because that makes sense if a if we're in raid and someone stops running oh i see the white yeah and it's also in the bottom right as well sprinting steps we have 10 minutes left of oxygen that's the right time you hear these steps i hear above us yeah to the left directly above us i think this is players tiptoeing around us he's still in his pod room i'm just to your left taking cover behind a box okay um are we gonna do this come with me come with me hey there's a hard hat nine minutes of oxygen just heard of you in the corridor okay so they're directly above us right now i think they have some sort of balcony to look over okay i'm just gonna try and full send up the staircase yeah follow me i'm covering that left angle yeah uh yep who's trying oh they're they're engaged in hot combat is this where i killed that one guy yeah i can't jump over that's pain i'm just gonna fly around this corner and see if he's on the stairs another one below somewhere below you heard shots after that right i shot okay what's your name again and why is it not chat my name is i'm making a joke that you're basically chatting it up right now oh but you said chat like no i said chad chad as in you're uh you literally rounded that corner and just dropped a man there's another man give me a couple times he's all yours i can't really see him it's nao i think seems like he's got a higher advantage there's a guy down low in the middle somewhere maybe we could go left and get an angle he's coming towards me killed holy dude i should change my name to chad you really should i'm running out of ammo now so i'm trusting you to gun anyone down that gets in our way what kind of ammo do you need uh nine mil i have an svt um i have i have no nine mil at all it's okay it's okay i have an svt off this guy so i'll just drop this take that uh yeah i was trying to explain before you just stand in the corner um if you press tab your player on the left now should have like there should be like a white bar at the top of his head yeah that's the max health you can heal to now okay makes sense okay so we've got to get a move on that and we got to find our way back to our ship and we have six minutes so all right let's try and retrace our steps okay i feel like that's our best because i haven't found a key card on one of these guys yet just be ready to blast some ass like this guy my story spawned recently another guy upstairs this gun's horrible dropped him nice low us two on the staircase i think he's on the stairs lower right stairs left stairs left stairs i got one get ah you got him find the angle oh i see i see it he just can't peek over it i got him oh i don't got him i don't got him he's on the of you stairs him dropped him oh god i wasn't sure which one was you oh my god you're good you got a heel yeah yeah that hurt though okay okay let me search this guy quick do you have i've got a biscuit med yeah can i can eat your biscuit mat i'm gonna put it on this guy sounds good right but i put my i put my biscuit on that guy okay i'm munching on your biscuit um we have four minutes so we gotta be fast yeah i feel like we gotta get the hell out of here just try and follow me as best you can um i don't even know where i'm going but hey where did you go i'm back at where the bodies were listen for the voice matt [ __ ] you [ __ ] you oh god i don't mean so aggressive i don't mean it oh i'll whisper it instead oh you can whisper too yeah you should write f1234 you can say stuff i don't mean it matt [ __ ] oh this is it yeah this is where we started right this is it oh hello help please you have the card you open this gate you don't have your card you're the captain cause you're the host uh warning wrong airlock oh [ __ ] no it's this is what i mean it's so symmetrical okay i guess we're further right uh screw it i'm gonna try and tank this damage it's fine i didn't take any damage um yeah that was fine how the hell do we get out of here the map just looks the same everywhere you go yeah it doesn't really at all it doesn't have like any like defining features no try this door please uh no ships at this docks oh god we just have to believe i need to find the pods again wait dead body this might be it i think this might be this is it has to be this way come on we don't have time yes yes okay okay door's opening no need to panic [ __ ] you decompression i thought it was locking you out for a second do we get our oxygen back now no no that's that's the raid time oh so we have to get into the ship and then yeah yeah and get the hell out of here so even on the ship we don't have any oxygen no that doesn't you know i'm not gonna lie that doesn't seem very uh it's so confusing for a new player that it's just you get 25 minutes at the start of a match and when it says remaining oxygen that's how much time we have left before the match ends uh we're looking for a gate mat it should be like a yellow one yes direction i think is that a gate that looks like a gate that's it do we have do we have like afterburners we can uh punch it we cannot go any faster than this the speed of ass right now so like yeah this is the slowest ship in the game we've got it we've definitely got it you got it and all of a sudden another team like descends upon us yeah like you can't extract with the pods but uh so much faster oh did you just do it so you can try it we've got we've got time let's just go come on let's go let's go get off your shirt wanna lose my ship matt the drama no no no it's fine you always have the [ __ ] it's fine it's for the drama the viewers are going crazy down below right down below down below follow me follow the sound of my voice man [ __ ] you okay you're so aggressive get my own pods get in a pod i'm gonna escape on the viewers are panicking man this is what they signed up for this is why they subscribe this entire process is taking a minute gotta see this i've gotta show you this at least once okay now we're in the pod right yeah yeah so there's another ship off to our left now click to go faster left click and you'll fly towards it oh nice nice see you see the gate yeah yeah i see the gate okay we've got 40 seconds yeah yeah it's fine it's fine we'll make it all the time in the world just use your afterburners it's literally a clicking noise yeah it's fine just the countdown timer matt no need to be anxious 30 seconds you got it do i go in the hole just go in the hole matt go in the space vagina the devil's anus my characters my character by the end was dying yeah he was okay i was waiting he was holding his breath so maybe matt yeah he kills you too oh it slowly kills you whilst great like as as we run out of oxygen unless it's just there to scare you it's probably just there to scare you okay all right i got to level three that game oh i got four kills somehow nice yeah gaming don't tell me how many kills you got it's gonna make me feel uh inadequate does it does it tell you yeah so it'll say my marauder if it's a player and it will say raider if it's oh oh i got one marauder then there you go okay he's gaming so what do i do with the captain's key card do i do anything with that in particular uh sell it you sell it now that you've got loot on your player you drag that off into your inventory and then either craft or sell right now i wouldn't care about loot if i were you so okay so i just need to sell i mean regardless of that being mostly ai like that was a really good run yeah that was good that was fun hell yeah that was awesome [Music] you
