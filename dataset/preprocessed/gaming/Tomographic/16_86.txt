wow how is this game five years old i don't get it there's games that are releasing today triple a titles it don't look anywhere near this good oh my god it looks so good without the hud on doesn't it i might need to do a cinematic intro for this video i think it needs to be done nice we have taken objective george oh baby that looks nice welcome back to battlefield one we have taken the footprints in the snow that's so good all right i better turn the hard back on otherwise i'm just going to spend this entire play session fawning over over how good this game looks i mean even with the hud it's pretty minimalistic but once you take that away it's so immersive but i have the best sniper for this sort of range got a nice hit there though this is the martini henry my favorite gun from battlefield one there we go that's a nice kill to start the round there it takes a bit of skill to use this gun because it actually is a one shot kill within 30 to 80 meters anything under or past that won't be a one shot kill so there's a sweet spot range for it which is really cool good shot teammate okay oh my god that was sick i actually probably had a decent survival right there because he got set on fire and then immediately put out by the water that's good oh baby love that sound oh i didn't mean to bring up my mini math what the hell was that got killed by the mass torpedo boat i think i hit a mouse button on my mouse by mistake it was an awkward way of explaining that wasn't it so why battlefield 1 i hear you ask well be quite honest warzone is very boring right now i'm waiting until season five for any new exciting stuff the guys there let's see if we can land a head shot this is the sweet spot range there it is love that can i get the other one uh yeah but also uh battlefield one is currently free to play if you have a amazon prime account i think if you link it to your twitch account on prime gaming you can get a code for the game for free so yeah there's a fresh wave of new players playing the game for the first time all that grenade were oh wow we actually held it surprised let's finish capturing earth any more enemies in the vicinity yes there is and i'm dead but he's dead too that's all that matters can i get a res from that medic come on kanos incoming medics yes he's accepted the res i'm back in the fight we have taken objection let's uh say thank you i dropped me nice little med pack as well what a guy the best part about battlefield 1 for me is that you always feel like a small part of a larger war this doesn't feel like your typical multiplayer game you can tell they really worked hard on this one the f5 never really hit the same oh it's got on the right hand side is that uh look at these lmg boys they do love to go prone with their bipods don't they the uh the atmosphere and the sound design is just unbeaten in a battlefield game today i think imagine if i just know skip the pilot should be using my uh my cable it's actually because i do more damage don't i it's not the plane i'm aiming for though there's a big old fight around the d flag there's steps there's one oh no save me wooden post yes this game is like a movie the atmosphere is so good oh my god just save that teammate's life and me here for 20. see that's outside of the sweet sport range i need to move up a bit i think let's go on this right flank see what awaits us i was already a teammate over there oh he died yikes oh we're gaming i just oh hello run into my arms that guy's dead now i think there's dynamic clouds in this game it's going really dark all of a sudden let's be careful here oh yeah that's a lot of enemies have that come on just gotta be prepared to whip out a pistol when need be what we're gonna get a knife to the back mate oh no i'm dead to risk oh medic i love this guy i love this guy what a legend oh crap we need to clear them around d they've just held this point for so long now if we can keep spawning here it'll be great opportunity to push the uh the rest of the islands oh there's a nasty flick shot nasty i really like snow maps in games especially battlefield games because they've just done so well there's a guy oh how was that a mess get back here where the hell did you go is he dead i don't know it's not the same guy but we'll take him out all the same our team of captured d as well sick good work boys the lead is in our favor oh that was weird what are we shooting now that's some snipers causing you trouble i guess one that's two what the that hell a crazy shot i can't see anyone else from here i think it's time we cross over really is a beautiful looking map isn't it it's not even a map because this is depicted on uh the estonian archipelago my memory serves me correct oh we interrupt this history lesson to bring you a devastating head shot from across the map so many angles here what's that guy doing oh my god did you see how many sniper clips there were then on this roof in the water what the hell oh my god this is crazy this is crazy 11 hp come on see if we can clear out the rest of them oh just in time jesus second i pull the trigger i got killed from the other side they're all hiding down here have that oh teammate just saved my life thank you so much i will never forget it where the hell did this guy go is that the same guy we are losing objectives i do not know i do not know why i am fringe now i'm gonna stop before i offend somebody my terrible friend jackson come on i can hit this guy yeah there it is there it is oh it was a big explosion i keep wanting to throw grenades but i don't have any nice i think that's everyone on point yeah we're getting e now they're trying to take d from us not gonna let it happen oh okay you can have the i don't want it anyway freaking gas grenades are everywhere dude come on team we're absolutely dominating the enemy here so taken out by that strafe yeah i think that's everyone now that's everyone this is a massacre back to history lessons with tom just looked up on my phone and this map albion depicts the german occupation of the western estonian archipelago so it was right in 1917 i believe it's actually quite hard to it's an arm ahead to give a history lesson amidst gunfire who would have thought somehow we're making it work all right let's try and take this next set of islands shall we let's try and cross over here i need to get a bit wet that's a nice detail just notice that my soldier lifted up his rifle as he entered the water there it's really cool i think there's a mechanic in bf5 as well whereas as you enter the water if the water's over your knee height then your soldier will start lifting his legs up frantically which is really funny very accurate though much like this martini henry it's all about finding that sweet spot range it's so immersive though this game the only thing holding it back is the hud obviously it's quite arcadey so it needs to be there i'll hit that guy i need to take that that's an enemy hit this counts as kill nice do my best to clear it oh how was that not a head shot i need to figure out this lead come on with one of these guys there we go what the hell i'm missing by millimeters there it is that took so long i'm just glad he didn't know where he's getting shot from switch to k bullets do more damage to armor let's go up there all right i need ammo so gotta be careful try and help my squad mate over here if i can no it's our first death in a while on the plus side at least we spawn with ammo oh we just moved suppression assist take that at least lost objective butter uh oh did our team not capture c i've got to do everything myself come on boys we're doing well earlier we have a solid lead we're definitely gonna get the win i think but [Music] there we go let's try and take d back and uh should be enough to win the war or at least this battle we'll win the battle but not the war but that guy's miles away okay i'm trying to snipe there's no way i'm out sniping this guy 986 tickets we're so close now come on get a flare up oh my god that plane oh my god the pilot oh they're swim over well i can land this shot how was that miss it's not from elsewhere as well oh and it's over oh my god what a game what a game i'm not sure how i missed so many shots on that guy but we won it 1 000 tickets to 868. we're starting to lose that in the end so it's a good job we won it when we did but 39 kills eight deaths we'll take that that's pretty good for a scout a martini henry served as well the perfect choice of weapon for those ranges that's going to do it for today's video though guys i hope you enjoyed it leave a like if you did subscribe for more and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music] you
