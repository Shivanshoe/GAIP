hello my friends and fellow gamers welcome to far cry 6. had a lot of love on the first video that i posted on this game i heard your cries for more far cry so here we are welcome so we're going to be playing through at least the opening of this game for a couple of hours see what it's all about my first impressions your first impressions but hello hello to everybody in the chat and anyone tuning in if this is a vod afterwards um yeah welcome we're gonna just crack on i'm gonna start a new game because uh i played a little bit just to get my settings right and stuff action mode that's what we want isn't it there's no like there's no easy normal hard or extreme in this game it's uh action mode and that's it so that's what we're going with it's the classic far cry experience at least i bet exactly hayden yeah i wanted to get this out now because it's going to be a busy week this will be a chill one because i've i gotta get up early tomorrow for you know what yara is an island in the heart of the caribbean in 1967 a guerrilla revolution led to a crippling blockade frozen in time for 47 years the island collapsed into poverty until a new leader was elected with a cure to rebuild paradise el presidente of yara anton castillo there we go played by giancarlo esposito for too long our country was stolen by politicians but you elected a vision a cure a road to paradise viviro created by our own brilliant scientists the most effective treatment for cancer the world has ever seen grown within our precious tobacco modified with the purest fertilizer viviro is the key to rebuild paradise but our paradise comes at a cost this our enemies will never understand yara did not elect me to do what's easy but to do what's right and so with renewed focus i must extend the draft to paradise classic villain talk isn't it from across our island chosen to produce enough viviro to heal the world and save our country these lucky yarans will be chosen by random lottery of course i've watched breaking bad it's not my favorite show turn you think the draft is only taking through yaddas is the outcast the poor orphans like us he's bringing slavery back from the dead in yada you can't run from this hang on you ditched us run out to the jungle with a bunch of guerrillas libertad now you're back here to recruit for clara garcia's local crusade come on this is our big goodbye danny [ __ ] say something that was awkward he said say something and i was just really quiet i'm gonna go with so you can choose between male and female here from what i already played when i had early access no offense to the male the male uh voice actor but i think the voice act of the female is way more compelling in what she says the message is better received i think they got my name wrong danny you could help libertad you're trained it would have been korean military if you weren't such a fuck-off just come with us lita hi you never [ __ ] listen danny hey time to go both waiting drinks in mako dinner in miami well she's kind of cute [ __ ] blackouts too big for a black off [ __ ] packing oh yeah do you know what's going on knock me out oh god jesus that's loud let's return the game volume down just a little bit uh mr centu thank you very much for the 4.99 euros i think yeah euros i appreciate that dude yeah i'm gonna be playing battlefield tomorrow you're gonna see maybe a couple of videos and a live stream as soon as i can start because i think it's like 8 a.m for me so [Music] yeah early one but um we'll play this for a couple hours have some fun stay close later do some more far cry streams when i can as well hope the volume's okay guys let me know miss valentina as well finally caught a live stream after telling me she's missed all three that i've done so far [Music] there's nobody here control the crouch i'm a sea to crouch kind of gamer watch the detection me and stay out of sight okay classic far cry stuff that'll buff out exactly who opens the door is daniel a bullet wound it's fine oh no you see me you didn't actually see me right that was so fast what would you want me to do you don't seem panicked oh you've just got to die that's great god did you see him like snap to me that's a great start oh man he's got bad eyes out man one tap as well that's good can i not sprint straight away i don't think so far cry ai is usually pretty yeah they're not the smartest this might be your first stream that you've seen on youtube of mine at least um yeah i streamed on twitch for a while but i wanted to mix it up and especially with these let's plays it makes more sense to stream directly to my core audience and i think most of you guys appreciate that as well because it means that everything's in one place thanks for tuning in appreciate your support it's been fun man it's a nice way nice uh nice change what's going on here okay i'm not resisting i'm not resisting hey i'm james sorry mate no weapons for me still can't sprint oh the tank reversing no the tank was not reversing the turret was just backwards doesn't see me has it i can peek apparently that's nice okay i'm going i'm going across that square please let when can i sprint yeah this is the tutorial level we just started cypher we literally just press play i keep getting spotted so easily yeah i was wrong about this side one difficulty here we go we can sprint oh god they're everywhere into the sewers where the [ __ ] are you taking me it's charlie day down here from always sunny in philadelphia loves himself so doesn't he guess we're going up this is so [ __ ] they're looking down this game co-op it is indeed yeah you can play co-op after a certain point after the opening i believe i don't like that thanks game yeah said this was going to be a chill chill stream and you're already here with the jump scares okay i'll get it i'll keep i'll keep moving we're just going to sprint through this yeah i would agree for me the the lighting is the one thing that makes this game i don't know like not so much blood look as good as it possibly could because the character models are all really nice but like i think they just look a bit flat i don't know about but that's just because it's dark right now good i've seen a lot of people say that you know maybe it doesn't look as good as a lot of games but you gotta remember this open world as well right like [Music] so the game isn't out yet it's out on october 7th um so thank you to ubisoft for giving me an early code [ __ ] i'm allowed to play up to a certain point and then uh we'll continue the the play through um when the game releases oh my god it was not stable to run on sorry ladies guess i'm going this way i wasn't here no i definitely made my presence in what just the um the lighting i guess because the game the textures and everything are great i guess people just can't look past uh oh god [ __ ] it's funny if you have like lens flare in a game that blinds the player it's funny because uh everyone just seems to think that's what good graphics is lens flare equals good graphics wow look how beautiful this game is lens flare for you gotta go we gotta go oh no no no hey what's up david keep moving we're almost there let's get to that boat i think it looks quite nice do you have any idea what these are worth let us do oh yeah marco always making new friends danny you're late where's alejo he gave up his ticket for his family [ __ ] alejo's not going anywhere anymore come on let them on good man get on this boxing gown [Music] oh lovely someone gets seasick don't worry about it here that's all i've got this isn't right bunny we should be fighting not running to the young geese alejo gave you a [ __ ] gift lyda we survived same as the orphanage same as the academy please well this is intense junk hollow is that you oh boy before he was el presidente me papa love to fish we would go out on a boat just like this and we would catch the fish and then release them he would say it's not always about your stomach it's about the challenge except when he caught a big fat juicy marlin he was too proud to let that fish go sit down a very big fish today what the hell haven't i diego now it's time to bring you home i don't want this anymore papa we have no choice let them go they can work make vivid truth or lies truth they could be good workers always been so manipulated they could help rebuild paradise but if you wanted them to live you would have never set foot on his [ __ ] boat 13 years old and diego has such compassion for his people these fish we will catch a release why is there subtitles when they speak english isn't hard to understand them at all uh it's just for for anyone who wants to follow the story if i happen to talk over them at any point by accident holy one opening jesus yeah you're probably not used to this uh val it's uh i think it's the quality more than anything right 40 40p any youtube stream it's unheard of on twitch yeah see another thing is that the cutscenes in this game are all rendered in engine so like transitions you from gameplay from cutscene to gameplay and vice versa this is all my fault my phone forget it my phone this is the beach danny it's [ __ ] fake what she's hiding here lara libertad julio [ __ ] call you it's all here take my phone follow the code like when we were kids stop it just wait i'll find hell no you give her this glad i will help you don't you get it you're the lucky one danny you're the lucky one oh that's the look of vengeance isn't it that in his leg [Music] yeah careful with the spam owen uh to answer your question uh ubisoft provided me with an early key for the game um i'm allowed to shop to a certain point and then we'll continue the let's play from there see this is what i mean lens flare i should look for supplies and get the [ __ ] out of here this uh heavily reminds me of was it dead island the zombie game you guys remember that see that looks beautiful and i don't even have the high hey was it the hd texture pack installed there's an option to do it but like i mean the game looks [ __ ] totally fine anyway i guess if you've got like a killer system you could uh need to find that camp it's a chicken that's a chicken nice you could uh yeah you could download that texture pack but it's like 16 gigabytes or something on top of the main game so i mean this looks pretty damn good to me so no complaints want some fps you know collect parts raphael take the spray paint and mark the trails your markers will guide us safely through the countryside towards our caches and away from patrols blue is the true color of our flag not that rag castillo uses clara your family would probably never know what happened to you i mean i could tell them okay oh shooting better stay quiet careful it on your um just sweat it's this think of a traitor all rotten on the inside how did i know you were scavenging for liberta i smelled it on you that's why you died oh yeah that's the stealth way carry body i don't want to do that collect what's this would be useful oh yeah uh what is it tab yes so there's a gear stats in this game that applies to clothing slightly improved sidear sidearm ammo reserve that's what these pants do you can see there's like loads of different loads of different clothing options as you go into the game and get like flame resistant outfits or i can't really read any stats here but lots of stuff to flesh out your character as you get deeper into the game another thing is weird i don't know if it's i don't think well maybe this is the first game but you used to skin the animals when you killed them there's an animation for it but it has since been removed in this game maybe peter was on their case since i used one of these they were like stop skinning animals so now when you run over them you just get the hideo or whatever the meat doesn't want visitors okay oh cutscene time is it gonna show your face before you shoot me i'm danny a friend of lita um let me dub that for you shut up there you go some reason the character dialogue didn't play there you are the only survivor clara garcia answer me i said are you the only survivor see lucky need to know the risks that's all you have to say you're here that's what matters just a second hermana i'm getting the hell out of yara well you're in my camp i need a place to stay a few days libertas no charity hermana lita said you'd help lita also said you weren't a [ __ ] she got moves you're an orphan see funny how friends can be closer than family remember danny castillo has kept you an orphan why do you want to run i watch castillo order a whole boat of our people shot to death get as far away as you can from that psychopath all of you when tyranny is law revolution is order quoting oliver won't save you it's pedro albiso i'm gonna save yara with library cards i have a list free elections free expression free the outcasts ayat free of castillos simple simple castillo's got what three hundred thousand troops i count six burned out geria's and you with a bullet to the leg you don't believe me i'll show you cheeky far cry stream indeed or video if you're watching back from our basement on this island was a basic operation of tobacco plantation snatch some fuel and go home but castillo's forces were waiting got us down from 60 to six you need to get back to your base yes but this island is surrounded by a blockade we don't have boats we don't have much gear and we are not leaving until that viviro plantation goes up in smoke but we are guerrillas we know this land inside out you're already familiar with argeria paths they were built by the legends in 67 they're spread like a web across all of yara now they're ours guerrilla pastor go to ambush soldados or to hide if the army is on your back they have caches that will help you survive and all of this is legit this map is old as hell made for tourists yeah it's out of date but you got the regions municipalities and landmarks of yara you'll get used to it now i need to call in some favors with the locals to get us a boat and you need to go find me juan cortes who someone who can make one guerrilla fight like a thousand 1440p 60 you know it um what kind of race racing features does the game have is it lighting reflections or shadows a little mix of everything it is a mix for everything yeah there's a bunch of options you can toggle i'll give you food a bed even a goddamn boat to sail to the yankees but it's gonna cost you bullets and blood you can shoot so shoot pay your rent she said sweet as the cutscene comes to an end the dialogue sort of fades out um what else do i see there we'd be streaming 20 43 tomorrow why is everyone saying 43. i've seen that a few times you realize the game is called 2042 right chat but yes um i'll have a video up as soon as possible and then maybe an hour or two later i'll do a live stream of the game squad up with some of my friends most likely uh or else yeah it's fun it's it's familiar fun you know i enjoy far cry series i don't know i don't know how much depth there is to the game yet i know there's some new features like supremos and the uh the resolver weapons are really interesting but i i mean i like the series more of the same is all like i'd really ask for with a game like this to be honest and they at least adding new things this archipelago with a man named juan cortese he helped me build libertad from the dirt juan's a spymaster from the pre-castillo days can build an icbm from a goddamn ice cube tray pulled off ops for espinosa the kgb then flipped to the cia and mossad for fun juan is my mentor he's also unstable and an alcoholic when she'd went south he was so

accept and try it's an interesting way to uh interact with the characters though i think because the animations are never that you know flawless when you're watching someone in third person like this but it's good to get like a more intimate um you know it's like an intimate conversation with them the animations are much better in that little instance they put you in you keeping up guapo where's

get hurt so kind of this guy wow there is a lot of bullet drop when you got the suppressor on the game is right i back down you saw there as well the suppressor overheats see that and then you eventually like kind of break it you can see it splits and uh it's no longer suppressed it's actually an accurate mechanic like suppressors can't last as long as they do in all these games we play who spotted me i'm confused there's someone over here you can see on the map i don't know uh i need to capture this i need to blow up the sign don't i yeah have that whoa badass slow-mo that's cool first

happy most important thing if you didn't know is family and i i'm so sorry the game is now making me feel guilty for killing an enemy this happens so irregularly irregularly i didn't even get my money back i just killed them use your phone to scout out enemy soldiers and see their weaknesses it's a workbench giving you his right door for the right job talk yeah he loves that talk use your phone camera to scout location attack soldiers tagging soldiers will reveal their weakness use the workbench to build and install different ammo for your weapons it'll be that yeah ruined family it's been tarnished uh t phone no x phone zoom in oh i just dropped off a care package but i won that i won that game why are you dropping that in a campaign mission armor-piercing rounds we've got a heavy gunner i mean there's the officer in charge soft target rounds okay careful danny he's higher rank in castillo's army that means he's better trained quicker with the trigger and a tough [ __ ] turn the ui off take pictures hey beautiful my finest my finest photograph yet how do i put this away again x there we go this fort is the most protected base on the island these soldiers have been issued with body armor and helmets okay nothing armor piecing rounds can't handle ah you know me too i will i want to put some armor piercing rounds on that sniper i got not muzzle socket ammo socket oh i don't have gun powder damn it okay i guess i'm gonna have to snipe with my that parachute i gave you could come in handy here just like i'll drop into the middle of the fort okay that sounds way more fun but i get it hey stone if you're watching take tips man you can pull shoots you pull your shoot in this game and many games that will not be named sheesh i can climb these vines if you didn't know now you know that's a grapple she made the hook sound for me they wouldn't let me drop in the middle did you see how much like how much i sank after i took off that's what happens carlos is dead because he ignored my orders do not go out alone especially after dark the gorillas own the night next letter i write to you let the bit a little bit meet more zeep he's talking right now i can go that way can i go this way [Applause] inside search zone oh that would have been a perfect shot uranium is inside little stealthy takedown [Applause] lovely ammo it's unmaxed yeah i'm maxed hey guapo you can help out in a sec dude i just want to try and get a takedown assassination right in the neck disable alarm just in case you can shoot the alarms i did not know that now okay we've got two here and the guard at the gate still with a helmet rounds were successful that was pretty clean [Music] i literally turned that guy's head into a fountain didn't i yeah that's crazy it's just crazy like sliding down these staircases because there's another that's what i thought me can i save you nope you're definitely dead okay uh or next through here need a key what a key be that looks like a key i'll i'll read those for anyone that wants to look through myself you can pause in a youtube live stream if you didn't know if you're interested in that stuff we'll keep the play through moving forward i do take a quick glance at least speed reader if i take the time to read it aloud then it takes me longer okay we're in collect and this is the main objective by the uranium you didn't [ __ ] tell me i was stealing uranium it was supposed to be a surprise now bring it back to me what if this [ __ ] kills me is depleted uranium danny stop being such a [ __ ] guapo [Applause] can i go through it let's check this out shall we a little bit of exploration oh yeah that care package is marked for us nice is it just one level of membership on youtube i mean you can set up multiple but i've just set up one um i might add more benefits later down the line because i'm so new to it i wanted to at least have one ready so uh i was locked there's some wood over here can i break that yeah it's like that first um first door i smashed down when i started that's got a crocodile on it see that the auto crap pistol okay i look pretty cool pimped out as hell look at it oh yeah the velocity on that thing is insane sheesh improves aimed weapon damage improves body shot weapon damage that's cool i like with some of these oh there's a unique pistol is it all right well anyone that plays through the game themself if you didn't know now you know you can come down here and uh oh i'm climbing this ladder wouldn't make more sense to jump a little bit faster that's for sure uh there's a nice little pistol there a tidy gun indeed even tactical scottish the water looks quite nice in this game doesn't it there's an enemy there the fish is jumping out of the water so there's something i learned in the co-op is if you if you quickly slide at your enemy like that you can knock them off their feet it's just useful when you might you know it doesn't take them it's not immediate when they uh spot you if that makes sense if you're not not into their feet first they kind of get stunned so you don't get spotted immediately but it's obviously benefits you to be in close proximity to do that you're not going to be able to slide tackle from 100 meters away i want to west these mods are you i thought you would have been one attack one of lucky's mods what are the scottish and the tactical britain i'll get along where am i going by the way i'm confused oh just a mere 1180 meters away where is that oh that's my camp i can just fast travel sick oh i just forgot about the care package oh you bomb head you bum-head tomographic that care package that dropped in has been left behind i'm a little nappier oh damn it that's annoyed me you get good stuff from those depleted uranium soviets left these sexy byproducts of nuclear enrichment behind in the 80s yankees use it for tank armor and bullets crazy [ __ ] nice robots you'll be a [ __ ] superhero danny lita and i used to sneak these into the orphanage essential reading while waiting to [ __ ] up convoys in the mud hege must be a sponge for inspiration okay what the hell is this this is yeah it is we're finally getting our first premo i think this is the rocket launcher one it's like a rocket launcher yeah that answers my question she does that too one more thing i want you to meet tostador the two go together like fire and fury i like a resolver so do i i do like sandwiches right let's oh it's already equipped that's the flamethrower then here's the other resolver weapons you can get we'll see some of these later they're super interesting this is the nail gun one right yeah i think so yeah you can see the nails there can't wait to get some of these i haven't seen a lot of them that's the mini gun did not see that last time so these are all like handcrafted so like you can see that's like a an engine of some sort of motorbike engine i think the flamethrower one's part of a motorbike isn't it yeah loads of cool stuff that looks sweet that's hardly a resolve weapon it's just an old weapon there's loads loads of new ones i haven't seen before that's the cd gun that plays music while you kill people a sword offshore yes but i'm talking about layers then head to the workbench yeah it's a motorbike engine okay now what we're making these aren't just simple let's take a look at that supremo oh i cut him off if i click too soon do i the special ingredient that makes this all happen is supremo bond you need it to make your gadgets pick a gadget danny this is a safe space there's no wrong answer here okay perception grenade attacks nearby enemies dynamite explosive grenade throw a knife smoke grenade it's gotta be the thrower to give that knives a workout all right all right all right where's clara exactly slow motion running i heard you but open the cue hold weapon wheel and select the gadget throw the gadget equipped i'm glad i got thrown knives so early i thought i'd have to wait forever to get those just wondering what that is on the uh that was this i've unlocked a watch it seems um new top what's that give me slightly improved soft target blast and arm appears in defense okay so i take more damage some new boots improves move speed while reloading okay does watch give me anything keeps on ticking greatly improves general defense while sprinting so again i take more damage it's a cool system got guapo already but there's a few tricks that we've seen cheats you're on we've seen don't know who boom boom is or a lusso looks like some sort of cat though up there very close objective you're here i don't need to tell you that viviro is a lifeblood of castillo's regime yeah plan on pc johnny comes to produce it all over yara these plantations use outcasts as slaves to grow the tobacco plants they turn into veviro these are our people danny beaten tortured sprayed by poison chemicals there's a camp on this island we tried to destroy it when we invaded we failed now we're going to finish the job waiting for you at a nearby barn julio is that the guy that doesn't like me he's got a problem ah julio this is things get too cool with the soldados just pull the trigger but one tiny tiny thing you should know uh-huh the supremes are in an experimental face they need time to breathe after you use them you know so they don't overload and kill you could have told me before i strapped onto my back you're fine of the blood of your enemies what you'll get it danny mental juan you're an absolute mentalist i love it it's not an enemy no what is that another mission hey come here i see this guy everywhere we found a sacred site dedicated to triada there's treasure in there but it's guarded by spirits just gives me a little side quest does he any part of that [ __ ] that's firm i wish you luck yeah yeah all right thank you i like that they give you the objective quickly you know i can just parachute there i want the wingsu though it's my favorite what beautiful i inspect my weapon while i'm going no watch out for the trees gucci how am i playing now so i've been given early access to the game um i'm not entirely sure how to pronounce your name but yeah ubisoft gave me uh an early code i'm allowed to show up to a certain point and then we'll continue the play through in another episode i mean technically you can sly cancel as long as you get that sprint i think you run out of stamina or anything so yeah you actually showed up it's this guy listen i'm not going to [ __ ] you i wanted to do this alone but clara gave me an order i can handle myself don't give a [ __ ] so could lita she should be here right now but instead i get you and i'm supposed to be in miami but instead my two best friends are dead and i'm stuck here with you so truce enough talk step one we hit the tobacco step two we destroy their poison supply step three we get the [ __ ] out of there and castillo gets a nice pretty message from liberta great take this gear it'll protect you from fire and more importantly castillo's [ __ ] poison now this is the dmr 14 not the m1 grand but i mean yeah they have they have similarities for sure fuego mitch he's given me so this will give me when did that get put on me a hazmat mask i guess that's what i need for this next mission so these are flame retardant gloves when on fire the flames are automatically put out that sounds great using the right protective gear in the right situation and keeps you alive yeah right tool for the right job i've been hearing that a lot lately classic juan nice did i equip everything i need yeah onwards listen julio lito was like a sister to me she shouldn't have been on that [ __ ] boat she died because of you no anton castillo killed if i could change anything it would be me dying on that beach lita was a better person than i could ever be and if she loved you well that just says a lot about who you are enough look if you and i are going to do this you need to know about the poison you mean that [ __ ] they spray on the leaves it's real name is pg-240 but we call it the poison because it [ __ ] up your system try not to breathe it or get [ __ ] sorry mate sorry's interrupt i just couldn't resist i like loot okay there might be some good loot come on all right no good lu okay his real name is pg240 right we call it the poison oh do you call it that because it's your system try not to breathe it or get it on your skin it can make you crazy crazy you're sick like deep so i'm saying i'm sick and if that doesn't get you the cancer that grows inside you will oh god so you're military marksman what's your thing i'm good with guns we get along so you need to know thinking that gear i gave you was good for fire and poison but there is no gear that fits their style no matter the situation or they get themselves killed this is hilarious right behind you okay let's see what we're up against do i have uh was it gunpowder yet i do i want to put the poison rounds i want armor piercing on my sniper just makes sense doesn't it and let's check if i can put a scope on i can actually a good scope oh my god if i had gunpowder i could have got a better scope look there are some pretty like you know military-grade scopes by the looks of it it's not all just resolver stuff so that's cool you can find stuff as well up here let's go see the vegiro tobacco and the yellow poison tanks see yes punch holes in the tanks to let the poison out into the air fun fact poison and fire make a hell of a mix big boom same idea with the fumigators they're hard to kill but they can't take the heat that's a fema guy you've got a flamethrower you've got that supremo time to [ __ ] up all this viewer [ __ ] you know lita and i had a ritual psych us up before battle a song please don't sing deliver that foreign where's my sniper oh okay well i mean before we do that i'm obviously gonna switch this out i'm obviously going to pick that guy off from the tower aren't i i mean come on this makes sense not the best scope for this but i still got the perfect amount of bullet drop because i'm a badass absolute badass that's how we say badass in the uk right chat someone spot me equip the flamethrower i'm not sure we need the flamethrower straight away go go go yeah i'm going i want to take this guy out he's one of the fumigators you said awkward thing is i no longer suppressor on my that's a city that was a pretty sick take down animation cannot lie try stuff kill this guy as well well so much for stealth killing guys that's a doggo don't look is it dead oh god it's still alive oh god oh god i don't want to look you just behave dog like i don't need to kill you uh [Music] did you set the alarm off i don't want to kill him [Music] you've got to be kidding me i don't see any other enemies around so who set that off you [Music] [Applause] oh there wasn't another another enemy you're telling me you're not gonna die from that [Music] we going to do yeah what are you going to do now run away be free dog i hate killing dogs in this damn game but yeah run away oh screw it is he dead yet how is he just surviving all these 50 cal shots he's built like an absolute brick yeah run he's armor-piercing rounds apparently it's not good enough for a doggo i like gasoline all right let's burn these down hope this song isn't dmca [Music] i can't clear the area until you kill him the game's like there's still enemies in this area they just must burn on its own i think so cause i'm gonna start the line [Music] nice yes spreading nicely [Music] what's that someone's about to spot me [Music] exploded but the dog's back looks like he wants to die slight tackle kill i could swear i hear music oh you hear that too it's crazy complete your collection of songs okay reinforcements are coming rocket launcher time i've actually killed one of those mary jane who's old enough to remember that [Music] far cry 3 was like had a massive sale on ubisoft uh on you play loaded games dude [Music] [Applause] [Music] catchy [Music] more of them keep coming [Music] get away from it [Music] uh this needs to be satellite 56 percent of the way there if you look in the top left [Music] i wonder if i can just like i can't do my supremo yet [Music] oh [Music] yeah it works this one's completely done [Music] pulled up another vehicle look a fun mission what's up boys this civilian is still running around spent all year planting these crops i've got plenty more to uh oh no oh no [Music] does that just blow up or no just leaks how do i get yep definitely blows up so much to kill yeah they were just standing there they took forever to get out of the vehicle [Music] 80 percent this one that was flamethrower [Music] that does work i wish i've known 91 any other explosive barrels around is that just going to do its thing recall is recall this i mean there's a lot of recall if you full auto i'm first firing for the most part actually no you're right it's all visual recoil i don't have to pull down my jaw control is always more difficult to control recoil though and there are guns with higher recoil trays so [Music] daniel van der waal thank you very much for the 19 euros and 99 99 [Music] have i just forgotten what the smaller variant of euros are am i okay i've just gone blank thank you we're done julio i'm coming and i'm bringing a tractor yeah it sense okay i didn't want to say sense i was like [Music] why do i not want to say this with a flamethrower that was fun i enjoyed that mission i really hope this song isn't dmca though otherwise i'm sure it's part of what makes the mission good though so if this gets demonetized so be it leave a like for the algorithm guys it's needed better get any cool stuff from that uh yeah i probably should just turn the music down a bit huh there we go i got a bunch of suppressors and i can put these scopes on now eight times scope um what's the difference between these two costs the same enables hold breath enables hold breath i don't know the difference i'm gonna put this one on oh that's good i'm happy with my purchase i actually need to talk to him huh [ __ ] you really can't hold your own i don't want to say i told you so look at my dance moves we should move that was a hell of a light show and they're going to see the smoke we work well together see listen if you are good with litha you're good with me turn off visual hit markers please uh i mean i could it is an option i don't remember if hit markers were in previous five chord games i don't mind them being on god i can't go through there if everyone wants them off i can do that it's just a nice little visual feedback for anyone that trying to guess whether i've landed my shots or not makes me look better you know actually let's face it probably makes me look worse uh where's my next objective some sort of compound here there's one guard outside we've got a phone i hope you can see the smoke from where you are you struck a blow against castile today wasn't too rough on you right in the head but okay i think lita would be smiling right now danny there's someone i want you to meet his name is benito he's a local fisherman which means votes for libertad he lives on the east side of gaza school always got time to make new friends you're building bridges for me it's your gift we need benito talk to him where did my horse go chat it's some early preview yeah it's an early preview celestial ubisoft gave me early access to the game as well as a bunch of other content creators but um i'm playing up to a certain point and then uh yeah we'll uh resume it probably after all of the battlefield stuff because i want to see how the story pans out and the far cry stories aren't always too long i want to see how this compares because giancarlo esposito is just like he's such a good actor isn't he he makes a great villain it's hard not to see him as gus fring but um yeah i'm interested to see how this story pans out to be honest uh what i didn't get is a suppressor i want to see if i'm able to do that as well no i need more gunpowder and more recycled whatever the hell that was eating customized vehicles and stuff it's really cool you're okay how far away is that cannot fast travel there but we are tracking it it's a military checkpoint i like traveling on horse though it's cool yeah billboards he's probably horsing around wow what the hell was that oh don't worry siri i'll help that was a flashbang get me off my horse jesus those are more who are we shooting at not the horse you mentalist is she tea bagging oh it's a hostage she's probably trying to get my attention i got you you're welcome no no no she killed someone and was just teabagging them like your horse though does it like me is the question yeah don't worry i'm a friend come on all right bye gang there's another that works love this it's great what's that just like the other lady all right all right be nice horse that dog's got speed hacks i swear we're friends now we're friends it's getting dark sun's getting real low [Music] go marching in she's humming something completely different see right holy [ __ ] is that king shark every day you've seen uh who's seen any suicide suicide squad maybe he's gonna accept this need to secure gasolina for benito and his fishes inspecting a military site okay you want me to steal one i'm doing that since i was a for one i'll kid a friend bring it right to you gracias but you don't have any friends one just shut up and call for a car danny what's going to be in here there's a car in there i refuse to be refused to believe that i think this is the car i just gave me actually so press r to call for a vehicle if i click rides that's good to know do the same with horses too but i'll just put why would i want that on my dashboard i don't want that on my dashboard it's gonna get in the way front bumper nice do some damage of that keep that call your ride using cue i can do it that way as well nice away from me i'm tempted i'm really tempted i can't i can't do it to him can i okay no i didn't work as if you've caught a shark credit to you man uh 800 meters away and a thousand meters away assassinate commandante butchered the name she's inspecting a military site and okay fuel revolution i think um fast travel there what's this one then we'll go here let me just check that i'm allowed to do this but [Music] got earlier [Music] [Music] how deep can i go yeah i can go on for a bit longer all right whistle for the horse uh let's grab a ride this is my car some loot here yeah i'm coming some wisdom munitions bracelet what's that one do require additional sidearm ammo i like the i like the flame ones hey what's up manuel [Music] turn stereo on off [Music] it's not working oh doing backslash use my weapon in here too [Music] that's it just got this thing on my back you're getting weapon no how is it so far it's pretty good fun 2k yeah familiar fun you know i mean new location far cry some sort of key here some new abilities with the supreme backpacks and all that sort of stuff but haven't been able to explore much of the free roam yet and there's apparently a lot of fun alternate activities you can do one remaining kid in read out in time i didn't even grab it or something else still there oh okay i need to find those before i can unlock the chest it's an enemy on horseback two enemies on horseback oh my gosh if i missed oh that looks so funny when they're highlighted i prefer the horse honestly like i prefer the horse over a car uh that's my objective better off-road who'd have thought can i get up here yeah like crazy frog exactly and better trained the chest is somewhere there watch yourself the military is much stronger better equipped and better trained find some high ground do some scouting before you pull the trigger shut the [ __ ] up yeah he has said that a lot huh slightly improved soft target blast and armor-piercing defense damn that's quite the get up so how do i select a horse i think horses you can only get from uh can we make that suppressor yet that's what we want to know nope not cool enough uh i need my horse back because i'm gonna be horseback riding don't tell me my horse has just despawned now he's over here just blending in look at him i'm going to call him shadow hey shadow it's a nice name come on you're okay whoa let's not kill shallow immediately unless horses are impervious to full damage what are we saying [Music] don't want to go down though that's understandable here we go how's that 120 meters away once he heated you off a cliff whoa all right shadow i'm afraid we're going up the pathways mate i've got missions today rosario is here too oh god they've got lasers we just go loud kind of want to just go loud there is a vehicle there that might oh i can't use my sniper this is annoying this is a problem i'm actually going to equip my my dmr14 i see you sniper cameras need to worry about i do kind of just want to go loud to be honest i just want to suss this place out first saw nothing steal or take him out steal all that and pass your call that's that's the same there's two enemies there rapport are you with me can you go get him bloody miles away aren't you come behind me no no no no no no no [Music] oh can we don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me oh set the heels at the heels at the hill oh my god my things are broken that was not pleasant of course blew his helmet off oh get in that was the uh that was the alarm so it wasn't completely pointless because i blew the thing up as he was about to call in reinforcements we will take that that was all part of the plan it's exactly what i wanted to do actually i wasn't too fussed about the guy or some sort of key um which i'm presuming is i need to head down here shall tomographic be the first creator i'm becoming a member to i don't know there is something about this dude so relaxing and great content i see there are a couple of members here in chat there are indeed that's what the key was for hey look dude just you watching is enough um i appreciate any of the support memberships are not compulsory to enjoy the content is that all i can get down here nothing i'm missing this back up we go then i can't get through there i can't go through there core challenge complete i don't know if you see that because that's technically an overlay is that coming up in my game capture it is okay remember that for next time more enemies this way was there anything else i needed to do here i need to secure no sign of rosario i should keep looking i'm looking for someone well they're in the search zone where that red mark is how are you gonna survive a shot like that my friend uh oh yeah it's a big area it's another bit of a compound or something over here rosario's not here she has to be at the other side oh god oh god oh god oh god i don't want to do that i'm going to throw a knife back trying to command guapo there you go apparently they don't like crocodiles but i'm hoping guapo will actually do something i want to see him attack someone for a change yes oh my god yes grappo oh you little legend i should really like that suppressor mechanic that's cool you can only fire like you can spam shot if you suppress rounds oh it's about to flick shot you mate oh i love it i got him [Music] i buddy to heal i need to heal they're trying to run me over on the dogs you for that how are you surviving that oh [ __ ] survive this actually gone nuts [ __ ] see that's how you put that's how you do it nicely guapo you absolutely mad lad yeeted that dog's corpse i mean this is this is a bit dumb i mean why is my sniper not one tapping you huh it's not cool enough it's a horse [Music] right in the bloody eye you go horse be free false combat 1v1 let's go if you really want this so this is what this is what far cry is all about just having a meme a lot of flames yes guapo now you're learning i'll give you a pet for that there's a good guapo little golden tooth good croc that thorough knife is pretty sick oh god there's more mission complete let's see if she's over here oh my god that horse is running through oh probably didn't like being sat satellite did it it's fair [Music] now where do i find so he's saying is they're not here either there's more dogs [Music] so really no one around here anyone up here it's a massive area to search [Music] this game worth it i mean it's up to you isn't it you know if you like like what you see i think something you enjoy there's a lot of content in the game i don't like making decisions for people but uh i'm having fun with the game for sure i haven't progressed too much with the story just yet we're getting there though it's pretty compelling can't complain about having an actor like giancarlo esposito carrying the game as a villain i mean if we had a better villain vast i suppose from far cry 3 was definitely number one troy baker did a good job playing [Music] forget their name what the name was in the game insecure gasolina for benito and his yeah assassinate okay so the target's not here she's inspecting military sides okay so if we if we find it we'll know let's take this horse if you've enjoyed the previous far cry games there's a lot of uh a lot of new mechanics that you might find interesting oh no it's just she eated me off because of the fire okay okay i can't get a clean kill without hurting the horse more enemies keep coming uh we got one two two thousand meters away and one 400 meters away whoa i need to keep searching so many different um sites it's kind of cool actually it's the cleanup crew jesus i need to get the hell out of here gotta be careful these reinforcements they're gone there's two tanks i mean yes you play or however you uh you know playstation store xbox store how do i steal the tank enter his driver oh my god no way [Music] oh my god let's go gamers all right cap can we that's my chance or isn't it oh yeah come on give me a taste give me a taste of the battlefield battlefield tank gameplay where is the tank it's on the road okay that takes care of rosario that's rosario now for the tank that works get a guapo she's all yours okay i let guapo die come on bud he was doing so well give him a little pet uh well yeah that's a promo actually don't wait was no no that one was mine vehicle scraps okay well we found an escape we need to get out of the combat away from the restricted area shift change oh no it's like i said he's bulletproof he's got armor on look he's literally drifting oh i can keep that horse if i find it the horse i liked shadow give me the hearts game thank you he's still over here did he run off i mean let's face it if there was as much action as there just was popping off there i probably would have ran away as well [Laughter] any goodies this game goes from a horse to a car from a horse to a car from the 50s to a tank in five minutes yeah that's far cry for you benito you won't be seeing rosario things anymore but the job's not done head to the fuse station and finish it oh that's sad i lost my horse i could have brought him here and kept him change coat i want a black horse wait was that a zebra that's a bloody zebra that's a unicorn that's our unicorn nothing to see there mate

come on guapo let's take you home he's been through a lot today we need a giraffe now i mean i don't know what these hit markers are you're getting hit markers or something though it's a it's an untamed horse it's a villager has his moments doesn't it i mean the game can't can't fault the graphics that's what i'm talking about though lens flare does so much for for the quality of games in

and that's one way to get in thanks horsey solves me sucking out doesn't it i was literally a door most easy thing to access of all time easy now okay onwards come on don't worry i'm a friend i don't know how people can say that this game looks bad honestly it's just colorful like i swear people are just are just too uh too used to games at grayscale like warzone i can't wait for that new map because it's because it's going to look more like this but yeah i'm one of the main reasons why i don't enjoy playing warzone right now is just the way it looks like i'm just bored of it's depressing to look at the dance 84 is literally the most depressing looking color palette i've ever seen says something when the game looked better over a year ago i don't mind the changes to the dance gate before at all but like why did they have to mess the color palette up so much i get that we went back in time but if anything cold war is a more colorful looking game than modern warfare ever was anyway we've got that new warzone season soon as well right that's on the sixth seventh yeah no complaints from me as to how good this game looks at least it's just very vibrant people are saying that the game looks better in far cry 3 but i think they're just looking at it for rose tinted glasses and the nostalgia is getting the best of them [Music] i always get the worst recruit all right let's make sure to walk over this plank this time clara yeah it's just brown and grey all the time isn't it you want us to take down until ships we're goddamn fishermen then leave us to die again come by the [ __ ] are you doing try it it's fun what's the plan hepa for anton to see us from the [ __ ] capital yes well it's working you've got 20 minutes until anton's forces come so you better start running all bands together go rule 69 run rules a revolution is not won by the fearless is won by the feared what does anton castillo fear free elections free expression free outcasts ayara free of castillos but he will fear nothing unless you are willing to die for your freedom today okay not when we have more believers or more guns today go off queen because today i'm going to put your hole through castile's warships i believe it i am not fearless i'm feared i'm scared as hell oh but i promise you one thing i will be feared oh there we go badass viva liberta let's go home gideous she does look like lobos from apex who cares danny she knows what we need see you from the sky agaria i like the voice acting in this game it's very good viva libertad that was a good cutscene something though as well i think people are just looking at the cut scenes and thinking this looks bad they're just so used to seeing pretty rounded cut scenes like in modern warfare's uh campaign where everything was like you know actual cinematics a lot of the time you'll transition from actual gameplay to cutscenes in this which i like doesn't really break your immersion much immersion immersion yeah bo at some point some classic far cry 3 vibes right then gang i think that's about as far as i can go for today you get that chopper up and running how dare you introduce me okay juan i'll take it out all right i'll make sure my fiery corpse comes down on you like a meteor awesome i really enjoyed that once they once they sort of let you off the reins a bit and just allow you to play and have fun which doesn't take long you uh you get back into that classic far cry feel which is what it's all about you can just experiment do some stupid stuff and uh yeah play the game however you want you get a lot of freedom and games like this that's what far cry so you know what makes makes far cry great but uh thank you all so much for watching guys i appreciate you tuning in there's been a
