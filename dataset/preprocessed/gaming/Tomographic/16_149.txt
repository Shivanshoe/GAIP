guys what does a jalapeno do what does it do yeah it's jalapeno face all right man catch later i'm purely using this gun because i want to see if it's got the ping you know the classic ping from the m1 grand oh oh it sounds good in this game oh it's put a big old smile on my face i should probably put the scope on it right get rid of the loading grip put the hunting scope on see what that looks like okay that's two down i guess wait there's one right here what are you doing oh can i toggle oh pog oh god that was good insurgency sandstorm it's been a while hasn't it so i'm sure that some of you have heard of or even played this game before but i recently had the itch to play insurgency again and ultimately i wanted to see how insurgency sandstorm holds up in 2021 long story short it absolutely does and it's definitely worth your time if you fancy a change of pace when it comes to your fps games frankly if you haven't played insurgency sandstorm before then you are totally missing out from the gunplay and animations to the sound design and graphics insurgency is always a good time and the experiences i've had from this game are truly one of a kind i've got some gameplay and highlights to show you today that i think perfectly demonstrate just how much fun this game can be and what i think you should give insurgency sandstorm another shot if you haven't played in a while for me one of the main factors as to why i stopped playing this game when it first released a couple of years ago mostly came down to some of the performance issues and bugs at the time you know i played in both the alpha and the beta and when the game worked it was absolutely brilliant but it was held back by some of these glaring issues but believe me now when i say that the game has come a long way since then and i thoroughly enjoyed my time revisiting insurgency sandstorm so i'm gonna let the gameplay speak for itself but if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a like and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one i'll have played this map definitely as you can tell by my clear map knowledge i know exactly where i'm going at all times rest in peace teammate can i climb this oh i can there's one that looked like a headshot to me it wasn't and now i'm sad that was a headshot happiness restored i think we're behind enemy lines here careful teammates i love you i'll get wrecked get erect what moving on up nothing can stop me thank god this doorway is here we are on the aggressive right now a great start to the match just shooting into the smoke hoping something will happen just wait for it to disperse and three two one i'm peeking and missing every shot it's a lot of recoil you have to control it's good though that much left in this magazine now let's make every shot count pushing did he jump out of the window god damn it what are you using rpg oh god here we go here we go guys they're coming one two three four stand still one two three good all the cleaner shots but uh we did the thing see what we can do with the oh i need to get to the foul damn it man it's the same guy we saw earlier the reaper hey that was a great game what a great round did some serious work there it's great fun okay now we go you know what i'm feeling i'm feeling a bit of the as val let's do it well let's do it yeah i heard fire fowl ruined me i mean i hit the guy once up a torso um i figured i'd just commit to the hip fire because you know eddie assing would make me lose sight of my target but that was a good run with the with the tar very good hey come on pays to be patient clearly let them all pass me and then did the job right there's back blasts in this game all right we got careful this gun though because we want to get like 20 rounds someone's my right now they did [Music] our guys lucky on the close left unless i killed him no i didn't he's alive just in general if an enemy is close enough i'll hear their comms based on distance just gonna let the teammates advance first trying to figure out where they're shooting from so i need to go on the far right flank if i can [Music] i like it cut g just turn that guy into a jackson pollock we move this is a ballsy play right now let's make something happen last bullet holy crap maybe a little too much zoom for an as well i think i don't know how precise probably here can i make this oh crap have you spawned oh i'm so screwed good job the as well so oh quiet get a cookery knife out i run off diddy damn there's a nasty angle here there back up back away from me back away from me that was a terrible rpg goddammit friendly fire galore let's go cobra yeah not bad run it's good when you can uh you know choose your position and wisely like that and you know you hear him spawn get behind there get behind enemy lines for a brief period until you're in a position to capitalize all right let's try this should be nice to have a large omega suppose oh my god look at the how much higher the cobra is on this gun on the rail yeah use the valve to its fullest low profile barely makes a sound no one heard me coming yo go in the barrio i killed a bunch of them i can throw an ied in there do it i wouldn't suggest i wouldn't suggest don't do it okay okay i don't want the team to die hey go in don't go in going going everybody get in everybody get in everybody let's go i got [ __ ] blown up right after i said that i did notice yeah oh no where is that guy i do just turned to paste in front of me i don't really have a gun for range do i but i'll be careful my sprint for long periods of time don't push him did i get him down oh just lost all audio completely and there it is i'm getting a haircut in here no we're good bob is closed during quarantine there's a ballsy flank oh i got him all right apparently it was a decent flank and he picked off the one guy but it was enough the rest of them fell back this way i guess whoa here we come watch out guys we'll shoot you up this one down great great i'm really good with these nades they go exactly where i want them to every time um i cannot see a thing i've only died six times god damn we're doing very well oh almost at a stone in insurgency jesus okie dokie that is a hot spot yeah i think you found it they're in there i think i got him down i hope i got him down really hard to burst fire that moving on oh my god he was in the corner behind me what the hell is that spot he managed to parkour up on top of that platform what a gamer it feels like it's in a pretty good spot right now it's just a damn good game i think it's super underrated and i'm dead and there's some really great moments when you do get those nasty facts oh it's good it's good the teammate collision is a bit annoying for me sorry that guy had to die so that i could live [Music] somewhere i just like the tip that is the worst freak that is the worst spawn point probably there's no way in how that guy didn't see me before the guy on the top of the stairs just doing me i need to regroup my teammates on that right side there the two blue dots on the left-hand side of that guy scope the funny rpg can wait we need to be careful we need to push a different angle our far right side seemed good because you know that we're gonna come through that door wait we need to play smart what's that like how does one play smart sick let me just write this down real quick r p g ah rocket propelled grenade all right i'm about to peek it with an rpg all right i got man down on top of the stairs now we advance that's a teammate and we win the game rpg [Applause] [Music] insurgency that's pretty cool 32-10 that's a bang insurgency game hell yeah we'll take that had a good couple of moments some nice flanks some good quote-unquote teamwork that was a good time that's a youtube video right there i'll make that guy happy and post some insurgency gameplay i don't like that wall okay why not it looked at me funny hey tom what's up shoot at the wall uh just letting you know i had to give you a special present you did of course is that you with the tier one sub of course bulletproof one zero eight zero that's a wholesome moment [Music] foreign
