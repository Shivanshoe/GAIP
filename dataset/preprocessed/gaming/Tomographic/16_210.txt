I just did stopping power shotgun I feel like a B string Oh discussed ended oh yeah yeah you might just be one guy other one stroke line oh geez I thought that was you shooting a little horse tears coming at you okay well bed nicely done Tom let's go three guys in one spray of a PKM thank God White's had the PKM yeah PKM saved my life so that right there is my number one example as to why she should try the PKM in war zone and i mean look that was just a world spawn variant of the weapon with little to no attachments it's also a great example of the importance of knowing your surroundings in battle I'm engaging this guy in the lumberjack outfit but I was also being shot up by his teammate in the doorway behind me so I decided mid engagement to move in front of the coverall stood next to you which obstructed the enemies view from behind and allowed me to focus fire on my current target after I down him I then turn around an engaged enemy shoot me from behind before transferring that spray down onto the enemy behind him now it's definitely possible to do this with other LMGs but the PKM has the best all-around stats for warzone most importantly though the weapon starts out with a 100 round base magazine which allows you to take on multiple opponents at once and you're gonna see more examples of this in today's video so this is my preferred class setup for the PKM warzone this build works like an absolute charm and allows me to take fights on most ranges while maximizing AES speed and Rico control to help balance out the usual drawbacks of using an LMG are using mp7 as my secondary weapon with this particular load out for any close-range engagements than my require higher mobility plus when running out on the open it's always better to have a more lightweight weapon to maximize your movement speed and I think these two weapons work really well together if you want to see more videos like this then make sure to subscribe with notifications turned on we've just surpassed a hundred thousand subscribers and that number just keeps climbing so I cannot thank you all enough for your support I'm just gonna do my best to bring you more of the videos that you want to see as well as the videos that I like making so with that said to leave a like if you enjoy today's video and let me know which weapons you want me to try out next in war zone thank you very much for watching and I will see you in the next one as guys a person who's guys are pushing right here we're all this way right I'm green I'm Westie oh I've just been beamed from the right there's one there's one on the right already Oh getting melted from or which is constantly running away oh no no no no they fight if my check fire station okay seems to be I think seems to be now there's a lot of stuffing laid here not fire station m4 do it I need we need to all be together I think for this because there might be a full team anything for ID is there one any spare plates cuz I got five I'm Karen I will fall I'm good for now nothing near bones I'm not quite stretchy Lipton let's trench that gluten and get that bread look at the way that gluten stretches it sound exactly like the guy on the wagon Mama's Instagram no he sounds like the it sounds like the sculpture in our attack of the man like the cement head oh and more I thought that's that's smart oh no attack we had like a like a Greek ahead bust he was it fewer fetus yes we're closer to it I guess yeah oh God Oh Mike he's gonna thirst no yeah we're watching my heli I found him a down the guy shooting I obeys God seen things another one down another one on here once pushing me I'm left behind there thank you already buying our building i'ma hit comes give you some support and then objecting me now I'm coming I'm coming see for the door a one down here nice one more maybe pushing me okay let's see anyone see you down two down one day one laughter thing this thing comes to him you run off give you a key loggers are nothing on being it's getting this vehicle and let's go Old Vic come on maybe economy it right next to me I dabble in straw from the behind behind behind behind I'm down gonna get finished stomach down and dead okay he's on top of the roof of the hangar with a HBR full team on that roof actually yeah that was to been the Gulager then they must have given in my cab let's keep moving now those two give me this note they got a load out on the roof west across the road to you so I don't get finished so quickly the absolute a man extra plate bundle and leave it by their fire thingy someone just like me from blue area okay I'm coming -
