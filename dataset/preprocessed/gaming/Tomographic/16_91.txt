so this for me is my absolute favorite way to use the ram 7 in warzone i guess you could say it's sort of an smg sniper support build if you will though there's technically no ammo conversion to make the ram 7 and smg if you build it like this it still easily competes with some of the more popular smgs in warzone gameplay today is with the tea drinking bean team that is westy study and the tactical brit but if you do go on to enjoy the video make sure to leave a like and subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one dude aren't these new drop spots so sick

control the wall here we go i don't know why they made the bike impossible wait they just dropped out the window here dropped out of the window all right okay oh no they're on the south side of the building they are in a firing squad oh my god is that nate really gonna back his butt he's actually gonna just pogba oh god i am a god amongst men i did a flank as well like i always say you're beaming i ran all the way around tomorrow i came in here and all four of them were yeah i saw i was i was in that purple window doing the same thing and uh we'll just watch start bleed out that's um yeah he starts to come and then he bleeds out got a present for you stored you ready no you're being sniped from um north still up on purp wesley's going for a flank uh we can hold these guys out on our loadout there's two over there on the red marks they're still on the walls over and they have to run over now i'm not going we've actually got such a good place yeah sniper on the wall right here

right in front i'm in camera right team white right now coming for us we can do this we can definitely do the last team do we get two of them right yeah they're in the windows of the building sorry we'll shoot move what's the best we can do right flank yeah they have quite nice positioning there though just keep an eye out oh they do have the position i mean they it's flash photography on me it's nothing i've made the play i've made the play so that you guys can learn one in the window i him i can't empty that wall two follow-up hits that's exactly the teammate team is going for res now that's a really difficult angle heading this way they're both second floor if i can get an angle and you guys have got this can you mark the exact height they are i can't anymore the second floor of it there you go there you go oh no this one got the back um nice a glorious dub on this glorious day well done lads well done there's a young lad i haven't seen a red door at ages get rid of them now they they do exist they're just super rare rarest red door in war zones man please please come inside of the plane next to me nice i can't name it well down did you slam that guy still no i did another bad guy because he was pretty low i snapped him i have four men over here guys oh get drop here just literally four man george foreman oh got shot from behind he's here educators edgy

yep nice that's well done well done team damage that's the um what's called the aim punch on the hdr is just absolutely terrible i reckon there's going to be a team inside the main building yeah i'm looking now down there just on that purple thing good position outside it there's a few people hiding in it let's have a look i'm waiting for my snapshot to recharge looking for more there's more in there there's three teams yeah he was in there there it goes oh we can possibly save no i think like that lack is in the power play i'm sticking cell phones i'm doing a precision just in case to get on the right someone just peed me from the right i still don't like this hanger someone's gotta be here somewhere behind me where are they stay there lucky somebody might be able to get rest yep
