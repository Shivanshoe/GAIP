think i want to try this loadout in a solo but we'll see let's go go get that this probably isn't the game to do this thing is as well i've purposely not added the attachments that make them you know good look at my eds i'm using attachments that they would have used in the cold war so i've got the sks blueprint from the cold war event and then i've got the m16 blueprint from the pre-order look at the back of that if you guys can get an angle no they're inside done one broke armor on blue guy dude there's still one on blue yeah broken yeah he wasn't any dead i had shot damage on the sks so the tip of the lamppost was a guy there take the truck down one that one here move to engage look at him go accurate this thing is from the air that looks cooler in my head can't see him he's off the quad he's dead poor guy i think he accepted that one we did there's another play box i can hold it there they are on yellow they're in the open come on finish again you're doing something that i didn't expect from you hmm and i've built the worst possible loadout for it ass shots [Music] probably gonna right if he had res tell me you should probably push it i'm pushing up i'm gonna stun it right here go down over here fine find me in the road i'll say it right bro i literally i scoped in and he was below my scope so i didn't see him literally i feel like i've been time traveling with this loadout i feel like i've been pulled into modern day it's all shots here oh there okama the left across bridge that one dude but you kidding ask us like what are you right there right there foggy oh yeah i see a cc why is no one using this or calmer one and i'm tagging these right now oh my okay different team i'm shooting at them there's oh the guy's behind you on green holy crap bro karma one look at that there's two of them there i got armor hits on them knocked him i knocked finish still one more there though there was two there's a couple down bullets oh my god in the river it's an easy rares there on purp one's down on perp yeah they are almost done or not i just i just picked them up i just picked them up i'm one i can't see them right here i'm pretty sure broken you could deal some serious damage with that thing i think that was the gun i was trying to use for a little while i mean a lot of those were assists because it was just peppering people but like you get those head shots it's devastating dad dad after six beers it's just it's someone from peaky blinders all of them um it's uh which tomorrow impression is this all of them yeah hello [Laughter] oh my god i'm a slap head direct line to his head it's oh for steps that's right there doesn't matter with you with your shields [Applause] there's also a team inside wait wait where's the mall where's more there's definitely more maybe inside maybe inside oh we've got money let's just go to the shop what are we doing uh-huh i need to get out of it it's gonna be all right where's that from that's the uh there's more steps on me steps on me no no no dumbo leave leave leave you got the 12k just get out i can cover you from behind but i can't cover you if you die i'm not there get it come to me not run right let them fight let them fight i love just like chilling whilst you're full panic and i don't have to say a word but i didn't know if you were going to fight it's nice that you care i do not know about wedding do you expect me to do a westie there and just go completely silent and just like disobey everyone westy don't peed that all right yeah i gotta make an sks load up so i gotta do oh perfect i don't know how you haven't done that yet yeah have you not done the video i just haven't committed to that i'm doing it now this is it dude this is the gameplay this is the ultimate gameplay of ultimate history do you want to peak this does he want to he wants to beat this thing he mad yeah that's big dick he's just going to say rpg he's got an rpg stream oh oh it's the worst man trees just like the other guy i beamed his mate his beam mate he's being made that's a smoke grenade where's the rest of them no eyes no eyes no eyes it's gone in i'm going up trying to come off on the far side all right near a blue marker uh 20 meters long the building maybe okay right right next to you should be it's very lit stud that's us fragmented all right so now what was happening there well what i've done with this loadout i've tried i've tried to go on as cold war as possible right and that's very disappointing yeah i mean what i've done is i've equipped a frag grenade instead of like see me from somewhere near right past him which rebounded off a wall and did nothing someone has just sniped at me and i'm explaining that mid-story no idea where the shot came from i'm hoping they shoot at me again there's nothing i find more attractive in a person than being interrupted i'll tell you what oh god if it was where's my fmj going it's not shooting back is he let's get let's take uh you want to go bloody police yeah you're insane i like it duo's is just so low's twice one down old chat heading out pretty sure we killed these guys before where are they on blue yeah yeah where else you don't know semtex didn't have the range i thought it would on blue i'm going to crawl in probably i've got f let's go are you sure what if they've got a setting explosive cheeky origin i did not go where i thought it was going to go you sure this is safe tomorrow i don't feel very safe right now well look there's no idea if you're really that scared my where is he up here run away you've got gas installed safe zone relocated on the other end oh i broke him i broke him odd pig he's not gonna be okay he's not gonna peek is he he's not there it's my rpg where's this guy i've just opened the door with the rpg to be honest it's the only reason i picked it up uh i mean he's got ghosts i think this guy let me just give you stopping power that's very nice i hate pushing buildings i just this door's closed heading out it doesn't say oh dear dead rj i'm dead oh stop quick touch touch you beast you absolute beast oh my god well i had stopping power so that was the only that was the only redeeming factor there's no one quite like the way that you can win any fight with an origin yeah you just win any fight with the others literally well you know the enemy has the opponent you can even kill hackers you can literally go hack to the origin they can't beat you i've ever made a lot of noise so should probably move on well i kind of want them to come to us well don't uav perhaps or yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah although i feel like they're gonna be exactly well i've got these haven't i just to go oh buggers lots of people will get you evie i just stood still oh my god [ __ ] him what are you doing another one stop did you just what's up head beautiful august poggers um and also another guy floating in over there somewhere probably okay what should we take yeah there was two guys near blue a vehicle right here enemy vehicle enemy uav overhead smashed into he's been in an accident and he needs financial support and it was his fault have you been in an accident it wasn't your fault the vinky oh pogba's hitting pogba's hitting pockets this guess is nuts it's you know what the drop off is pretty nice uh lower police would have seen him well i've already hit him once and you must have headshot him i guess well no i mean uh the bullet drop is is about like car 98 levels uh okay let's see another guy on the roof maybe on the roof behind there yeah his teammate's pushing up i saw him ground level so he went in on blue and he's going to go up for the race what do you just want to hold a circle look at this oh yeah we can do that beautiful top of this building yeah yeah yeah yeah what is it we've got to snipe it to the right of the hangers oh god oh god we're dead right oh god i'll go with this one quit him i don't know just from behind it's literally my only call out i've got shot on the bum so i run out of the msm on me one down on me okay okay okay i'm coming looking i'm watching his left side where they have to come towards us anyway i don't like this at all i don't have my baby monitor anymore with it tomorrow nice team monsieur super super yeah we gotta get ahead of this circle start i think we can i see people but they're running all right unless they've got snipers target both teams get one different one now one's just run past tech and one down one down one here okay watch your back yep they're running through up through tech now you're with me yeah yeah i wish i had my baby monitor that would help oh guy jumped off he's jumped out of his head and he's dropped it three people here dude yeah i'm pretty sure there will be a team pushing this over this hill very shortly we've got an okay i think we should probably hold on someone's already on the roof dude someone's already on that roof we need to push that roof dude that's our problem look at that uav we have to push that roof no so do we go far left if we go far left do we go for our left what do we do um far right go far right i think there's yeah yeah there's more hill cover a little bit more cover right there so many teams armor once i don't see anyone on the roof yet but we need to take the zip up i think the right zip is dude are we dead in this opening we have to take this roof or we just use the cover we have and see where the zone updates in 40 seconds those guys on the roof will have a huge advantage that's all someone's fighting you okay yeah i get i don't want to be bottom floor either without around shots around this vehicle here otherwise we're stuck nice shot dude right here on his [Music] yeah i see him using the broom yeah he's is that solo do you think yeah maybe on that hill just be on the hill oh god i'm so much in a bad position there stood still for much too long i hear them where's that guy on the edge he's just going to stay there isn't he he is but you're in a decent spot just don't make yourself seen yeah oh no what's david's life just saw him and he knows he bloody knows it he blood he knows it lovely come on guys get out of the bloody building probably got yourself probably got self he does have herself i know he does but i don't want to leave the building because they're watching oh this is good i've got to come to you now where are there they on the roof no no no but there's well you bastard they're all gonna rush me at once just hold your ground you're right okay any more teammates i'm like am i okay am i dead am i ruined and see man i thought it was one guy i thought it was one guy you know what i mean we played we played the damn video game why did i have why did i have to fight everyone i knew it was gonna happen i just got beamed in the open it was a dangerous spot to try and cover like the guy didn't even see me was running towards the big building solid game though we'll take third yeah [Music] you
