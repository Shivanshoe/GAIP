likewise [Music] so hello everyone and welcome back to enlisted and a big thank you to them for sponsoring this video now it's been a while since i last covered this game on the channel but they recently added a new campaign called the battle of tunisia which we're going to play today and the battle of berlin 2 which you saw in the intro features some really cool maps that i hadn't played on before both of which are really fun and play out very differently offering something unique visually and strategically depending on the campaign you choose such as maps troops weapons vehicles and more for players to unlock if you haven't heard of enlisted before you can probably already tell that it's a world war ii multiplayer shooter but there is a real focus on historical authenticity in this one not to throw any shade the game still manages to keep you in the middle of the action at all times though and there is a great atmosphere too the audio and visuals can be quite immersive with an impressive amount of destruction at times it's available on pc xbox series x s and ps5 not forgetting ps4 and xbox one with cross-platform support enlisted features large-scale combat with dozens of soldiers like vehicles and armored vehicles airplanes too if you consider yourself to be a strong enough pilot there is no purchase necessary and you can follow the link in the description below to

sponsoring this video and i will catch you legends in the next one we have to attack okay yeah oh i've got an actual sniper this time this looks sick sniper class has a sniper scope which one is it if it has a picture of like like a crosshair oh right just a sniper bullet i think that means you get a scope okay sick is that the carcano mod 38 yes yeah that's the one yes well it's not an amazing scope but it's still a scope it's a nice scope dude this map's cool look at this look at the color it is very vibrant oh so we've got to plan that bomb yeah i think that's how we move forward in this mode yeah i'm in the bushes i'll never expect it don't want to lose this guy that i've got now so i kind of need to find a good sniper oh i got immediately sniped dude i killed one kill two thomas
