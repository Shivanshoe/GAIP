where is this bounty hiding he's on the stairs maybe oh are you kidding me there's no way i didn't see that oh my god come on how was i ever gonna spot that there's so many people abusing the rose skin right now but can you blame them look at that advantage that is insane hello everyone and welcome back to more warzone so back by popular demand i'm using an eye tracker in today's video to help you better understand my thought process while i'm playing and you can see where i'm looking at all times during a match that blue bubble you can see bouncing around your screen right now is the focus point of my eyeballs in real time so this should make for an interesting video i'm sure but wait before we get into that today's video is sponsored by display a display if you didn't know is a one-of-a-kind magnet-mounted metal poster designed to capture your unique passions and durable enough to withstand a lifetime of intense steering the steering is only half the fun my friends you can customize collect and rearrange them at will and it only takes 20 seconds to set them up with no power tools no damage and no frustrations so these are some of the displays that i picked up from some of my favorite movies and games and i was really impressed by the quality and color of these prints they have over 1.4 million designs to choose from and every display purchase helps to plan trees in africa which is pretty awesome they really do help to add some flair and personality to any space and you can get 30 off your display order for one week and then 15 off after that by using my unique link in the description below this video right then let's just jump into the gameplay shall we i'm using the ffar and khana 8k build that i showcased on the channel recently and i'm also playing solos for the first time in well a long time so let me know if you want to see more videos like this in the future by hitting the like button below and subscribe for more thank you for watching as always and i will catch you legends in the next one a guy [Music] no chance of making this oh my how long have you been there should really plate before i push this but um surely not how did he not know i was in his building i think someone needs a new pair of headphones more steps come on in drop shot saved my life they don't even try oh i'm gonna die hello what's that an rpg or a strela hmm it's definitely a rocket of some sort we know this was it you if it was you no it wasn't you the hell was he firing that oh no it's a javelin oh god am i dead oh come on hostile drop it into the area watch the sky there we go oh that would be such a nice segment of gameplay if i could have finished off that clip what is going on here mental start to a game we saw this guy jump from the tower so [Music] should be cleared to check this building know hair steps oh no i had to say it here and you return to the front line yeah yeah i know time to earn your freedom send me back to the front line okay we spawned i don't know like 1000 meters away let's try and get back there actually if i land where i fought that guy by the shed should get a sniper back or my loadout this could be huge there's an enemy crate there as well i'm just gonna try and get back to where i died i don't wanna hang around here too long i'm not in the zone yet now i don't think this truck spawns here so i'm just gonna take it and uh we'll see what happens this is not there's a lot of obstacles in my way here oh please no that's from stadium i think let's get up here is that in the tents isn't the tense uh i kind of want to shoot through yeah he's right where my crosshair is break okay somehow that was a headshot all right that was uh weird but it's a kill on the board okay you should have won that fight you had the jump on me there saved by the cover of the shed once again i want to make the most of this fire sale but at the same time i feel like i'm in the central like most populated area right now there's just people all around me isn't that guy still in the tower that's who i'm waiting for just peek me once please make my day i think there's a guy on stadium yep there we go and i whiffed it and that's the shot i hit i got the wheel it's so weird man the shots that i hit in the shots that i miss if a target is stationary i'm more likely to miss the shot than a moving target i like to think of myself as a reactive sniper because people move like lunatics in this game so i try and understand where they're gonna move and how they're gonna like how they're gonna get there so when someone just stays completely still i end up trying to compensate for movement and they're not even making you know i see this guy's gun there we go vengeance is it was a mine shot wasn't it i think that was a sniper though i don't even know if that was the same guy that killed me before but we'll just we'll just pretend it is into the zone we go this thing is basically a tank i kind of do think they should remove these from solos it's uh it's a bit of a it's a bit of a joke it's not very fair when you do have one especially with the third person peeking how did i not run you over oh god no no i thought he was gonna take it but he didn't yeah keep him suppressed enemy where did he go i'm scared i'm panicking now for no reason okay downed and i cannot confirm my kill that's great that's just great this guy is annoying oh you're so annoying you down himself [Applause] what happened man no no man that was horrible that was just horrible there's no other way to explain that engagement i think that was the guy that i down with the con i hate before though so at least we've covered that front just gonna clear the uh the edges of the map moment to breathe finally recon on my position oh there's a guy right next to me [Applause] well on the bus station who the hell parks a truck in here probably that guy right uh i think he's above or downstairs rtb for reason he's behind that wall there well the next zone will be marked in a second i don't think we're gonna be in it so he's gonna have to run i don't think he knows i'm here so we'll just wait for him could be ghosted players around me this is solos i think a lot of people take ghost as their first class oh there he goes oh through the leaves i'm driving it's good okay whose truck has more health yours are mine they're about the same but i'll take this one i feel so bad now that i'm actually wearing the rose skin because nobody that i fought so far seems to have been wearing it which is weird for me i think it's because i'm playing solos for the first time in so long but um yeah i might i may have to go back to my old ghost game this doesn't feel right yeah self-rise and a uav and then be on my way there's one in the bus stop you're not paying that oh no i've thrown it god i'm such an idiot wait i actually could have just stayed in that bush and he wouldn't have seen me i thought i could pen that bus station i swear i've done that before maybe with a sniper but um that's how the game ends on to the next one look at that a ship wow the zombies are coming what excuse me i'm just trying to look at a chef mate and now you've made an enemy of me what the bets that i find a sniper in this house okay well i did but it's not the best one oh yeah he's pushing he's pushing i'm not gonna see him through windows because thermals can't do that here we go yeah i don't know about the x-50 come on there we go that's one hit break and a pistol for the finish how does it feel what is that stun intended for me right shield on his back okay which means there's someone around ouch if i were here might be right side of the building but you might have run left no there he is inside the building give me all your stuff be advised couple of lads on my uav next to my loadout hopefully i can sneak this and then third party which is what is happening right now gotta go fast one of them's dead and along comes tom to pick up the scraps what a guy i think i just heard someone open a door wasn't the main one but can i make this jump let's find an angle there we go my raven's got a craving for your face i think someone just goo lags behind me there he is okay that guy was just oblivious am i in crush bottom this is what it feels like like some of these players don't seem all out with it is that fair judgment it must have been low i don't know if that hit him oh my god get this done what are you doing we're in a gunfight mate give me a freaking heart attack weird games today oh can you imagine the scenes if i got that knock he's not going to pee crazy all right let's get into hospital looks like it's ending here don't get shot running in the open please another guy in a truck i'm just stopping right here okay didn't expect him to rush me like that enemy team is tracking your position that's not good gas is moving in new safe zone location take that silence don't really need armor at this point i hope only five left take this heartbeat sensor steps was that the guy hunting me no it wasn't i'm still high threat i might go all the way around in the gas might be the play don't hear anyone oh here we go don't choke now tom i could use that silence here oh run the wrong way someone's coughing in the gas they're making the same play as me i'm bad they were all right lost my gas mask my eyes are everywhere i've been daddy he's right underneath me don't die to the gas please oh i could have lost that fight there we go it is done weird game man i don't know if i'm gonna upload that is that a youtube game i don't know like yeah it was a dub but it didn't really feel like i don't know much happened players i was up against the pacing in general i am playing at 2am right now at the time i'm recording this on eu lobby so maybe that's got some some part and i don't often play solo so i think the sbm for me is going to be quite low until i uh i guess i rank myself but uh gg nonetheless hope you enjoyed that hope you enjoyed the eye tracker content as well and uh let me know if you want to see more leave a like on the video if you did enjoy it and uh yeah just thank you very much for
