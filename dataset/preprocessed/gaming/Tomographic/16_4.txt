hey how's it going everyone and welcome back to sniper elite five now don't worry i haven't forgotten about this game i just don't want to blast through it right away i like to give you guys some time to catch up between episodes we are already over halfway into this game now so i'm just trying to savor the flavor you know and regardless it's not like anyone's watching or playing this game for the story anyway this series has always been about gameplay any cutscenes are usually just to tell you who your target is and where you can find them just so you can move on to the next location so today's episode is definitely one of the more stealthy levels that i've played with more distance between objectives and plenty of areas to hide if things get messy the opportunity to go loud presents itself on a few occasions though which keeps things interesting i'm playing on authentic difficulty again for minimal hud and maximum immersion but without further ado let's just jump right into it so drop a like for the algorithm subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one we've disrupted the production line at marsha sack which will slow mauler's plans down but we were too late to stop the shipment of huge quantities of already completed components components included state-of-the-art u-boat stealth plating the shipments were bound for guernsey disguised as medical supplies i'm following the trail if operation kraken is some kind of stealth u-boat submarine i need to take it out before it becomes an invisible killer in the channel oh we're definitely in england this time never too far from a pebble beach are you factory shipping this puts those cracking deliveries in the underground hospital further inland gotta head there and follow the trail it looks quite nice actually the rocks actually look wet is that a gnome it's santa claus shoot it the gnome guard destroy gnomes in guernsey okay interesting little side objective radio tower if i take it out should slow down any reinforcements it's a cool way to start a mission okay i need to take down this radio tower how do i do that 131 meters away i don't think shooting is going to do any good those guards right there so radio tower support cables aren't up to scratch i can take advantage of that bolt cutters maybe or shoot the cables i'm gonna try the old stealth tactic the double kill strap [Music] believe the body's here just hope that no one's on patrol fort helmet the island's communications hub bound to be information i can use in there that's a crowbar i need bolt cutters he's on his bike those bolt cars yes that could have been bad imagine there was a guard just standing in the doorway smg rounds don't need bottles okay let's get this bowl guys the guard right down there okay you link this world you're gonna turn around that's it stay right there sorry mate i realize you're in a very compromising position there i'll take what i need to be on my way a grenade what's that doing up there so many different routes to get to the objectives that's what i love about these games they're not strictly linear okay cut the cable towers close the top cable to go oh i don't need to do this this is just a side objective um some radio in here comments radio if i disable this can stop the nazis raising me all right this changes things sorry cut you off there disable the radio radio down should slow down their reinforcements okay this changes things okay this changes things um there is a car down there i can get into this building without getting spotted nice steps is that above me or below me no one's on the stairs those ones i'm gonna take this guy out right in the middle of the courtyard safe combination we'll take that explosive barrier from over here got a plan a very unnecessary plan here he comes i'll take your time no rush up and over wow that's how it's done i could have just taken him out head on but where's the fun in that okay there's a precarious ladder behind me let's check this out oh god he's right there oh no you see me [Music] someone heard that hopefully there's not too many guards in the area try and keep up the stealthy approach hop down here and there's someone running around up here there he is [Music] is the bullet cam really necessary that's so overkill all right give me your stuff this'll come in very useful get this door open padlocked on the other side okay get through this window yes i can invasion only is the safe i need i do have invasions on but because i'm playing authentic i don't think many people are going to try and join my session custom po8 doesn't have a suppressor don't care oh i see a collateral opportunity let's line this up switch to normal rounds do the most amount of damage come on we'll keep a 0-50 i need the body shot really yes holy crap that's a dead man damn battery virus charlie mentioned this we won't be able to cross the channel if that naval battery is active gotta take it out of action before i leave what's a naval battery i've heard that before it's for taking out ships right like heavy artillery sorry you off buddy but i don't really care about this uh propaganda i think you can take these out yes you there's can of them on this map i don't know what you get for killing these but [Applause] um yeah if you want to believe that that was a tank right there i'm gonna do this take on the road steal law take him out or let him pass your call actually where am i i'm headed the right way infiltrate the underground hospital oh this guy right there not the best time to rechamber we got the kill someone heard that looks like you can get up in that church there's a zip line there here we go climb up these vines and suddenly the game has become assassin's creed all i need is a hay bale to dive into there's a workbench here hell yeah fun locked some new attachments a new suppressor you prefer the old one a new scope i think i prefer the old one i'll change the stock improved aim stability sure okely-dokely for smg runs here we go the zip lines in this game are so fast oh it's only right where i need to be as well we do love that the underground hospital there's got to be something in there that points me towards kraken's test site okay all this guy's right there let me sneak past them i need to kill them oh this place is big it's right in that doorway i can't use the sound of the artillery it's intelligent scuttle charges designed to render the gun inactive before it's captured if i can get to the nazis to detonate them mirus's toast i can use the sound of the artillery to mask my shots and then video if you like the alcoholist i shouldn't hear this though i'm from bowdoin i will never stop doing those takedowns it's so effective shoot the first guy assassinate the second guess that grabbed everything useful can't get through that door are they all hiding imagine that we were just sat on those seats watching this oh wait there's a guy right here yes come this way had a boy howie he's got good reflexes see him punch me first before i got the knife off that guy is a gamer okay some sort of box there i don't really need any allied supplies are coming to liberate you accept your future as part of the glorious i'm just making this voice going slow-mo let's get a bottle over there hello and then we'll do the old one too man i'd shot the guy with no helmet that almost killed me that's not good let's get out of here fast more bottles what does morbius drink out of more bottles someone's walking around here like i think you might have seen me oh crap found the stealth place spicy but no sign of where they're being shipped to there's got to be more information in the area i haven't heard that can't tell if i'm hearing more footsteps okay i'm looking for more intel um infiltrate the facility find a way to disable the battery okay this truck still on patrol doing laps around the map there's a guy in front of him 000 meters bingo oh that just barely killed him took his scalp off that was a mess that was bad it didn't count with a win there i need to aim slightly to the left someone heard me round about there [Music] perfect not the cleanest kill shot shattered his teeth and took his jugular out but um there he is no way okay time to move making too much noise here decoys don't need those switch to subsonic see a guy over there [Music] just in time almost missed my window of opportunity there is that the bunker i need to go in it is all right let's do it search this guy real quick pressure valves this looks like it was built in a hurry if i can overload them i'd be able to collapse the whole facility on top of the prototype crack and prototype a stealth capable u-boat oh i can't leave it or this facility standing conversation having some sort of meeting in here maybe i can do this stealthy i don't know oh they heard me okay take this guy out quick under the cover of the turret and then on up there yeah they're coming oh no damn it there's like a deer in the headlights there i need to get to that other guy's position time to go loud i think yeah they're on to me switching to normal rounds who's blowing that whistle you all the stairs okay he's dead there we go that's what we like to see another one the u-boat general down this is a great position let's pick him off so easily from here run up hammer he's dead he's definitely dead okay oh coming for you and it's over site commander keeps the scuttling order coding is safe need to get my hands on that code where's the safe gonna be in the meeting room maybe i don't see a safe let's go back out here how do i destroy this uber then can't interact with that what is this pipe lead another terminal down here there it is fuel line is active need to get the torpedoes in place okay how do i do that there's a winch here too small for a torpedo though there it is how do i move it some satchels it's got to be there hasn't it get the terminal beeping yeah there it is controls for the torpedo loading mechanism nice torpedoes in place fuel pumping into the prototype explosive combination hell yeah got to take the shot from a safe distance a safe distance i mean i think this is the only option right let's get on that island but i don't think i can okay oh i have to shoot the hook there it is oh damn i've done what i came here to do okay across the channel with mirrors still active a huge explosion i don't know if i was at a safe distance even there tunnel almost collapsed on me should be a way into the battery through those trenches let's go right there [Music] can't really use anything against him other than a bullet to the brain not sorry okay into the trenches this is going to be fun lots of satchel charges well i think we found the artillery is this it yeah it is we found the battery we've got the next shell ready to fire okay clearly area next round that fires is gonna be an explosive one there it is making good progress so far and there's another santa claus crackers destroyed and now battery myrus is out of action time to get out of here and across the channel and these guys heard the explosion i do have some tnt maybe i can uh put a little explosive show for them as well goodbye whoa i'll do it long grass it's a better place to hide i think i destroy the truck in front of it though no i'm gonna have to find another way to destroy that one oh he's stopping charge is still being placed he must be behind schedule i'm gonna snipe him sorry buddy oh popped both of his eyeballs disgusting okay what do i do here find and kill lanzo okay i need to shoot this that's where the objective marker is nice out of action apparently i can kill this guy by drowning him in cement which definitely sounds more fun oh god fun for me to witness because i'm a psychopath and when you get the opportunity to do something fancy to kill a nazi you're gonna do it oh they're talking about him so he's in there look cement mixer is still running should act as good sound cover okay lonzo baumann nazi engineer he's made the kill list that's my guy trying to sneak past here so is there a pit of cement down here yes interact oh okay you need to move i think he's gonna lean on that railing or something and fall in i want to see this get a good seat get a good seat for the cement show there he comes very very slowly need a better angle while he's working on that i'll take my opportunity cross him off the list i love that you can do that there's different ways to take out the bad guys there's another one on patrol here oh there's so much sway i just got my breath back okay let's try this again there we go god he looks so upset looks like he saw the bullet right in front of his face and he was like well not much i can do now did a backflip when i killed him this connie is really good nice to have an actual you know hard-hitting bolt action sniper rifle there's a lot of semi-auto rifles in this game because of the the world war ii era i guess okay this is it guys thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed that if you did leave a like appreciate all the support in this series so far so uh yeah you guys know what to do subscribe for more and i will see you on the flip side fair burn has returned with intel that confirms the serious and urgent nature of operation kraken to the foreign be
