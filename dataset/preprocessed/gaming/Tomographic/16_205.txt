so the new fennec SMG aka the vector is an absolute beast in war zone and I think it's easily the best SMG in the game when it comes to anywhere below the 50 neo range so today I'm gonna be showing you how to build the best possible class setup for this brand-new SMG in war zone so I personally recommend pairing the vector with your preferred assault rifle or LMG I wouldn't use this as a main weapon to accompany a sniper rifle for instance you will absolutely burn through your ammo so don't expect to take down multiple opponents in a single mag so the build I use in war zone includes the said alas saber muzzle which is basically a monolithic suppressor on steroids you can see the comparison in stats here you get the normal bonuses of sounds oppression and damage range you also get the added bonus of a recoil control which works really well when paired with the 16-inch apex barrel which also adds damage range bullet velocity and recoil control I then use the Merc for grip for improved recoil control and hipfire accuracy alongside the 40 round mags as like I mentioned earlier the rate of fire of the vector is ridiculous so maximizing the amount of armor that you can put downrange is an absolute must with this gun and finally I use their tackle Azer for aim down sight speed aiming stability and aim walking steadiness as for the rest of my loadout I use the PKM for any medium to long range engagements and I have that set up like this a bunch of you recommended in my pee-can build video that I use the 3x optic over the stipple grip which I had last time and it's actually been working out really well in games so this is my newly updated PK and build and I think it's my favorite weapon to use alongside the vector so I'd highly recommend you try this combo because it works so well in warzone I'm aiming for maximum damage range and recall control with this particular vector build if those stats aren't quite as important to you you can definitely switch out the apex barrel for the integrated dead full suppressor this attachment offers the same bonuses as the apex barrel and Sabre suppressor with a reduction to the overall damage range and accuracy or with a slight increase to mobility and control now that you've freed up an extra attachment slot you can invest that into slave hand or your preferred optic and you can even use the no stock attachments help balance out the vectors overall mobility but that's all the information you need to design your optimal vector build for warzone I'm going to leave you now with some action-packed trios gameplay featuring Acula and Jack frags using this awesome PKM and vector loadout but with that said thank you very much for watching consider subscribing for more videos like this one and I
