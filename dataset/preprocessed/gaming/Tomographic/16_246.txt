[Music] so welcome to the first video of 2020 on the channel and also the first of the decade which is crazy to say a very happy New Year to every single one of you 2019 has been a great year for the channel and I decided that in this video I tell you a little bit about myself and kick off the new year with a Q&A video because it occurred to me recently that in all the years I've been making YouTube videos I've never really told you much about myself so today I'm gonna be asked with some of your most asked questions over the course of last year as well as some of the questions that I've been asked since I first started my channel over 4 years ago now that I put it like that this video is long overdue so let's get started how old are you and which part of the UK do you live in so I recently had my 25th birthday I say recently it was about four months ago now but I'm just holding on to my youth I guess to answer the second part I live in a place called Shropshire in the West Midlands which is between the Welsh border and Birmingham I won't go into any further detail than that long JK this is my castle don't come visit you're all peasants alright next question do you do YouTube as a job yes and no is how I'd answer that question YouTube is only part of what I do I guess the job description is I am now a content creator so I make videos on YouTube and I stream on Twitch and thanks to your support I've been doing this full-time for about four months now so yeah this is a really exciting point in my life and I feel really privileged to be in the position I am now I still remember talking with my old school friends about one day being a youtuber and making videos for an audience who share the same interests as you and most importantly to me building a community so the fact that I'm able to do this is a job now I mean I have to pinch myself every day because I really am living the dream and it's all because of you guys I suppose a follow-up question to that would be what did i do before I started YouTube well when I first started making YouTube videos I had just finished college I was studying art and design and I've always been quite a creative person and this course allowed me to experiment with a range of different art forms including my two personal favorites photography and graphic design so when I left college I decided I wanted to start a graphic design business and I actually found that much of my success from working for youtubers and twitch streamers making thumbnails and creating channel are like banners and logos etc I actually created all of my own graphics on this channel which really helped me to save money when I first started making my own videos I ran this business for over two years part-time alongside working jobs in retail and hospitality and eventually after making youtube videos for about a year I started taking my own channel a lot more seriously so I left that business behind and put all of my resources into YouTube because it was something that I've really enjoyed and my hard work was finally starting to pay off fast-forward to September 2019 and I was finally able to take the leap and fully focus on my career as a content creator this has been the best decision I've ever made and I haven't looked back since the next question is what hobbies do you have outside of gaming I mentioned that photography is something I really enjoy and that's definitely something I want to be more of in 2020 I guess I'll put up some pictures of some of my favorite photographs from the past few years 20:19 was a really hectic year for me so I didn't get the chance to take as many pictures as I would have liked to but you can guarantee that whenever the opportunity arises I'm always trying to capture the moment and taking photographs that's how I like to do that I also recently started playing guitar so that's definitely something I want to continue in the new year playing guitar is something that allows me to sort of switch off after you know being sat in front of a computer screen all day recording and editing it can be quite fatiguing at times so it allows me to unwind and learn a new skill in the process also since this became a full-time thing for me I've actually taken up running because I do spend a lot of time inside so keeping up my personal fitness and stamina is quite important to me what is your earliest memory of playing video games so I guess my earliest memory is playing Sonic the Hedgehog on a sega megadrive but don't remember how old i would have been but we're going back many years now and i remember playing that game to its actual death I mean the cartridge didn't even work anymore and to this day I guess I still blame dr. Robotnik the first game that I got hooked on as a kid and what probably kick-started my gaming hobby was a game called Beyond Good and Evil on the PlayStation 2 I mean that game was just ahead of its time you could solve puzzles and you could do racing and explore an open-world with really cool characters they're actually coming out with a beyond good and evil too in the not-so-distant future which I'm really looking forward to for a nostalgia reasons and also it looks really good so yeah be sure to keep an eye out for that one do you have a girlfriend I'm gonna answer this question honestly and from the heart so I actually came out of a relationship with my ex-girlfriend not too long ago now it was a relationship that was very important to me but one that I sadly couldn't hold on to and I had to try and move on and it took me a long time to accept that my routine is so complicated and though I felt like she fit into my life I had to understand that I no longer fit into hers and it was time to let go this was around the same point that I decided to go full-time so thankfully I had the support of my community but I don't think I was able to enjoy those early moments of going full-time as much as I would have liked to because of the effect that the breakup had on me now although I'm in a much better place and the only focus in my life at the moment is my career and my house the way I see it if I'm able to focus on both of those two things and someone comes into my life that's able to fit into this hectic puzzle then I guess I'd be willing to open up again but for now it's full steam ahead and I'm only looking upwards as we head into the new year how did you meet Akio Fogler and stone and have you ever met any of them in real life I do get this question quite a lot and I'm gonna try and keep this answer as short as possible but when I first started YouTube one of the first games I covered was a free-to-play first-person shooter called dirty bomb I'm sure some of you remember the name or have played the game before but it's a game that I truly fell in love with and it's actually where I'm at occupy he's been telling me off a lot recently because I keep calling him occupy even though I've been calling him Connor which is his real name for the entirety of our friendship but I'm not sure if everyone knows that and stone and Fogler have been calling him occupy for so long now that I guess I've just been doing it for continuity reasons but don't worry acolyte you'll always be Connor to me so back to how we met I actually DM Connor I slid into his DMS and unfortunately YouTube got rid of their private messaging function a few years ago now so I can't actually see what I initially said but I remember stumbling across a very particular YouTube video from a cue light that was focusing on Vasili which was one of the sniper classes in xxx bomb I just remember watching and thinking damn this guy's good at video games and being new to PC gaming I thought I need someone to carry me 4 years later and things haven't really changed but it seemed like a great opportunity to collaborate with someone who shared a similar editing and commentary style as me and [ __ ] they're not channels were around a similar point in terms of subscribers and that's something I'd recommend if you wanted to start out on YouTube and collaborate with other content creators be realistic and reach out to people who around the same channel size as you make some friends in the process and ultimately grow your channels together four years later and Acula isn't just some guy that I make youtube videos with he's my best friend and before YouTube became a bigger thing for both of us and we didn't need to worry about content we would play every day just hang out with each other and I think that's the beauty of our friend group as a whole and why people enjoy watching us play sure we all have our own things going on as content creators but when we get together to play games we're not just doing it for the sake of content we have a real underlying friendship and we just want to see each other succeed a rising tide lifts all ships as they say we all help each other out and expect nothing in return so how did Fogler and stone come into the picture well at the time acolyte was blowing up on pub G and I think stone was looking for some more creators to play with and he got in touch with Connor Connor introduced me to stone and I deemed Fogler after watching a video that he made on pop G it was one of his hit man videos and myself immaculate I've been playing duo's on pub G for so long that it made sense to branch out and try and form a squad eventually the four of us got together and the first squad was formed and yes it's fast anyone that says fats will be outcasts you can't sit with us I'm really grateful for the bond that myself and my friends share I mean we're basically brothers at this point and I attribute a lot of my success to my friends and accurate in particular being by his side from the very start it's just made me so proud to watch his channel grow into what is now and I guess I just really appreciate him bringing me along for the ride we've made some great content over the years and 2020 is going to be no different unfortunately we've never met before but when we do we're gonna break the Internet and now it's time to give you the answer you've all been waiting for four years has taken me to get to this point it's a big deal Tom it's the big deal it's just her face reveal hey four years later I'm finally doing a face reveal guys why now I suppose the question why now why not honestly like I went full-time if you didn't know I probably mentioned this in the earlier part of the video I'm actually recording this part before I do the Q&A so when I went full-time I kind of took a step back and just try to assess the assess the channel on the whole and the direction I want to go I mean I'm talking about YouTube and twitch now before it was just YouTube for me but I couldn't have gone full time without streaming it's as simple as that like the support I've had on Twitch has enabled me to turn this into a job but I just enjoy making videos and I've always been about quality of a quantity there's a lot of videos that go to waste I'll be honest I'm very picky when it comes to the stuff I put on my channel sometimes I'll spend hours editing a video and then I'll wash it back at the very end and I'll be like you know what it's not good enough you guys might think it's good enough but at the end of the day you know it's my channel I'll post what I enjoy and what I'm happy to present to an audience and if it's not a discrete to the channel you know what that's gone to the question of why and why I'm doing a face reveal at this point because a lot of people would do it for like a big subscriber milestone or you know it's usually something along those lines I always had the intention of doing a face of real but it's been talked about for so long now amongst my audience and my friends like I actually haven't told the guys that I'm even doing a face reveal so this will be new to them as well hi guys how you doing sorry acolyte you're now the only anonymous member of the fast squad but yeah in terms of my personal reasons for doing this it's never really been that big of a deal to me I just wanted to make sure I did it when I was ready I wasn't expecting four years later to be the point that I'd do it let's be honest the main reason is that when you first start a YouTube channel you make sure that you buy the essential equipment and for me a camera wasn't one of those pieces of equipment like I wanted to invest in high quality stuff as much as I wanted to do YouTube and I wanted to be in this position I'm in now you never know where it's gonna go when you first start so you don't want to spend an arm and a leg unless you're really confident in the content that you're bringing to the table and that you know you've got an audience that's gonna watch it I just built my first gaming computer I'd never played on PC before and right as I built my PC is when I'd started my youtube channel and I was ready to start uploading videos first game I purchased was GTA 5 and I made a short film which is the very first video on my channel I'll link on the description actually because that's probably quite interesting to watch scene it was water as it was my first video I'm pretty proud of it the editing was fairly decent considering I had no past experience with editing videos so yeah like I said I posted that GTA 5 short film and after that I posted a bunch of dirty bomb content which was a really fun fps it's actually where I met acolyte I probably spoke about this earlier in the video as well but man I really enjoyed that game and I posted a lot of videos on it it's actually where I started um and I probably would have never met a queue like had I not played that game it's kind of crazy to think about but I just want to make sure I was spending the money in the right places when I first started youtube having just bought a gaming PC that already took quite a chunk out of my budget so yeah the rest of the stuff I spent on like a microphone good pair of headphones which I'm still using to this day actually audio-technica empty em m50x see i forgot the name has been that long now I actually have two pairs of these nothing's wrong with the one pair it's just that I've got one I use for traveling and then born just stays plugged into my computer at all times so yeah a really good pair of headphones and I'm obviously using a different microphone now but I had a decent microphone at the time it was just a USB mic but in terms of audio quality was pretty good for it at the time I started like I said there's no promises when you start a YouTube channel you don't know that it's gonna be successful I've been recording for 15 minutes now I've probably only got about 5 minutes worth of footage I keeps in here just cuz this is so strange sitting in front of a camera for the first time in four years it's weird yeah apologies to anyone who didn't want to see my face and like the unanimity and the mystery behind the voice but it's time I'm ready I've actually been going to a lot of events and stuff recently and not having a face associated with tomographic it's been weird the kids I go to these events and obviously I've been speaking with people who you know the companies I'm not really meeting the people that I've been talking with because they have no idea what I look like and I have no idea who to approach it's the same for them as well you know um so a lot of the time I'm just getting texts like meet me here and then a meeting room and it's like oh hi it's a bit weird I guess I kind of want to make my content a bit more personal as well and that doesn't mean I'm gonna be doing face cams in my videos I don't think I ever will to be honest it's not the content I want to be making some videos I'm sure at work they'd be fine but it takes up real estate it's free real estate it takes up real estate in the video facecam it the more I've always said this the more elements you have in a video the more distracting is for a viewer so for me it's always gameplay first I often find when I watch people who use a face cam I'll be looking at them talking instead of looking at the gameplay that they're trying to showcase so yeah it just works for me the content won't really be changing I just want to make this a one-off video and then other videos that are like this in the future then sure I'll do a face cam or if I go to an event where it makes sense to document the day I'll probably record it and things on social media as well it'd be cool to just well I don't make things a bit more personal I've always wanted to do that I've done my best to do that as much as possible without you know having my face associated with the channel I know it's very strange to hear a creators voice or someone you've been watching for so long I mean if you've been here for four years and you're now seeing my face for the first time I imagine it is quite strange for some reason the questions been coming up a lot recently I got more than ever and I don't know why but maybe that's the reason it's just been on my mind constantly these past few months since going full-time like I said I want to make my content a bit more personal and be more open about myself and just the direction of the channel to be honest I think that's all I wanted to say on camera obviously thank you is a is another thing I should be saying whilst I'm you know able to directly connect with you I think the word you're looking for is address Tom yeah just thank you so much for support like 20-19 has been an insane year for me so many ups and so many downs but to be honest like I'm I'm so proud of what my content has turned into I've posted some of my best videos in 2019 I'm really proud of the content and obviously I'd love to increase the consistency I've been I've been so focused on other other things going on my personal life as well as making content and I'll never rush a video so it is what it is I guess I'm actually looking to move to a new place soon so that's been taking up long time but yeah it's it's something I want to continue in 2020 I'm sure I'll be making some even better videos in the new year but yeah just thank you all so much for support it's really been life-changing to be honest I wouldn't be in the position I am now without you guys watching these videos and your support on Twitch as well if you didn't know I've been streaming regularly on Twitch that's kind of taking up a lot of my time but I'm really enjoying it just interacting with people who stop by the stream and regulars who show up everyday I love it it's like we're building such like a sense of community over there the only thing I really I'm trying to improve right now where I live it's really bad in terms of internet connection so I'm only able to upload at 720p on switch as soon as I get a good internet connection the streams will be crisp yeah I think that's everything I wanted to talk about on camera yeah just again thank you all so much I really appreciate you watching the videos and just showing support it really means the world and yeah oh it all to you that's it for this video I guess I'll see you in the next one it probably won't be a video where I'm showing my face but it's done now the face of real has been done you can stop asking me and anyone that does in the future you can redirect them to this video right thank you all for watching I hope you enjoyed it and yeah here's to 2020 it's gonna be a great year and I hope you'll be there with me thank you very much goodbye [Laughter] [Music] you
