sort them out or capture the objective got him look at his [ __ ] like uh it was worth dying to be sent to the google access taylor hello everyone and welcome back to the channel so i have an absolute blind of a match to show you today playing with my good friends acolyte and jack frags and this was the match that i realized just how much of a game changer the high alert perk is in warzone especially if you typically run a sniper as your secondary like myself so hyalure if you don't know is a perk that pulses in the direction of enemy players whenever an enemy outside of your view can see you and at times this perk feels like an absolute cheat code and allows you to pull off some insane reaction shots like you're about to see in today's gameplay now you do need to give up the ghost perk at the point where you would usually take your second loadout but for me as an aggressive player i don't always mind being on the enemy's uav as often times it forces players to push you before their uev expires meaning they almost always put themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to positioning and you can easily catch those players off guard if you have decent awareness yeah right so i'm using the brand new reactive ffar blueprint which just looks awesome alongside my trusty kana ak and i've had to make some changes to my ffar build since the cold war suppressors among other attachments are currently broken but the updated class setups are on the screen for you now and you can see them listed in the description below as always but without further ado leave a like on the video for this banger of a match and subscribe for more like this we're getting very close to 300 000 subscribers now so your support is very much appreciated thank you for watching enjoy the gameplay and i will catch you legends in the next one scorpion here tom where's the scorpion i've got it oh cool i want to see it in third person yeah yeah i squashed one of them and i've actually never
