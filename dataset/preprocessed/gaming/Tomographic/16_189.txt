dead he beats me humble you should have him oh he was pissed oh angry what do you mean what happened he screamed dude what's up guys and welcome back to another video so i've just got to say a quick thank you before i show you today's khan 98 setup the support that you guys have been showing me lately has been absolutely insane and honestly my life has completely changed because of it i've been chasing this dream for about five years now and my content has changed and evolved a lot during that time the release of warzone in particular has enabled me to really make a name for myself in this space and without sounding too cliche i simply would not be where i am right now without you guys watching and supporting my content it only feels like yesterday that we surpassed 100k subscribers and we're now less than 5k subs away from 200 000 which is just incredible i mean all i can really say is thank you and i'm very happy to have you all here so this is the class setup that i'm using on my karna a8 today the only major difference from my last build is that i'm using the vrk three times optic instead of the sniper scope it just allows me to play a bit more aggressive and track my targets easier at those closer ranges where the kanei a shines the khan 98 if you didn't know is actually one of the only snipers that can down your opponent with just two shots to the chest below 150 meters when compared to the three shots that it takes with the ax-50 and hdr and it is still a one-hit headshot at all ranges you can also see much more clearly outside the scope which makes snapping to multiple targets at once an absolute breeze so i've got a full match to show you now playing with my friends acolyte study and stomach 64. there's some great teamwork in this one and i think this round does a good job at demonstrating the power of the car 98 when you play within its most effective range with that said make sure to leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it subscribe if you haven't already and help me to reach that 200k subscriber milestone thank you for watching as always and i'll catch you guys in the next one on purple the wall green mark he pronounced that team nice

house left a fire house i knocked choking you it's the left of fire break him gonna push his teammates it was he dead silence as well when i have a cluster i need to start running with it because you're you have like fist movement yeah that's the cheeky little play then you don't have to drop one of your weapons together yeah to get the movements to be boosted yeah it's a good quarter what did you say tom sorry i missed that you know the cluster strike because it's just a laser but if you hold it out when you run you'll have fist movement speed oh okay okay there they are they're in there
