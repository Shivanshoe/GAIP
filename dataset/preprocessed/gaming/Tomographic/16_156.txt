it's content day in warzone and rebirth island has just been added and i've just won my first game playing with stoddy and westy unfortunately the new mode is trios only but you know hopefully we get quads soon and we can play the normal battle royale mode but the current mode has a respawn system in place where if you die as long as one of you is alive there will be a countdown timer that will then respawn you back into the game i am actually using the milano smg in this gameplay even though i refer to it as the mac 10 a million times and i mean this weapon performed pretty well for me i'll be honest it's gonna get very confusing with the amount of uzi variants that are in the game right now that's just something we're gonna have to deal with but um enjoy the gameplay leave a like on the video if you enjoyed it subscribe for more and i'll catch you legends in the next one i think like through that gap there hang on there no go in there drop down and boom we made it and am i we made it

the building where's the guy that he's inside the ground floor he's inside this building right now oh okay right at me where do you look well his name is accusation his name is accusation i'm being shot from somewhere else hang on a minute tommo is back tomo is back i'm on the ground pretty confident he's using a name but of some some delineation [Music] it's death then he's not pushed me yet rick turn off the beam one second he's underneath me still he was there right here right here yeah but he's gonna have his team with him surely his whole team's gonna be maybe so he's gone mate maybe he's gone solo right because like a member of one direction he's gone is it safe to grab my stuff uh no because he's still in the building below he's just still on orange you just tried to shoot me that was the rpk i saw fire station costs are adjusted i mean i'm sitting in here but i'm also terrified because i last time i peeked for 0.2 seconds he immediately beamed i'm pretty sure he's just sitting in there somewhere be careful okay i've not seen a move i've not heard anything outside i saw him once and then i can't buy the one thing i can't buy a uav short of money on it just sneak away

three uh three teams left guys let's save the uav for a second this lobby is empty with this with this big open circle i think this i think the circle should become more dynamic like if there's less
