i'm making it look too easy connor i cannot believe the series of events that just happened on that building so i need to leave i just died to full damage after all that yeah i think i went into a full nosedive and i needed a bit more time to pull my shoe hello my friends the day is finally upon us and it's not long now until each of you gets to try out battlefield 2042 for the first time i was lucky enough to be invited to play the beta early along with a bunch of other content creators and streamers so firstly a big thank you to ea and dice for allowing me to record some early gameplay and trust me i know you're all eager to jump into the beta but this one is well worth a watch come back later if you have to but i hit some ridiculous shots in this video we only got to record for a couple of hours but i'm eager to jump back into the open beta starting today the 6th of october for those of you that pre-ordered or are current ea play members it then opens up to everybody else on the 8th and ending shortly after between the 9th and the 10th of october so not longer all to get acquainted with the game for the first time which is a shame but i already know that this beta is going to leave you all wanting more the team at dice really wanted to stress that this game has come leaps and bounds since the version of 2042 that we're playing on for the beta but it was still a ridiculous amount of fun regardless and the early time i got to spend with the game absolutely blew my expectations out of the water and i really do hope that this experience is everything that you guys have been hoping for as well i've got plenty more to show you throughout the week so strap in and make sure you subscribe because things are about to get crazy i'd really appreciate it if you could drop a like for the algorithm as i'm not the only one posting gameplay today as i said earlier but there is going to be so much content for you guys to single teeth into whether you're playing or just watching with all of that being said though i hope you enjoy the gameplay and the beta of course and i will catch you legends in the next one battlefield's back baby everyone's just firing at

good and it has to reload it too it's not just like a cooldown thing oh it's a good vantage point i'm in you're in are you in though okay level five and i'm only four i've been playing longer than you
