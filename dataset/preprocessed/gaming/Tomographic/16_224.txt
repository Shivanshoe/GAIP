hey guys it's tom here and welcome back to another warzone video now in today's video i have a very special class setup that i wanted to share with you so you might have noticed that more and more players have started using the m13 assault rifle in warzone lately and there's a good reason for that it might not have the highest damage output but this thing is an absolute laser beam and i think i've found the perfect combination of attachments to use with this weapon you want to use the monolithic suppressor and tempest marksman barrel giving you high bullet velocity sound suppression and damage range then you want to equip the tack laser for aiming stability and aim down size speed and what i personally think takes this weapon to a whole other level is the vlk three-time zoom optic which allows you to compete at some pretty insane ranges for an assault rifle with minimal impact your ads speed the secondary that i use alongside the m13 is the mp7 smg which i have set up like this great for close quarter battles and having two fully auto weapons with 60 round magazines and separate ammo types is a beamer's dream you just have to try this loadout but with that said make sure you're subscribed turn on those notifications so that you don't miss out on any future war zone videos and i will see you in the next one let's see a guy over this way on green oh yeah we have a goo lager they're just laying it on the roof that'd oh yeah he must be down the side in the doorway in the doorway isn't he yeah he's in the doorway hey orange blocker hey essay kill the guy oh he was in the bin that was a pro yeah that was a proper flip around that guy pretty sure there's one more in here yeah i think there was one he's in the bin then i killed him and sent him back to it pushing the
