guys this one hurts okay but i think it's time that we say goodbye to the khan i8 for a little while we hit so many clips but now i have to let you go [Music] yeah that's right there's a new aggressive sniper rifle in town and its name is the swiss k31 after the most recent mid-season update to war zone many of the cold war snipers have now seen significant buffs like the new sound moderator changes and the 5mw laser now performing like the tack laser from modern warfare increasing game stability and significantly decreasing aim down sight speed all of these things combined have helped to make the k31 my new go-to sniper rifle for running and gunning and i absolutely love it having a magazine for speedy reloads 2 instead of individually feeding the rounds into the car 98 has made the window of opportunity for hitting some insane back-to-back snipes even shorter i'm telling you this gun is a clip machine and you're gonna see a lot more of it in your matches i've got a couple of matches to show you today playing with my friends jack frags and handler and the class setup for the following gameplay is on the screen for you now but with that said leave a like for the algorithm subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one was it i've found a place it's one of the most iconic lines of dialogue yeah yeah yeah i mean the little delivery time it's the first that comes to mind for me yeah it's just it really sticks in your brain i mean you can tell by how quickly that quote came to my head when i was trying to oh i don't want bro uh

just did you said bruce willis saying random stuff now i don't know about this no i'm not hearing anything thank you oh top tower fire nice good shot no airstrike one of them they have to come out in a second gas is moving boys just is it the wall i think hold them if you need to stun them with the gathering down this guy there should be one more this guy's running into my flames he's going to come out that same way he's done going out it was done he's beaming him nice there's a specialist bonus though i'm going for it yeah oh two in there just rush rush over where do you want to go hill i have to like be here or something moving down okay come on ryan he's going to be here you got him then an armor on a guy broke one gas towards me have down one at the bottom oh no i'm dead how many times got it down on one by the truck uh two left up ready son yeah all dead oh dude you're a legend big plays i'm stuck in the open now drinking you can cover me when i land on orange yep i'm trying to get that orange right now got a guy here i did down one up hill like south west but trying to look higher up on the hill oh good game boys good game enjoyed that a lot did you enjoy when you got run over for science listen listen we've got to test these things okay do you think bruce willis knows that he's in war zone i bet disney owns them yeah they don't have them they're throwing everything down you were bought by disney yeah okay how much did they pay for it may well go way back oh this guy's going for it he got it he's got it huh i'm bailing really popular spot isn't it i don't know it fills me out of all the things they've added to the map mm-hmm maybe this is the best yeah like people actually wanting to go there you know yeah he's on green ryan very top yeah right at the top all right i played tom we fired him so hard can i land with you uh yeah yeah i didn't expect the attack helicopter to be there in normal yeah they're in plunder and they're so annoying no for for this one if you take that out it drops something okay somebody's dropping in where is it yeah he's right almost there that fight you're on the roof something yeah oh that's throwing knife oh hello down that guy oh play here is it somebody else is dropping in that guy yeah another one on me i'm in trouble no i just jumped off here on me guys coming should get an underline there tom yeah him a little bit oh it says the specialist ted that's ryan why is this crate like highlighted in red because we have a specialist bonus it's the rap thing okay so it scans claymores and stuff let's try this tundra finds results to making his own stream sniper mode jack by just naming himself a user with a bunch of numbers you know what that's a great idea it's a great idea you really need it when you play multiplayer yeah you need some rocket launchers right take out my chat i'm saying that's from the vault oh just hit i'm on that guy okay so they must have done the dude what the hell man okay so do you think they put that in just to stop roof campus in downtown is that what that's for i guess but it's not very fair to the people who wait where is it no it's not fair but it's there like i think if you're on top of that roof i don't think the heli would oh god they've rest up there you can buy there's a bike station on the roof no way never mind i'm just gonna snipe the pilot hang on oh i did you can do that wait why maybe you just hit it no no no no no no no i just got a red headshot hit marker by shooting where the pilot is is there a is there a man in there though is there a figure i was joking i didn't think it would actually happen you're kidding i was doing it for a laugh and noah laughed and then it happened and now i'm the one let me just stop you right there tom okay it turns out jack was right and you can't actually snipe the pile out of these helis it was just really good timing on my part and i did the last bit of damage to the heli which is why i thought i headshot the pilot i mean it looked like i did right and uh it didn't say vehicle disabled anywhere so i just assumed that that was a possibility but no turns out you can't and sadly myth busted but what if they put like a multi-lock missile launcher in it or something you know something new something crazy oh they jumped off there this way moving i'll get a uav yeah that was orange thanks i'm down see me further back rambo oh i'm getting high alerted uh top of hospital he's coming over now in the valley he needs to raise his buddies doesn't he we've just down both of them uh i finished one finish he got out sniped by another dude yeah i gotta kill for top hospital under the bridge okay are we gonna zone these yeah baby yeah nice shots sniper's so good man playing enough i'm gonna move i gave up yeah just gave up uh we could get cell phrases maybe or uav yeah it's a risk what was somebody top hospital earlier i downed him and got the kill okay why is there a discount stuff oh we've got specialists so the hard line yeah we have specialists yeah oh someone just shot at us then i think i didn't hear anything twins up on twins oh yeah yeah that one hello next to it ground level oh yeah down the guy on the orange roof just up in here i've been beamed absolutely beamed thank you stay alive you stay with me that's horrible yeah i don't like the voice it's like mono
