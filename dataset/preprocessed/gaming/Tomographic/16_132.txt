night someone just sniped at me as well as they went down in the truck nickel yep i might have an angle and a thick armor bound nice there's a collateral cloud but they're still present i collateraled them we need to get in inside them holy the collateral jeep snipe come on and there it is [Music] yo what's up everyone and welcome back to the channel so today i'm using the lw3 sniper rifle with a three-time scope and the fennec smg which i've seen requests for in my comments for a few weeks now so i thought i'd deliver in this video you're welcome now don't get me wrong the fennec or the vector whatever you want to call it is a more than capable smg sadly it's just overshadowed by the likes of the mac 10 which is currently dominating war zone in the minute but you know me i refuse to become a slave to the meta even if it gets me killed more times than i'd like to admit anyway i wanted to jump straight into the gameplay today so the loadouts are on the screen for you now and i'm playing trios with study and jack frags in this one so without further ado drop a like if you like and subscribe for more like this we should be at the 300k subscriber milestone around the time i post this video so thank you all so much for the support i really do appreciate it more than you know so onwards and upwards from here and trust me when i say we are just getting started so stay safe out there and i will catch you absolute legends in the next one i'm off to the side they're gonna they're gonna rush you somewhere okay damn he was already hitting the middah they all had weapons there

to the right of that ping yep yep no eyes on him unfortunately i was so tunnel vision then he blended in so well he's gonna go live there actually literally on green oh this vector is good but it just rinses through ammo too fast trying to use it alongside a sniper back i'm just covering from further back they're going right now on blue they're probably going to jump off from the right side i want to move further left actually i was expecting the third just not for him to be stacked on his teammates like that [Music] one more see what you mean about this rare call ready it's behind the concrete barricade of the half hill stud close towards your blue like level of your blooping yeah there you go he was hard to see did he lend it in so good i d4 gillies my god strong skin well all the pros
