don't want to ruin your ace here um i appreciate that i mean i'm just gonna call them out for you dawg my anti-passive nature makes me want to push down that hallway but the bombs here so you can if you want there's nobody at that point i pinged earlier oh he's right there he's right next to you on the other side of the wall he's running down the hall oh there you go there's the ace hell yeah dude great comms there all right what's up everyone and welcome back to my new favorite game zero hour honestly i've been having an absolute blast with this game recently whether that's with friends or just solo queuing with randoms this game just speaks to me and the potential for zero hour is just so exciting i mean look they arguably just had their best update yet what is that maybe i'm a bit biased because they did just add my very own tomographic watch to the game which you can get for free by the way if you enter kotomo in the game store like this okay fine i digress but the game really has come a very long way in such a short amount of time zero hour is compared to rainbow six siege quite a bit from people that don't really understand the game and are just judging it based on face value yes the comparisons are definitely there but in terms of the game mechanics this game has a real grasp on that tactical gritty feel something that sadly rainbow six siege lost sight of along the way and now just a few years later that game feels more like overwatch than it does a tactical shooter which you know it was originally marketed to good job be yeah but there are no classes in this game you just choose your weapon and your equipment and you're good to go it's enough to keep the game engaging for me because the moments that happen in this game are what keep me coming back for more oh i got that guy he's on the staircase careful good frank yes dude beautiful fragment that was great with that being said let's just get into the gameplay shall we leave a like for the algorithm subscribe for more like this and i will catch you legends in the next one oh and i promise there's more than just one map in this game by the way i've realized that i just always seem to have my best games on terra house so enjoy the gameplay i used to put a center but they start noticing it for some reason like i don't know why they're looking there i'll be a spy cam just outside your room ricky i always go gotcha can you just move over a little bit won't let me out thanks i'm a little wide yeah you fake boy balcony dead i think okay give me this balcony am i right oh yeah he's right here okay now he's dead yeah yeah i don't think you got him yeah there's only one body here think about this door oh he's got a camera on the stairs nice i'm gonna watch your camera and then if he gets in front of the door i'll tell you to shoot shoot now you got one you got that guy one is on the lower part of the staircase aiming a similar angle opens up her as well they're returning fire now one up there somewhere i'm gonna burn that ammo yeah he's still there left of the door he's opened it fragging damn almost got him i was like you're afraid all right that one's dead gonna try and hold this door here we got the door open oh nice dude jesus look at this stacking bodies you got one going lights was that from my side that's all i saw oh i hear him they're coming they're right outside that door one's a repellent roof one's got a right shield he's in killed the body stacking up on him come on give me your toes give me a kneecap anything oh let me reload stay there stay right there you're nuts bro you're nuts oh you should have seen that dude i was watching that that was so funny possibly i heard him repel up yeah oh yeah he's coming down what you got let's take the royal shield shall we defender with the right shield let's go he's on the staircase coming you're coming right up underneath him he's looking for you two of them yeah he sees me he probably thinks i'm on his team oh balcony i don't actually know what i'm gonna do here i've kind of ruined myself oh no i just died the same way i killed the other guy why did you take the shield he said memes he's in on your right flopper just come in now oh my god that shotgun is ruthless blew your face off oh i thought he got off her pill he's still on rappel i'm gonna push out and get him disgusting am i the only one left oh crap you undo then take uh top stairs maybe push down from roof i could just die immediately that's fine too definitely going these stairs oh he's got the shotgun that's tough [ __ ] my he life start much of a chance though man it's a shame what i was looking at yeah one was on the staircase man it's in the right room other than the left he's prone [ __ ] dude you got a little wild in there oh it did it's so funny when you're prone though because you've got like barely any movements you're just wriggling around trying to be the first to reload like this creep around oh that's so good we're gonna go with the mp7 for this one get around man well played i like these guys it helps to have teammates who actually use cons again yeah yeah let's do mvgs yeah for sure if we still got them yeah actually don't have much of an issue finding people who use mics in this game which is great i think it's probably because the game is like so small right now i don't think i've had any bad experiences yet i mean i think it's because the game's so tactical if you try to be a dick you're just going to ruin the experience for yourself so let's get my lineup a couple of these windows this is very i risque they're on this floor yeah far end look at my watch it's so cool nice to take the stairs no one in that corner take that camera out there's gonna be someone right here i know it one downstairs one on the stairs as well right where i killed the guy it's upstairs upstairs might be uh roof oh nice you got him good stuff you might be able to bank an aid off that wall mullen co it looks good bath into your right flop i done some damage to him at least unlucky man he's in the uh the corridor to your left ricky who's at that door just holding it the main one leading from stairs there's a hostage room just in that door oh yeah good shots did that guy just say geet got the left covered i was in the bathroom oh nate in that bathroom and he's dead okay i'm gonna try and move over there he's in the bathroom there's a little window to your right of that door right there yeah toss it in this window's tricky though oh my god the rebound come on man so i'm going to ruin him now kick this door down [Music] oh come on man just use my own plan against me worst night in my life use my own tactics against me they're evolving dude they are evolving around the left corner round is this five see if this guy can clutch it oh traded though literally the worst possible timing okay we need to start pulling our weight now now stamina guard lights see how this pans out oh my god they're already here right outside the store it's one nice two oh no oh i got him got three down here one left lay down lay down he can't find me i'm good i'm good i've got frag up there i'm taking top floor sound like the repaired up top one more he went down that was a crazy start to the round that was a door nevermind he opened it yeah i thought i'm here if you need to switch he's down very good yep how do you report i've already confirmed it you just press f when you're over their body the last one's probably main entrance again yeah yeah he's got a right shield oh my god dude great round everyone i think maybe let two people inside that entire time i was literally playing gatekeeper at the main entrance i heard him dropping like crazy i was like you staring it up yeah my boy's popping off well let him hit the power first so they didn't even have their mvgs on youtube they felt safe yeah i'm definitely gonna try a different tactic this time i won't be doing that again oh damn is that friendly yeah okay that's balcony window right i think so yeah yeah trying to hold roof access they're probably shooting through windows literally just one tap that one's right outside this door yep it's cracked open oh no there's two of them top stairs might have killed one of them yeah yeah confirmed one top roof entering now main green door walking slowly come off the pale balcony okay they're coming in our floor yep you can see them on my spy cam now walking in perfect you're good with your nades man there's another one behind him right there's another one on the stairs just behind the door yeah you're right uh yeah he's he's coming in now same door buddy stacked up behind him it's definitely not fair that i'm able to give my teammates calls whilst i'm dead but the game's still early access so yeah you got that guy there's another one coming in behind him now same position same position moving in slowly yeah shoot now crouch tight crouch right perfect i'm lucky they've taken out so many of these cams now you got this dude i believe are they going straight for the views get there beauty i couldn't even see yeah i don't know there's only the stair access right so gg come to you like your vids tom that's hot dude good game guys that was great great fun love this game so good [Music] uh [Music]
