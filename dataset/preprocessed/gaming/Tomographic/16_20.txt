there he is look [Music] no way oh he instantly gave up as well wait someone's looking at me hi look this way what is that flinch man i couldn't even see him my scream was shaking so much he's beat me through the turn as well hang on this doesn't look right at all why am i so low to the ground i'm gonna crash into peak what's going on i'm actually gonna crash uh well that's perfectly normal isn't it oh there's many men coming for this oh my god he was coming for the melee i'm just an innocent man yeah where's the guy oh no no no no i hate this pistol step on the trees step on the tree where are you taking me where are you taking us oh my god he threw that man in a hole and you return to the battlefield lose and your fight is over this place is a maze i can just land exactly on my loadout we do love that m4a1 and the ax50 didn't expect to be using this loadout anytime soon but here we are i'll put the loadouts on screen for you now shall i look at that ax50 sexiest sniper in the game i want to get restock but i'll be too risky there he is body shot i'm gonna do that much damage unfortunately i need the head shot can i grab my loadout before i fight him he's running along here then if he's in that house on the left or at the very top there oh he's there that's what we're looking for and we're off i do love the flowing water on caldera where that come from oh my god the flinch please the flinch here we go broke him need that head shot what's up there again shoot me through the trees now are you he's even got a sniper rifle he's doing like one hp damage to me i'm wasting place here go and peek it boom it's gonna sell froze if i'm not quick enough oh it was iron man love your 3000 okay that was toxic oh why can't i get their game come on oh this guy's shooting at me that one hit damn it i forgot not to leave the x50 so different didn't have much on him i have the high ground now anakin there boop too much foliage oh that felt good that sound is so satisfying to the area watch the skies you like her that's not good jesus man jumped off the balloon didn't he landed right on me with his loadout fair play it was a jeep there i'm definitely getting reported for that one no chance that's that one slide first shot two that was nice oh that was did you see that my scope didn't load when i zoomed in i think i would have seen that guy otherwise there it is still still for me shoot me please i'm grabbing my guns thank you oh what did i just say huh he's on the gondola mad lad i have one of them it's like wall hacks in warzone don't you know oh my god the pocket lost in this game is so annoying if you think i'm gonna run out of snapshot grenades you can think again unlimited power he's running away the haldi you could say anything in those deathcoms instead you sniff down your microphone hello how's he got tempered what was the gulaga let's find someone are you kidding me why does melee suck so hard on pc wait if that hit me what yet melee is so bs man that was controller i would have lunged through the door and met laid someone on the other side of the map unload all on his face with bullets i mean it's a jeep down there look at him go peak is absolutely massive now i still want to see it get demolished but it looks a little better oh that's scary do i take the balloon into the zone target right here do i drive make sure this is clear looks good let's take the balloon the enemy won this bell but why do i play this video game i just latched on to it as well here's something cool you might not have seen if you've watched the uh the kong vs godzilla movie you'll know that this is king kong's hollow earth axe gives you a good idea of just how massive king kong's gonna be if this is just the axe there's someone below me just dropping in apologies for landing on your head i'm just gonna take your stuff now and be on my way that cash drop hasn't been taken yet oh is that perk don't mind if i do i thought it was a c4 trying to load out without getting gunned down immediately someone took the cash draw from around here where's that guy yeah it is deleted another one where is he if i'd be inside the building but oh he's out there just looked at me with high alert game over buddy i'm sorry that perk exists i never would have seen you otherwise maybe i'm just hearing things what is that have got an easy headshot there shot a bit too quickly oh shots out there too look at those guys got the brake gas is closing in relocating the safe zone there he is big mistake and that is why you don't go for the repeat when you know a sniper's looking at you if you repeat that angle chances are you're going to lose your head said enemy dropping in but i was at him driving away in the car no what the hell that's the guy i just killed got his stuff back and dipped how was that no headshot must hit him in the neck come on i do have snapshot grenades there you are now stay dead enemy uav above that means they're in my vicinity doesn't it it's the buy station nearby keep the armor box just in case oh god damn i'm having fun with this x50 i can't lie it's not the most reliable thing in the world but definitely viable sometimes it's not all about damage range velocity if you look good you feel good and there's no better looking gun let's be honest i'm just gonna follow the circle around try and sweep up any stragglers there's one he's got no place hit me in the face get to the new safe zone gas is closing missed the flinch is so bad now i swear it's been increased that's just the modern warfare guns i've tried to stop people from using them i'll never stop okay how many advantages you give the vanguard guns well the warfare guns still hit different feels so much better mechanically to me as well there was a fire sale too busy fighting oh god there's a sniper glint there game over just gonna run through this house and if they're at all nobody's in here there's a guy everyone's running tempered come on there it is he's got self-respect he's dead to gas anyway oh he's definitely dead to gas so many angles i'd even look on this map still 23 people in this match oh no guess it's right on your tail ah that hurts that was definitely a headshot if it was any other gun someone's died right here i'll move now leave that guy where the hell did you die from i heard shots i should have won that fight oh no i'm dead no oh man i just saw him last second we look at this guy xm4 as well this thing absolutely dominates at the moment just gonna spectate this out steps bonnie hops on this man someone said there were your bicks this guy's at seven kills at the moment it's got the heartbeat sensor out ace rimmer interesting username i'm not entirely sure what this gun is looks like the uh well gun but 100 sure with my vanguard guns i don't know what is and what isn't in the game cluster strike there as well okay he still hasn't how did he survive that with no place i think the b-hops actually saved his life there we go that's it this guy's absolutely fearless full sprinting into an open hangar look at him not even check the heartbeat that guy just got killed checking his though wasn't ready for the aggressive push i think he's being a bit too aggressive at the moment he's got 10 kills right now she needs to slow down a little bit and he got killed climbing a ladder by richie pegleg himself three kills to his name the tortoise beats the hare once again please don't climb that ladder richie whatever you do oh god he's gonna make the same fate he's fine why are these last two players one of them died to the gas oh is he on the roof come on richie you've got this he's coughing reposition keep him in the gas yes just go prone in these bushes or something good you hear him oh richie no how are you surviving the gas so long he must have had the uh pds system whatever it's called good game unlucky richie good effort man excellent game thank you for that really good why is he so nice i'm not used to these lobbies don't know how to react [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
