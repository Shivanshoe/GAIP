and nvidia and the following gameplay was captured using the palette geforce rtx 2060 super gaming pro oc a graphics card which enables you to play warzone at 1080p 144fps and features a two-fan design with support for pallets thundermaster software which lets you easily monitor and overclock your gpu to get the best possible performance along with the added benefits of geforce rtx like real-time ray tracing and dlss and of course the main benefits of playing at higher frame rates and monitor hertz in warzone include a significant reduction to distracting effects like screen tearing and ghosting which helps to generate a smoother image as well as reducing input lag to create a more responsive experience check out the link in the description below to view palettes range of geforce rtx gpus in your region so i've got some very entertaining juggernaut royale gameplay to show you today i'm playing with jack frags stoddy and westy in this one and this game mode is so much fun especially with friends i'm also making a return to an old favorite class of mine featuring the ax50 and mp7 which i have set up like this and there's just something about the x50 in war zone despite it underperforming at range when compared to the hdr i still feel so much more flexible when using it like i can pull off some insane plays due to the faster ball time at the end of the day both snipers are good weapon choices and each sniper has an advantage over the other so just play with what you prefer i personally like to rotate between the different snipers and warzone as i just have more fun that way and i think my gameplay is better for it anyway please leave a like if you enjoyed today's video it really helps me out subscribe for more and i'll catch you in the next one tell me why tell me why what song is this okay i'm going to come this way come this way this is safe your teammates after the goulash why did you make me come this way because he said it'll be safe keep
