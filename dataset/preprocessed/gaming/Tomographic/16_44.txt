they did such a good job with this game all right time to fly there's that logo again don't know how close to the ground i am i'm actually quite far off [Music] so good look at this dude this game is beautiful so take a quick midair selfie oh yeah that's going on the ground so cool that you can do that what's going on over here then oh big car crash that car crash looks bad hope no one's injured

don't worry i'll save them i got you man oh look out everyone i'm so sorry oh god i'm really sorry oh there's another guy stuck here look i'll crush that pedestrian if i don't do something he's really wedged under there okay this is unnecessary just get out the way man i don't need to flip the car that's just more work for the emergency services victims are out of danger there's so many flip cars here now did i even help all right we've got another suit to showcase i think this is obviously the hybrid suit from no way home but they've also got the black and gold suit which i haven't seen yet and oh my god i love it so i've set the time of day to night time because it just makes sense right but this suit looks great if you've seen the movie it's basically the stark suit inside out this is what it looks like on the inside i'll show you in a second i'll go into the photo mode once we get to the top i'm currently scaling the empire state building for a nice view of new york oh yeah look at that jesus this game looks good definitely the best view i agree if you know what i mean you got avengers tower over there the oscar building beautiful let's have a look at this suit up close and personal you don't get to see them like this in the movies so this is really cool wow look at the detail the circuitry and the wires coming off the suit really cool well the gauntlet that strange gives him spider butt spider butt okay we're on the empire state building so it only makes sense that we jump off it right it's a spider-man game it'd be rude not to oh my god i just got goosebumps love that so much can i do a backflip yes i can i gotta shut this down before they free their friends and start in on the cops as the rockefeller center below me a famous ice rink all right what's going on down here a prison escape by the looks of it trying to get people out of the van i think not those make sure you all get a ride back to rikers oh they got the door open imagine just breaking out of prison you're finally thinking uh we're home three lads and then spider-man shows up knocks you out immediately and you wake up back in prison no wonder criminals hate me i got you oh my god there's a guy stuck in there step bro i'm burning hurry you're really stuck in there come here big guy let's get you out of here that was another got you too badass i'm such a hero saving the day oh god what's happened to that guy should go to the hospital get some oxygen just in case yeah i think this guy needs more than oxygen i'll be honest guys oh look it's the rat from ant-man excuse me yeah i'll do something that was the freaking doorman that said that oh god um i don't have insurance for that bye what a day it has been i had to put the uh the amazing suit back on this is definitely one of my favorites i'm just heading to times square right now so i can show it off there but look at that so iconic i love it all right we made it here we are at times square a big part of the amazing spider-man movies did that woman just call me short what the hell man look at this though i just i love this suit i don't know why some people seem to hate it a lot but i really like it look how unique that spider is and the gold visors as well just looks so good i think really cool texture to it as well i wish they added the amazing spider-man 2 suit it'd be really good a bit too late now though isn't it maybe in the next game i can't wait for spider-man 2. it's gonna be so good this is cool i love that you can do that just pull yourself up the fire escape it's been really fun though guys i hope you enjoyed that i think we're going to wrap it up there but uh if you want to see more of this game or even spider-man miles morales i'm definitely down i love that game as well i really wanted to show these suits because they're so cool and obviously completely the main story for this game but i wanted to do some free worm today if you enjoyed it leave a like and i will catch you legends in the next one [Music] you
