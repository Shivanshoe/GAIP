okay are we good i think we're good welcome everyone to battlefield 2042 the open beta and i'm gonna be playing with the fast squad today uh we've got fuglet stomato64 and aculite shouldn't really say in that order should i if you don't know what the fast squad is it's made up of foglit acolyte stone iron and myself tomographic fast um we're gonna be gaming for a couple of hours here uh i'm playing as a squad full squad we've got four of us today so at least i think it's max four right it's not five is it it was five in previous battlefield games i think but uh yeah this should be fun um i think they're sending me invites now guys why you hating bro yeah did you send me who else but tom wearing a thong what oh whoa might be a little on the tos side not made for kids why did you have to go there option you have to select when you post it's not an option tom it's not an option all right all right fog jump i start i do man who's throwing stuff how long are you gaming for opening some stuff yeah i'm not you think you're better welcome everyone tuning in thanks for being here so yeah this will be off i haven't played at all today so sunshine this is gonna be interesting [Music] i had so much footage from the uh the early play tests that um yeah i just did some editing today i wanted to jump on with the whole squad and figure some stuff out together so we're gonna try a bunch of things all the stuff uh maybe do some vehicle stuff today i don't know i don't know how confident i feel um but yeah if you've oh great i've also got some codes to give away uh for open beta access or at least at least the early access um i would like a gun please game there we go that's one of the issues i noticed when you first spawn into a match for the first time it won't give you i can put on a scope i want to try it's not really working for me is it it's an iron sight snipe viable in this game you guys dead the classic iron sight sniper that i am i think my sense is uh correct from the last time i played i did change one thing there's a transitional sensitivity slide of it oh the millisecond layer that guy would be dead yeah there's a transitional sense all right gentlemen we're in a full squad your aim this is it oh yeah my map doesn't work either if you guys got your map does it matter you can't bring up a map stone no you can't pull the map up no and you can't increase the size of your map either there's no like hud elements you can change yeah i was hoping they they had that in previous call of duty's you could open your map up bigger i think they will but they said that they don't have a lot of the uh what do you call it um the helpful stuff helpful you are yes accessibility is the word i'm looking for ah yes of course um i'm gonna go with a sniper package proc sensor and a c4 deploy let's do the thing uh i did see that um true game data has done some some research on the snipers in the game i'll tell the guys as well i'm just i've just muted myself uh yeah tgd did some um inspecting on the uh the snipers it's like a 600 millisecond velocity sorry it's not i think i saw the tweet on that yeah it's very slow that's about as slow as battlefield 4 so yeah it's very slow it's much harder to snipe in this game i mean i get some really nice shots but to be fair most of them were medium range when we played yeah um and do you guys know so this reconfigure you're playing the recon right now oh shoot oh my god i'm definitely on n a servers oh my god just knocked down destroyed we gotta take out these helies where they at george thank you very much for coming remember man i appreciate you got a medic snowy do you know how they're like this recon um thing that's popping up on the bottom of the screen works though yeah so that's like a high alert but only from behind i believe it'll blink when an enemy is like approaching you from the back oh is that what it is yeah you don't have to you if you're a couple but i didn't know why if you want to use a sniper you don't have to be that recon class stone exactly yeah yeah yeah i'm just like this bush personally i thought he had a nice one oh my gosh exactly like that all right it's just it's you know for starting out we gotta just start with what we like with what we know push it up i've noticed though that everyone is pretty much playing uh mckay like you don't get it i had a couple of playstation 4 guys in my squad would you play anyone else but i don't know if what what they were using though i'm supposed to be ten specialists until son yeah yeah yeah probably got access to four right now yeah i'm doing right i love dude i got heels though as a sniper and it feels so good yeah you guys we're in heels throughout your arms feels so good yeah you just throw your own heels and stuff it's amazing there's not much going on in this part i always dreamed about it that's the thing like i always felt so frustrated with some of the limitations that i had with the class classes in battlefield i actually really uh i'm looking forward to this specialist system so i could use whatever i want with whatever i want we are dominating this skies right now at the same time like for the same reason that the customizing weapons on the fly system might attract away from squad play i i mean i can't be like a one-man army yeah no i get it i get it and i think a lot of people aren't going to like that especially like if you want hardcore battlefield whatever but i want to raise this guy res me dude res me please let's go save me it just keeps making me take someone's kit it's my bush it's my bush is too good to get you there we go here we go i think i'm up i think i'm up my mom's killed myself in the process i'm going to throw some meds on you tom thank you man we dying oh yeah you gave me your gun i think i'm sniping well okay now we're about that sick dude that's your fault if i had my sniper i double triple headshot that helo as well you took my sniper no no you took it yeah you took my sniper dude we probably both had the same kit so like why did you not trade with my stuff you know are you using a sniper right now yeah the same kit probably oh man i'm going to grappling hook i'm going to grappling hook good good boy try this one out 10fps with an overclock for you oh i like that a lot the stone test full damage oh no dead or sniping man be way faster i gotta figure out my controls oh i think i just sniped the driver of that but i didn't kill him i got a hit mark yeah the hd 4040p streams yeah no action happens behind me so we need to get over here really oh what happened to that guy it's been a pleasure whoa whoa what just happened i don't know if between deaths my sensitivity is being reset but i keep like over flicking which i wasn't doing in the uh the previous build of the game freaking mute buttons when i swapped seats i was like wait why did i get into this a lot of people have been adjusting sensitivity all day with this game trying to find the right sense it's a nightmare oops did you get your sense swordstown yeah i think it's okay for now i just lowered my uh yes i'm having to set it where it's good enough i'm i'm just gonna have to tweak the guns on an individual level i had to drop the sense for sniping a lot though for the 6x yeah it was so high i don't know who they think i am where can i call this in how do i call it i'm no accolade dude you're with me i'm pulling a vehicle but i seem to be working i'm behind you here i'm moving up there's a guy in the hill ahead of us it's unavoidable now nice oh i see him he's a bush nice oh my god what's up what's up truck almost killed me oh give me my vehicle all right i'm with i'm with i'm with where's the boost shift are we all grappling hooks let's go oh yeah of course do you have an ammo pack by any chance oh oh no we're below okay damn bro it's floating go go try and grab it and save it go grab it dude there's another missile launching in the background yeah i tried to fly this guy right to your right tom okay brother almost killed myself i don't know if i can't really ping it yeah you can't are you in this tunnel with me the dog is shooting us from down below oh you're right yeah yeah i see that guy right here honest i'm out of ammo or are you on the mall's away stone sniper down yeah i know i'm covering it with my sniper dude oh [ __ ] bottom of tower bottom of tower right side sniper glitch yeah yeah i see it again what needs to die oh there's a mini gun on the back of the truck i tagged it though hold on hold on there we go but he just lays right there i have to dip down here i can't stay up there with you guys oh my gosh i got raised yeah anybody can rest gosh bro sheesh little doggie he's going down that's the truck over here yeah that guy in the truck is i don't know if i can hit him or not you can do it it doesn't look like it doesn't look like i can't look like i'm hitting him on point no one's running called it a nuke you crazy it's a nuke it's not going through right dog is crazy i've totally forgot there is legit ai yeah there is legit ai there's quite a lot of them as well no i got meds should i switch to should i switch to it yeah one of us should i think can i boost in this as well should i just redeploy here i'll read it do i have to stay in the ring to heal no it looks like it's just triggers no i don't think so jesus is getting dark again it's so hard to see out of the heli i think it starts it but all right let me spawn on you guys are you uh are you in the hell i don't know if you want to spawn on me all right i'll spawn a thug nope you don't this guy here uh can i only spot a thug nice [ __ ] yeah i don't know a i don't know so if we parachute sideways do we go further just trying all the warsaw and stuff no i can spawn on you tom it's letting me spawn on you did you switch to ammo accolade yeah because he was in a heli but gotcha well let me spawn on youtube gotta aim you know you lead someone in there and then and then they just stop this guy spawned okay sniped his ass it yeah the smartest thing in a spot though yeah you can only spot briefly dude they just keep stopping whenever i shoot that's the bullet velocity for you gotta you gotta hit tom you gotta hit him i'm just going to hit him he's got to hit him just like this just i mean just like this i mean just like this don't show me i mean just like this hold on you mean do you mean just like this hold on oh let me reload let me reload just like that i'll show you in a second show me yeah yeah yeah just like yeah oh he's gone yeah you're looking though are you looking i probably got ran away because he was so scared because i reloaded he was probably that yeah no there's this one of those are snipers are looking at us just like this just like that there we go just like that dude i swear yeah there killed another one on the left behind us behind us the bullet velocity is so much faster than the last build of the game we played did it i don't think it did i mean it's in some much longer range shots the lead just doesn't feel like what it means right down to the right down to the right dude i'm dead there's loads of loads of them around us now oh there's four of them here no one when you want them and then everyone when you get them in this little thing i mean he always pretty good you still gaming last time i was trying bro but it's just not much you could do with a damn freaking pistol he's going no tom even if you aim perfectly you're still gonna you're gonna die man that's just how it is all right i'm gonna try and uh i need to reduce my abs sensor thing increase it i'm to try a little smg action here the vector is tough yeah i wish no not though oh the vector no pretty good on this map anyways unless you stick really close okay i'll try the ump then i guess i mean you can try it i'm just going to try it just stick close get close okay mike will be good i'm going to ramp his revive enemy revive teammates with full health oh what about the century little doggie following me around that might be fun let's go right oh there we go there's everyone what bring me a little doggy switch to the um there's 11 people on in combat i can't spawn on you okay let's try this one right now my kill to hit ratio is so low right now this is great i'm having a great time just hit the more how are these not connecting oh somebody hit it with an rpg oh come on bro i'm customizing my gun i've got over 200 ping do you really yes that's why top left top right yeah i don't have that server are we on you're you're hosting con right yeah i'm hosting madison is the west coast maybe there's only west coast the neo servers or something no that can't be it i mean it is better oh i have c4 right now oh that's not whatever response point is over 200 playing us nuts yeah that's probably why things aren't connecting that's the thing like it looks like they are so clearly but absolutely nothing was it in sounds like like that and i'm watching my bullet go through he's like like that i'm like dude some of my shots look pretty good there i'm not gonna lie it looks pretty good like that my sniper back where is it i love watching the ai fly helies they fly him too 20 round smg though this is going to be tough you're tough okay killed one that's you know what i noticed too if you go prone sometimes it auto walks you forward there's a tank right in front of us okay start found out earlier that there's like certain parts of the map when you go prone the character starts crawling forwards for no reason exactly exactly yep because i was sitting down trying to use my recon drone and i couldn't it wouldn't let me do it earlier dude all right i'm going in stone welcome everyone just tuning in what are you going in for fugly how are you doing hey man and then show your thoughts [Music] enemies up at the cars here i'm fragging up got some tax on him i don't think i'm going to snipe he's behind the tank on the road we got a teammate in there i met him back up i got to heal i'm going in with him oh you got about 40 coming into that building right now you got about 40 to 50 enemies coming in you're back building publicly oh my god dude they all related to me um what'd you do did you finish yourself off hello i can't res him it's not let me res him i think he finished himself off right in front of me that was a bad time to take a sip of my water i was just about to say he's probably drinking you're drinking some water yeah almost come on my nose dude rehydrate man rehydrate that's good we'll be back okay did you go down in delta oh dude he went down down on delta dude come on man where's my team i'm out here playing by myself over to the rocket oh my god the savior oh camden save your teammate i'd come down to rezzy's stone but i don't want to so i'm gonna fly past your power shouldn't come on oh yeah you're in the air yeah yeah i'm trying roof to zip i'm gonna try and grapple the zip they all build later nerds oh what did i say later that's the only battlefield moment [Music] oh i love that the transition from grapple to zip that's pretty pog yeah it's really smooth did you go from the roof over to the zip no no i spawned on you so i didn't get as much momentum it's done oh you're all up here stone this is a high place yeah i'm pretty high up here for sure yeah there's your heart bound in oh focus up here too and you're up here oh no that's accurate what's the light i'm on a plane okay well i'm going to try and get these things here the annoying thing is you can't see how many players on the enemy team when you bring up the scoreboard it's just like yeah it doesn't show you huh nope flyby it shows us our squad oh that's kind of cool it shows us our squad stat though so we can see how good our squad is doing versus the others yeah total yeah if you hit tab there it shows we got 60 kills as a team i wanted to test out the snipers yeah you can turn down the opacity of um flags and stuff but you can't do your own you're in heads up what's up heads up kids dude someone's locking on to me please help me like [ __ ] here fly right over me i'll grapple you oh my god that almost killed me take this guy out real quick all right take him out got a couple more up to our right here tom hover hover hover dude they're hopping out oh i got him right now you guys use the uh the lmg's yet moving up on delta yeah it's really good is it that's what i'm using right now and it's you use a uh do you use a high zoom optic or the smaller one yeah i swap between them whether where i'm at yep i use all of them like that yeah it's nice because that's how you get big mags in this game because the uh ars and smg's you can't get extended mags so it's like all right [ __ ] fly over me i want to grapple you i think i gotta get behind me but i'm gonna be right have you seen anyone that's until i match oh wait don't know they are they're on it worked for a moment i think but i think you're flying so fast just dc you're shooting at me is it this guy i wish i could pull the map up to see where the objective is it's like it's hard to tell what's going on all right i'm coming in slow but you don't know the math yet all right like that knowledge will help you out a lot oh it's just slow slow yeah that didn't work i messed it up though i think it was just me like what are people fighting over i've barely found anyone around the building i feel like they're all just on top of the skyscraper they love like trying to fight for that high ground you think they're in here there's no flag there i saw a guy in the middle up here somewhere i don't know how to get up there on the back side now oh nice shot oh there's a rocket launcher on the ground i don't know what's happening right now where am i it sounds like what's enemy this is enemies oh that was a big boom a big boom look at the big dip are you on the building we are destroying these guys you're in the building just tom look at these guys i just triple killed them were they all ai i just triple killed them no because the ai love to spawn in vehicles and just sit there i guess i didn't really check i don't know inside the building ahead of us tom yeah yeah they're all dead i i'm getting to these fights way too late oh there's a zip line inside here whoa here we go i've actually seen that one nice oh that's quick that's a good one i like that the forces are dwindling oh it's the lmg here one more in there at least the ttk does feel a lot more very similar to bf4 what's happening we're crushing them we're up by 700 lives is that what that holy points or whatever emp or something uh behind the boat there's one inside the second floor going up yeah oh it's around me here i'm coming i'm not dead hello i'm following you tom i feel like i need the motion ball so just so i can find someone one killed inside wait is there a way to turn that is there a way to turn a compass on too we're playing kiss chase it should be above your map no no it's not there i don't know i thought there was going to be a compass at the top of the thing there's a tank to our left tom well it's gone now all right he's already won it we won victory i was just running like a madman attack sprint the entire time how's the uh are you doing the buzzard thug or the attack shopper uh i did the little one and then killing it the little one is actually insane it shreds the mini heli yeah it shreds the bigger ones right i didn't feel good over 200 ping i heard some people complaining about ping issues earlier so i was like i haven't played it all today because when the beta first went live i was really looking forward to getting on um but i figured there's no rush i've got so much footage from the uh the early play session that we had i figured i'd do some editing and prepare more videos which i have done so probably another video tomorrow um but yeah 200 ping on n a that's pretty rough for me i think typically when we play warzone it's about 110 111 we're gonna play this time 111 that's precise isn't it 120. yeah hopefully that's not the experience for the entire time maybe just add more servers in certain places because i want to play all my friends but they're all n a right like i can't i can't change that unless i move to an a which isn't really on the cards for me yeah you guys been enjoying the game i've been playing in surgery the last few days and i found myself shooting two bullets of people i gave this game and expecting this to be dead no oh no it's done r.i.p you can join to join back i think you can hop back in right oh i did make it private though hey illegal bull thanks for tuning in buddy oh yes i'm trying to be kelly glad you catch a stream you know when bf3 released there were no memes damn dude i suppose the meme culture wouldn't really hit until like i'm gonna take this [ __ ] out real quick and he vehicle destroyed what do i want to use i'm gonna oh he's already dead i can't even select a class right now you want to go to f that's probably where all other people are going to be deployed i don't really have a choice i'm just kind of along for the ride here then redeploy there we go somewhere so uh i think you might want to get out here we're playing on a build of the game that is like a few months old two or three i think that's what the beta build is and dice wanted to stress that they've obviously come a long way since then um and a lot of the issues that people are bringing up uh most of them they've already addressed in the in the build they have and i completely get the complaints from the community because some of the issues like you know if they have a version of the game that works well why isn't that the one that we have but from a developer's perspective they need to it's it's like building the game twice right right they need to make a version of the beta that is at least a good demonstration of what the game is going to be in a sort of uh you know a sneak peek so yeah you've got you can't judge it on face value but i do think that a lot of the issues that are present are very easily fixed and i just hope that a lot of the the ones that most people are complaining about are already like guys are well aware of most of the stuff people aren't about because when i when i first played it i don't really i don't really have any anything bad to say about the game but i've also got to remember that we're playing on a server that you know was sort of just for us and there wasn't hundreds of thousands of players trying to get get in on our content creator lobbies uh yeah i want to try the shotgun because there's um hats there's a twitch streamer suggested that we try the slug round shotgun it's like a little it's like a medium range sniper oh come on ellie don't single me out okay great it's fine honestly because i want to change my gadgets what should we do rocket launcher and um rocket launcher and a motion ball sounds good drop shot too that's that's not a thing in this game apparently you guys alive no no we were killing it though i mean in the game yeah yeah now we are yeah so they can't realize trying to eat a rocket over there what's the hell yeah what do i have what is this it's g oh can i just like lock onto him f3 lucky howie we're under attack this is not a fight you want pal trust trust trust i'm jumping i don't trust oh my god i'm so close i got better mobility though oh god okay hey those guys taking shots i can get behind this huge zorg on a c2 i'm not leaving before one of us dies on kvs teammates yes all right but the bullet velocity is obviously ass but this is pretty cool i'm using the uh the shotgun i'm shooting at me with slug rounds okay yeah the lmg definitely has deviation i just pulled the lmg out right now let's see how it goes it's so good dude i think it's only one kill by doggo yeah i think it's only good hit markers david garcia thank you very much for becoming a member man so if you don't move while you shoot you're good i hope you're doing well did you put the grip on it if you're dying spawn on me oh there's a tank i'm dead this is where all the action is starting running running oh yeah there's a ton of people down here oh okay yeah this thing's kind of nice yeah it's going to blow isn't it oh the tank bro the tank oh hit it once this guy won't give up i thought i switched to the car i'm getting t back i got the drone yeah welcome to the battlefield oh my goodness sir if anyone's got anything it should be pretty low if you die spawn on me where are you [ __ ] yeah i'll spawn on you on the you're in combat oh shoot i'm gonna try to lay prone here are they shooting are you oh this guy on me i'm not touching him i'm like spamming to spawn come on [ __ ] give us a name it's so close to me are you trying to capture the point get off the point if it's letting you count i gotta get cool in a vehicle oh yeah this is this looks nice it's a good looking game yeah i can't see the lmg i put a nice 3x on it now oh we're losing a1 we're losing a1 right here you need a really flat surface oh yeah they're in that building adjacent let's make a hole in it oh one of the left of the building there's one on the roof i killed him one outside the double fragging tank nevermind i'm dead hang on it's done there's a guy to the left of me just outside the building yeah oh this is this sucks because it's everywhere they're underneath us there's a heli on top of me i'll just respawn i was gonna pick you guys i've got i've got slugs on my shotgun so when i actually wanted to use my gun as a shock oh you're still here hold on i've hit him once at the end there nice uh i need to reload one moment can you rest one level you're dead i'm dead just dead yeah i see your body it is currently in the messed up position in the messed up position are you in combat i am yeah we could spawn on f1 in a second there we go i'm taking his car he's going for a ride with me now what's that spawn on you guys oh yeah let's step up instead pack that guy no just zip up he's just jamming out in there i feel like ai without a sniper oh this guy in the turret in there i just took his vehicle you sit there shooting someone oh there's people down here oh you know what i for some reason my vehicle my forward ski doesn't work i can't drive vehicles let me see imagine out sniping a sniper with a shotgun and my accelerating key doesn't work ow yeah it doesn't work i can't drive the vehicle did i just get in you got it in mind but my w key doesn't work in vehicles for some reason the keybind doesn't work you have a controller plugged in i got a launcher now i don't know if it locks on or what that's free fire the first one free flight another guy down there yeah got one of them nice nice nice these are killing it oh you i'm with you i'm with you no you is that the rocket no [ __ ] zipping across like it's he's up on the hill that's all i can tell you hails are everywhere look around you on the hill with the rock and the literally is it the wooden tree just find him green one it's not that difficult it's not that difficult it's just he was like bottom of the tower area when we were just that which okay okay whoa relax on the cons okay it's just clear cons there's like that it's over there it's out here it's over there yeah this map is massive dude even with 128 players it's difficult to find someone it's all right [ __ ] the behind you two two three three three i'm gonna try and regroup you guys yeah i think find the right one uphill of us too that's pretty cool oh there's a vehicle right there uh saw bus thank you very much for the five for the five i love spending my sweet sweet salary for tomorrow change attachments we're annoyed boy yeah right i like it thank you man appreciate the support of views yeah kind of crazy movement's ever been this fast in a battlefield game oh that's a lot no this is quick that's why i'm curious if the attack sprint has a slower ready time than just normal sprint it feels pretty fast if you go from go from that to 80s even with an lmg it feels really fast because i've turned on attack sprint by d4 right so i should always have it under american control i just got it in the vehicle there actually got him another one what just happened the body just like zoomed what the yeah there's a few bugs a few there's only one guy on point he's right below us can we cap from up here we're on objective i think we're capping admitted we're good i suppose any of you guys are carrying uh no cats oh no i got a launcher okay there's drop point oh okay where the heck is dia or where is the girl wait towards the tower i'll master the market there's a tower i need to mock them d tower stay on hot pickup yeah yeah pick me up dog right there i'm in baby i'm overheated really hot picked up i tried you just keep it steady i was trying to i was gonna oh my god that's that thing suddenly picks up losers everyone's got grappling hooks prediction would've been immense i'm just gonna swap to a little close range side before that yep you can do it on the way up oh here we go yeah swap it on the way up as sick as that freaking sleep somebody just hit me i killed him don't worry tell him to stop there's a guy up here he was shooting you from below stone i'm going oh come on man did you just die to that guy he wrapped to the right yeah he jumped down he's the top zip right got him charging is it the heli that's ruining us oh up here with us up here yeah yeah oh my god oh my god oh my god i got you back tom he's the best i took off shoot i think we're all down it just keeps swapping the gun i'm trying to revive him and he's i think it's a reset boy i'm [Music] you got rockets coming oh my god it just dropped forwards i should do a double rocket what was that i'm gonna punch this tank to death it's got no idea what's coming oh my god connor you got to kill it now yeah yeah you do that you do that that works taking this thing out right now okay let's go team can you actually ride on top of it without killing you i'm killing it right now maybe are you killing it or you you know look it's on fire this is insane i'm actually superman does it do damage when you punch it of course it does have you seen these muscles so soon okay i'm dead the harder boss than i thought i'm gonna need a few levels we'll get there we're getting b1 okay chat i'm gonna uh i'm gonna i'm gonna put a early access code in the chat can we go again i've got a few to give away chop some trees let's go that's not where i want to spawn broken first code is in chat now what am i doing we can spawn a vehicle right oh yeah my button doesn't work whenever i press b it just goes away again oh god those are enemies just the same hey directly ahead he's knighted me oh my god it's so hard to shoot got him nice try this oh you're dying can i get a res oh there's so many long range engagements honestly literally just leaving them all right i remember how this ended last time all right i'm top of the tower now even though i was in a vehicle oh dude my life just crashed in the tower my life literally flashed before my eyes in real life oh no that thing's about to obliterate literally all of us are about to die right now we'll leave this for later dude all right here we go round two we're getting this point we're coming up boys nothing's got invisibility cloaking shield team potatoes here i'm ready dude that heli is still here yeah i'm gonna spawn and i'm gonna i'm gonna shoot out the sky it gives me an easy visual on the cockpit i might be able to murder him oh that was so murder close i've hit him a few times actually he's about to burn himself this dude oh are you dead hold on a moment i died oh my god again oh my god no you're super dead though give me a break game and how do you blow up boxing him once twice three times a lady i don't know how far i have to lead with this ammo but available it's actually pretty low now i wanted the mini it's dead i was trying to get the grapple kill i can't believe that's even a possibility yeah stone you can kill the grapple by the way oh really yeah wow does anybody see if there's a plane flying behind me neat um um i don't see anyone foggy right i don't know what it locked on me maybe it was it might be able to resume i'm kind of safe up and saw okay now i've got 93 ping this feels a bit coming over oh there you go oh someone raised you that previous server was horrible man come on doggy yeah go get him own him yes are they trying to contest the roof hang on stone they're trying there's one right underneath there like oh that guy's got your medic hey i see helicopters owning us yeah the boss is back i'm coming in there's a few on backside roof i'm about to hit a crazy rocket on them oh nevermind yes these codes um they didn't give me the platform but since the email is ea i kind of put two and two together and guess that it's gonna be origin let me melee thanks come on you shut up again come on game let's dance then yeah servers have been down up and down for some people today it's a shame man there's just so many people trying to get on you know happens with these day one bears and i think now is probably peak time for a lot of people i'm not spawning to die to this buzzard thank you good night plane get double flares how does that work oh it doesn't shh who was with me though tonight well he was spawned on by f stone just rpg a little bird out of the sky dude hell yeah buddy i want to do the same thing dude i need way more ammo do you have an ammo tom no unfortunately okay i think there's a tank they've kind of been got you i got him too though damn wait we're getting infantry missiles yeah [ __ ] i had that full auto glock glitch what you know when you said that oh glitch the the glock was full auto for you when we played i had it as a burst oh maybe it's burst yeah because i was trying to like burst fire anyway i said that it did have a firework for it it probably does it yeah just press v it's kind of really coming back for more stuff we're being sniped from elsewhere on the roads multiple places let me see that guy oh i gotta swap my scope here what's up guys what's up how we looking do you see anyone starting out been shot from everywhere oh honest it just parachuted right on us oh my god there's two i don't know where they even came from they're the ones or two of them drop them high now as well he's resting by the rock which rock i see oh the one we died at the one damn shot by his body down in the hill find the new strategy i want to go see one i'm getting pretty good with grenades in this the grenades absolutely slap in this game yeah they've wrecked the blast radius and damage is insane oh my god what's this guy even doing and they blow up quick too they're almost like impacts that's the most ugly assassination animation i've ever seen assassination and there's a lot of guys on top of that roof clear up that [ __ ] uh yes they're in the water all right we need to cop that point well i gotta get that kill thank you we're capping it we're capping it i've still got that transition sensitivity thing even though i've disabled it what's that transition so like when you on like when you go to ads the sensitivity slows down massively the way you can disable that yeah i don't know so much debris this is a death trap here yeah man damn it was really up there now yeah the frags are super good we're gonna obliterate about them give me some of that health it's weird having tax print on all the time though i don't know if it's giving me increased movement speed or not he's shot by oh i will get one of these harleys i'm hearing more shots down there those things are blown up froze everyone come on it looks like you're just stalling on my screen what was it soldier sprint always use traversal i just quad headshotted that heli pilot he still didn't die he made that sound so much cooler than i actually was how dare you put a lot of effort in those headshots tell me more bro i can't that's all there was to the story tom this crosshair you just shut me down it's so glitched i don't know who's ai and who isn't are about to lose yeah was not ai have you guys tried um the i've got the name of it you know i don't know john main real story bro you're freaking wrecked uh how does it like how do you like your own medicine huh i just want one of these hellies to fly over me perfectly that one blew up that guy landed he's dead that's a jet he's dead no i haven't tried that yet yeah literally just like you spawned with more health you don't apply plates or anything [Music] good juice boys i'm running around a lot more to find enemies than it was when we first played and then 10 to 10 10. people were like trying to figure out the map so they were like well that's a big building let's go in there like that's a bad idea let's snipe from outside it oh a menu hey louie yeah a game finish guy i wasn't done with it i was done having fun the game ended bro i don't care i was not done were you sniping again uh i was at the beginning and then i swapped over to the lmg and was that the guy was that when you quad quad headshot are going to heli yeah with the lmg maybe i was hitting the gunner or something like i double tap the first guy and then double tap the second guy i don't know yeah so my um my honest opinion is that this version of the game feels a bit different to the one we played a couple of days ago when we recorded for the early access stuff it's hard to put into words it feels maybe it's just the server lag it just feels a bit more clunky i guess i think you could tell if you watch the video it looks a bit smoother i i i think it's pretty obvious but i felt so like dialed in and this is genuinely the first time i've launched the game today so i think we're playing on another different version of the beta build of the game which is interesting maybe it's just placebo a lot of the bugs i've encountered in this play session i didn't encounter at all i had no problem with like the three hours that we got to play this is what this was definitely one of the bugs i encountered though like i don't spawn with a weapon my first life so i have to redeploy in order to see my stuff it's just not as fluid the motion fly me over dopamine i'm ready the gun play still there when it works but just uh the way that your soldier would transition from jumping to crouching just sliding whatever those connecting animations felt a lot smoother and that's what i mean maybe it is just server lag um but you definitely feel it [Music] there's a lot of people oh it's interesting i feel like i have to learn the game again when i only just played it like it was literally the last game that i played before this if you know what i mean i'm relearning the mechanics but yeah i mean it is an older build so we'll see what the final one is like and how much they have fixed and how far the games come but it's still really fun and i'm just really really excited to see what i'm getting the hazard zone mode is like sort of uh how that was received by the community yeah i couldn't help you because i think in terms of quick scoping people watching content like like a story to be told and if it's a mode that tells a story i think they'll be on to a winner that's why battle royale is such a success because you get to see like a beginning middle and then should be one more at the far side there oh there's a lot left here you're having a party you cannot crouch slide though which is good you can do a normal slide well i got three or four of them if you try and me at the game without you yeah they're packed up here i can i can save you connor there's a guy there's multiple men those are women lots of people oh guy under me on this staircase over here too he's about to if i kill shoot first i got the guy locking on you who's locked there's someone else oh it missed i slapped a dude oh it's a plane i think yeah there's a hover plane right here um come on i'm gonna take you out good night mister killing your killer shots look dead on tom roof okay his name is moose games moose he's dead come on let's take our let's take our spot under the stairs again i can revive if you're all right oh no you're good i'm okay you said you were dead yeah i really did think i was dead we dominated down here last time we did we were so good i want to take over the heli though yeah i did that i took out a jet i know i was there right beside you supplying your ammo all the time yeah i took out a jet actually it took out two remember your eyebrows are gone yeah well no it's worth the sacrifice for the content i'm down and i'm going down the mountain oh no what's hitting me that dude oh man you can sort of manipulate this lmg to just have no recoil [Music] the vector the vector was difficult for me but yeah going down on the mouse with the lmg and you don't have a massive abs time with amg which is new see if that thing is trying to shoot me for me that's not connected lmg is a lot of fun that's pretty straight isn't it if you move though it hit a flag pull up is this is this a lock on rocket launcher no free fire free fire i think maybe they'll have like a remember when you could pass it's great it doesn't one hit though unactually direct impact i just killed him one hit he must have direct impacted him then you crazy crazy boy crazy boy well you crazy boy corner i'm a crazy boy boy howdy's coming back up oh direct impact what's that you oh the hell is after us wait what now that thing is miles away i was prepared to eat a frag as he got close a literal mile away i can't there's no way i can hit that he's gonna have to fly straighter not whatever this maneuver is this is going to cost his 57 years what's that that's a doggo yeah it is a really good looking game i'm i'm interested to see some of the other maps they have to offer but this is the only map for the beta unfortunately makes sense though you know not everyone's a full-time content creator and can play as long as we do so uh i think the average play time for many will be only a couple of hours has been secured where are we at boys where are we at how do you how do you request ammo stone do you have ammo that raises uh usually ping gives in oh no there is no request somebody who is a well yeah i guess they you don't know who has that used to bring up a wheel and be like i need a medic i need some ammo i need yeah that's cute i forgot about that you can't thank people yeah yeah yeah well you could go up to support and just be like and click ping on him and it would ask him for ammo and give you a little signal so you have ammo i feel like i gotta run ammo for acolyte over here this guy's just going through it he's just eating his ruffles with your hair with your lmg yeah yeah yeah you can't use it with a rocket launcher though right it replaces it oh right right right right calling me too why are you sniping i'm a rocket launcher because there's so many helicopters helicopter above a speculation i was doing that i can't do anything about it stone i don't have any ammo oh i almost hit it then i hit one out of the sky earlier in the last game yeah when it was like don't be nice what put it in the montage stone i'm going to put our ammo on for you actually let's see if it refills your launcher yeah it does that's why you can't take a rocket and an ammo box so they've thought about that yeah where's this guy going where's this ink unheard of wait [Music] yeah i just got an extra rocket oh this guy's not flying straight i can't hit him i thought i could guide that myself no you can't of course this thing stalls we have a we have a big heli above us yeah yep they're parachuting on us i no longer have ammo i hit it once oh no they're parachuting more i killed one hold on i might be able to get you give me a second oh okay i'll wait i got him i got him oh no you got him rezzing the incendiary grenade i wasn't a big fan of it i think it needs to keep your eyes peeled chat i've got a this is for origin pc and he's the only codes i have but an origin pc code is going in the chat right now for the early access player come on let me in spawn with fogler shall we think he's in this chopper i can only like look around with a spotting thing though oh my god that guy's sitting on me i'm fine again folks this is you isn't in it yeah area i just can't all i can do is spot people yeah the little hilly there's not much fun to do we go to the big rooftop there's a lot of people oh my goodness i'll be some easter eggs over here what about a good shot out of the sky by the way okay can you turn off the depth of field with the um like four x's and stuff as well what is this i don't think you can start i haven't seen an option for it this beat is bananas that's exactly right john exactly right oh oh oh a nge hey um did you spell out i think i just killed six people with one spray holy the lmg's great oh my god i think i just killed six people watch my two i can't spawn on you guys anymore i jumped out of there you are yeah definitely have been muted that is true that was crazy omg is fantastic yes we got to sip off the back line of that roof there's so many people up there yep they're watching it though they are definitely watching it yeah but we're the fast one let's do it let's get in there real fast i'll just recon drone all right come on the recon drone c4 we can put we can put c4 on it there you go see we're thinking about our head it's c5 there's c5 dude forget c45 yeah c4s yeah that's like yesterday's news that's that futuristic stuff nice time yeah i didn't do anything i was shooting with somebody past that i think i was saying there i didn't even see that guy that actually yeah actually people up there are you dead already i'm waiting for oh where we came from somebody was uh somebody was there somehow somebody was there somehow wait time i'm going out comes dead there was like 20 people here a second ago there's two people on the suppressor try that and these other guys were just rolling up from the side wait i got the guys on the well that wasn't as hectic as i thought it was one on the other side i think there's one yeah look so if you look at the point yeah tell me how many enemies are alive i've got your phone thank you you need to murder someone the point is no longer contested when someone's on it [ __ ] you where the b1 is it tells you how many enemies there are above it yeah when there's nothing i guess it's just okay underneath the roof there's guys you know that hallway yeah yeah yeah there's one guy there i see him on the staircase oh my god there's there's like 18 of them there i swear i got three killed two out here just got killed by the heli careful if anyone's got a rocket for it i do i do trying to spawn i got this upside down come on where's me i don't know if i'm reserved yeah i am do you see me uh yep one moment oh no memento you know yeah yeah take tips from not me absolutely my goodness you should try out for the uh the canadian olympics team dude that's a absolutely oh did i just take off it was a beautiful uh double backflip pike come on oh we missed it oh i'm gonna miss this time okay i missed it that time not the next time though but the next time bringing in the aerial support and if we miss it one more time the time after that are you kidding me just watch all these connect don't worry i'm here boys everything's gonna be okay now i'm just gonna hover over hover oh my god they're all out they're all out it's still that misses any medics nearby i don't think so you don't need to she's still locked onto me what's another guy there too that's cheating yeah i'm dead did someone say you're never dead another origin code in the chat another origin code in the chat okay that was a bad oh i avoided it i didn't avoid the second one though dude i just spawned on you and took a rocket up there you know does anyone have any rockets rockets going up i was going jason jason stephen [Music] i got you you using the red dog yes i swapped twitter on the way up that's good you can do it on the ziplines and then i can reload on this zipline it's great i'll [ __ ] on you on youtube oh my god he landed it man you got the good eyes i was coming up the zap and he'd be parachuted from somewhere yeah it's a teammate uh there is one there though right to the left here yeah once i get the issue good there you go guys coming up with the staircase on the full office teammates keep fooling me that's that's bad because because of the specialist system everyone's wearing the same outfit like before you had russian operators and american operators yeah so now everyone just yeah it's true everybody's just basically like everyone's got a rose skin yeah it's kind of difficult to know who's on your team yeah i notice if you're a ads sometimes i think it hides the hud too so you can't really tell oh my god that was sick is he gonna land it you guys come over to d1 there's tons of people here i got dead at it i'm now did it is has there ever been this many aerial vehicles like able to spawn at once in a battlefield game um usually it's like on on the big maps it's like uh two jets two helos yeah that's what we got and then also a transport helo yeah and then there's like four to eight things in there there's a little bird there's a viper and a transporter there's three kilos and two jets the thing is the area the air combat is like and all the vehicles i should say are very lethal in this game yeah it's nice it's not just transport like these are um they're a bit easier to control though people are saying from previous battlefield games because the yeah you can't like you don't have as much precise movement it tries to keep you upright the whole time oh interesting i guess so new players don't just flip the hell every time every single time they get in it i mean they literally have a they literally have a hover mode for the jets though i don't know if you've seen it no i haven't even tried it yet i mean there was harriers in um previous ones too god's sake i just trimmed the first series i did one of the first series that i tried back in battlefield 3 was a jet tutorials because when people would get in it including myself when i first started playing it they would just crash straight into the stream to the ground wait you made youtube videos yeah believe it or not i was drifting back in the day back in the day one time you guys haven't tried the ak yet right here above you guys i got you two round first there was one that was a burst gun that i put on and it was a burst and i hate yeah you might have no idea yeah you might press v because it's not it's a different you think i toggled it oh okay maybe i did i don't know i switched it off yeah huggled it on toggled it on to burst like the lost every fight it was great going going that's like pop those players you know that players oh i think i just killed them dude the last bullets i had nice [ __ ] we need to watch the backside here you didn't do anything particularly spectacular particularly spectacular four guys four guys coming out of my zip four i'm with you damn cool bro wait for them wait for them wait for them oh god now murder them they're shooting us i got two i'll get two sheesh oh oh he killed me oh mom bro they actually can defend themselves while they're going up a zip line yeah that's so much better but also so sad for us being dead now yeah there was crow on your right i did prefer um i actually love that if they can import somebody who can't watch when they have character models that are just the same on both teams yeah it's not quite there's a guy here what is this guy doing what did dare you okay uh they're coming up on the right um set of stairs no on the roof access where i died there's two of them oh yeah behind you behind you i don't care i'm sticking around he doesn't even see you damn and i can't get up bingo yeah i don't know if i can get hold on one second i was gonna say is he trying to help you just walk through oh wait this is you picked up somebody's gun so we're gonna have to swap back there's so many hilly's that just continues to show this i literally just finished myself and uh what i'm saying is that i finished myself before he could even raise tom that's not saying right next to me it's faster to just die and come back exactly where's the voice line have you guys heard the armor plates yet that's what i'm trying right now that's one of the easiest oh i haven't plates 20 20 armor dude can you get your armor back that was the question or is it only good sickest play ever yeah he did that's what i like to hear what did you do connor bingo he wore the brown pants well come on that corner should be one right on your connor you've got one hp so you're really doing loop so nice yeah i'm loving it feeling real nice so spicy oh the rocket there he goes oh he's dead no way he made it he fell to the ground dude oh my teammate didn't make it the ending match sound is so like ominous it doesn't really build it's just like [Music] my rocket just go through the ground doesn't matter head shot here we go now it's starting to build up oh yeah that enemy might have been but they're dead what's up everyone tuning in am i the only one lagging thanks for being okay right now i think i think i'm back again yeah i'll i'll put some more clothes in the chat oh geez little bird of course that would be the damn it those guys next to me they didn't realize top stairs roof they love it roger that that's what i mean like no one can test the points they just can test this roof the roof's calling have you tried literally have you tried to capture a point this game i captured one earlier yeah yeah at the beginning i captured one oh my god that's the most badass pilot i've ever seen in a battlefield game thank you um never flown a day in my life yeah definitely bro oh man come on that's tough stuff do you remember uh you know i remember yeah i remember you know yeah you know i think i do remember i knew it dude now that you mention it i do remember i actually was trying to think of something but i couldn't think of it you know hey four vehicles i'm coming i no don't don't do it there's like 85 people on this point yeah you know they're not not even nice i'm trying to think what was that right what was the name of the app when battlefield 4 came out that allowed you to call like you were a commander was it called commander oh i know what you mean yeah like commander you can literally just go take a poop and like crawl call in some cruise missiles or whatever from your from the toilet yeah yeah you just watch the top and you uh i think you're playing a different game than i saw you command it oh yeah another way battlefield 4 they weren't cruise missiles they just said constipation companion app is that what it's called yes oh my god this neo i suppose it could have made that way easy for myself i put in a good scion yeah i have seen the tornado bounce owl uh it's in my first battlefield video that i posted earlier which you should definitely check out if you haven't like you ain't gonna avoid this one jimmy not to toot my own horn but in terms of only in battlefield moments that video has aside from vehicular i had so much gameplay big mistake has this ended around music been playing for like 10 minutes or what yeah we got four tickets left but no one's like [Music] dude i thought we were owning i'll look at this dropping a bomb i thought we were domsky i was like dude we're getting carried hardcare now let's do this thing dubski's oh now that we got our scents dialed in we know what we want to use how do we can we see the board here can we see the leaderboard i've got a live audience thank you thank you everybody it's so great to be here thanks for coming yeah whoo pick me up turn me up i can't be able to hear myself think all right let's put another code in the chat i'm gonna do a double whammy all right guys i'm gonna do a double whammy would you say to me we're gonna have uh one two three oh yeah all right so new world two coats we hopping two origin codes what's happening are you guys coming over my time for the earlier i know that's a thing we have stuff to play now ian fugley just ran the level 45 dungeon yesterday and destroyed it easy dice destroyed it yeah tom's already beat the game so it was in the alpha test make it stronger it was too easy for him i actually actually took part in one of those wars but it was just just me versus live i don't know maybe 100 players hundred people wow yeah well well well okay how are you guys getting the hellies did someone say third code going in there oh okay it's not just like sitting on the map anymore because i've never seen them that's crazy dude the vehicles and you gotta just be the first person i mean to take this alley so i'm gonna attempt to be somebody other than the grappling hook guy did you figure out if the plates um went or no they don't regen you get two of them i think but you can only use one at a time and then once they're cracked you can never get them back yeah once you're cracked you can't go back damn dude hey it should be expected why is that code so i'm trying to do it on you on sure once i can weird anyway i guess one e1 okay all right huge dub he's here guys huge dubs dubs okay redeploy already i have to i have to redeploy when i first spawn otherwise i can't choose like weapons and stuff it's weird it's a very unique bug i've had oh that's an easy four man thanks for uh softening up therefore vehicle inbound that's all my isn't it unlocked we're unlocked uh oh another vehicle c5 [ __ ] you muted brother oh are we able to go in here yeah you can i wouldn't suggest it he is a tank and you're giving him a very easy shot wow that's crazy it's almost like i said it it's almost like you wanted actually crazy wow uh iceman thank you very much for the five dollars dude appreciate it content live one yeah this is the is the first fast squad level 60 today no that's an enemy tank shoot i switched to our armor penetrating around whoa did you just do that to that guy uh oh yeah wait let's be honest it'll happen to you i'm coming push me up okay yeah that was all me oh i got one shot man i'm pretty sick of this game if you didn't by the way this this stem gun actually hurts enemies you can switch your uh lmg rounds armor penetrating to hit vehicles yeah it's good for aircraft i think even on that tank it was i mean it was doing a lot but it did a little at least did something let's let's actually play this game where do you guys want you want to actually play all right let's play let's play up with you i'm with you actually i've got a better idea let's grapple to the top and stand on the rocket and fly when it takes off am i shooting this maybe later okay are you shooting it i think you're shooting it i'm not pushing anything dude this happened to me the first time i played the game i my left trigger is broken yeah tom had this issue as well yeah always shoot yeah yeah okay guys is your is your is your foot pedal plugged in yeah unplug it unplug it is that what screwing it or if you're in a vehicle turret click right click to aim hop out just hop out is he still in there oh yeah i don't have a grappling hook oh yeah grab him i messed up my giraffe oh no i can't move at all now now now it's all broken moving though like it's it's that was confusing for me just one with the bushes so like so quickly that's true i do like a good bush now the only access code will only work i think i broke it you should be able to join you know when you want me to open it extra mountain x don't know my media party don't invite you [ __ ] what what i'm gonna invite you first not landing the ball of loss it does feel like feel a bit slower since the first time you played you keep saying that i just feel it is that what you're saying yeah stodd felt it earlier and then i felt it when i played it for myself now is that what you're saying though yeah there's a robo dog that's just dropped off the side oh i was not ready for that sensitivity a double the meal time i got you it's left it's one he's one he's actually won love that for you it's a robo hang on is it still there you're not staying still i was going to stab you thank you you got to open your party back up acolyte when you can i do that one moment please this guy trying to stem me you're right bud all right it's open you're a [ __ ] yeah you gaming bro a real support has arrived no i'm eating stop missiling me all right i think that's joining me i think it's joining your game that guy does not know how to fly nope we hopped out he knows how to shoot though yeah that's generally how it goes we we know how to shoot but we never know how to fly i mean it's w yeah it's really weird spaces to shoot how do i like it at all not with my mouse yeah extra fire countermeasures nice these are the these are not lighter yeah i'm just going to bail like not you're still in it connor you want to jump oh you took control i'm a gamer you've got to do this you got it i need to change the uh the controls before i hop in one of those more things i was uh i was pretty dominant and weird i was dominant on bf4 but i had a controller no it's just not the same oh god oh god it's because you've got oh god yeah the left and right and then the you're with the mouse wait i'm out go back up oh no that's actually going to kill me medic down i'm gonna need a res yeah how do we how do we change the controls that that's tough thought that was a teammate that helped it was another teammate getting ready you're not still in that heli no that hell is gone yeah i haven't properly flown an attack shop with his bf4 because like you know i've had like bf1 hardline i suppose that had these but it wasn't like mostly transport i don't know what to change it to i mean oh you left the party left i left because it's not letting me join it's i don't know if you can kick hobbs because you're the lead what about sure try and open the party back up so i gotta try and join again um all right it's open i love how i'm the only one ever catching onto toms press escape go to squad and reference squad and uh players thompson you can never understand them man no i don't want to use profile live on stream uh yeah there's no kick option can we tell him i can make him squad leader like i joined your squad and he started matching me for a second and then it was like okay i'm done matchmaking bye-bye i can mute him i can make him score leader i can report him she will just report him and get him yeah let's do that i don't think that would be very sorry is he trying to get it should leave you want to just leave you can leave yeah we've just really started this match see if you can pull this out and they can pull you out let's not make this weird i'm leaving you're done all right let's go okay exit to menu yeah shoot me an invite or no we're in a party i think we're just gonna yeah we'll still be in the same party but we need to queue another zombie together we're out we have left party give me a second do you guys think there's gonna be like uh i i feel like it's kind of awkward when i go click the game and it's just this guy staring off right here woody from toy story it's just i feel like he's kind of awkward it is and there's i can't customize my character or guns or look at the guns [Music] another origin code that part doesn't really matter i'm not original serious like is it gonna be just in game or are we gonna have like a menu outside of it too i would imagine i don't know like to see what things we can unlock or what's to come or like i don't know we're losing this one already oh yeah we're going to losing game what the heck if i got that m2 if i tap out of the game it doesn't put you in until you get back in yeah i can't change my loadout until i die i gotta go in and die and yeah that's what i'm just learning i don't have a weapon like in my hands yeah no oh i do have a weapon when i spawn it's from whatever the last game it looks like click to spawn redeploy then choose my stuff the ak's bar i always have to change the uh the attachments on it yeah we should it just removes the attachments oh yeah no every time i start a game i have to redo attachments yeah likewise and sometimes it bugs where my preset doesn't save plus system no there was a guy right next to him my pistol works okay now i spawned this guy camping come on we definitely have some call of duty players in here i mean let's be honest the game is a is like a blend of modern warfare and battlefield what is the double a missile have you tried that hey you missed no i haven't seen it i haven't tried that yet anti-air i guess probably just locks on yeah anti-aircraft that's what a means come on you played not battlefield games commander yeah i guess so i guess so i thought it was like you know auntie it's the uh i hope there's vehicle unlocked yeah yeah no idea the anti-aliasing launcher that's the one no way he hit that shot i hope we get the tv missiles in the helis for this game yeah tv missile clips from bf4 were just insane i'm just saying that would be cool you just said i haven't found him yet how do i release the grapple whilst on mid flight i don't know before it reaches now oh my god okay question can you set a specific hotkey for your optics it's like can i just do f3 to auto switch to 4x and f2 to switch to you know what i'm saying i don't think so i'll be way too op right i'm not saying that that's what they should do i'm just wondering if we can do it and i could utilize that i don't think this is high yeah i think the system's cool but i think veteran battlefield players are going to hate it because no one's going to work as a team yeah that's insane here we go everybody just goes on top of the tower too i just i just spawn on my top of the tower those helicopters landed on it this is gonna be every game oh this is good if you give everyone the freedom to just change stuff on the fly like this it's just nuts it's definitely gonna be like a metal weapon because you just turned like a m4 into an smg or something i think you can actually put a an smg mag on that m5 is the tornado in yet does it start swelling up ramona can tell up here just got who are you what have you done with fogler weatherman wait pick me up at the hiccups oh my god don't land it i just want to hop in hold on it's a war zone a little bit locked on now we better hurry dude rubber side down what are you doing i'm shooting my missiles i was crushing myself oh he's doing it wrong oh boy he's doing sideways it's a bit of like this this a k i'm just using it for the first time it's actually a bit of recall with this one but it hits hard yeah i don't know it's very good though you can control it yeah cause yeah that's down there full spot so tom cause the lmg actually has barely any oh so the right plug is very close i'm dead vector jesus the tomb nato okay so when you push t if you press one it'll it'll cycle through your optics so you don't need to mouse click it what t so e and then one we'll switch your two is for the right one wait what um three and four just toggle them or whatever your your thing is and then t will switch over so you don't need to click it that's confusing as hell i'm clicking it yeah you're just like yeah you'd like press old man classic yeah well you know but stone when you do that you've realized you don't see what the it doesn't show you the negative and the minus the red and the green okay it tells you like which attachment is best you know i mean like if you hover over the different barrels for instance you can see the stat like what it's taking off from what it's adding okay yeah but now press the numbers and cycle between them and it won't show that statistic you have to do the mapping yourself yeah well i i'm just saying if you want to switch them quickly like if you just want to switch the optic i'm not saying to do yeah i'm just saying i'm just saying contrast if you guys don't stop saying i'm gonna lose my shoes what i'm trying to say jesus i'm just saying that all right big brother jay thanks for the ten dollars dude appreciate you operations your videos make my day every time much love brother

didn't work i'll come back off the gap yeah i've eaten two c4s i don't think i needed the third um i mean i think it's just another it's just another tower match isn't it by the looks of it okay so i've been told that if you swap ammo you would have to reload that exact ammo type again so like if you use your main mag oh interesting completely like halfway and then you see a tank swapped through that those eight rounds of reload otherwise right yeah well well you do skip over the load switch it and the gun does go down when you guys revive i don't know if there's more enemies on the roof so i just give up there's people here i'll give up oh you guys are a different spot normally there's too many explosions going on there comes the roof let's try again yeah i'm dead donut hole bro get me

well welcome robert and scottish spider with the 4.99 you guys are too kind man love the content was what you started earlier who was stating the glock is worthless doesn't feel worthless it's just it's it's very effective at close quarters but yeah i would like to try the the uh the revolver it's kind of a staple when i run a sniper rifle i think i should have it if i choose the right class my game capture was in the corner i was all tabbed my bad yeah the games it keeps a bit weird like if you all tab just like put your game in one corner tom what do you think of this beta being a different build to the one you played on monday see it's hard to tell man like i don't know if this is netcode server side i knew from that first match like that was not a fun experience i had like two over 200 paying so everything that i knew from playing the game only like a day or two prior i had to completely try and relearn because i had to lead like two seconds in front of people or 200 milliseconds to be in front of people all right let's play objectives are we doing objectives objectives okay listen think about it that's it though i'm not gonna play the objective i'm just gonna think about playing the objective all right i'm gonna start off this round by redeploying okay this is it guys i like that let's play objective don't i don't know where this guy's taking a ptfo i can't i don't is he taking us out of bounds we're out of bounds we're literally out of bounds what why did i spawn on you why did i are you kidding me this is how we start the game i'm not playing the objective this is what i get from deciding to play the objective wait i chose the dmr how did you die stone i died why did i swan i literally heard the words you were saying and willingly selected to spawn on you yeah what are you doing oh my god dude all right you're the funniest [ __ ] i've ever seen i'm glad oh my god oh my lord that was a good start boys was it yeah can we fly again w this game's about bw not like that guy jesus wow streaming i expected more from you i couldn't i couldn't i could not freaking control this this is mental mistakes were indeed made i feel like i need a joystick is like leading me on a wild goose chase man i don't know which way he's gonna hey you're right this is full out of this ak i don't know why yeah you guys need to change the timeline it does have a burst my mic now did you say what you said what it was not wrong i thought that was at least i got to another random vehicle here right off the cliff come on man huh i went to give you ammo and i went right off the cliff huh all right we're going for the d cliff i mean this rooftop we're going for the decembers oh shoot it's a robot dog the robot dog just obliterated us the big weenie rocket hit the driver of the vehicle in front of him he span out he's crashed again he's killing it it's too much for mr incredible i just gave you ammo where'd it go i don't actually know oh man not in my rocket that's for sure we're capturing d these nuts garnier hey that guy in front you should be one tap there connor got him everybody's up here with us i'm jumping i'm gone look how fun way out there that's way out dude not the tank not the tank not the tank not the tank go peek that again double dog there hey guys double dog gamer come on brother who do you think you are i love how everyone just like everyone takes in turns to take a few shots off the side and then they inevitably just get shot in the back on this roof you guys are on that freaking roof again like they just go from no no no i'm not going there this game i'm not going to go there no i'm playing objectives i wish someone was here to help me yeah i'm playing them come on come on lady that's what i said inning this is it this is the game that i don't go to the tower i've trained my whole life gameplay you must resist i'll come help stone the jump shots are actually okay though they're sick you seem to be accurate on this roof with me apparently can you not be in combat i can't not be in combat how would you expect me to help you then oh my gosh the frags are disgusting they do insane damage dude it's fun now no i'm just getting it on these guys you just throw them and you get free kills it's amazing wait you're just throwing amazing just just throw them and then people die it's like wow i didn't even know these years playing battlefield i had no idea that was a thing exactly that's what i'm saying too excel exactly i just be shoving up my up my what uh i can't even talk right now this is so weird that's so weird was that weird that's a guy don't die let me spawn okay i'll sit here in the middle you're doing it wrong stone i think so he's rushing he's rushing he's rushing it could be english i'm not sure is this why we win we all just we're on the same wavelength it's just what makes what makes this squad so great at the same time because we all just finish each other's jobs we're just finishing sentences yeah we'll just finish each other off yeah sandwiches wait that's so fun oh boy that's the part you say fun to nice wait what were you talking about i wasn't listening i was just throwing it down there you know all right what were you talking about i didn't listen to you it was just his own tune yeah just has his own little twist on it do we have two members on this rooftop again i spawn there so i can go to the next objective all right okay he's like they were accurate call outs but you just kept doing 180s because every time i said it you were like what army well tom have you called garbanzo in yet i can't do bonzo owns all garbanzo but he's not going to be very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good on this one for you boys get in there oh crap do your thing every time i smile i don't know should be on the way [Music] yeah that's okay one crouch slide fixed it that's a heli that's early that's a heli with my name on with my name on with my name on i'm getting into i can't shoot with my name on i'm being blasted in the ass don't get out if you run recon that can help because it'll show you it'll kick somebody up there behind you there's a lot of people spawning on this seaside i'm trying to swallow it every time i do i just die another dead guy that looks like a man who's actually alive on this episode of battlefield 2042 marking oh i killed a man that was already dead maybe that's what i should do oh oh oh you actually have to take the plates yeah yeah you press four you know when you just game i'm dead yeah when you're gaming and you know when you're gaming yeah i'm gaming right now man actually funny story that's crazy i know right thank you man someone just told me in my chat that if i stay on this roof any longer i'll get mistaken for a skylight oh wait are you on the roof to go up there tom what are you doing on the roof man we need to capture charlie one i said one thing to do capture charlie one and you're still up on the roof i've got a job to do all right i'm crossing this field boys wish me luck man the recoil in this dmr is kind of funky that was epic music i will say that was happening i put a lot of effort into it i only spawn on the roof to jump on the point and kill this guy oh no i've got a kimbo vowels in the in the chat i mean when you're on this much of a streak you know like do you really want to get off the roof oh shoot ice actually through frag cover you just shouldn't be on the roof i think that's the issue on the road keep having it off the roof tomorrow up in this [Music] why did i do that i don't know going the wrong way oh my grapple actually this could be perfect this might be the opportunity i've been looking for oh yeah yeah there is an enemy there you go should we should we try blowing up the rocket i mean the ship oh i keep going i just wanted to explode objective or oh what are you doing up here actually what's up man what are you doing you said we couldn't go on top of the roof right so oh don't freak me out like that no no it has to be fueling up oh okay this elevator is an absolute jack shake a what what did you just say a junk shake shake yeah it's like a milkshake i found a bug too i can't die that's a good bug just call being good um okay does that live dude i can't be it dude has he seen my videos he has no idea oh come on tom wow somebody says that i've had such a scream i killed someone with a grapple hook and it was amazing now oh really yeah yeah you have to hit them twice and this is the headshot okay so the dmr is not awful it's just not good yeah you have to wait for the recoil to sell right it's not as good as what i would like it to be i think sure oh damn he's up there he parachuted up there what what does this happen to you stone did you fall all the way down there and killed me i'm going up you can spawn on me if you want i just got killed by gg noobs cool gg noobs did you noob chop chop chop it ready guys i'm not paying attention to the sky the guys just don't just keep killing me i keep forgetting to hold space it's hard to respond to you i'm just sitting here like waiting last night there's a plan i don't know what streak that was because it didn't tell you how long of a street you had but that was pretty crazy far ended i had so much fun in that roof sorry did you did you accuse me for sitting on a roof and then you're in this tower that's pretty stupid tom provide me he died because you guys those balls are pretty good though if you have grenades come on yeah the name you know i wanted to be all right oh doggy to me i did jinx myself okay let's see have you guys tried the healer class do you know how it works yeah a 20 kill streak and then like a healer so tired or something steel or there's a self-heal oh that's sick sick and bad all right guys we actually captured our very first objective okay i'm only here i promise this guy in the little bird is doing i don't know what he's doing [ __ ] go kill that guy well i'll kill him for you sir get on his ass i'm capping the point because i'm a i'm a team player so okay now that we have one i'm going to move to the other objective here i come tom yep i'm going to see one right now that's the next objective like one in the building and then one outside it i'll guide us in nice okay that's the teammate i'm gonna slip us right in the back here point look somewhere it says you're slipping in the back flipping in is that charlie one we're on it yes yes yes queen yes uh we're on a test that's a that's a ball that's a ball yeah there's a few bots over there i think they all just spawned you're calling people bots yeah it's about dude i know guys are toxic man i thought you were different oh that's a tank oh there's a hole there is an objective up there isn't it wait no what does that be up there you see that is that an objective [Music] yeah dude be ones on top of the tower bro yeah we have to spawn up thank you for becoming a member dude now we have to go up the tower cheers barry i can't even get it to like thanks for becoming a legend you guys should um i'm sure you already wear one why would you stop there but they bought these the jeeps having the radios throwing me off yeah it sounds like voip doesn't it yeah it's kind of weird actually where's the zip we can take one okay you're muted you're muted by the way oh sorry this guy just knocked me off the chute what what did i jump down i'm coming number down he died from fall damage oh how embarrassing dude i can't even notice that oh there's long wheels a lot of dead teammates up here though imagine getting obliterated by a tank what they've learned wait where'd you go oh wait oh you went up again oh yeah you don't even see the zip oh i'm coming [Music] dude let's never let him live this down oh we can't are we all we can't dude this is it go back up oh full damage done done a full damage got it nightmare behind us classic mover that's a classic that's a banknade 180 360 no scope all right let's secure a roof here let's get this objective i'm going to behind us trying to help throwing frags on them i'm gaming now i've adjusted to the slight lag that i've got on these servers but next time we're on eu i'm throwing them so many i was more to save my boy yeah yeah appreciate is there more up here i'm on the front side you're on the top uh there were like if you look at the above that where it's the cat point is connor it says how many people there's one right on me right now if you see my body one right on us actually got it just realized down the stairs the cover art that shows you that player card looks like no no i want to repeat the magnum try it out it's great i've been absolutely popping with it if you've got a good flick shot if you've got a good flick shot it's one hit headshot it's great it's gotta be in in cover out of cover right yes keep dipping and diving i went on the most ridiculous spree i think i've had things like 20 kill streak with a magnum in the snipe just defending that roof this heli is pretty slow if you can hit it with a rocket you're better than me they're trying to attack uh c1 again i'm there with you one we are getting absolutely obliterated these guys have got so many objectives on us should we try and play the objective guys oh my bad what's up tom what's up dude i think this video is going to see forward i was you it was me just pooping down a little bit drop an apple don't go away yeah they've got right across the road they're behind us the vtv where's the teamwork right vomit unbelievable [ __ ] thomas back on b1 no i'm see one up on the tower ugh c1 guys all right spawn me up there you won you later oh dude i got into a turret of a vehicle of some kind c2 c2 later would make more sense don't c2 later yeah that makes more sense you're right see one you later why can't what what's happening in this vehicle oh see one you later idiot well i just you know it's just like a quick quip i was going for that's great yeah i mean yeah set me up for mine i didn't really think about it too much yeah yeah i set you up bro you get us that's a that's a good friend right there wow where where will he be i'll go up and get that b point boys hmm that was close i almost killed that guy if it wasn't for my shitty aim i've got stone in the alley no i wasn't a heli i was trying to ride on one but then i got out okay oh while you're parachuting you can get onto a zip yeah yeah yeah you can also suppress space any point jump off it you can do a bunch of like free maneuvers that's so sick you get much more freedom and you get a shield on the zip too i just killed somebody who was camping the top of the zip what a sippy we should try to sipper for a different objective i'm going to try and go for e1 i'm gonna try going forward oh the nuke is flying are you going for anyone a glitch oh okay i don't like that remember what we had in ghost recon when someone was flying the heli yeah yep that's it's also in this wait i don't remember are the two pilots or whatever i were out front of the heli oh yeah actually in the vehicle they're just i'm leading the way remember when he said that that game was so funny did you know that have you seen the dislike ratio yeah yeah the the battle royale front line i think is cool yeah yeah his name on like properties that don't need it just because it's just because they've got the licensing to do so yeah yesterday all right today take off with you guys on the jet he picked me up i'm in the sky i landed [ __ ] i'm going for echo one right now oh my goodness i just need to reload never mind maybe you can't go back in the jet okay i'm gonna fly as slow as i can under your trunks this is the slowest i can fly you gotta come right near me oh i can't i can't get in i have an elite pilot only one guy on echo one with me if you guys come over we can cap this for sure uh we're doing the objective right now i'm on an objective [ __ ] objective that we're trying to do oh tornado coming in for hurricane i guess this is over the water right that's a direct time i'm on it oh damn wait you're taking me outside the zone bring me back but then you're dying hey t family why have you done this um you cannot mow the grass in this game that was so sick we could do it again i could do it without they're on c1 have you tried spawning on b1 yeah i'll try it okay good night but we're gonna lose c1 in the process i'm still getting locked on here yep there's a heli and a plane on me what i think we i think you can actually stay on it actually oh my god the points shuffle because we didn't have a b1 on this roof last time we played i can get you i can get you yes we did there's always going to be one up there he's shooting you in the head no no i'm not even there mate relax still to put you on point find you this music though okay the music will say like what is this what i just heard that 10 minute cooldown oh you're saying you're nice dude nice i'm not even doing anything winning murdered that guy what's happening right now he's shot in the ass uh oh you don't want to get blasted can i revive you okay thank you guys thank you so much for coming out thank you appreciate it did you enjoy the stream make sure to drop a like and subscribe yeah gg drop it a like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah notifications share it with your friends that was a good game we played the objective the whole time still lost by 500. so you know we actually performed worse than when we just focused worse yep i think we did worse than when we're just farming bro you know actually had like a 50 bomb the other game uh we still lost that one too but you know either way we were closer to winning we were closer to winning that time yeah and you know what that's all that matters oh man all right how many codes have i got left another code going in chat all right this time we're going to play the objective early access so not late no i think next time we don't do the objective honestly i don't want to do the objective i don't think i do the objective this time at all it's worse because you just i don't know we're losing yeah the tornado's awesome players we're losing the game when we play the objective can we just get the tornado already like come on if i'm ready for it i could i was i myself 1v1 soloing echocap and then i just i i didn't get the cap anyway so what's the point you made jalapeno poppers val what's lovely that is pretty pog um i think we just focus on getting as many kills as we possibly can what are you saying wait this game's already over we're losing turn around we'll turn around why there is no way we can turn this around unless we play objectives 10 times our score right now dude that's why they added us to this game oh my god it keeps sending out [ __ ] you stopped having it out of the game like your voice goes so lucky just switch it to full screen i'm tapping it play borderless yeah we can turn this around easy right everyone split up and take their own point i still don't have a gun even if we cap every objective we're still going to lose because they only need to kill 49 of us okay yeah should we just quit let's just wait it'll put us in another game yeah until the music is going to play for like 12 hours everyone just keeps spawning on the roof and just died to full damage they'll remove our tickets items are pretty good is there any reason to use irons over the teams dropping like flies nine tickets left already unless you just like it all right i have all the four i can't even close it i can use like my facebook chat i can move but any other window like discord or anything i can't stuff dude stuff oh you have an overlay bug the service is definitely unique in terms of crash issues we're having i don't know should we wait he's got a frozen you talk to you later yo westy if you want some games i mean we've got a new world um yeah we'll be interested to see if if this game like what the difference is between this build because they seem very confident that the game's come a long way since whatever they're showcasing it's a very specific bug that i've had of eagles the guys haven't really had it i think stones had it once but like yeah it is a repeating issue that i have all right i mean we're going to full screw the objective kills right okay that's the only way we're going to win i think that's how we win yeah i think that's how we're going to actually win okay i popped off so i don't care about the people in china telling me not to snipe because it's it's happening no you do you thanks boo are we dying are we getting wrecked it's another one um are you guys down for wesley to join oh yeah you can probably go once how much longer you yes how much longer you guys going for not a super long time um probably another hour yeah yeah perfect i love that for you thank you i love it for me love that for westie i love that the parachutes sometimes glitch out and you can tell where everyone is yeah she's like look at this guy look at this dude dressed as another dude looking like another you do dude what you do you can't overuse it now come on okay just having fun stop it get some help with that what's up for you totally original enough fun dude just think of the amount of trick shots and like the the grapple hook is going to add to the game they do need to reduce the cooldown though because you have you're able to use it more times in pathfinder what body's just floating here i'm noticing a lot of player models just floating that aren't actually players too what's they can just join the chat i thought to drag him in hey there you go wow i gave him too many too much permission um how's it going you're right okay my apartment's basically my apartment's basically empty and it's really echoey right now um yeah so basically my office is completely bare all it's got in is the desk and the two pcs that's it um it's very very loud in here gotcha i can't hear anything different right now oh that's good any gunshots and stuff going on i'm just gonna hear the sultry tones of westy's voice this evening so soothing the lower end of his auto sprint that you were talking about tom it's good dude like if you don't if you don't um i haven't been noticing a difference honestly between regular sprint and double sprint like that's what i mean the ready time is the same oh really yeah it seems like it to me where is it on foot auto sprint yeah traversal sprint on oh but now my oh wait what is that yeah do i have your own hours income i think i just sent you a firm request okay always use traversal sprint let me yeah the game and then it goes into into a tiny little window i am mini field mini field are you guys not on border list there we go full screen yeah i play full screen yeah but when you minimize the game it like puts it into a tiny little window all right should we back out then yeah yeah i'm down has anyone had the bug with the rocket launcher where i don't maybe it isn't a bug but it fires two rockets oh that sounds like a great bug they should keep that in the game but yeah but both rockets hit i don't think it consumes another extra rocket though love it freebies it's very weird make it an easter egg one in ten thousand chance yeah destructible tree no that tree is indestructible how about this one you should be able to join us all right leave uh if i leave party or do i no no no just just quit just leave game yeah it'll keep the party together how do you leave game press quit exit bottom left quit it says abandon battle and return to maine is it the main menu yeah that's the one whoa oh damn you don't unlock anything in the beta um joskey all right am i selling your guys's group here you just select a a weapon might not become available until you select the right specialist if you know what i mean i think some specialists can't join thomas who's the party leader [Music] you can click my name connor and then make me make me the king make me the king that's a weird maybe that's an onion origin thing westy where the screen just goes tiny yeah i don't know dude my game was screwed early it was absolutely ruined i don't know what happened oh no it went to tiny field then it went to 4-3 field then it was like pixel vision and then it literally was cycling my monitors and then it would crash my pc and restart my pc completely i don't know what was wrong what the heck i had to completely reinstall the game it fixed the problem but like it was progressively getting worse for the four hours that i played did you make me lead connor i don't know how to do it i've tried i clicked on you it doesn't work is your name just westy on origin mr pro westy it should be and if you see the big orange orb that's probably the right one i mean i do like i can't invite you for some reason when i see you in the party slash friends thing send friend request i see him i have added him we are now friends maybe it's just a party host thing yeah i think i can join actually there you go perfect there we go send us to the all-out warfare to the gulag the 200 ping field let's go baby i hope it's not fit too bad i've had some that's just 100 and then others that are 200 but yeah you just got like try and figure out what the lead is for both it's great it's fine it'll be okay you've got to pretend that you're using two different kinds of snipers oh god did you get any uh decent games though earlier i got some great games like i got some really good like moments like just running around as a squad just capping flags and taking people down it was crazy yeah we don't know what that's like yeah we do not play this you gotta you gotta show us how to win man we're uh i thought i thought you were you were the guy to come to for wins you know you know you thought right but uh in execution and practice not yet not yet let's just put it that way have you guys discovered the power of the dm7 is that the dmr the dmr yeah is it actually good i don't know man the velocity seems to be much stronger than most of the other guns yes so i mean i'm fighting a three shot kill two shot headshot yep it just fires slow so like you have to choose your fights when i um when i picked up off you connor i actually did get a few kills on that roof at close quarters like it felt pretty good for cqb it's it's good cqb and mid-range long range it's still not bit but none of the guns in this build are good for long range anything even sniping i'm i'm not really enjoying it because the velocity is too slow yeah the sniper velocity is so slow it's not uh true game day actually he measured it he said it was 600 meters per second that's it yeah yeah it's pretty low that's like the um it's like half the guns in war zone that i i usually i mean literally right now if you were sniping over to e it would take longer than a second for the bullet to get there dude yeah anyone see that and two it seems like sometimes i hit like it looks like i hit but it doesn't hit yeah it's a little bit there was it there was a guy driving a vehicle from spawn at full speed and a teammate grappled onto the back of it and just like skied down the road like like he was on a surfboard in the snow he managed to grapple onto a friendly helicopter yet and it flew like florida no but i wanted it i wanted that to be a thing i did it in the test lucky managed to kill a pilot by firing the grapple at the pilot out of the heli and pulled him out of it yeah there was a clip that think battlefield i think battlefield retweeted it right because yeah i think why they like uh direct impacted the guy if you get a head shot you can i've killed one person with it but i had to hit him twice up a torso you know what i'm just going to run around oh yeah baby but once it hits it doesn't latch in the halo flight test where you pull yourself to them and then bash them in the face it's a bit like someone just throws like a bit of metal i'm enjoying it yeah i'm enjoying the beta this this build is obviously not like they they said that they've they've come a long way with it foxtrot i think i think it is a clear idea of what the experience is going to be like how do you tell if you go hard to really judge the game based on the options [Music] i do feel like i'm being limited to a particular loadout range lmg dmr like i'm doing now sniper rifle so i want to try stuff out like a vector which i have done before but it's just not suited to this map whatsoever unless i spent the entire game inside this building here it's a bit um it's a bit overwhelming the amount of information that's there yeah it's a lot of stuff yeah i'm sure we'll get you but and it's also not yeah i think it's just it's just different than what we're used to normally you hit tab you see both teams kde whatever guys is that is that an honor oh mute yeah it's pretty obvious that this build is nowhere near what the final build will be though yeah um do you know what that yellow hit marker is is that what armor headshot i think yeah it's headshots yeah i think it's headshots you can change the colors in the accessibility too top of their tower over foxtrot sniper up there okay if you're in the air change the size of your crosshair and the thickness of it yeah i saw that too i haven't messed with it though you want a thick crosshair yeah you want to know whoa what is happening i'm being mortared how spammable is this dmr uh semi spammable at close range anything beyond maybe like 30 meters and you're probably not looking okay i'm literally i've just turned into a icicle there are many i'm doing great i'm going to run out of combat here so you could spawn right i'm here playing this all right copy that i'm trying to move up on foxtrot because there's a dog uphill on our left so i want to go up to the top of the hill oh we can kill the dog easy yeah come on let's go i just stay away from the dog dude it killed me last time i tried to 1v1 it's to our left here you guys see that right there you see it's marked if we if we hide in the bushes it can't say it's not there's two dogs oh no i'm out of ammo one dog dead second dog with a rocket i'm gonna call it fighter i'll put it in a crater it can't get out wait i did my double rocket again i think it's dead right it's dead yeah the dog has been put down just didn't really like make a big fuss all right just one final worth one crying okay i think we can change the name to run around huge map field right we all just have to adjust our behavior start rolling in vehicles all the time that rolls off the massive field massive field of battle wars correct is dead i didn't know you'd get a zip line up here tom no different to warzone it's basically the same thing somebody told me this game was too much like fortnite earlier and i was like ah didn't realize it yeah no that's a good point at this point i think that's really weird people are just trying haven't they removed the reinforcements feature that was in battlefield v oh it's okay tom it doesn't matter everything counts difficult i mean to be fair like it is easy to draw comparison in terms of the movement it is a blend of modern warfare 2019 and battlefield i mean i'm all for games taking the good parts of others and making it their own so because it's how it's how we get better games absolutely the only reason modern warfare 2019 was so good is because they had a few years of their cod not being the top dog and they had to raise their game so yeah i don't know even if modern warfare 2019 came up with tax brent uh i'm pretty sure other games probably had like some sort of like quick sprint to get into cover or something like that so got him out high stone there's more on point cut do you see the clips done on twitter of some guy driving a flying a jet through this gap no they flew through this all the way out to the other side which is like symmetrical these are insane yeah i'm killing ai guys i'm on an absolute tear of a streak this is oh you like your side canceling thanks dude i've had absolutely no benefit shooting actually slows me up yep i'm sorry just slowly catching you but because there is a slide mechanic i'm going to do it all right all right you know like just leave me there there you go pharma man but what you can't do in war zones oh a couple of them by i can't even describe where it is but it's by usc okay between us never mind you're dead yeah i'm dead right now your mouth no it doesn't work i have found the one of the best classes if you just want to run rounds like a rambo solo you just go as falc with the what's it the revive syringe thing so you can heal yourself and then just stick an ammo crate on your client yeah okay you do find it yeah has the vehicle spawn been really inconsistent for you when you're trying to pull up the tablet oh it hasn't worked for me once i've had it one time and i had to be on the flattest surface possible jesus i don't know if it works like i try and call it in and then i don't wait around it does what it should do is get oh here we go assigned drop point you have to be honest you did it yeah i did it my vehicle's coming in did you just respond behind us as well accolades you're left down off that cliff do you know the one other place i was able to call it in on the helipad of the tower yeah on the roof because it's so flat yeah yeah actually no there's a tank it's okay just drive i'm actually i'm pretty much out of ammo here it's kind of sketchy to be pushing up with nothing robot don't go shooting me got another one though oh it's done i can give you i can give yama dude yeah if you got an ammo that'd be sick there you go oh my man there you go my man i'm just going to rest some ai i'll be here gives me another armor too yeah i think he does black pressing air was that guy all along shooting at me if it was get wrecked oh i mean you know i mean you know yeah is there suppression in this game no no that's good nothing i think you get pre you get pretty heavy flinch if you get shot at so you know it'll kick your aim off target but that's about as far as it goes which i think is good and then he proceeded to absolutely annihilate me so far by we've lost sector f who else hates the big bar that appears at the top of the screen all the time it says enemy game sector you can turn it off but like gotcha brother it is useful information oh never mind you died yeah we died again if you play with hud off wesley it still pops up i mean that's just a bit obnoxious i mean doesn't it doesn't it just look like hey we're trying a new feature so let's put this really basic thing in to see whether it works speaking of which lads get your uh get your thumbnails together i gotta go quick oh by the way if you do ui.draw enable space zero in the command and then hold the plus menu it brings up your gun on the screen and gives you a lovely depth of field blur in the background if you do what so what have you do you know how to use command method yeah ui dot draw enable space zero turns off the hud yeah um yeah and then if you hold the plus menu whilst hud is off it shouldn't bring up the plus menu but it gives you a nice gives you a nice blur in the background plus menu like the t button or whatever for your attachments and stuff oh okay yeah i gotcha toggling the ui in um in the in the game settings won't allow you to do that it still shows it yeah so the ui.draw enable space zero turns off literally all the ui and hud completely so if you went back to the main menu like in the spawn you wouldn't be able to see anything oh it does go a bit darker but i suppose you could brighten up easily and oh yeah definitely you can definitely brighten that up the only thing that like the gun profile on the screen isn't so great but you could probably still make it work if you like look to the sky or something because you get oh yeah you get a nice little depth of field on that i found that earlier i was just messing about cool screenshot for sure don't worry i'll res you ai the life of a youtuber okay in his thumbnails mid live stream hey multitasking dude oh gosh this is dmr i swear it shot slower enemies and who's not depends on which um mag you've got i think if you've got the 15 round mag i think you can fire a bit faster a ton of them jumping off the tower right now okay oh yeah i see them oh no they're sniping me no it has to be a friendly oh yeah dmr's away dmr is great i went on a 12 kill streak on a hillside earlier with it just dropping am i healing myself with the revised pen or whatever it is uh ammo are you using ammo aculate of course i'm coming your way draw enable one is that back yeah yeah space one it brings it back yeah bringing it back i love the uh the uiless game is just beautiful yeah it is very attractive very attractive the only thing is no distance no distinct faction so you've got absolutely no idea i'm just shooting everyone the thing is i've actually found it's not so difficult to know who's an enemy and who's a friendly very well i just think yeah just yeah sometimes the dot over their head disappears and i just started yes yeah i put that i've made a little video wait don't tell me the guys behind me were enemies i'm just shooting everything whoa what the all right heard i'm gonna need you back it's about as useful as everyone wearing a rose again isn't it chocolate yeah they i wonder how they would do hardcore then too i feel like that would be even harder well i think portal like you're gonna be able to do all these settings on your right of your own apps and everything yeah to be fair though i mean you'll probably get a lot of free cosmetics just by playing the game so not everyone's gonna be looking the same but like the fact that i don't know yeah just the specialist system in general like recon and having two different factions russian us forces whatever it's also always easy to identify who i i got a feeling that they did the specialists because like you know we were talking about borrowing features from other games like every other game yeah and not only that like modern warfare with all the characters like building the world and stuff like that you know it makes sense but like the implementation like where you know they all have their own traits and stuff like that why why did we need that we didn't need that just yeah just make them the normal soldiers and just let people pick it based on character customization just leave it at that oh my grenade grenade i was an ai hey hi he just like direct impacted me with a molotov ruined oh my big noob my game in korea is over boys literally have you been banged up by the ai yeah like multiple ai on one human when they i i'm going yeah like a gang of ai oh my god no i have it things are tough yeah i like when they all look at you and start shooting you at once it's not fun i love that you come back for that soon oh yeah what am i going to leave that on the table there i need to learn how to take off so now what what okay that guy's dead you've been playing since 10 today no this guy's level 10. he's been playing since he's awesome yeah he's ranked up you started early this morning wester yeah yeah i was on a well i i started the the the loop at you know 8 a.m like yeah that's nice it was 8 am for you guys yeah well i mean like for me normally like the embargoes are like like 4 or 5 p.m in the afternoon so this was like early morning embargoes like unheard of yeah but um yeah it was interesting because like this for me this is the first battlefield game since four where i just didn't know anything about it until i got to play it today which was actually great it was really refreshing it's really it's nice right it's quite refreshing yeah not knowing what didn't get fixed from six months ago that you found out about that that no one else ever found out about and you can't be annoyed about that this time could fight of all time trying to figure out the drop of this dmr was against a sniper who's missing all of his shots no don't use the very last hey you're right there's not much drop at all oh my god what is this this guy's just floating in the air it's great the damn in the beginning like when i used it um when we were in the event it i swear it shot slower i feel like dude there are so many bodies just floating around randomly in the sky or like t-posing or whatever i don't know i don't think stein's talking about the game guys it's just really floating this guy's floating man outside his window snatching your people up yeah i'm not sure how i feel about the ai i think it's really unsatisfying when you kill somebody and then it says badass as well exactly like i sniped somebody on a zip line and i was like oh and then it said ai retweeted doom oh god yeah there's a clip of doing the c4 with the recon drone stone and he is mate he like flies it with guidance from his mate underneath the heli blows up the entire area yeah and they have the most crazy reaction and then it's just like force yeah i'm just killing a bunch of ai right now i don't know if they left or what no one's flying this it's about yeah like the reaction is like me killing someone in far cry oh it's going crazy but the thing is earlier today when i first started playing this morning i was getting a lot of ai in in my lobbies then by lunchtime there was barely any now i played a little bit this evening and i thought i saw more again so i was like what's happening here don't you dare kill me you helicopter bugger off got him you're wrecked yeah eyes after me send help [Laughter] don't you dare come after me you helicopter dude you're dead you bloody helicopter i mean yeah you can spam it but there's definitely bullet deviation with the dmr yeah which is good it pings about what was the hot key to turn this stuff off you said it was ui dot draw enabled to say one of my biggest gripes is non-first-person assassinations because they're the most janky thing i've ever seen in my life like oh they're probably just not done yet it's just because well no i i think i'll probably carry over to the main game because the problem is is they have that thing where like if if a enemy is on an elevation the animation doesn't tie you both together if you know what i mean you both do a separate animation right so like i'll be slicing the air's throat and they'll be at waist height right okay so yeah cold war animations yeah it would like cut you into an animation that's like its own instance if you know what i mean one thing i will say is i'm killing lots of ai this round and then when i come across an actual player uh there is clearly 200 mil of latency but with ai there's basically yeah i'm literally shooting at a guy who's clearly a real player i think it's actually closer to three i'm landing every single shot every time no problems but like before before we got early access to play early that you saw thank you we're in a presentation um with a few of the developers and like they they it didn't sound like they were just trying to tell us what we wanted to hear this is a good game i'm enjoying like they genuinely sound confident in the actual build of the game um the thing is the reason why we're not playing the build they have is because the stuff that they play for internal testing isn't designed or has been like i said earlier they basically have to make two separate games they've got their one for internal testing and then the beta build which they've had to polish up as much as they can to show it for the first time but there's obviously going to be imperfections and a lot of the issues that people are complaining about they've already addressed and said that hey look we we know these are already problems with the game and they've already been eliminated the build that we have um so it's just a matter of time i am interested to see those seconds for some reason i don't know what's happening yeah that's kind of unplayable i mean i'm going to be interested i'm contributing i'm throwing down am i it's the greatest fight i've ever seen it's getting those points yeah oh come on dude let's make this fight as awkward as it possibly can be yeah it's busted you can spam fire the rocket oh player dropping in from b cut his parachute coming down he's slammed into the ground wait a minute wait a minute if you spam click the rocket i think you fire multiple is that what happened to me earlier when i was oh dear that's a bug how many can you shoot i fight three in that instance what does it use your ammo or does it just shoot you put one in no because i remember i did i shot a tank before and i got hit markers both times where are you done all three let's do it how do we do it have you got the rocket so just spam click it does it do it for you i was getting hit marcus on the tank all three times but i don't i don't know if the damage applied well let's find out shall we i think it probably is look at this guy doing his t-plus thing yeah he is that's a nice third-person thumbnail i'm gonna try this thing out yeah i was gonna say he's gonna stand might a latency issue for me westings we've got over 200 milliseconds ping in the top right press tab 100 top 50. that's why oh well we're inside where we're going to want some and no wonder things have been weird for me yeah there you go we should not be playing on this we're losing anyways yeah i can shoot i can shoot two rockets and yeah shoot do they both actually explode though like no that's only the first one okay this dmr is actually pretty true to like where you shoot that's crazy it doesn't have a lot there's less drop with the dmr than there is with the sniper yeah dmr's got faster velocity than the snipers yeah the best scope that it has isn't good like it's basically a red dot but like it's still decent okay it's not even a 4x it's like more of a holographic doesn't only has a one-time zoom i think yeah it's not it's it's a nice optic though yeah it looks clean you guys want to leave this one i'm good okay it's all right we'll see the game through we're in it now we could just be in another one it's fine in a crisp look at the velocity on this that's insane fine we'll just shoot ai dude and not have a problem because they're not they're just standing still for us that's great yeah i know that's what's saying that shoot the ai there's basically no latency titanfall tried ai didn't they not i didn't go down too well i mean it was all right i mean yeah i was used for something though yeah just to build up your streak yeah and they didn't try and get involved in the action if you know i mean they had their own fights in different areas yeah they were they were worthless points too they're just kind of their own little and you could easily tell because they were smaller little guys yeah do you think that this game should have a a separate kill counter for how many ai kills you've got and it shouldn't add to the main ones you have um but little timmy needs his kills i've just been assassinated yeah yeah i think it's gonna be confusing if you separate it out little timmy doesn't need his kills that's the problem i just sniped that guy with a head i did i headshotted that guy but then what happens when little timmy is recording and trying to be a content creator and he doesn't know all the information about battlefield and thinks he's just had the coolest clip of his life and he posts it to reddit ready for his career and then just gets yeah that's true obliterated by the hardcore communities in isn't that like you know when the battlefield account tweets your c4 sorry they did expose him to that because every one of the comments is like what do you mean it's ai ai yeah that sucks dude that sucks that's the thing is like i feel like the game it's okay having ai because it's casual enough to where it's like you know yes at least it builds it like it's not that big of a deal it's not like you're competitive anyways but right that's what it does suck for when you hit those insane clips then it's it just takes away from it do you think it's competitive actually this is the most controversial i feel like you feel like you've significantly contributed to getting dubs here today i've been trying stone i mean you did have a 50 bomb that we lost by 700 points on that was pretty good yeah that's yeah we did throw it because of you so nice between the 9th and the 10th i should say oh so we don't know the timing that is ending on the 9th but i mean for some people it will be the 10th i guess this guy is so lost not long to play but i'm glad i found him you can help him to his grave i'm sure they've got a dry info that they need he's beyond belt it's good though i'm really enjoying it like i'm not having a lot of the issues i'm dead oh i really want that to be headshot i feel like the dmr might get nervous i'm having a lot of the issues that i've seen people complaining about also i would prefer everything else get buffed yes i think let me meet these guys a sec um majority of the issues are on console side um on both you know both sides of the spectrum playstation 5 even though like the current gen consoles are suffering some issues what the hell's going on here then again it's what i'm telling you how many times that happened to me i fire the perfect shot it should be in line oh he's having a fight just having a 1v1 what's ptfo it's play the [ __ ] objective that's what that means that's what the lmg's for the 100 round mag yeah great anyone really like been using the uh the ap rounds uh i haven't really touched them to be honest yeah oh my god i got a kill on an actual player i mean the opening to my video is basically about that's what i'm talking about oh yeah your opening was very good tonight made me laugh a lot what the hell i need stone you shouldn't watch it okay you shouldn't watch my intro easy why not full damage um you're saying there was a crunch listen acolyte's the fall damn guy what he literally downloaded as a sample sd can you believe this guy i never said i downloaded it they're crush don't don't please don't tell me you you recorded someone eating a crisp no they'd be chips mate bloody ketchup chips was it don't make fun of ketchup chips stone loves them they're pretty good honestly we have them we just we just don't eat them oh this truck looks like it's down for a beating and i've i've taken a beating yeah so you've heard some people say it's bad on ps5 and others said it's pretty good i wouldn't be surprised if they extend the beta through the 10th oh oh we lost i don't think we've won a single time today yeah i wouldn't i would not be surprised if they extend the beta yeah i don't know i don't know because of the issues that control the console players event what's the main issues a bunch of crashes um some graphic glitches like uh hey push it back if you need to push it back texture's breaking and stuff the game launch yeah whoa connor whoa dude seriously dude if that needs to happen do it yeah nah i mean it's true i would prefer the game be flying like there's so many bugs like imagine if there was just no bugs and all of it was working on as intended like that's so much better how many issues have you guys had on pc i know wesley had some bad ones this morning but i've had none other than the ping issue because the game the game like the netcode doesn't feel accurate totally played early no but we were privileged to be the only ones playing on their servers yeah um so my fps keeps dropping i think there's i think there's some leak yeah there's a couple stutter issues go headstone i mean i i just feel like there's tons of bugs i'm seeing like soldiers is floating around i'm seeing parachutes floating all over the place when i spawn in my attachments are wrong i get into vehicles my keybinds weren't even set like i spawn in my guns just infinitely shooting i can't and this is just like in a two three hours of gameplay it's like every game there's something wrong yeah it seems like i'll agree it is is there's a lot of bugs there are a lot um but the devs have been pretty vocal the ones that like they sound really passionate and sound very confident about the build of the game that they're working on internally and the one they're playing on that's i'm just saying like they're like seeing a bug in the game that you fixed like two months ago and it's got like a facepalm gif yeah he's like yeah and uh that's that's good but i mean i'm just hoping that when it launches that it's not so many buttons so like to actually point i if that if it is like this at all then it's like that's going to be really tough i'd much rather have all of this stuff just definitely smooth across for sure it's like i'm seeing a dead body right now what are you staying up if this experience was the case for every platform it'd be okay to launch obviously this is this is better and i think a lot of these issues will be going anyway but that wouldn't be okay to launch yeah i don't know about that man if this launched on pc like this i i don't know i'd agree like if this would be i would say no delay this what i'm thinking is compared to bf4s launch yeah we're on a bad server i knew it yeah yeah i'm 180 yeah let's switch servers let's just let's just get out of there switched right yeah false launch was like i was just very wonderful well that's what i was trying to tell people too is like even in the battlefield three just in the beta that was really rough too like i feel like a lot of the launches are can be pretty rough historically with battlefield so it's like yeah you know i think that's just kind of how it is a lot of the problems come from the fact that it's it's got a more casual approach to like some of the mechanics that they've had to implement just to keep it accessible yeah like the bot system is ass let's face it wow yeah the problem like it's okay though it's like it's a casual you know it's just for casual game get some kills like if you're if you're new to shooters in general like i feel like this is going to be a good one yeah but what i'm hoping for is that because when we get hazard zone and hopefully yeah it tells a good story but that's where the content's really going to be for us in terms of what people are probably going to want to want to view the most yeah because i think hazard zone will still pack all of the all of those elements where you've got like all the casual stuff and it will just filter in like the core elements that people actually want from this a lot of the bugs we're seeing accurate or a lot of fps titles i think there's just there's a there's a few things for me like something acceptable some things definitely aren't yeah yeah like i mean when you when you're being revived and you're on the ground it takes like five seconds from the cat for the camera to transition from third person to first person and you can glitch the camera so that you can like get out of first person and like be behind your soldiers you're it's it's like there's clearly some things that just aren't finished that's weird yeah no and that's where i feel like i thought that was deliberate yeah a lot of the animations that's the thing like it's this this version feels so different to the one we played um i think it's probably something to do with the fact that you know we were playing on like a very small number of servers and like no one would it wasn't i mean the public beta was it sorry no but the animations aren't client-side so like when we when we played i found like going from like throwing to crouch sliding whatever all of that stuff out super fluid and in this version of the game i feel like there's some i don't know lag or like server like latency between those animations they don't feel quite as clean or look as clean everything feels a little bit more disconnected yeah definitely i'm surprised too like i some people are saying like i kind of wish i knew what the other mode is before i pre-ordered the game as well yeah the hazard zone because like we've heard you know a couple things of like okay this is what it's going to be like or whatever but i don't know what's it actually going to be though that's that's the thing this is my point if this is a build that's a couple of months old obviously it's not good enough for a release but what i mean is the problems that are here if if the development team are as good as we know they are and can be like these are all issues that can be turned around in a week they can address this stuff super quickly i mean it could be it could be addressed i i you know i think that they packing it up it could 100 you know we got this game the game was delayed by what like a month so the beta was delayed by a few weeks so if the beta build is two months old like they're saying it is technically the beta build would be a month old if the beta had been three weeks back yeah so i can do totally understand why they delayed the game a month because like they needed something this is what's interesting about what you got like you're saying like this is a separate build apparently this is a brand this branched off months ago this is a different thing like what's the point of even doing the beta then like the beta isn't the is it the point of a beta to test it out so we like can give them feedback and like improve it for whatever yeah this is what i've been saying for the past couple weeks if not like all these betas now i feel like this is just a marketing thing at this point it's like okay let's split up another thing yeah and we don't you know the feedback's really not going to be anything we're still going to do our own thing with it anyways let's just see if we can get a bunch of people to play it and do you know what i think they do that like the beta for this is like they've probably got some stuff with the ai they want to test they want to test the matchmaking they want to test server stability which arguably has been locked in place for months anyway yeah that's important stuff they want to go and they're like look we just need to make sure that this actually works on a large scale yeah and that's that's all they're doing i mean it's the fact that this beta is literally four days long like battlefield betas are usually like a week a week and a half right they they're clearly just doing this so they can get the data that they need to be like yep the delay was justified so we can fix the bugs we know that our server system is working okay we can launch on november 17th for whatever problem is with these betas is that we get a beta a month before the game launches which is not accurate to what being inside the dev team would have a better build of the game so like if we got this if we got to play this two months ago and it was like this we'd be full of hope but like we also know that there is a better version of the game that the team are working on but for the casual player who's just like oh there's a bear going on and they might want to try this in the open beta and they're not keeping up with the news some of these issues are going to be the energy that way exactly oh this game is so close to release i don't want whatever they're to to incentivize even to the point of what you were saying westie and i i felt the same way it's like i didn't know anything going into today like i had seen a minute and 30 seconds of gameplay of multiplayer stuff like okay let's see what let's see like a lot of like i like that they're delaying to show us what it is it's just i'm sure there's a lot of people that are also in the same boat and they're gonna see it and be like oh and they're but they're not gonna hear the caveat of like oh yeah this is two months old build or you know whatever so yeah i totally agree and like you can see it like obviously when we're like part of that one percent that follow this stuff and like you've got to think that joe average who's just got his xbox and he wants to play and he wants to play like a friend exactly [Laughter] just you know it's always been said it's always average joe joe joe average mate do you know his name right yeah it was weird he had his surname is his first i guess you're right he's just a formal kind of guy where do we stand yes mr average or mr joe his first name's average wait what okay you can't place ammo boxes up top somewhere they seem to just disappear into the floor yes have you guys tried the slug round shotgun i've not even no i haven't tried that one yet kind of slapped you know medium range this is much better server guys much better server yeah i got a 35 bigger 100 yeah i got are you closer if i'm further now i'm probably closer to the cable i'm probably closer to the start of the cable you know southern privileges and all that that's the one watch my back we captured this flag i can't find them i think they're down below me underneath the building here yeah there's a guy i did not like the blind fire mechanic in vanguard i completely agree i don't have ammo on my class how is it blind fire see what you're shooting at always go with the ammo this is their idea of blindfold oh i'm so blind it's just hit fire mounting that's all the all the mechanic is they're weird though isn't it oh my god that's heli jesus yeah this has been really inconsistent trying to spawn in vehicles that's another issue that i kind of forgot is that i can't spawn in vehicles correctly yeah like they have that so that's a kind of that's like kind of a major problem for one of the biggest maps in the game where there's three or 400 meters between objectives that's one thing that i think the like dice may struggle with a little bit to begin with is like getting people to you know change their behavior and get in vehicles a little bit more because it's not natural for all those players to do that like they used to make maps like operation metro which is like condensed af so yeah wait this is my tank it's someone else's maybe that's the issue is that so many people are bringing that up at once and you can only spawn in a certain number of tanks or whatever no i'm just clicking it too late oh no sounds like so he can't give me the prompt because it's just not saying you know it's already deployed or whatever all right come here you let me snipe here in the face are you still sniping no way i don't know i just i i'd ran out of bullets so i picked up someone else's i'm seeing a lot of the teleporting player models now that you guys are talking about i haven't really seen that in oh my god there's somebody downstairs you haven't seen that before i keep getting that not as not quite as jankas as that was have you had the ones where they're literally like motionless and then yeah yeah start shooting at them yeah and then they start running at you and it's like a like a jump scare yeah so you like leap forward like 30 meters i'm like this is not helpful oh my god i was unaware of this when i had a sniper rifle headshot we have men coming up hill what is the velocity like let me tell hell he's not having a good time they're like little cucarachas little cucarachas yeah i really want to snipe it's like yeah i just pulled the sniper out it's just too big of a map isn't there like i don't know i was using that i honestly don't like it the bullet velocity is too slow for me mm-hmm i agree no i don't think it's very good but it is pretty fun it's rewarding for sure yeah yeah yes when you get that kill it's like yeah sniping out of here just like that just like i did with that guy oh you just wanted to kill me you can switch to the second mag on the sniper and it gives you faster rate of fire uh obviously you get reduced range yeah i that's one of the one i was using and i hit a head shot on this guy i got the yellow hit marker and they didn't die and i felt so sad so i took it off is that the vector by any chance i was like how do i hit a yellow hit mark headshot and i i don't kill him what do you mean what do you mean i don't kill use your arrow keys is oh no oh no oh yeah we're gaming now dude dude this is how i'm gonna be playing the game forget the mouse you know what that's why right control was shoot the right control is bound to shoot yeah so you can do the arrow keys you can play with just the keyboard bro oh my gosh innovation the innovation i think that's for left-handed people i don't think so it's it's replacing the mouse it turns you wasd does different things than what the arrows key arrow keys oh yeah no yeah you're right it's like it's basically replacing it's one of the thumb sticks it's like you said left control right yeah because i was like i unbound it because my control was i was just shooting randomly i thought that might have been probably i'm ready like the intro the keyboard only gameplay the down hour for me is uh mute crazy i'm playing on console down arrow is mute yeah i pressed it and then looked down i was like hang on like it looked really snappy but i like to be successful how do you zoom in okay i'm going to try and we're gamers guys this is nuts let's go follow me oh one tap of the keyboard i'm like how's the quality is it looking all right how's the game look on the other channel it's easy easy job hit markers the 440p is also going to be good but like when there's movement it can be quite pixely i guess oh you know what tom we have the technology if i start there it doesn't look like there's zeroing in this game anymore either no no they they removed that it's too hardcore we're too hardcore man there you go this an enemy i don't know why i almost got him almost okay just to confirm there's no t you can't tag anybody that either right like if i'm hitting ping there's no point in playing right yeah the ping doesn't work at the moment the game doesn't matter you know what two i don't like is the compass spawns on the bottom when you aim downside the compass comes in on the bottom like what what's up with that i think it's because of that stupid bar at the top where it tells you what's going on let me turn hud off and then tell me this game looks bad because that my friend is illegal almost killed myself i think the i think the thing that people why they're coming to the conclusion that this game looks bad is it it's not gritty like it's a very clean looking game in terms of how to explain this like there's no clutter around you know like there's not just like like trash and cans and whatever all on the floor and the graphics aren't muddy it's a really vibrant game so it like shows any flaws that might be visible it's very bright that's a teammate the lighting seems off to you i mean the brightness i mean i set my game's brightness to you know to the point where it's like hey set this until this part is barely visible is that better it's a little more realistic in tone that does look a bit better actually yeah maybe uh dante thank you very much for the the 1.99 man do you think this was worth killing battlefront 2 uh oh but yeah you're right because they focused a lot of that development team on this right i think that the nail in the coffin battlefield offer on two was just how that state that game released in you know because yeah that game could have been great but they and and it was it was by the time they council development but only the players are stuck with it got to see that right so like if um if they hadn't had such a shoddy launch with the the pack system they had and that whole loot box debacle then yeah keep battlefront 2 around because it would have a player base but let's be honest the player base was very very low as massive of a franchise star wars is it makes more sense for them to cancel it shift all efforts to battlefront it's battlefield 2042 and then if another our front game comes down the line or a new star wars game then i mean just imagine what that game would look like with the systems that they had with the frostbite engine it was it was dead on a rival that game they had so much like this like that's another bad thing because i know there's players here look i mean they're teammates but you get the idea it's uh it's the gun just running around with no heart is quite nice it's a couple guys up ahead uh many men many men too many men too many many men oh no robot doggo take it out we melee it yeah exactly just imagine my bar front uh gaming our front three would look like graphically like the the photo realistically afterwards imagine a refined version of that looks like we got more gamers down the bottom of the hill here yeah there's a gamer there gamer gone yeah gamer down you guys killing gamers yeah yeah yeah they're getting gamed upon are they doing the gaming no we're gaming what you're doing and i've mailed him third person there's two guys after you're right yeah there's another guy in this bush here please i can't i thought i saw somebody in the bush he did not react at all let's see how to appeal huh i'm coming back towards you guys i mean one thing that we can all agree on is regardless of the state of the game it's fun yeah yes yeah it's pretty fun man you know what i like about the movement too is at least from what i can tell it's not the old jumping and like strafing left and right when you're going across like if you jump in air before it keeps your moment it keeps your momentum yeah you know what i'm saying but you do lose momentum for the stuff that is abused in other games like you can't crouch slide but if you try it the game doesn't like you can still jump while you're running like instead of crouch sliding in this game you kind of jump like that's always it's kind of like the leaping gazelles was always you know yeah battlefield it's more it's not as slide cancelling in this game it's more just jumping but in previous games if you jumped and turned right it was like um what was the term quick strafing or whatever in apex um where it would keep your mouth tap strafing so like if you jump and turn right your character actually turns right in the air yeah right like in this if you jump and you try and turn right your momentum is still going forwards like it actually would in real life right and yeah you can't do those those weird ass mechanics but that was something that's always been like at least that i remember like that's been in battlefield and people just keep jumping and turning and jumping and it was so hard to hit them him i do like the like that feels better to me you can do that as well you can do like two jumps in a row if you can land the jump properly you can get like uh especially if you're especially going downhill yeah as well you can you can really hop yeah you can jumpy jumping is very uh effective in this you gotta show off my palestine yeah yeah yeah i'm just pulling cover he's in a bush alright um do we know if the tactical sprint actually gives you increased movement speed uh it does slightly i think it does slightly and it's also infinite as well it just it just yeah are you guys using that thing now yeah i turned it on yeah i turned it on i i don't see a reason not to turn it on it looks jankos as hell because like it doesn't look a little weird when you can't see you just especially if you keep jumping like i'm just sprinting around flips in your hand constantly i feel like mccree this guy just prone outside a he's literally just in a bush prone to a battlefield player the sprinting doesn't always look like this chad lemon if you think about the tactical guy i just killed that guy he's literally prone outside a i'm not kidding he's prone in a bush yeah he's if you think about the tactical sprint in modern warfare 2019 they have that in this game but there's an option here uh that's a keyboard on foot always use traversal sprint turn on to always use reversal spring when activating sprint by default you can enter a traversal sprint by pressing the sprint input again after activating sprint turning this option on changes this so that you always use traversal sprint immediately upon activating sprint sprint sprint sprint sprint sprint so yeah why wouldn't you turn that on to have the faster movement speed like that just seems weird like just have a normal sprint mechanic get lead great drop you can see the bullet trail as it's going out if you're going to see where it lands the dust kicks up if you're gonna give people an option to sprint faster and it's a toggle option in the menu and it's infinite i reckon why would they not just have yeah why would they not have a normal sprint function that is just one size fits all i reckon they'll i reckon this is one of those things that eventually they will just have it like i think in the build they've got at the moment it will be balanced so that it only works for a certain amount of time and then having the option for auto attack sprint is just it's basically like modern warfare it will just do it as soon as it can how is that tank still alive sure it's gonna blow up and say it's literally on fire literally on fire literally literally literally on fire oh no this man he did some assaults and died but i have rezzed him oh god yeah i can't can't piss the whip that thing just stopped i wanted to see the uh in the objective what is it valerie the hammer on the revolver look good does it the rocket definitely blew up sector echo fully secure oh yeah you can save money yeah i mean that's i think that's industry standard now i think yeah i like having the reload uh i think the guy actually has a youtube channel know who he is he did like some fan-made halo style rebuild yeah yeah but like one man army build is where it's at animation at the moment we literally have 64 real players versus 64 real players in this server oh nice it's a full human circle that snipe just felt even better got him off the tower oh my god i did the same thing about 500 meters away ah this is more like a thousand thousand meters it doesn't show you the distance right no no that's what's that's kind of sucks i will say it also doesn't show you the amount of damage you do per shot which is something that'll be a five yeah that's true it doesn't show you that yeah but the head that was always nice like because you would get when you would get a long range headshot you would also get xp for the range of what it was and that's how you could tell the range and that was always super satisfying for the long range 400 500 xp or whatever it was yeah that boost was big it doesn't even tell you when to kill like when you get killed let's be good across the field oh yeah dude they don't expect it they think you're gonna go through the tunnel of death is there do you know is there supposed to be a map though like when you push m uh yes it's it's just broken okay that's good i because that's driving me bananas i keep like i i wanna know like what objective should i push where's the teams where are people gonna be spawning yep i'm the same i always use the map it is free to play i find that there's open to everyone um i like to be able to zoom in and out remember you can just push n on the minimap or even just be able to make it bigger like in the previous ones you can make the map the mini map like 140 150 percent or whatever yeah yep i mean i don't know if console players don't get that option do they don't have the excess the same accessibility options no they don't have you guys turned your hud motion off though oh god uh i don't think so actually i've turned off trying to i turned screen shake off mine's a 10 percent a little bit of wobble yeah a little bit of wobble a little bit of wobble in my life give me the marble bar we gaming now we came in with the pbx45 never stop gaming i still haven't used that it's good yeah the man has just stopped in front of me he is clearly arranged i like the graph i like the zip lines and the grapples as well you can just slide up to him three snipers on me now because i've killed him so many times and it just instantly puts you onto the the zip lines there's no like animation where you have to like stop yeah and the fact you can shoot on them and do all that stuff it's like it's so nice it's so nice yeah zip lines in the the grapples those feel fantastic how do we use the underbarrel shotgun oh my god i finally died i actually have the game going on no i did no wow there are so many people on top of the tower right you can change scopes of this yeah i was just looking up and yeah there's x the dog is up there shooting one second left i don't actually know if we're on russian teemo we win hey we i just needed to pull my sniper out that was it that did the trick finally we're on the winning team i had to pull my sniper out stop playing the objective and just play one man army yeah yeah wesley carried us that's true that's true i was just gaming you're gonna call it that everyone or oh yeah dude it's already five huh yeah i think i'm gonna call it there sounds good are you taking a break that was fun though overall like that was great it's great to have a new game great to have battlefield giant maps yeah um but definitely some good stuff to hopefully it's already improved what it sounds like is that you know they're going to have all this patched up for the game which is fantastic and i i hope it is and there's going to be a grind we're playing this but there's no objective in terms of our progress yeah no attachment unlocks no new weapon unlocks there's only a handful of weapons that you can use um it'll be interesting to see how this compares to the full experience indeed fingers crossed man that was fun though guys thanks for playing yeah yeah that was great if you guys want to team up some more on uh this or when it comes out to sd or anything yeah yeah i'm down for that for sure yeah i'll join you again stone i guess uh well i'll think about you actually i was kind of talking to us you know i was kind of directing that more to westy but you know either way whatever dude whatever works obviously in new world but i guess not wait you are no no no no come on over bro come on over we're getting smashed we need all the help we can get bro we have zero territories we have ze none heartbreaking i'm wasting so much cash my gold is going out the window it's terrible man i need help oh i can't relate to the new world life ggs though boys i'm gonna go all right that was good fun all right chat that's gonna do it for today i hope you enjoyed that that was a lot of fun honestly it does feel a bit different to the the build that i played and i recommend you go and watch the first video that i posted on the game because i mean the moments that are in that video you have to see them um but yeah i mean first battlefield 2042 stream on the channel first of many i hope um and yeah thanks for the support tonight you've been absolutely incredible as always the the amount of donations and just you being here is all i ask but um yeah good time i'm looking forward to it i i i have got high hopes for the game because what we have at least is a fun battlefield experience that has some modern additions that some people will hate the veteran players it's not going to be what they want but they will get accustomed to it because it if all they've done is play battlefield they wouldn't have experienced games like modern warfare warzone or maybe even just dip their toes in but there's a yeah there's a lot to there's a lot of fun to have to be had for sure uh but yeah have yourselves a good one um enjoy the beta goes open on the eighth um yeah it's gonna be a good time i'll catch you guys later later that's not my outro i'll catch you guys catch you legends in the next one oh my god at a brain fart alright bye
