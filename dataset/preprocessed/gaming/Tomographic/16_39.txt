crack that guy okay we're gonna be held from the right as well now the vehicle get blown up i think we pushed that bridge where they were okay let's get under the bridge there um vehicle yeah i thought you were still in it otherwise i would have got yeah i don't know if we should wrap far left or if we just hold the middle i think we go left because we got the other team on the right here when you shot from this way yeah from up ahead here maybe right of blue there somewhere maybe at these trees we've got definite here though we can hold this two other teams that's it they're one just
