smell dog okay then the other guy is here towards the quad bike this was the guy that air struck you so the other thing is you got still three other people in this game okay relax holy are they inside the building no they're 195 out of rock yeah in that direction tom went outside oh try behind us you stay inside very straight it's crossing the road now they're both solos you are gonna have to rotate zonk and you move slow accolades so you're gonna want to move towards zone here or just cut them off but you're going to have the other guy to do that you might want to go for the quad if you jump it moves a little faster if you jump every leg yeah there's a guy here on yellow he's close buildings wow there you go what am i supposed to do to secure that juggernaut was like nothing i've ever seen in my entire 100 that was crazy i had no idea what you guys were really doing you just said take the trains and then i started taking the trains and tom's dead it's faster for him to just do it than try and explain it because it's quite a weird process yeah i had to do an i activated a secret code which i had to go over to the airport in order to activate a special train which took us to underneath the dam that was where we got juggernaut and then coming back we were in the gas so i died tom managed to get the thing going through the train okay and i'm popping a uav calling the juggian new roof it looks like hell yeah did you make three cool noise for me oh nice you know i just killed him you knocked him oh my god i knocked him i'm gonna call don't precision him then where's the hell yeah he got finished he got finished okay i want precision chase there's so many stairs i feel like the hulk i hate the stairs oh yeah you realize who i was now huh go ahead hop in that hilly you jumping off northeast over me that no yeah sam oh oh oh right here down low to the right [Applause] another one just landed there hola senor he's getting shot from another angle in the direction he's running he's dead he was getting shot from that direction yeah because they just thought they just bought there oh no nevermind is from the other side i'm in second floor white house wait if you drop me a bullet he told no he jumped out he jumped out yeah you can jump on him hola [Applause] oh one second floor he's right here on yellow head nice i lured on me from southwest dropping on people is the best oh my god oh he's up here with me got him nice because he's coming back to the bye these guys are both running though kill these guys on the road here to the right yeah that's not happening bud perfect all right we can go back for that guy now okay reloading this is fantastic wait is that oh i thought that was him he went back to the buy station he's on the roof i don't think that was him that had been somebody else oh i don't think so either someone's clustering us go go go someone's after their lucky charms man oh my goodness i could call an advanced on him yeah you might want to see him to the right of blue he's behind a red outfit oh you should drop me from above oh you wanna i'll just kill him i totally forget about that someone is shocked over here yellow yellow somewhere copy i think it even the funny thing is i think it even one-shots vehicles oh it does well that's that's the thing you ought to be careful of though because if you land on a vehicle it blows up moving you want to land on them yeah i'm gonna try oh there's another one good luck yeah you did his buddies over under me here you want me to pick you up are you good yeah you pick me up okay this is great hulk smash all right he was last seen on that live mark i'm gonna go in second floor yeah i'm guessing that guy tries to go back for his stuff yep he did this guy's down [Applause] coming for pick up the other going for altitude oh you got him get him get [Applause] what a him stuck the landing let me grab this stuff real quick all right make sure this is too good man this is great war zone at its finest great all right i'm gonna go get another uav it's gonna call a bunch in yeah we're going advanced here there i'll just hold that and then let's rumble just feeding me oh no oh you hit the tree dude hello wait how far are we how much time do we have on zone time see i don't want to get too close because if i blow up in this thing and we don't have a trophy on it i'm dunzo's you'll be able to tank at least one of them but yeah but i can also get you back in right that's true oh just other side of this fence and in the second floor god wow don't shoot me please no no let's see if we can take these guys out one second floor i think window back scene nice i don't know what i picked up you definitely knocked that guy second floor okay we gotta have those guys over on the ridge they're gonna be pinching us i don't even know if this is the last team we have no idea you wanna go try and hunt them out or what do you think i just don't want you to die in the vehicle because you'll die right if it explodes maybe let me drive you hop out on your bridge or something and i'll see if i can get some snipes if they pick you on i mean i have a precision as well they're up to the right [Applause] i can't oh i hit one okay slowly running up and when i say slowly i really mean slowly you have a self that's fine i fire strike them i'm selfie idea if i killed him with my airstrike or did anything but i didn't think he could call him i didn't even call it in no i didn't he's running back up the hill oh you did knock a guy i didn't kill them off far left unless there's might have been somebody else i knocked on he's getting shot uphill to the left over on yellow i'm coming up he's got me marked nice we win it no way oh my goodness gg man oh my god he had me live pinged he was just trying to headshot me i was smart i was smart didn't actually get a lot of damage and i think that's because the the slam doesn't count for damage oh yeah just instant it's just dead yeah they just die yeah jesus man covered in blood man they should be carrying me from like the lift underneath so big my guys ggs guys [Music] you
