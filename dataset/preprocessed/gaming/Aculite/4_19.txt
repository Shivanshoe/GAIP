oh right here oh that's you again man sound in this game yeah it's a little strange sometimes oh he's right he's right down here there's three there's three headshot the left far left far left quick scope oh my goodness it had to be done it had to be [Music] so this is the cycle in my personal opinion i think we need more games like this if you're familiar with a game called escape from tarkov that you'll understand the cycle completely except it is an overall simplified version of that game the whole point is to go to traders in the main area accept all the tasks complete those tasks within the game and then go turn it in for more rewards gear and better items overall once you start leveling them up the catch obviously any gear that you bring into the raids will be lost upon death and unlike escape from tarkov these worlds are going on these servers are going on for a long time it's not just 12 people loading into the same map at the exact same time that only lasts about 45 minutes to an hour so there's always gonna be people dropping in these drop ships and people escaping and extracting throughout the entire lifespan of that server so it makes for a very unique experience so i'm gonna be playing with my good friend fuglet here we're gonna be exploring doing some tasks and obviously as always focusing a lot on the pvp since that's where i tend to have my most fun killing people and taking their gear really hope you guys enjoy the rest of the video i'll catch you in the next one yeah they had a bunch of different stuff on on pay-per-view what the hell did they have on there it's generally movies right can you buy movies on there oh i have no idea it's not not really a thing in denmark so all i know what is about is this is boxing and stuff that's like how you watched at home movies before netflix and all that stuff i got blue helmet what's with these logs over here we can just farm these right in the starter zone wait what are these i want one what are these they look cute uh what do i need here i'm just gonna use this okay right i gotta drop you the janitor's key i forgot to still have that every time i want to give it to you dies i mean yeah

exactly where it's at don't have to kill stuff here wood cutter camp and i need to go to water facility and kill stuff i need to kill creatures with my pistol oh there's to the right that sounds like

two out there they're shooting a mob is that you that shot and hit him a bunch of times oh my god his one body just went flying got the other guy are they both dead yeah i saw a body go flying i'm

rushed from everywhere i'm hearing a guy right here in that building hit him a lot frick i can't get in there he's wide armor only he's on the back side now your side okay there's no way he's still in there what outside he might be dead headshot his buddy over there dude i'm not even taking damage they're running they're broken out here might be too they're both in the same team they have to be and we got another team then i'm not really sure they're right here yeah pushing up the hill killed one the other one's up here on the swiping we are coming oh my god that's scary oh my god that was just
