wait am i in harry potter vehicles can fly upside down now what's going on so over the past couple days i have taken to some solo warzone and if you have not tried solo warzone for yourself i feel like a lot of people have then you'll totally understand when i say the game is random nothing makes sense people sit inside buildings they camp in bushes they will be anywhere and after playing for a full couple days the first day i died 7 out of 10 of my games were from dead silence i don't know why that that item is still so insanely strong the drop chance on it is huge i feel like it's even increased in solos for how often that i see it and then the other three deaths were from concussion grenades so 10 out of 10 games i could not fight back on the deaths that i had none of them were fantastic games by any means they're very early on deaths but it just sucks going out like that and i know many people have and that's why the game becomes so frustrating so hopefully developers will take a look at these types of i'll call them inconsistencies because stun grenades not a chance that you're fighting back against that dead silence there's currently no counter to it there's no perk or anything and i think the drop chance is a little too high but i am very stubborn so i set out to try to get a couple of good games at least one and i think that's what happened good games i'm not so sure entertaining i hope so if you guys do enjoy please leave a like i'll show you a couple games now thank you guys very much for watching and i'll catch you guys in the next one just take my kill oh my goodness game's lagging what captain she clapper okay did anybody else hear that there was glass i heard glass break and then this guy pushed me there's no glass here okay you open that door there oh my goodness please i just have a moment of peace no way he gets to live i missed one bullet that's all it took could hunt him down with this though okay he's been hunted down that worked see no one ever does this i don't know why people don't do this like tell me that's not one of the smartest things that you can do it's completely safe everyone always trucks it outside okay so i figured it out i know how you can finally beat solos or at least mitigate how much you lose you generally never win even if you actually win in zolos you don't actually win it's just pain just pain all day that's it but what you do see use one of these any sort of vehicles that are used which is like all the time people always try to run me over and drive at me take them out with that because they're not always gonna have a trophy system on it and then of course restock with stun grenades that's right i did it cause if you can't beat them join them what is this guy doing is that him there's closing in relocation hostile maneuvers i'm afraid this guy on the left is going to snipe me [Music] went to the other building didn't he the heck is going on here people want to fight then people don't want to fight you're a little expired come on man you're running around in a rose skin with a sniper on top of a hill okay jump slide peeking like a maniac if i kill you that's on you friend sorry man you're the guy from earlier that guy was really angry wasn't he i mean i get it solos are awful they're just pain i don't even know why i'm playing them right now it doesn't make any sense i think i just like pain that's what it is oh yes no you should have had me only because i hit headshots there did i get you how did you know i was here uav no i have ghost oh you know what he drove up he might have saw me in third person that makes sense that would make sense okay i'm kind of afraid of pushing this compound there's a couple vehicles there yeah see there's a guy there already great for finishing off people too hell yeah pain is coming i feel it it's gonna happen listen you just gotta climb up the tower like you own it and then no one will look here because it's mine right that's how it works i belong here no come on why you gotta ruin my fun who looks here enemy team is tracking your position i don't care that you know i'm up here i'm gonna sit up here hostile maneuvering hostile maneuvering please get into a fight please get no fight please give me a fight i can kill him oh my god man this is amazing does he have a rocket launcher dude are you kidding me right now go cut it out holy oh my stop it what just happened did he just get direct impacted as he gulagged back in from me killing him earlier what that's an only in battlefield moment it is you couldn't possibly have that happen again see didn't i tell you the tower was gonna work though i told you where's that from are you cheating what's going on over here did you murder a guy for me yo i appreciate that thank you man it's very kind of you enemy uav overhead oh i missed that shoot get me recall uav entering the ao enemy uav overhead this guy above me isn't there all right pull up your socks this is where it gets fishy we're in the end game now and a win or lose the end is coming gas is inbound marking new safe zone yeah i'm dead of all the places you could be oh my god that's how it goes just remember warzone solos is pain and pain is weakness leaving the body and i have so much weakness leaving my body right now might be a lot of people going here i don't know we shall see that didn't work oh my god i should have came here first oh those guys are going really far i have ninety nine hundred almost got enough there is somebody underneath we have eleven hundred zoo is that that guy like a minebeam i'm just trying to clear the area a little bit before i get my loadout oh wait there's no buy station here what am i doing ah closer i might have a free kill here i think you might have flipped it he is [Music] there's another guy down enemy there overhead no luck on the wall bang he might peak this one of these windows though be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply if it did sounds did we push it okay campbell's soup hey that's good stuff oh my god why was i not using this sooner this thing's amazing oh my god there's another one yes yes yes yes yes yes i don't know what game i am playing right now but this is fantastic recon is inbound anybody here uav entering the ao this gun is still crazy i thought they nerfed this didn't they change this like recoil or something no way i can't do anything about it [Music] either hey i absolutely need to push that guy man they got up there's no way that this isn't the best weapon in the game right now a chunky bit of money didn't he get me recall uav entering the ao uav entering the ao uav entering the ao look how many people are in prison what one two three four five six seven eight there's eight people at prison what i've never seen that before it's just too good it's just too good so much damage hey whoa chill relax stop cut it out and get blown up what was that fight trying to be friends what there's no friends in solos okay no friends also using a riot shield so we like 100 can't be friends it's just not happening get fire on my target this is tracker 3-1 good copy let's back up i just get an armor hit that was lucky i never trust these doorways anymore the amount of times of like people have just been sitting here i'll chuck a c4 out ready as you're driving by closing i see you this thing just cooks people so much damage headshots just like three headshots and you're dead a little recoil i do see them we got a rose skin down okay i thought i saw like some sort of leg or something over there gas is inbound marking new safe zone [Music] see down below no way no way oh my god it's slays i totally understand why everybody's using it yeah this is definitely how you have to play solos kind of just gotta wait everything out play a little patiently because if you make the first move and somebody's sitting around that corner like is that a guy right there i don't even know you start questioning everything are we living in a simulation that was awful timing for you i'm sorry gas is moving in new safe zone located enemy cluster strike incoming take just inbound oh my god am i gonna have to wait this out for real i have to get inside the zone i'm gonna die it's moving again okay okay just beamed me right through it i'm dead though that's it can you get the stun grenade off he got me right through the tent riot shield ending oh no what a game you know i haven't had a solo match like that in a long time that was a good game those prison endings are always so strange you never know what's gonna happen you
