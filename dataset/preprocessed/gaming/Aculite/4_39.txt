cleared it almost oh wow he's gone prone come on refusal i killed him this is why we play battlefield gentlemen i can't believe this guy's still in my gunner this entire time i believe you're still in it what does that mean high ground i'm going to d1 later you've reached the promised land i'm flying down to d1 you're gonna there we go like no oh my god this teammate is trying to push everyone off this brought a big smile to my face all right we need the hotbed of enemy players move out the way tank with a real tank around here that's right you just are you just driving jack yeah i'm kind of driving this is the lover craft how many stalls is that on uber  jack just thinks you can go through anything with this it's invincible dude there's too many tanks that you left in your trays so i'm having to deal with i wrote one of them a tank wait he jumped out the tank destroying i think it's better oh there's two guys over there no no there's one kill it's so easy isn't it oh my god he's

not to rez ya don't resist sorry why go on the hovercraft bridge that would be great wouldn't it i have like a 90 degree angle here oh got the guy closed what do you do jack what do you do against this i don't think you can do anything oh my god the guy behind us too up in acolyte oh yeah i love that uh he hit the rotor so i couldn't i couldn't control it as much let's get to work constantly being hacked locked two on the left building left side left side got him smoke screen out let you get some ammo back we got one up to our right out here is he still camping out here he's got a beacon get that beacon out of here i can't return to the engagement you got it i think no no i can't shoot it oh yeah i guess it's dead i don't know a huge guy right here right here dude oh there it is oh my god two more two three more four more i need ammo i need ammo that's right i'm backing up i'm backing up we're gonna get ammo and we're gonna come right back over the ridge once they're all respawning my four five six i'm good to go okay moving up they're all back up here they're all back up here i'm at ammo again guy in the chat it's not called sit back it's called breakthrough that's good that's some quality memeage right there quality meme there's a vehicle after us nice quad i gotta find some uh higher ground getting us over the ridge here again there's so much to shoot at i don't have enough ammo for this i know oh this guy's trying to see for us nice got him nice i need to lower the gunner sensitivity okay i'm going to get us back how many vehicles there are health here oh look this guy's back out here accolade honestly what is this guy doing he's got a beacon out there mr fuzzy nice keep going straight ahead straight ahead oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah we're going in the belly of the beast here off the left nice straight ahead behind the truck nice well done well done off the left off the left huge huge huge huge left side big man it's so dumb oh my gosh dude we haven't even needed to go get another one yet oh no yeah i gotta probably unlock that oh the tornado it's sucking me nice love that for you i love that for you tom stop bragging get the kill feed it's just what is my stomach is hurting in the back in the back of the truck i can't see anything oh we we gotta we're gonna have to travel up all right i got it tom building yeah do you trust me i trust you redeploy in get out of this tank get out of the tank tank out of the tank it's trash oh my gosh am i playing a battlefield game right now what is going on here get out of the tank i got a random to drive me oh my god oh my god i wonder if anyone's looking at us right now you got a kill they better not remove this we better not remove this this is my favorite thing ever i hope they don't either oh how do you climb the building just drive up it just drives until it starts getting it like boost into it find a left well let's go down to the next building let's see all right nice you know there we go leisurely flip from building the building top i know you know well if you want hold on can you just park on the side of the building for me no you see all the guys down there oh can you shoot them oh my god no this is the best angle you could possibly have i think i just got seven or eight right there do you know what you're doing are they still down there or did we just take it from there's a couple dude they just keep kind of spotted there here let's get a different angle where he was off to the right side he just flew how's the chopper right here okay one moment no way we don't we don't make that dude oh of course we make that come on mugs i hate i hate this and love this so much okay give me a second let's prepare all right let's get a nice little angle here hold on oh here we go oh right here okay there you go they're all ripple oh we're flying we're all in front of us we just go over that shield oh he got us with the nade oh he was parachuting he he cut his shoes for that yeah never never this is the best gaming decision ever gently floating down dude that's why they call this a hovercraft oh oh that did a lot of damage just wait just wait it'll wrap this tank i can't even remember what loadout i'm using yeah we need the other objective and this one and then we win i got the nade launch here we captained okay we go up now we go up there's no one up there though they're all down here with connor and mugs they're they're capping d1 right now though very slowly probably one or two guys here boost it this is so much more difficult without the grenade launcher though yeah all right here we go tom we've got d1 back oh we won the game see we just needed you in it and then we win nice first squad pain did you get first on that acolyte yeah i had like said 125. i was number five i think i don't know if that's for like squad or if that's i think that's just you i think that's just you because i was number five but that's kills and assists okay yeah that would make sense then passenger assist passes 200. 61 driver assists on your own sound oh [Music] [Music] you
