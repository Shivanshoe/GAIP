that's it that's the one oh my gosh blink Jesus that's so fair so recently I've been playing a lot a lot of solos cuz I wanted to try to get a little bit better and I wanted to try out a bunch of different weapons and stuff like that just see what kind of combos work and I've kind of settled on something that is I guess I want to see a little bit unique but anyways I kind of have a game to show you guys and I know everyone's going to be a little curious on what the build is for this but this is what I already using it as my main weapon is the Odin with the colossal suppressor of course longest barrel the damage range TAC laser bo case go for a little bit that medium range area as well as the merc for grip to control the recoil now this is not really something that I would use in anything but solos maybe duos just because you don't have the ammo capacity to take out more than one person no time but as you can see the growl is still crazy as ever so I won't always want to mix up my guns and just never want to just only use the growl in the mp5 I feel like those that's kind of the two weapon combo that everybody's gonna be using all the time at least until they get changed at some point I feel like if you're not messed around with a bunch different weapons like you're missing out on at least 90% of the old game of war zone I got the whole point gonna add some bright anyways I also use a grenade launcher that I found and it turns out to be a very very interesting game so I'm not gonna keep you guys I hope you guys enjoy thank you very much for watching leave a like if you guys enjoyed just like if you didn't get you guys the next well been forever since we can come down a train station oh my god I haven't seen this thing in a while a long while the four guys over there oh boy nevermind oh my god what's going on here got the pistol ears yeah at least I got an mp7 now LMGs are nice they do a lot of damage but then p7 early game is just so good hard to get away from thanks cool that's new ground Lee okay got 6,700 that guy came out of nowhere probably said the same thing about me oh okay we get we got to come back for the car 98 I can't just leave this thing behind though why is he collecting back here that's not gonna understand there's no loot okay how is that fair like especially in solos you know is no chance I kind of want to there's so many good guns laying around does the karna end yep eight up above I got maybe I should keep this I've never really used the grenade launch it all that much it's gonna be interesting to see when people have EOD I'm assuming it's probably gonna take about six shots to get them lost as a direct impact no don't kill each other that's never gonna get old is it coming back for the loot this Odin it does so much damage especially with headshots can we have one more here in transition might be dead might be dead no we're fine we're good it was worth it it's a guy here too probably this thing is so sick the only thing like the biggest downside to it is if you run on ammo you're done unless you have enough for a munitions box or something that's it that's all you have [Music] it's a fair fair foundering fair and balanced weapon yes don't want anybody think otherwise you know oops issue that last one I can't believe I killed him in two hits I don't even think the one was a direct impact see there's all right there's gonna be a tough push we reload that real quick Oh Mike what is happening in this game this actually feels like a war zone solo match like not like the other matches I've been playing where somebody's just sitting in a room or something they're not doing anything this is people are moving around this is nice like I'm actually I guess okay technically things are kind of going my way here probably not for long either god this thing hurts this Odin does so much damage I think that that was faster time to kill than the the growl at range I always gotta check this now I don't trust anything in solos there's a few guys in this compound over here poor guy comes from back from the gulag and that's what he has to deal with okay there is I don't know if he was the third person because it was like there was one guy hovering and I think there was already three in town building is it that's a good idea next building was that the guy in the building or did he just I don't know if that was the guy in the next building over here showing up on UAV all undead hello now wasn't the same guy earlier he hopped through the window he's still in the building I'm I'm actually speechless I should be dead I should be dead let's trade in this thing late game's gonna be pretty rough from driving around on a quad no trophy system allowed see a little spotlight up on the hill looks like he's trying to do Morse code or something with a sniper oh my God he's death comms will never get old they're so good we can pinch people outside outside the zone should be okay with because it's gonna take like to c4 to destroy my truck just trying to make sure there's no one else on this side oh I think that's a guy am I missing with those he's gonna live he's gonna live if I push them at this point like he can just one shot me I don't know where he is okay I'm gonna do I'm gonna push back I'm gonna let that with zone push him because then it's gonna be a little bit easier I just want to force him out so he's not peeking me from a bunch of different angles god I can't get over how much damage the Soudan does I used to always love in this thing in multiplayer but I didn't realize how good it could be in soulless as well somebody was looking at me over here with a sniper yeah I probably shouldn't be doing this the no trophy system well that really sucks I had to leave the truck yeah now I have to leave it I can't damn I always love keeping a truck for late game or you know something some sort of vehicle because you never know if I cleared everybody out on this side probably not SOLAS are there the very eery at times people when they kind of have they only move when they have to where did he just die from that's confusing oh my god there's a guy right there now you understand what I mean [Music] it was really dangerous what I'm doing [Music] no way this is how it ends have you get climb these rocks is he really not pushing why didn't you push you had an easy kill I think people are really scared like game like they're just afraid to make any sort of movement he 100% should have pushed though I was already down like it was an easy kill there's no reason not to okay there's only two left one's downhill I don't have any stun grenades I don't mean okay we got one guy left 1v1 he's got to be downhill somewhere I've cleared the whole top end yeah there he is I have zone it's coming over to me GG I had to use the Odin I wanted to make sure that I was able to get it he's also downhill so never know I didn't want to miss it the grenade launcher what a match you know that's like it that's a rare combo because if anybody gets too close to me I can't really do too much with the grenade launcher because you have to use it at a specific range and then of course the Odin is really not that great up close 25 kills though that's crazy [Music]
