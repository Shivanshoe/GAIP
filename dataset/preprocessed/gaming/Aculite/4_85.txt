oh big damn oh big damn oh my god what a hit what a hit okay got one down [Music] we got some nice shots in there though a big big thank you to ea for sponsoring this video never in my life have i ever been part of such a cool event as this apex event this has got to be one of the coolest updates i think that they're going to release as you can see they are adding a bow not just any bow a compound bow i have wanted this in a game since i can't even remember it's always crossbows no one ever adds a compound bow i've shot a recurve bow a crossbow and a compound bow in real life and i can tell you that compound bows are by far some of the funnest bows to shoot so there's quite a bit to talk about for this update one of the biggest things that they will be adding apart from this bow is apex arenas that's right arenas in apex legends i got a bunch of gameplays to show you guys to be honest i'm not very good with the bow i need a lot of practice but arenas are insane they are so much fun it's 3v3 arenas which is where i recorded most of my footage paired along a lot of other content creators and on top of that they are also adding valkyrie such a cool legend this is all coming out on may 4th so if you guys want to get your hands on that check out the link in the description below get the game downloaded it's going to be so much fun so for arenas it's a new permanent mode that's coming to apex legends it's 3v3s on two custom maps at launch and i'm sure they will add more maps over time and everybody starts off with the exact same amount of money or credits and then you buy whatever types of loadouts that you want to use you can upgrade your weapons in there as well depending on how much coins you have or currency so you're all an even playing field which is what you exactly what you would expect in arenas some of the legends abilities have been changed slightly for balancing because obviously if you don't know what valkyrie's ultimate does i don't show it here but i do show it later in the footage is uh if you take off with your entire team into the sky and then you guys can jetpack around the map obviously like deploying off a balloon so they needed to serve it slightly just so you don't take off into space and go outside the map but this bow which is called the bow check bow you can have up to three attachments on it so you can equip up to i think a 3x on it so you can shoot it a little bit longer range what you're seeing right now is the dead eyes tempo hop up so what it does is if you can hear the sounds there's a couple different sounds if you fully charge your bow and then release it at the perfect time there's a blue light on the back of the bow which will indicate when it is ready to be shot and if you continuously do that three times in a row then it speeds up how fast you can shoot it and as you can see it can go pretty fast it does take a little bit of practice i think those who have very good accuracy will be dominating the battlefields with this thing but uh it is a little bit tough i am not going to lie to you it's very much like using a wingman and one of the coolest things about this thing is that you can pick up your arrows so even though you shoot an arrow if you shoot it at a wall and you miss you can go and pick it up but if you hit somebody you have to kill them and then the arrows will be dropped in their loot box and then you can just pick them back up again so realistically you may never run out of ammo as well you can also add a hop-up for scatter shots which will split your arrows up making them kind of like a shatter effect or a scatter effect much like the hop-up suggests and uh you can use it a little bit more like a shotgun if you choose so i'm gonna show you guys some arena gameplay now which is mainly what the whole video is gonna be focused around as well as a little bit of bow action i like i said it took me a little while to get used to this thing but a big thank you again for ea for sponsoring this video hope you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like if you do check out the link in the description and i'll catch you guys in the next one why do i feel like everybody's going to choose wingman right away uh i think i think people pk that's what i did oh yeah yeah right away i think i'm gonna do the wing man they're coming here first i think he jumped off the roof i got two broke two broke right here yeah yeah one down nice well done guys i was sick hey we won our first round this is insane it's wild it's crazy got one down should be only one left right two for two headshot one for 70. path is broke on the right broke somebody here broke him oh i'm knocked damn nice try so close so close did he drop down i okay the jet pack at the wrong time i got a path down as well one left [Music] arenas and apex legends who would have thought right right yeah this is crazy let's go baby hello how are you doing not too bad yourself not bad coming off my first win i feel good about myself i feel like i've done something myself nice nice how many games you've played this match uh this will be my third one [Music] all right this is my third as well i won the first one last a second i'd love to hear it wait actually no you lost it that's okay that's okay you're about to be you might be two and one that's all that matters you know i mean the last game i had to try out the bow i had to i'm gonna do it this game i won't lie i'll try the first round and see what happens and then i don't know well i think you have to i think it's like 600 to buy it oh i can't even get it just kidding tricky yeah it's 600. are you ready this is gonna be awful we should all go together i'm actually so scared right now if we're gonna lose first round here are you ready oh my god they're ready down up down him behind you behind you oh my god we actually got that we're crashed okay so that's what that does all right they were ready for that better they had the same idea we did all right dude buy it get it i'm gonna do it but listen if we lose this round completely blame me okay i mean i'm doing the same thing so okay all right i got my ultimate we could just take off if you guys wanted i'm down if if you want to uh yeah you want to try to like get centered yeah we could we could find do we have any less on them right now uh let me hold on let me just rock it up into the sky well my ultimate should visualize them right yeah yeah they are there okay we could probably land up top yeah i think it would be super cool it's takeoff time baby oh that is
