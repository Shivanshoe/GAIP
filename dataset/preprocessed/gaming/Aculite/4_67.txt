well those other guys there they can't get up here though unless they go up to the other zip they might though yeah they might never you never know man you're right you're right this game doesn't make any sense anymore attack rover yes it's gone goodbye later this is all i this is this is what i live for now that's it so if you managed to catch my recent video you will know that i am starting to fall in love with the strela because i brought it out in solos where it seems to be that a lot of people like to drive around and try to run you over and this is my one counter to that but what i didn't know is that you can pretty much snipe with this thing it travels so fast i did my very best to get as much footage with it as i could but what i was trying to do is blow up vehicles the majority of the time what i didn't realize is that it's a one-shot direct impact even if somebody has eod on that's kind of nuts i had no idea so if you're in the licks for using a different type of weapon i highly suggest throwing this thing on and messing around with it you'd be surprised how many times you see vehicles come across you and they don't have a trophy system on it and you just one shot them so i'm joined by stone mountain and then fuglet in a later game i'll show you guys a couple games if you do enjoy the video please leave a like as usual that always helps the channel and if you didn't catch the previous video definitely go check that one out there's a lot of a lot of interesting moments in that solos can be a wild experience one other thing that i wanted to mention if you're not enjoying the game maybe consider taking a break from it i've seen so many people raging at this game recently and i understand there's a lot of issues but it's just a game anyways hope you guys enjoy that a ladder here delete the evidence okay we don't have a trophy system there was one in the building back there we could go grab we want oh was there oh we can go grab the balloon yeah i
