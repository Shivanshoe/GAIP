[Music] so I thought this would be a fun little video to make since myself and if you've been on the channel for quite some time you'll know that I'm strictly a PC player I just really enjoy keyboard and mouse and it's been years since I've even touched a controller now since war zone is cross-platform and you're able to use a controller even on PC I thought it'd be fun for Stone Mountain and myself who also plays on PC to only use controllers and see how well that we can do you'll see a couple of games that we reflate trying to figure everything out and it is very difficult it really does put into perspective you know like what you have to go up against as a controller player what you can and can't do mind you I haven't played controller in years so trying to figure out all the controls and you know my sensitivity and luck and all that stuff in is very difficult so I'm joined by Stone Mountain 64 who's also playing on controller we play a couple games and then we ask two other streamers yeh as well as promised to carry us noobs there are a couple of games that hopefully get away anyways if you guys enjoy please leave a like and if you don't dislike I'll catch you guys in the next one okay I'm like I'm figuring it out I'm figuring it out ready for this those do it first game of the day simulator here can you help I don't have a weapon you talk down to here boy I

that noob was here to play anybody but me gets over us yeah probably was probably not worth the meeting itself right let's be real but I feel sometimes like I feel like usually if I die I'm in a situation where I'm not gonna be raised or be able to suffer everything's just so much more difficult for me she's got it like get the as I'm so used to like I can passively play on on keyboard and mouse right like I'm thinking about what I have to do like every button push right now it's no yeah that's good though it's good fun good challenge let's say you feel on PC yeah yeah how am I looking at the keys going oh yeah of you I got you oh yeah there's a guy you like him let's go top of cool yeah who's just passed it [Applause] is one inside the pool and has a little ball on the outside
