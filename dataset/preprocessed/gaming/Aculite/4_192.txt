all right apex legends third person mode a classic out-of-body experience I think this is gonna be very strange to start playing not something you would expect from apex definitely it's gonna take some getting used to oh this is so weird I've played well I played one game before this but still feels really weird oh hell yeah any one of those for talking yes this is gonna be it right here this is what you need I thinking I'm thinking that shotguns are definitely to be a huge portion of this easily something you're gonna want to carry around with you it's probably not so much different from any other mode but okay so I played one game before this what it's still strange to me and I noticed that the thicker characters like Pathfinder his legs are in the way I mean I love the character but when you crouch and the only way to increase your accuracy it's when you crouch which helps for like RNA nights but no yes or no right so the are 99 sprays and stuff I guess anything at long range but they're like his reticle was being covered by his butt or his thighs so I'm thinking the the skinnier character is gonna be the way I think it's crazy how much better the average player in Apex has gone or maybe like everyone just got tired of dying all the pros because so many good people playing it now anybody here but nobody draw up here what's going on I'll see ya our 99 might be a little bit better terms of spread cuz it's all third-person is I remember the first time I played mw2 third person cuz they had that in and monitor warfare the a case spread was just phenomenal it was just so close together so I always used to use that and it had such high damage fluting and this is a little bit strange a little bit tough shall we Oh how's it going here - okay dude the heck was he using there nothing hurt okay so you cannot cross the open apparently two different teams maybe try to come up with teammates here let me get him up did he take that okay I'm gonna go up to the roof yeah I definitely think the smaller characters is the way to be for this okay there we go should be guy in here somewhere busy top floor nice we're getting shopping the other side hunker down brother I don't know if sites actually work in this check it out wait where'd he go did he go he didn't go right out did he you jerked me out must be a second or something I can't find him dude okay get me out of here this is getting wild we're fairly close to the zone so this might be one we're missing one now oh no does he need help you good we're holding up we're holding up apologize I don't mean to take everything from you men that's I'm doing here just need some attachments you know tough life out here okay we all have full purple so this is really good like we have to RNA to nines and maybe a couple piece capes I don't know what like the best setup is gonna be though wonder if the g7 is any good to try using I tried using on past fine Pathfinder last game but it wasn't like again his butt was getting in the way so I couldn't really see much that's definitely how I died but I don't know I feel like people are gonna start figuring out what the best loadouts and stuff are but shopkins are definitely to be the way I think the EVA peacekeeper may be I think the peacekeeper might be a little bit better in first person because you have nothing obstructing your view hmm did these guys keep it running it must have they booked it though if that's the case don't even take any damage yeah there oh yeah high ground is the way to down know where the last guy went he's on the run a lot of these games soon like a lot of fights in this game have been really weird haven't been able to like it's a lot of back and forth haven't been able to just like clean squad wipe anybody I know this guy wants heavy ammo of it I don't have any where'd you go get him boys right to the teammate get them oh yeah there you go whoo Craver I do we take it I don't know it's like is there a point in taking it you can't 80's with it oh you can 80's with it okay we'll do it so this may be like one of the only guns you can first person with this is so weird I love it there we go break it down should be able to get him I think nice the plays I love it okay Oh somebody said they need a double tap right lass squad where could they call that in do we have that we don't have a pathfinder damn it if I can get one pick this will be nice ones bottom floor it looks like god I want to talk about it all right I don't want to talk about it if I can get him to peek my other teammates or something died knocked on second floor there we go good stuff teammates I think they got this one left you guys got this yeah GG man [Music] all right they picked legends third person pretty sweet if you're gonna do a third person I think the skinnier body characters are the way to go for sure not a bad game very very interesting it plays kind of neat to like you can you can work around your angles I don't think it's all that bad of a mode [Music] you
