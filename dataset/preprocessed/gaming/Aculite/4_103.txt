kills people pretty fast but you know what if you miss your shot you are dead because there's no coming back from how slow this burst is them head shots though some good damage if you get the head shots in that don't mind me just gonna buy a little eh it's not bad oh so i love testing new weapons in warzone it's a lot of fun it keeps the game nice and fresh for me and uh without going on too long and rambling this is what i was using on my m16 if you're interested i have one game to show you guys i don't want to go on too long with this intro but i know everyone's always interested in asking you know what loadouts people are using and they're always very interested in using it for themselves so if you want to copy it this is what i was told to use and i was pleasantly surprised i didn't expect an m16 a burst rifle in warzone to do that well especially after having tried a couple of them in the past like the moss just it just didn't do it for me but uh this uh i might actually start bringing this out a little bit more often hope you guys enjoy the video thank you very much for watching [Applause] do you think i was out of ammo she had the jukes he had the jukes almost move to the next location man i am getting some awful lag i am just teleporting around this is not great it's like consistent packet loss in this game okay we need that first of all i wonder what this guy was shooting at um key card pick it up for now but so that timing i just have permanent dead silence what is going on here dead silence is too nuts it's too insane is that him teleporting or is that me maybe it's the server oh my god he had dead sounds too okay the only good spot is here i suppose we got some good snipes this game so far a couple of them i gotta stop sniping though i gotta put it away put it down try to use the m16 i need enough for a uav you know what i suppose i could hit the bunker up [Music] [Music] whoa man put that thing away [Applause] holy where did you even get that thing from that was a grenade yeah he's got the grenade launcher there's a mental man he must have got it from the other bunker oh no i guess yeah you can get it from like legendary crates and stuff right oh no zone's here [Applause] cutting it close no i'm dead he just took my vehicle i'm actually dead pretty sure i'm dead maybe not maybe i can outrun this he must have grabbed his loot again took my vehicle and left that trick okay i didn't realize how close this one was maybe i didn't need to drop my sniper well i did say i wanted to put the sniper down so it's gone now even took my trophy system man [Music] may have just seen somebody holy crap man stopping power on this thing is absurd that is wild i don't know what that was about but all right here's ground level next to the buy station going in the left building which appears to be a shack and this stopping power is ruining people it is so nice somebody did shooting me i don't know where that was from [Music] oh my god i thought that was a land mine i didn't think it was c4 well done he planted that so early [Applause] he baited me right in look at that i didn't see out or capture the it [Applause] that guy has so much money now he could literally buy out everything everything that he wants he could just buy it give him like 30k okay question i'm i'm wondering now since i died with a little bit of stopping power i definitely should have shot uh jumped out sooner on that guy though and smart [Applause] um since i died with stopping power in my gun still do i keep it yup interesting he's gonna know where i am too oh hey hey whoa relax [Applause] i got revenge killed him with the stopping power that was still in my gun ah off to the left here it's on the roof i think he's at the buy station that was without stopping power that's insane we're back up to 20k recon coming up uav entering the ao [Applause] i want to even get this other bounty we'll just bounty hunt 24 7. i guess we wait so that already drive around like a maniac seeing if i can find people but i assume there's there's gonna be a lot of people uphill oh i gotta call hold on hello you know what we're going to bounty hunt so this is what i'm going to do [Music] yeah we're bounty hunting [Applause] wait that wasn't even the kill contract recon coming up okay uav entering the ao take cover [Applause] guess i deserve that friendly recon inbound uav entering the ao gas is inbound he's gotta still be in that building right oh yes oh i'm dead i'm not dead i thought the dead body in the stairs was him holy crap that was so risky my heart man i flicked here because i thought he was just gonna start just shooting with a shotgun or something okay well i wanna go for the loadout but it's gonna get me killed most likely i don't know if ghost is necessarily gonna save me i'm gonna run across under the bridge that's gonna be rough oh he's going another side requesting recon overflight uav entering the ao losing ground friendly recon inbound uav entering the ao [Applause] you have to fight him on the way uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply [Applause] be advised uav what is going on here rtv for resupply wait it's 1v1 it's just oh he died of the zone it's possible right because i'll also definitely lose this uh yeah no it's not pull that out i thought that was a uav zone it's over there somewhere um there he is designating target for air strike this is tracker 31 good copy he's pushing me oh my god this thing's nuts no way that did so much damage i love this site this site's great man i was i was actually so afraid that he was going to head shot me there with that that car 98 or whatever he was using i like his car 98 what a game i think at 90 of that game i started off with dead silence and then it went into stopping power on an m16 and it does so much damage you can one burst people with it with full plates that's nuts that might be a fun gun to use like in uh in trios or something might have to mess around with it in there you
