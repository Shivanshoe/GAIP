there bro located whoa [Applause] position yeah okay there's most likely gonna be a few guys here no way bro okay there's definitely a guy but there it is that's what i was looking for sweet literally can't get any better everything's looking up be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply wait for the peak where this thing was stopping by is absurd it's so nuts it's just insane all right what do we want we want to go straight at the start probably right what's we got let's just go for ghost like we got the main weapon mp5 for secondary hell yeah [Applause] oh my god look at the damage on that it's like a three shot this gun's gonna be ridiculous when it's initially released it's just gonna be too much way too much there's a few people over here [Music] i'll oh my god it's insane it's just so nuts with stopping power it's just not okay oh shoot [Music] i'll make sure i take the right direction here because we're not gonna live so this is the rook blueprint but we don't really know if this is gonna be the best of the best for the weapon right like when it's released these may not be the best attachments where's that zip up here it is and we can go in here oh yeah no one knew about this one either got a plate box probably don't need ammo now we just wait no sir no sir did you get up here he must already been up here he had the smg oh no is it really gonna be like this get me a recon overflight uav entering the ao okay i guess everybody has ghosts [Music] well there's just nobody near me or there's a cheater in the game i don't know one of the two this guy just died randomly in a bush oh oh he wasn't dead okay all right if it did sounds here well he was definitely ghosted three comes inbound [Music] hey listen man i need this okay [Music] [Music] here it comes [Music] let's get in the next building [Music] it wall bangs too slaps which building wasted my daddy yeah okay i had a feeling it's okay i'm biting yourself froze that's a nice shot hey oh man oh shoot he can see me there recline up uav entering the ao [Applause] maybe we should drive the vehicle up maybe we just hold the rocks up here [Music] the only thing about this is it's really slow like it's just so slow slow to reload slow to run you're slow to do everything so i got over there here we go huh i'm dead yep man so this is really strange it's so strange everyone's got ghosts i think i just need to take off ghost and use that other thing use a high alert let's get first match with it though 10 kills oh this is genius there's no way he's happy about that okay we need to find uh the weapon [Applause] did he kill somebody he must have killed somebody by running them over it's not here look at all these rose skins man okay got the circ this is a stupid idea i got very stupid are we gonna do this riot shields come on i mean it's night here comes feel it it's happening he's gonna be on the roof isn't he [Music] yep [Applause] so i don't know why you would repeat you're crazy i had you broken absolute maniac there's a blast in his feet i gotta get away over here these upper possibly in this corner here be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply he's got it he's got it yes he's got the weapon give me it yes as soon as i heard it i knew i knew exactly what it was damn what a combo it's gonna be great unless we die it's gonna be not so great recon up uav entering the ao no come back man this thing it just does so much damage i just don't get it i just don't understand i feel like this is not a solos weapon this is like a uh a trio's weapon you know this is really not a smart idea okay never mind so far so good all right let me go oh my god [Music] 007 which way is this guy going enemy uav overhead [Applause] sorry my guy uav entering the ao [Applause] okay it was upper so confused everybody in the swamp is a ghost [Applause] of course of course of course you're the one sitting up top here like i'm about to do okay you can't you can't be upset when somebody sneaks in and kills you [Applause] don't worry i'm gonna have the same reaction when somebody kills me exact same reaction [Applause] closing in it's gotta be some sort of sick joke there's nobody in here right oh my gosh it's insane it does so much damage okay we have what four four other people this guy's driving around the outside oh my god no way we gotta win this one okay one of the guys that's in the truck dealers out in the field there he is there's field boy i don't know where he went this is bad uh [Music] you messed up you messed up hey let's double seven from earlier he shouldn't air struck me i should have waited until i was in a bad spot he could have hid behind his truck the zone would have been pushing me would have forced him into the open i would have had to fight him or stay outside the gas and try to fight him that was a kind of a strange game man does that uh does that lmg hit hard though that thing is something else i think it's gonna be a meta weapon i really do they just like allow it to be released really easily and used to the grind for like an hour or something you're gonna see it everywhere everywhere you
