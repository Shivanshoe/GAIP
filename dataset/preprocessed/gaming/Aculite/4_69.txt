that's incredible the fact that you can jump off the roof like that doesn't happen every time but it happens enough to where i feel like it's been implemented and it's not a glitch it's genuinely there in your face revenge that was a guy from earlier did he have my weapons krieg xm4 okay nevermind everyone's wearing that skin so it's hard to tell enemy uav overhead oh god this gun the window which means there's a guy up top thank you man appreciate it thank you it's not hacking it's called cheating okay it's not like people are developing developing the hacks themselves and then using them rtb download software and then they just use it i mean maybe hey maybe they develop it too who knows is he still down here you think this is incredible this weapon just does so much damage um i don't need that this is so sick it's sickening someone's going to beam me with this thing now i see him i gave that guy a free kill i ran the wrong direction oh man i should just kept driving that was my initial gut feeling i should just keep driving don't hop out on the guy it's not smart don't shoot me oh i could land on the train train's got big money right unless there's a guy already on it which i seem to see did you already have your setup like what are you kidding me or is this ground loot this must be ground limit it's got to be shoot i need a little bit more don't i if there's not enough in here that kind of screwed i have to go further okay i have no idea where he came from there we go this is the gun i want to use too all right let's see the c58 this thing was shredding in uh in plunders doing some big damage so that's good [Music] did we grab this bounty oh wait is he in the left room he might be in that left that close left room oh no he's underneath wait no yeah he might be in that close left room big damage wait there's a red door did we take it do we dare all right just this once i'm going through lima station i'm outside the zone see this is why i never do it this is why i don't do it it's pointless and now i have to run from the zone and i might actually die because of this i do know where everybody is that's kind of this guy's nice for the quad i think up to my left no he's just running it okay i can make this there he is enemy maneuvering i'm actually considering muting deathcoms they're funny from time to time but the amount of uh bad language that gets thrown around in this game i swear that was that was pretty much nothing it's much worse than that oh there's a guy here one in the tower maybe could be at the top there's a zip up here isn't there where is it here maybe i won't have to waste my cluster oh my god this thing shreds it does so much damage it's good it's good i will say this though i'm i'm pretty disappointed in the route that they've decided to go with the guns they've made everything a little bit more cold war oriented it's all the cold war weapons seem to be the new meta as everyone says i'm not gonna go for that guy's money 18 000 he was clearly shooting at somebody in the building will he choose to leave it though he will take that this is my first solo game in a while doing all right this thing's going to get me killed i'm going to die on this [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's your kind of shack designating airstrike target this is loaded 2-0 good copy cluster strike away [Applause] see if we get the top of this building hopefully it doesn't push up where oh where did you go far left yeah there's two guys over there wait a minute and a vehicle oh my god man i can't even see this guy it just hits it hits so hard okay i want to get somewhere safe let's see if we can play a little bit of zone i want to play this game a little bit smarter not so aggressive [Music] i can't really see him i don't know where he is okay that was really close he had a very good vantage point on me hit me hard too i almost died there i need to sell fresh i need to get to a buy station enemy uav over there's a guy in here too oh my god this is rough man i just want to buy nice try oh my god that's terrifying i mean we do have a bunch of money i might as well just pop this real quick see what's going on one guy in that far building he looks like he's gulagging in because he's going really fast that's probably the guy that i just killed up on the cliff side he's coming back for his loot this guy's holding down the buy station at the bottom building another one away over there i kind of want to try to take this guy out but if i mess it up i'm dead we got a good game going wait i thought he died i got the assist from the uav and i thought for some reason this guy died not too bad time to earn your freedom soldier okay this is kind of rough because now i'm stuck spent the majority of my money is there gonna be another a uh does another loadout come in i don't think so right never mind we're good hmm i don't know if he'd push that he's still up there okay could it be a gulager kind of a rough situation here if i can somehow get around them i can go to the buy station buy some armor yeah this ghost class it's kind of a rip how do we beat this guy when i have no armor yeah i just can't i'm on his heartbeat and everything yeah not a chance that's a good game almost [Music] you
