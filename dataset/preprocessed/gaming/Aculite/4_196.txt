[Music] I feel like they should have this in every card like I don't know why this is a limited-time mode they should definitely put gun game on every single card and it should always be a game mode because it's perfect for warming up you get to use a bunch of different weapons and you get to warm up with them oh hell yeah we start with a deal uh I mean hell yeah we start with a deagle dammit I can never use a sight on it's either iron sights or no girl okay I got just going it I think I'd actually be okay with them increasing how many kills you need with each weapon - like - it was that they ugh that's not bad oh no can't be missing those shots we still got him worth it all the fal things nasty I was a direct impact okay this doesn't reach that far and we almost had him to chose an emphasis of in there for a moment oh no not this oh my god I can't believe they put this in Jesus relax settle down over there you can't even see anything how you supposed to shoot somebody with this all right we can do this we can do this hey there we go you know what you know what that's like it's like shooting at in battlefield like it's like you're shooting at the Doritos you're just shooting at the nameplates now can't see anything why do you call it that one to the leg all right not bad oh this is gonna be sweet way to think I don't know night mode for gun game isn't the whole point or wow I have on her pain what's going on there isn't the whole point of gun game to like get better with the weapons though but isn't a lot of this just just shooting with the laser sight essentially yeah see I feel like that kind of takes a little bit away from it my modes kind of cool but suppose you can always turn up the night vision just use your iron sights or whatever sights they give you yeah see like right there it's I don't know it's not like you have to really control the weapons oh wait wait did he die oh jeez okay guess that works I'm seeing that's not too bad I suppose it's kind of cool a little bit dark at times though alright let me sneak around over here we use that weapon before is that uh that's an LMG isn't it sorry man okay this is not gonna work oh you must have spawned right there you're gonna have to push me man if you want to fight can't really do much with this shotgun all right that works that works got to play to your weapons advantage right dranks whoa Jesus calm it down almost hit me nearing the end I got a sniper really no this is bad this is very bad okay well you see that it was either try for the quick scope or go for the noscope and I know I know my nose scopes never hit I can't do it I can honestly just can't do it I don't get it give me our insights and I can I can aim with it slightly I know it comes sick I swear them first I hate you you just still might go mom aunt Wu way god I'm not bad not bad that round could have went way better though yeah I don't know bad night mode for gun game like as its own game mode I have no problem with it when it comes to gun game I don't know I just feel like is the whole point of it like to use it as a warm-up game mode and you don't want to be aiming with a laser sight you know oh this even has the trigger delay doesn't it this is gonna be impossible this always this weapon again never mind Kelcey up oh not this weapon again doesn't have enough attachments Jesus man that m4 that's insane it has such good accuracy it's just unreal and the damage and I thought I got that first one okay up there on at the hammer scope every time I have this thing on it I always mess it up because the long-range sights are the first thing to pop up I feel like everybody's kind of spotting on one side of the other the left to the right yeah like you just fought over here you're on the other side nobody's spawning in the center this is how you die don't follow me yeah see basically a giant free-for-all should be running around on top of the walls sorry man sorry I feel bad I really do they give you an RPG as a weapon really I don't think anybody needs to get better with that I bet you could just stay up here this house the entire game and just go 18 and oh you're basically watching over all the spawns or at least one of the spawns yeah see everyone just spawns down that alleyway I'm gonna left to Road whoa is there increased damage in this or is it just was he just that low I was the same but I think a one shot him anything was ahead Hey look at this guy go slide and he's peeking cover I like it oh no not Piccadilly and if there's one map I want removed from this game it's this one every map has its issues but this one looks identical everywhere you go no idea where side of the map Allah never alright can I get a kill with this oh okay I was lucky serpentine serpentine there we go works almost every time holds a scar I have the I got the red tracers for this I had a I got try that out it's not one of the guns that I've really loved about hope you slate into me wait did I die from behind lost track of that guy why does this sniper remind me at least the skin the skin reminds me of the new Tesla at Tesla truck I think it's just a color Jama maniac I shouldn't be doing this there's much safer ways to play this I'm over here just running through the open right through the center and that's how you die 24/7 all right who's getting it [Applause] see that's okay that's the one good thing about this map is that you can just explode the cars next to people and it counts towards your kill otherwise when I spawn on one side I have no idea what side I'm actually on oh he doesn't know he doesn't know oh crap alright we're gonna have to go the other way I just saw like eyes me and played through the wall all right time out time out never generate about the almighty mp5 you know what I thought this was gonna be a lot worse but it's actually not that bad thought it's gonna be a lot more chaotic Oh thread the needle wait wait thank you Oh trigger the trigger delayed I told you every single time because it's like it's one of those guns where you go to flick shot right so you immediately click and then you think the shot is already hitting so you kind of like uh name from them you don't try to track them and we got game AGD I was like we went four in a row I think not bad I do I do you think this is one of the they should definitely keep this in as a main game mode oh I made her a unicorn nice and realize that they should though they should this should be a base game mode for warming up I like it [Music] you
