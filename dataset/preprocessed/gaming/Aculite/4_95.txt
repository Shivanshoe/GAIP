always made like the best skins for everything i'm kind of afraid of the reactive camos like i don't really want that to become a common thing like a theme really i think that's kind of they're going to do a lot more because yeah i didn't play blackouts like i'm kind of excited but then i go down underground into a bunker and can't see in front of me and i'm like yeah yes well that's kind of what these rockets are like a giant flashlight in my face and you can't see in front of you well that's like it's the same thing as tracers like tracers are cool for the first like four games you play with them and then you're just mad that you can't see yeah well i feel like the tracers are worse than like they're more annoying oh that man just don't run moving no no no no no don't i'm sad 350 333 yeah right top floor ow okay he's good shot you're a better shot he got a hog he's noped he's got teammates that seem pretty upset how did i miss that oh nice follow up through the door three doorways yeah

everybody in the whole lobby is just full sending on us on everybody here [Applause] it's crazy that it comes with a key like like to set off the nukes oh you saw on the left side of the gun here you can see it comes out like it comes with a key on the side of it i guess to turn on the rocket or something that's not like because it's like launching a new yeah it's so sick it tries to get away from you it's got to be like one of the coolest coolest skins in the game it's nuts too bad it doesn't do anything when you're uh when you're getting kills or whatnot yeah if it had like stat track on it you know like cs go or something on the side that'd be really sick that would be rude i'll be down for that yeah i am not seeing that going with stone oh car there's another vehicle yeah what's
