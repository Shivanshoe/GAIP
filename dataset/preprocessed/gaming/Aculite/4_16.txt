i was shooting at him but i don't think i killed him oh yeah is that the wall he's running away from us at the wall right wall right wall i need to try nadine literally can't see him there's also a guy breathing behind us i don't know i see the bloody oh my god i got him you're so low you get him yeah yeah there's still another guy though at the wall did you get him honey you killed this guy there's a body here wait what i killed him too uh yes back on tarkov well actually not back on tarkov because this is older footage i should mention that this was back when the ump was one of the top dog guns and i don't know if that's still the case but it's always nice to have a weapon that you can rely on especially early wipe that's kind of how long ago this was now something that you can use reliably and build up your stash so you don't have to worry about too much gear fear but one of my favorite things about this game is the pvp aspect i've said that many times now and my two friends here jack fraggs and tomographic who may be playing with haven't played the game too much so i set out to try to help them and show them what i really love about the game however they love to mess around you can look behind you i suppose you can do that in real life can't i'm doing it actually no i can't really see you that far i'm stumbling out of absolutely nothing against it they love to have fun and honestly that's what games are mostly about anyways if you're not having fun why are you even playing but i did my best to show them and kind of i guess chauffeur them around showing them what i love about the game which is the pvp and the intense pvp fights that you can get into so this raid that i'm going to be showing you guys i did my very best to showcase that however it didn't actually end up being that way and it turned out to be one of the raids that i will really never forget because of what just happened i really hope you enjoy that's funny okay it's like for you oh it's one of these ones yeah you're going to love the legs it's a 2.5 and one for you oh lovely thank you i just tried to do a vicinity look at my street look at my stream i'm doing cannot touch while i'm riding you need a tool for that oh my god put it on cannot attach it well just keep on okay you guys want to fight i'm dying no no no no no jack okay you guys want to die you want to fall jack yeah follower yeah make sure you're full auto i'll have so much trouble jumping in this game guy ahead oh hit him i think i killed one yeah there should be another he's running right carefully you're right there's a hole down the way on the on the right there just be careful that yeah i remember it if i run and jump out you peek yeah yeah okay i heard him he's in the factory building i'm saying okay oh yeah maybe all right you want to fight him jack yeah let's go right you go first it's going to be a dark factory though he's in there is he he's going to be on the right side i think inside oh shot from the left then so the scav i don't know i'm crossing over yeah i see him in between the crates over there by the ramp oh yeah same with your name oh it's a player where i'm at the factory building now far far left side of factory yeah i'm about to enter the factory are you with conor jack no no i'm still at the big red building on the corner have you just run past that blue crate corner blue crate you holding an angle no no i'm nowhere near you where's the red building okay shoot anybody you see over there that's not a jack are you sure now i got me going i'm coming over i'm coming over i died i'm coming jack my side to build a pump got one nice man he let me up i think i've got a hill yeah you do the same are you sure there's two in there no yeah 100 jack wasn't in the building no i wasn't and there's two he was in the container at the front entrance not the side one you're at we're missing a guy too the other guy ran off i'm afraid he's going to come back he told me on that why is he shooting you from there he's at the shacks factor you get both the white tracks jack no this guy's still in here everyone get an angle on the white chat guy hold on i'm going backs out of the red building for a second i gotta heal back up your screen con oh yeah harm only protects the parts of your body that aren't exposed right so like the fact that he had shot me in the face yeah exactly so he can hit you in the nose the ears the chin that's a one-hit kill yep yeah here's someone by me again okay holy sh he's in the blue shack is he here yeah you should know me can you get an angle on him fine i may have hit him in the head then oh he's still up no at least a lot i'm afraid of this guy in the red building damn it you know what let's go mess him up yeah yeah might have killed him yeah you got him good job gonna like um [Music] um the bullets are worth like a thousand a piece right now jesus for one single bullet for a round yeah once people figure out what the meta is the price for stuff just skyrockets see the thing is i like i don't think he fully ditched i think he's still here somewhere i found him he's directly ahead of me he's just wearing where i'm aiming you want to pick him same time yeah yeah sure okay i'm peeking now he's uh underneath behind the vehicle what did the truck the truck yeah bro i can't see anything under there oh he's dead i didn't even see him once yeah i wanted to try to let you get a visual on him first to try to fight him but i guess uh games i don't know nope i got him with the ump nice i feel like i'm playing a different game to you connor yeah tarkov can kind of be that way sometimes i mean my gun is completely useless and like if i get injured it takes me about 20 minutes to actually fix myself i just thought it felt like a random search like loose outside yeah far end of the ramps you see these logs here yep back of the green container now the like five stack containers the one with the bread got him good call oh there's another guy further to his left i've got a hill con yeah what is going on here we can't even leave i think it's a i think it's a player yeah it's definitely a player there's a surprise aka i think i'm pushing around the outside trying more grenades in oh he's buying the truck you got him nope someone she's someone else now i got him that was yukon connor's dead there's another one though at blue shack he's running behind blue shack right now i'm still in the red con damn pushing over i'm coming with you you think he's wrapping around yeah i think so yeah he could have left doors open we need to start looting jack because it's going to take a while there's a lot of gear here um this guy right here that i just killed behind the truck i think one of us should loot him you should probably loot him you should probably load him this guy yep just stuff everything you can in your backpack he's got a nice looking ak oh he's back he's at the blue thing again the outer wall right side wow you get him no no he's still alive i think he stopped moving khan i might have traded with him there but he didn't kill me like i just got a lucky ricochet off my head can we just have a moment of peace over here i'm i've got like i'm full up now come on i can't take anything else okay we really shouldn't loot until we know if he's done i mean i didn't hear any footsteps after your firefight this might be uh him here yeah i think you're right is that him scav player let me check the angle yeah that would have him get a good bag too sick okay let's loot up and we got one more guy over here he also had a good vest here we go some loot oh i still have my other bag of stuff crap ah i don't know if i had any stuff in it jack see if you can take this guy's rig i think it might be better with the one than the one you have um okay seven minutes left i just gotta go grab my bag but i don't think i had anything in it shoot him overweight here jack take one of these what is it take some drugs unknown items it's a good idea yeah come on it'll be a good time you all oh my god i just stuck it in me so the mule will increase your strength for a certain amount of time but it'll also give you some negative side effects we've got six minutes done yeah we can do it we can do it you just fall over and die if the timer runs out no you get like a lost in raid i guess but yeah you just die server just closes um let me see yeah i got two okay take this one too that blue one what's all that stuff you keep injecting yourself so the blue one will give you stamina for a lot longer again it gives you some side effects okay there's a guy down here that's just a scav perfect he hit me a few times then leading cool what's the best thing for bleeding do you have the uh soloist still uh yeah i've got one use yeah use that okay we need to keep moving we have to keep moving or else we're not going to make this i don't know my screen's getting dark oh no it's okay okay keep going jack keep going no worries the amount of times i shot him there's another one don't worry about him keep going i can't sprint con no oh my god it's not open we gotta keep going no this one's not tv it's not too much further i still think we can make it where did you go con did you go down stick to the wall jack no no go go around stick to the wall on your right this body's falling from the sky connor i can barely see [Music] give me your mosin get more ammo come on jack there's another one i literally can't even aim at this point connor just just come around the corner come around the corner okay we gotta keep going we can't fight them we don't have time one minute 18. do you have energy still uh it's quite red connor and there's nothing in the bar jack you have to make it you have to oh i mean i'm ruined don't i no no no it's right up here i promise okay if you don't make this i'm going to cry jack's going to crawl across the finish line where is it it is quite literally right here this is a small building that you go down 30 seconds yeah you've got this jack come on jack you'll find a small little building with a down staircase my character is so ruined seven seconds you got this okay yes oh my god dude down to the wire i can't believe it fully man we just couldn't even leave that red area to start our area if jack didn't get his scarf kills after that round bloody hell connor look at that list there's loads of scarves towards the end that's five kills and one player scout i think so i had to drop my ump because i had no more ammo i killed one scav [Laughter] it's a banger today's video is gonna be a banger you
