there's a guys up here guys over here okay oh just one shot him try and take the devil away from jack at once it's all go see mate hey guys right here locked one right below you right here again oh my god oh god [Music] i just punched them out probably one of the most unique games i've ever had the opportunity of playing hunt showdown now every time i do post about this game on my channel i see a lot of questions regarding how the game works what it's about maybe there's a little bit of a misconception of what goes on in this game so let me explain and give a little bit of context behind it basically it's similar to a battle royale in a way in that the whole point is to essentially find clues to kill this boss once you find the boss you want to kill it then banish it grab the bounties and extract now while you're doing this all the other players on the server are trying to do the exact same thing so you have these hunters that you can choose right off the get-go they're automatically loaded out with stuff so you don't have to change the loadout yourself but i always do because there's specific rifles and stuff that i like to use obviously you want to add dynamite maybe some firebombs something like that there's a lot of unique utilities in this however the one thing that i've noticed is that once you know that all the other players on the server are dead it leaves kind of this little bit of an empty void in the game so i'm hoping that there's something that they can do in the long run to bring back that intensity so that once you know all the players are dead in the game you still have something else to fear otherwise you end up like my team and we run around like headless chickens doing some sort of meme stuff which i will show you guys in a moment here hope you guys enjoyed the rest of the video please leave a like if you guys enjoyed the video and uh i'll leave you with these guys fooling around for a little bit and we'll get into a match [Music] there you go that's what i was doing like do you think this would one bang connor i don't know how much health he has yeah he'll probably one banging he's talking to me before don't put it away it won't kill me they can try it if you want it won't kill me uh two full bars [Applause] just die oh my god wait i couldn't even take it back no you know you can't undo that right this is what happens when we have nobody to fight fight each other just for a glimmer of pvp what's a pork pie um so imagine a pie but like small like a like a mini pie not too many is it like a mini meat pie uh yeah but it's like um sausage meat in the middle and then they surround it with like a gelatin and then like short crust pastry around the outside okay yeah it's like uh like a chicken pot pie almost yeah yeah those are so good that's really good okay connor we'll have to um feed you all the disgusting food that we have oh that's good yeah and then you'll understand the references isn't there like a st a steak that you eat raw you could eat quite a lot of steaks raw yeah wagyu yeah it's like a wig of wagyu beef i've never had that either by it's apparently it's very expensive for a little piece all right one boss okay this is gonna be crazy boys yeah it's gonna be wild get the clues sorry we've been through been through the darkness now and through the light we're ready first right here you know like spam connor yeah i deleted all the time oh speaking of pork salsas salters pork we've been doing that a lot recently anything we talk about just like shows up in videos i'll find this dude i know things happen change her head there just girl shooter the hell is that mister i'll find out i have a good feeling that that's a bad idea no it's just something that'll be harming a bucket pumping
