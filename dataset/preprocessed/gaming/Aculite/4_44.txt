this is so dangerous this is how you die oh they're extracting up here are they no that's kind of far no way we make that i mean we could that's a yeah we could snipe them oh yeah we can definitely swim from here yeah we did this is terrible this is actually terrible the train boy strikes again hey [Music] so this is the cycle now i wasn't originally going to do a little bit of an introduction for this game but it's changed since it was initially released at least the direction of where they were going with the game so if you've been around on my channel for a little while or perhaps you're just familiar with fps games in general on pc then you'll know of a game called escape from tarkov now this is one of my favorite games i really love playing it i do however have a few issues with it one of which is how complex the game is it's not easy for anybody to just pick up the game and play it but if you are familiar with the game that is essentially the direction that the cycle has gone now so you go into raids or you have this pregame lobby where you can run around accept tasks and quests load out your character however you want and then you go into a map you queue up and you drop down on these airdrop pods onto the planet but unbeknownst to you there could already be people on the planet because at any given time you'll have people coming in and out of the server so once you're fully looted up you know you found all the valuable items that you want to either sell to a vendor or you need it for a quest then you go to your extract point call in a ship and then you can leave the planet but the server will still go on and i find this really interesting because at any given time you don't actually know how many people are going to be on the planet i personally love the idea of this i've been having a lot of fun playing it it has nice progression to it because once you start leveling up the vendors you can buy some better weapons which you will need for the second map and if you're wondering there is fall damage in the game we have tested it anyways i'm gonna leave you guys with the footage i really do hope you enjoy the video it's essentially a pve vp game where you just wanna go in grab the valuables and extract i focus a little bit more on the pvp since i tend to enjoy that aspect more in these types of games and yeah hope you guys enjoy did you finally get that weapon no i don't think so i was about to head over there and see how far i was from it i think i'm pretty close to it i don't think i'm far off i'm level 11 one more level level nine i'm just afraid to sell stuff hey man i've sold a ton and stuff that i should not have sold like yeah that's yeah i think like selling compound sheets you know the spinal bases if you pick those up yeah like mob stuff i think so too that'll be easy i'm good i'm check marked ready to go these sideburns are ready i gotta get that new gun today man i gotta get it gotta get it dude there isn't there's another one it's like an assault rifle i think and it just deletes people like do you remember the tutorial very early on what sorry what on a water weed uh do you remember the tutorial early on like when you first start uh-huh they give you that assault rifle that much i don't remember you remember that right now you're so slow compared to a war zone when you're running this how do you do there's voice lines oh here it is hey you wait how did you do that i changed mine to caps locked heading out what was this oh you don't remember that oh someone's doing it right now they're doing a rare that's exactly what i need oh they stopped it i'm sneaking once up to my right okay just sneak up here until he goes over there then we'll blast him i think we're gonna drop a bunch of stuff here maybe you heard me no it's not there yeah he's still up there to the right being very sneaky or if i just walk up and murder him and that's that might work do i think did you kill one of them no but he is hurt you went out the door to the right yep he's not back somewhere attack him once that's a blue guy he's definitely being chased it's right there lost an angle yeah see him he's right below me right now a pursuit you are not getting away good sir sorry no healing here nicely done i don't know who killed them the markers are a little bit the okay i shot a little above them did you see two up there or no i thought i thought there was another one but it was just your footsteps oh can i take the data drive yeah i'll take the cpa wait that's not a data drive i just took wait i just loaded in my inventory and then you took it from my inventory after that really okay you have room for the backpack i'm dropping the snipe uh no i gotta go pick up the other backpack you can take it then i'll pick up this one yeah i took this one i dropped all my stuff so i could be quieter but he definitely hurt us oh it's getting kind of stormy see if we can find some ball bearings real fast oh this guy up here hold on hold on i have an angle i have an angle dead damn we just double tagged him i shot him in the head on you after hello what does that call it how does that help me he was just sitting there staring at me you're lucky we've been playing long enough that i understand that cheers hello i need help now i need help help i only made 10k i made three missions i got one more backpack yeah i think there's guys up ahead man i'm scrapper i thought i heard shots over here they must've not had armor right dude i okay so i played the war zone of halloween event that thing didn't scare me at all that scared me though are you sneaky jesus that's the loot and survivor game they will find a way last thing i need is another heart attack okay another heart attack question wait what wait a minute too much coffee lately definitely not enough oh yeah i miss this oh yeah that good just try to just try to shoot it don't even move your mouse i'm going to try to control recoil okay oh my god what and it deals so much damage the creatures and players 22 rounds 15 oh my god it's got 25 pen and the dot is clean too on top it's so clean and you can tell the big blue guys without much worry sick you want to go for them first uh i don't know no that's fairly are you sure yeah i'm here in these shots i feel like things are generally a little bit farther what they sound like to the left to left there you see them i think no i have a big tree oh yeah nasty i think i'm hearing it from me there's another after you're right up the hill still behind big rock one dead well you guys did could be three shots for that i don't see that guy shooting we've never seen a trio yet that is actually true we've seen seems like maybe they changed it so you only go up against duos now at least that's i don't think we've seen oh actually no we have seen solos i'll cover you oh good he had smg ammo yeah let's go we killed two players yeah like i was trying to crouch up on you the second guy the gun looks so weird though it's like a little it does look really strange it's like a wheeled a wheel nerf gun i feel like it's one of those discs and measure or something you put down on the ground and then you walk with them like a laser yeah a laser measure or whatever yeah that's funny gone dead next yes it's closed finally we've been up here like 7 million times and nothing now we shall get all oh is this oh okay it's not everyone i got a janitor's key oh really janitor where's that at all think maybe it could be the one down at the um uh the vaccine lab there's one room that kind of looks like yeah maybe we can go check that out big loot oh my goodness i got three focused crystals from that yeah it's absolutely disgusting holy oh my god our loot this match this room is crazy that's pretty wild and some type of that's it i got i got nine focus crystals and one pure okay i got eight focus and two pure oh they just fought here that's why down left in the compound okay one's underneath us he's not up i'm gonna kill this guy i don't think this guy's in here oh i ruined them yeah is there one more up there yeah i think so coming up or he's underneath down to the left like 12 north i definitely hear more footsteps dude i only hit him once if i had to just hit one more time i think that'd have been it you can go around the right i'm gonna lose you guys healing real quick this week yeah you can get you can get over to him this way i just hold my stand for no reason right you still up there oh he's right in front of us he just died i think look at that dead one more one more down near the rocks i think i'm clear on the left side real quick make sure i think we're good over here yeah i see the rattler down there no joke i think this guy died from the rattler maybe oh he's running all the way out here attacked it no way good night sir i saw a rattler spitting here but i guess yeah maybe that was the same guy it'll be epic heals okay feeling that strong medkit he's got blue shield you want it oh heck yeah well who killed him even uh i don't know what if he's got him well i might i'm gonna take it because i gave you a 4k gun fair enough i'm down with that i mean the armor is probably worth about the same as 40k i've never even been on the other map i don't even know how to lose it looks like i was there one time it seemed a little apparent just not about knowing where they're at you just run into it let's hit it don't touch that armor don't touch that armor no that was way too slow really epic armor and embarrassment we're literally just talking about this holy okay this is definitely like straight out from tarkov [Music] there is green armor in there if you want it i'm okay i already have an extra blue one i'm gonna be unkillable epic armor dude i didn't think i was gonna see that in the beta damn i'm thick just don't get a headshot i'm not gonna loot it in time i'm dead you already have enough i need it unless oh i picked up a shard thing i know it's a material for backpack too so i'm snacking it oh so you need it understandable i feel like we almost did everything that run start laughing every time i start dates because we're like you already know what's going on all right star port admin room is where we need to go i made 52k oh i made 30. damn it's got to be the armor yeah the armor for sure busting it up there maybe i also but i also got the generator just key right and the gun for me i don't know if that counts probably not oh yeah maybe you
