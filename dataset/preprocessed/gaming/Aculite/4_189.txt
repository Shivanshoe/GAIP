[Music] this is great this is so much fun easy do you think he'll check over here my guys not that guys not hey there's that guy okay we're on a roll know if it reloaded just slightly faster it would be so good [Music] all right we added the stronger limbs should drive a little faster but the movement speeds reduced and yeah I like it hit that guy at ATS three is reduce so that kind of sucks however I don't think I've noticed a difference maybe this guy won't have any other screws in wha [Applause] go over to the spawn here like something like so damn if my teammates don't push over here we can have them spawn trapped I mean any of us got him the travel time is not that bad where's this guy shooting at like oh I thought I hit somebody on the roof hit a crossbow as well I'm on your team I got him you're cheating dude he's using a sniper I'll see how close it was oh I didn't even shoot moving up moving up sneaking okay okay all right let me just take that back thanks appreciate it need some help there you go get on the ladder yeah you got it you got it uh-huh gotcha don't you worry let me help a good friend out see you downstairs I don't know what's happening right now what wait I missed I missed I missed I'm out tell me though thank you he's looking the wrong way care package oh my god I messed it up damn we're really like 16 I know what's going on there okay let's call these in yeah over there and then see if you call these both in at the same time then they kind of have to focus one down and the other one will just dominate them really if there's a guy over there me you're kidding me right now I'm down that route my two zoomed-in where is there one I don't even know where these guys are but I'm getting kept markers so I don't understand life hello anyone up here I was a headshot these guys seem a little bit oblivious I don't know but you know what my last few games well why didn't ago is gonna reach him like no drop they're my last few games like I haven't heard any footsteps super strange it's like everyone's using dead silence come on let's Duke it out oh there's a guy there 27 kills mind you that wasn't all with the crossbow but I kind of liked it Petrograd okay so I took off the heavy limbs cuz I noticed that that little bit of 80s speed it matters quite a bit in the end only because you only have one shot so if you get shot first before you can shoot then you're great you're hoppers and it's all because they aim punch which has messed me up quite a bit what excuse me help me team help me team I think there's a guy up here oh no he's dead never mind so is he I noticed with Cod players they'll always continuously shoot at the last known location not a lot of other FPS games I know of where people do that like they'll always pre they'll pre-fire you essentially I guess because they expect you to peek again I think that's how I die most of the time I didn't hear would hear a single footstep dead silence yeah must be sleep sleep I love how quiet it is it's good it's good it's a fun weapon it really is weirdly enough though I haven't seen a lot of people using it it takes a little while to level up because you have to get five kills we'll see like right there that ain't punchy is crazy you have to get five kills with a reflex sight on a marksman rifle five kills in 25 different matches and I don't think you can leave afterwards because that's all I had to grind mine so it takes a little bit of time so I don't know if people are that interested in doing it oh my god man he's not making any footstep sounds I didn't hear that door I didn't hear anything they shot though you know what the building fights on this map remind me of it reminds me of the contaminated areas in the division doesn't it give you that vibe I suppose because this area is kind of quarantined off I won't hurt I think through yeah they're all spotting on this side over here west side I can hear him just holding the grenade Oh luster strike where is everyone this should be spawning behind you think one okay there's another got really quiet all of a sudden no one is moving what is this man doing you're supposed to put that in like a window or something now Oh normally those don't hit I got lucky there I didn't even know you could get up on this balcony for the longest time it's like a kilt from it on the flank she's mad that was a buzzkill oh I hit him in the foot a lot of fun playing TDM with this I don't know about ground war ground war might be a little bit too crazy it's a little too much going on I don't have time to reload I missed I missed again you may get them ah see it's not accurate when you move and you shoot it's not accurate at least not at range yeah see it hit the window so damn man we did all right though 90 kills that was with no kill streaks either just 19 kills yeah I don't know background war I'm curious to try it but I don't know if ground war is gonna be a good idea it might be a little too hectic I think it's a good weapon though it's a fun weapon I don't think it's meant to be like this crazy you know wipe out a whole team with it what they could do I don't know if this is in the match or in the game already for it what they could do is add like I I suppose like a rotating I'm not really sure sure what you would call it a cylinder for the bolt so you could just rotate and then just reload the whole cartridge rather than having to single-handedly reload one bolt at a time and just reduce a TS speed with it or something I don't know there's an idea though I think that would make the gun or the weapon a little bit better I'll tell you what it's a fun weapon it really is I'm curious to try it and ground war [Music] you [Music]
