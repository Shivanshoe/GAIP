so recently I've been messing around with a bunch of different weapons and loadouts in warzone and why not right isn't that kind of the whole point of it there's so many different types of weapons attachments that you can throw on different weapons to make them pretty much a different load out entirely and I came across this one recently when I downed and then killed off a guy and I thought he lost his marbles completely but he's off the rails and what it is is an m4 with nine millimeter rounds now I run this thing roughly the exact same way that I would in normal m4 the only difference is instead of a sixty rounder I use it with thirty two rounds of nine mil now if you want to copy this for yourself this is the full load Oh feel free to if you'd like I was actually pleasantly surprised when I first picked it up I was like oh my god this guy he's wild why would you ever want to do this but it's actually not that bad the one thing you got to remember though is it fires much quicker than a normal m4 and it shows that you lose a little bit of damage as well as damage range but I don't know if that really matters for how fast it fires you guys will see in the video I don't want to ruin it or spoil it for you but if you'd like to try it out for yourself feel free to copy this and hopefully you guys mess around with a bunch of different Lotus cuz that's the whole point you're supposed to have fun in video games anyways hope you guys enjoy if you do please leave a like if you didn't dislike and hopefully I'll catch you guys in the next one they're dead yeah yeah RPG em yeah what's up they were like headed right towards it yes suspiciously so like soaring like flying super lotor trying to come say hi hello oh my god what is going on here here munitions box going down you're nisshin's box there's another one in here and then whatever you want interesting proposition you know me doing I'm gonna use my 9 mil em for somebody was asking about that they're like what do you think about that garbage oh I got I got something I have many flashbangs all right dude oh I can't drop my money okay no one give me anything always strange damn stone excuse me literally can't move I cannot move I'm below him I literally kidnapped but I can move a pixel on my screen just jump oh he's right underneath he's in the house underneath you okay we could drop down what do you think I'm going for a loadout then I'm going back over I sent a flashbang and it went out the door even at times like they'll be some days are my flash bangs or my sons are on point and then other days I'll just like chuck it and doesn't matter where I chuck it it always comes back at me bounces off like a flake I do that quite a bit probably on that buy for maybe Oh a little closer yeah they're like
