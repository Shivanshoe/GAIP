so this is metal hellslinger and as you're about to hear from the music it is very much that it's a metal rhythm fps game so think of something like rock band combined with doom and that's exactly what this game is i never thought i'd see the day where you could play an fps game to a rhythm very strange concept but to be honest it works it really does work now this is not a sponsored video i just think this game is really cool and fun com was kind enough to give me a demo key so i could test out the game for myself and record and share the footage with you guys if i so chose to now supposedly on release it's gonna you're gonna be able to change the difficulty as well as change what type of weaponry you want to use but since this is just a demo we can't do any of that but it does do a nice job to showcase exactly what the game is going to be about if you're a fan of metal then you're definitely going to enjoy this and if you're not well i got nothing for you i'm sorry hope you guys enjoy [Music] i remember this place like it was yesterday wish i didn't [Music] all right here we go so the point is to shoot things essentially to the beat or the rhythm of the song right so if you look at the left and the right crosstails coming in i have to time my shots or even my dodges along with that i think the dashes even work with it too and you even have the quick reloads [Music] [Music] yeah it does works doesn't give you any extra any extra experience or anything like that the combo number doesn't go up [Music] [Applause] [Music] pretty unique though [Music] it's kind of nice because you have something else to focus on besides just attacking i'm kind of realizing now how difficult it is to talk and play to the rhythm at the same time [Music] not a big thing of the skull i don't think it works that well i think the shotguns overall my favorite [Music] pistol time [Applause] [Music] messing up my combo so each weapon has its own unique ability too once you build up the yellow bar [Applause] you can use it kind of like a little bit of an ultimate [Music] [Applause] not really sure why these guys have strings attached to them are they supposed to be like puppets or something [Music] i can honestly see myself just playing this for like a full day though just jamming out to this as you go through yeah the pistol holds really good so right now they have pistols a shotgun the sword and the skull in at least for the demo don't know what else they're gonna add i think there was even a crossbow in the trailer and obviously there's gonna be many more songs [Music] [Music] trying to upkeep the 16 times as much as possible [Music] i want to see if i can beat my score [Music] to be honest i don't think i'm going to though it's uh it's like 5.2 million or something [Music] so there is a boss at the end and you get to see kind of like the unique mechanics of fighting a boss [Music] and after going through this a couple times i really want there to be a harder mode so like this is cool you get to like casually play through it and i know there's gonna be a harder mode i just wonder what we're on right now oh i was supposed i think overall the pistols are probably the best shotguns definitely one of my favorite though the skull doesn't feel as strong but it has a nice aoe to it when you use the ultimate [Music] perhaps maybe it's just gonna be the starting weapon and they just uh give you kind of everything to go or at least a few weapons to use right now [Music] [Applause] i'm missing everything now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there we go he's the ultimate on that guy the benefit of mailing somebody i'm finishing them off that way i believe they drop little health shards like that thing does boss time [Music] so i'm still not fully sure on the bar underneath her health bar maybe it's a stagger bar or something can't quite figure it out [Applause] pop my pistol clone these guys are really tough sometimes [Applause] [Music] really started gotta start utilizing my dashes a little bit more nice we went through that pretty quick so something else to mention i don't know if i did mention this earlier your damage is based on how perfect of a shot you timed so i guess the weapons have like base damage but then you do even more damage if you perfectly time your shots with the beat [Music] we almost got her [Music] there we go aspect defeated yeah i love these pistols they're so cool hey that's not bad at all i think uh that might actually be my highest score so far didn't take much damage either there's not many people on the leaderboards right now because not many people have access to the demo but out of curiosity have a seventh it's a cool game i thought it was a really cool demo a very unique concept you
