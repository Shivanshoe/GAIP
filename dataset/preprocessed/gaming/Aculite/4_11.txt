[Music] oh there's two two ahead [Music] i might have killed one i don't know oh killed one i think it's two more i think it's a three stack in there yeah i killed one i killed the one down to the left oh no more i got a hill too running low on ammo behind us killed [Music] don't worry i'm a seasoned professional the aiming for this is so strange yeah i got like three more fuel canisters that will run out break it into the vault welcome to marauders this game is a hardcore looter shooter set in space which can be a little bit confusing considering the weaponry that we're using but honestly i think the weaponry does suit the game pretty well especially with the level design that they've chosen to go with now first off it's not a sponsored video but they did give me a key to the closed beta access so that i could test the game out and showcase some gameplay if i so chose to now i'm not a big fan of comparing games but if you've seen a game or played a game such as escape from tarkov it is very similar to that gameplay element the core gameplay loop is to well deck yourself out with whatever you would like bring in your meds your armor your helmet your weaponry whatever you would like and you spawn in a ship where you're tasked to go into the main area but i like to consider the main hub kill some ai loot up do some contracts if you so choose to try to make yourself some money get some gear and make it out alive there's a few other things tied in that you can do such as breaching other people's ships by taking escape pods and just breaching right into them and if you're lucky enough to kill them you can even take their ship and extract with it so if they have a better ship than you anything you bring out you get to keep that includes ai you can also attack ai ships loot up take all their gear and just extract so you don't even have to go into the main area but i figured i'd give you a little bit of an idea of what's going on in the game before we get thrown in this is our first impressions our first type of gameplay trying to figure out the game i really hope you enjoy let me know what you think about the game in the comments i'm very curious and i'll catch you guys in the next one we're [ __ ] huge just getting some test shots so we have 400 speed compared to the initial one which is only oh yeah it is the interceptor thing you have to be a guy i think that guy has it too yeah so you just kill the the cruise ship and then we're good what are we looking for is yeah he's hiding in between i think he's a player oh yeah that's a player for sure and smart yeah just get us in there this ship looks sick we have 400 movement speed you're flying we're already in dude later gamers we're four times we're four times as fast as a real ship right now you know what you should be able to stash loot on your ship too and go back for more uh yeah you can wait you can yeah once you get upgraded ships where's our oh so right here now that you mention it here's the storage right here so is this shared storage if i put the bandage in can you see it yeah everybody can see it okay so do you then get this stuff when you extract i guess since it's your ship yes i want to say yes i should make it so there's a crate for each player for storage then i think probably a good idea to like bring extra bandages and stuff and then just throw them in there too true unlock airlock i didn't bring a pistol this time only a shoddy i brought a well rodden in uzi should we stand still first then listen listen for what what's this they're very loud in this game yeah i don't know what's litable and what's not on the torch did you go up yeah that was the box it wasn't me shots this way right in front of me actually dude it's a beamer oh my god he almost killed me i can't hold up here i don't know if i just killed a player or if that was a i'm slowly pushing over how many did you see just one they're down below us yeah yeah i only seen one the white helmet on was that where we came from i don't know i actually don't know it was over here wasn't it do you even know what it bro i have no clue well it's a circle like well there's an eye here oh my god i'm at 23 h missile i hear more steps in bubbas or something the ai respond yeah that's above they're coming down i think [ __ ] so you no i'm here this is me oh that's me no no no i'm right behind you i'm just a different player dude i decided to play her [ __ ] i thought it was you uh yeah i'm so dead there's no way they just rolled right up behind us [ __ ] you this is tough i might be able to do this come on peek into me [ __ ] you no way did you get him i am absolutely gaming right now grab that arm i had it oh i can join dude i don't think i've ever gamed so well in my life should i get a dp28 too oh commando backpack we love that you gotta make your backpack yeah who's carrying one oh yeah they were kinda they were sneaky they kind of knew what they were doing so good stuff please tell me it's dock 1a 198 or 190. i'm pretty sure that's ours i'm right here no way if that's the case yeah i never looked back to check oops that's okay i didn't either yeah this is it this is ours i guess technically i could no i don't have enough hp for that oh it takes time to craft stuff too um any idea how we get to the top of our ship we are flooring it oh muted how big is your backpack the new one i got is four by five um i can't check right now just cuz i'm in space but commando bag i think uh that sounds about right four by five way out [Music] ruin this guy odds oh my god i cannot believe i just hit all those shots in a row he's not faster than us nope he's toast oh yeah you're already straight okay he's gonna take his pod so can i shoot the pod i don't know i know when i shoot at it right now he loses hp that's what happened to me i mean you could dip and go on a ship if you really want to kill him are we getting shot at by someone else i don't know i think someone just noticed oh i almost hit that asteroid i didn't see it don't hop out we gotta kill him we might have to leave the ship should i fly away while you fight [Music] i mean we could just take take the escape pods if you want right here i don't want to save the ship no we can try we're losing hp fast i just got disabled i just killed him all right our ship's done for i'm losing hp fast yeah we need to dip [Music] i don't know where the exit is at it's down here on me [ __ ] you i found it i'm escaping yeah i'm escaping dude i think once you hit this pod you're fine you want to take it we can repair it but we don't know how so we're going to die before we figure it out i think it's better we just did yeah where did we go um well we could try boarding that guy but i i would need to heal same i'm really low too do we just board them anyway which one of them one next was there dude cooling down no one shooting yep okay reaching i'm a little out i'm going for it he's getting shot by someone else and i forget the one we were in rachen i'm in don't shoot me i'm healing is that you i'm not moving okay out of meds that's it i'm healing right now i'm out of meds too now are you down here with me yeah i think i'm in the basement with you i'm in a bunk bed area are you walking i'm walking right now i'm to your left your left right here okay this guy over here and ahead of us i think i'm going to talk about he's above us there might be one more yeah biscuits watching man i actually just got roasted it sucks you can't take their armor can you not or their backpack sorry army can i got his key card oh yeah i guess you can i think his armor for now um how are you doing hp oh good now okay should i go fly it i mean yeah we need a ship we could probably go repair ours now all right let's try but don't we need a repair torch and we don't have that do we use the fire extinguishers by the engine i'm being told yeah there's a fire extinguisher every ship has one of those so um i think the big ship below us is an ai okay i'm gonna exit this with escape pod i wish you could just like kind of breach yeah i'm guessing those infinite escape parts i think so yeah so we kind of suck to board someone and they take the only escape pods there we go it's going up where do you see the ship hp at right here oh god that was loud on the screen oh sick 100 baby hey we begging business wait so literally while we're shooting because if i'm not in the turret seat you can fly and shoot right so i could just be down there repairing right away technically yeah wouldn't that be the way you wanna reset okay yeah it was a good ship battle i like that okay so if you're in it now you can control the turret right now that i'm not in it yep okay so yeah that's that's gotta be the strap then you're just flying i'll be down there ready to repair okay maybe we should applaud button yeah right odds are back they're mid they're actually mid so i don't think it matters which way again engine back hatch front pods made there were two small pots what's the big one all right roger that oh look at us [Music] we're off to see the wizard they look so small yeah they're both coming another one too let me know when you boost oh never mind i think uh third ship actually got destroyed oh yeah oh he's plodding around there's two pods they're getting breached the other ship is getting breached not ours oh the ai just owned me no you're already dead nope not yet got him i'm across from you oh my goodness got an ai that was me oh no this guy behind me i was stuck in the doorway you think it was a player dude it breached behind me with no sound oh this was a player nevermind ah that sucks what is happening please tell me this guy's got meds it's the most pvp action i've ever seen in my life food i'm killing the entire server because they keep spawning in front of me they keep potting in that's what happened to me i just got shot in the back but like it's just out of nowhere i'm pretty sure the entire server's dead hey let's hear those guys this is so insane what just happened if i die to the ai now you said you were across from me right yep i think though that's what it sounded like did you die in the room or what yeah like in one of the side rooms okay i'll check yeah i think this would be uh actually plate rig this must have been you but i think he took your stuff no well you probably killed him though right no i honestly don't know i can't tell if the commander's still alive or what's going on that'd be there's still player alive come on not a boy oh yeah easily uzi is the best i stand by it he did take your bag pack it up one two three four five key cards that's got to be the whole server there's no way there's more than yeah i don't i think we yeah that had been everyone gotta take that maybe i can take another armor that would be good let's think this through here okay what is this a k1 assault rifle it uses five five you ever heard of that never heard that yeah the k1 yeah yeah i've seen it i don't think i've used it though is it worth me taking i don't know if it's good i don't think i don't have the room escape podding back to our ship and then i extract god that was so mental everyone just kept plodding right in front of me there was like three guys that did it it's like that's the meta right now people just go for that now i don't know how many people know with a blowtorch though if you have that you know hey yeah the blowtorch is pretty sick i wonder what happens if you extract well and enemies on your ship i think they just extract too then you think they just come with you probably we out [Music] i had six marauder kills oh my god hey he's popping who's he's the way man he's the way i'm gonna try that new 12-gauge shotgun i just got hopefully that thing slaps you
