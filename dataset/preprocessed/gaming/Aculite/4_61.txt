so there's not really much out there in terms of content for war zone right now it seems like everybody's just using the the meta stuff actually it's kind of all the time people tend to use the meta stuff but i personally think that gets really boring to watch after a while so i like to mix it up and try other things and in this case we tried the dragon of with the gallow and i can tell you firsthand this is an awful combo i would never suggest using this unless you just want personal pain but since i'm titling the video mainly based around the dragon of i wanted to mention to you since there is two games the very first game i do not use it all that much i didn't want to be that guy to post about using a gun in the title and then not let you know that the very first game it's not used all that much because you don't want to wait 15 minutes to get to that type of content anyways i would tell you the attachments but i pretty much stopped using it right after and it changed off the loadout so i have no idea what the attachments were regardless i hope you guys enjoyed the video thank you guys very much for watching and i'll catch you in the next one my textures are completely ruined for some reason i don't know why do you see through the floor not quite it's just there it looks like quake one oh yeah come back then it might come back no i think you have to restart for that one where are we going i don't know somebody else dropped train yeah got some action coming in here though these guys are coming in late hey oh yeah yeah super late oh yeah look at this guys i think one's in the stairwell here yeah they're all on this purple side i gotta reload oh man i'm just gonna second floor with me as well following me lying all right i'm coming down are you guys on the second floor i'm coming in on a second yeah i'm on second right now i just is the guy here tom unless he's been killed watch out i don't know he's on the left strange there's one on the road i missed every shot on the roof dead sorry it should be low one more on the roof oh he died somebody just killed him died yeah it wasn't uh somebody killed southwest yeah yeah there's another on the roof then a very interesting location yeah that's channel four ron burgundy ron burgundy man i just took him down it was a rose game that was the guy oh was that the guy there's another one here he's neddy no he's broken enemy down you get him i got one that's not the the one that just killed stone though should we push this i don't like pushing these stairs like this yeah that's really bad do you want to go up this way yeah okay largest is he melee let me just my light i'll just ruined myself i appreciate he's on the stairs with us here somewhere i'm above you guys yep he's kinda low nice tom i played some connor was it true that that game broke your graphics card yeah yeah it's true yeah how crazy is that it friday night it's like does your graphics card really uh start to open up you blend in so well with that bus specifically but everything else everything else not so much what about the box wait wait what about the box where are you going connor i can't i don't know jack i'm right here can you see honest eyes where is he what is what do you see he's gone freaking out or is that just me i don't like you at least that's really good i'm floating guns right uh need a bit of money tom sure connor's gone now so i don't know oh there he is what oh no your legs disappeared oh wait crazy dude hey man how did you do that hey dude right i got extra spring in my step okay it blends in with the asphalt leave me alone um this is gonna be so bad it's not it's not as uh attractive in a title oh yeah you get more views that's true people just want to see you go through pain now there's nothing to do with low doses they do like that it does uh yeah no that's true i played warzone but every time i got a kill i stepped on a lego wait that's a genius idea how do you think i got this right there oh is that what happened to your leg you stepped on a like you stepped on a lego parts of the caribbean do the joke again pirates of the caribbean he just keeps going until he gets a laugh even if it's from himself i actually had a partisan caribbean update see ya thieves did yeah yeah yeah good news they come out soon what's up see if thieves nuts fit in your mouth oh he's so good he's just a natural the pain's not just about playing the game it's about playing with tom yeah that's the that's my challenge for today what's the real challenge we're going to go buy a munitions box didn't take my time with that one can you buy me new ears too yeah i'm yeah let's get a new graphics card i mean i barely shot at anyone in this game okay what was the dragon that was insane that was it it does sound cool yeah it sounds really nice suppressed i take it back dragon is just the best gun in the game well someone sniped at me oh they were in the top right the guy above me right now oh dude he's got beams outside here now we're being tracked enemy down one down on the roof my roof yeah yeah i think he's the only one on this roof everyone results is on the other ones and you can finish him good job yeah yeah uh bank roof i hit him once it did no damage oh there's another spot behind no why is this always the case of course i'm in this area i don't know where the other team was it killed you he's there right there he's running into the unknocked my bank my building above us my or something [Applause] [Music] [Applause] nice i don't know where the other guy is killed him kill him i might be part of the same team that was a teamwork uh we got two here so oh man is he in the building i think we're clear at the back here okay is that the street oh it's the gala street sweeper got nerfed we had more that were looking at us from the south here though bro yeah they're up the hill on the left here i think we can take these uh just crossed left one just armor break second floor any tappers yeah i'll get you thank you i have it on the roof left side left side i'm blue he's lit it's absolutely lit i'll get you come on i'll get it any tappers thanks for the dab until you want self got your full head oneself we're gonna have to go up the hill we can either do it now or later yeah let's go let's plank right up here yeah i'm down down come up get a vehicle if you [Music] oh my god this gun is so good i don't even know what i'm shooting at is i wanted to push him out from there and he just took it just he just stood in it what a game like you know what i'm going to run outside into the airstrike here this should be good fly 4v1 this is how i'm going to collect it this is how my the game right now watch this i have 11 kills and i got one kill with the title the dragon off is the new meta well that's the beauty is that you're using two off metal weapons so you can you know if it's the galactic oh the galaxy the gala is not half meter it's really good does this used to be a plane yeah i don't remember everyone's in the back of a plane was it just it was one plane wasn't it yeah you've got gas closing in fast get to the side well time flies like the poverty plane when you have your gpu being roasted i mean true on that oh we got a dropper you found the money never mind oh okay you do not appreciate that the wall though basically wall hacks that were just represented in front of me there gonna give him a thumbs up because he's watching this guy right here there was a guy over there yeah just kidding i'm gonna feed my iguana to him you're feeding the armadillo again i mean armadillo yeah excuse me that's a good armadillo yeah i know it's supposed to be cute that's bob brown finish them please finish them did you down the ground in the vehicle was that the dragon off acolyte oh yeah oh my goodness dude best gun in the game and there's the one kill we've been sleeping on it i know two kills you already doubled your success from the last game power that was hotel oh tower i always just call it talls everything is tallest to me we're in downtown tallest they're south of us around is tallest i could just be on the roof and i'll just say that yeah they're tallest above us uh we need a contract all right i'm writing one up all right it's ready to be signed i just want to drive around and wait for it this was connor with his super silent dragon no no no i'm pretty sure the nail gun is louder in this thing in modern warfare what do you reckon what's up jack sorry do you think the dragon was good at modern warfare or oh it might be it's actually yeah it's one of the easier weapons to grind uh knocked one or gold even if he's right next believe me i am oh shoot and i missed him i couldn't snipe him maybe that was why that variant just got away dude oh yeah two vehicles three vehicles and we're gonna beat them from down there take out this guy nice turn this around oh i just got smashed [Music] there's another vehicle here guys another another vehicle gas station gas station what just happened all right no your character is literally underneath the raid running into a wall [Music] i'm being looked at from northeast building you're still what's going on those guys on the roof stone yeah yeah yeah oh no he's parachuting on us gun truck you go to the truck oh my god i'm ahead of you right now you see me running array right here yeah you still alright [Applause] i'm right behind stone at the moment that's a truck there's a guy in this building i just don't know where okay i know where he's in this room here on yellow move this guy's cheating like i just died in one second where's that from the lowest side north side second floor second floor over here enemy team is tracking your position i love this man we're all together pushing this is great playing as a team yeah this is actually hopped out here on the left more one more one more nice there you go you good that's the whole thing i think this guy might be a gas station could be wrong yeah this guy's gonna be a guest it's not left room oh that wasn't him there was another one no no no dead get wrecked i got the bounty though you know what it was worth it it was worth it stone's just stood still in the middle of nowhere i thought he dc i'm just chilling no i'm just chilling right here why take one extra step and just get covered while you reach out this lobby's got nothing on us tom i'm not even concerned it's a wallbang you know just puffing his chest up and built this i just felt differently no i could even lick my direction hit him through the walls it's like it's nice nice stone's so good he won me my goo leg i didn't have to fight anybody that was crazy yeah i'd set it up for you i just got him to leave the lobby there's one moving down on purple here we're moving for long it's in the ravine i think i broke his place my asteroid never got down yellow as well what are you doing he's hit the outside of the wall there i think he's using a dragon off too moving the logo why are they not moving they're all going to die by yellow yellow the guy top green in the window yeah i don't know how i missed that guy i missed two easy shots on him this is a funky object you see the orange this whole gun is funky man i think he's resting someone there behind the orange truck there's a guy in uh would you say it's low-key fun loki it's kind of funny yeah i got i get you now yeah 40 minutes looks like there's one up for the trucks there or something jack you got an eye on that yeah yeah orange not sure really i joined up the hill see if i can support it here i'll land on the loadout again the loadout oh we just started full damage don't worry we just did a sign so that's fine fourteen one what is it another one another one i don't think he did that yeah definitely that's so weird i said he died the full damage did a stone mountain moving that's that means that he got a full team wipe head shot only yeah he died before one bullet he won't die damage and then get caught quad collat well i would count it oh it's interesting oh he's rebounded i'm ready to get him first now we are not in a great position three in this building guys three in this building oh damn yeah all right let's make it none in this building yeah i like that fine tools [Applause] oh um he got killed by another team wow zone is coming in okay i do have a gas mask i'm on very bottom dead then level he got killed by another team guy in front of us here right in front of us here oh what's that guy to the right for the finish [Applause] second floor i hear one on the left close to me he's going to jump out here oh my god getting knocked they all have to come out oh there was some nice little jump shot no scope something again yeah that was a good game still could have done it with the scope how many kills with the dragon off uh i probably got about four or five there you said you had two right at the beginning there no i only had one at the beginning but combined between both games at the time i had two numbers i i could see my math just got mixed up there those are some big numbers i was just gonna let people believe it because you know it sounds better yeah yeah yeah fosho might as well nothing about that gun is good yeah that optics a bit weird there are there is ground loot weapons that are better than a fully built dragon hey thanks man did you guys know that windows are like wall hacks and warzone you know that oh it was [Music] hey yeah there you go now you're not gonna get reported you
