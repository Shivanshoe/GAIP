how is he hitting me right now eight seconds i'm dead it's over little re-landing on the rooftop where someone is dude i'm literally getting murdered by every team no one is shooting each other yeah that place is pretty tough any chance i can make it to that loady it's been pretty quiet out here there's a full team over here a second ago there's guys on prison roof somewhere i miss so many shots on my guy he is replating up this and still slowly moving towards it coming over the wall i guess that means there wasn't a teammate since this first teammate is far as he was like get the key card

oh it's okay it's not terrible at range but oh there's one he's one there's one he's dead yes i'll probably be using literally any other gun over here from up above that's like that guy's teammate i think probably dropped it oh he's picking me i i'm cute i can't get through there oh no wow oh my god dude what else i'm never gonna trust you when you called cheats now i'm just kidding oh they're over here online have fun wow [Applause] [Music] gotta get in there with the shotgun i got two guys in grandma's house i got no plates broken like i had me solo nice nice dude it was uh it was pretty salty it seems to be a lot of younger kids that are yelling a bunch right now this guy over on my roof though he's about to float he's below now did he die he's in the building i killed one over here and the other guy is in the building he's probably just hiding waiting for the respawn you can hide from us no he sure can good times we kind of gotta go for the prison roof yeah yeah i really feel the deathcom sometimes you know it's like yeah knocked him surely that guy's not still in the tower no no no what do you want to do here you can go inner to up this is not the way to go yeah i'll strike it if you want when we get close where the hell are we all right incoming be aware how what the heck oh my god did you kill yourself how did that even right i guess the window and then splash damage down here or some bs oh well he must be right behind this thing yeah i think i'll have a look around you got a son nope dominating i'm pretty sure he's out to the right right here moving up

no i didn't kill him the other guy dropped me real low i thought you knocked this guy over here that's where he's like okay didn't even need the bubbly first time we didn't need the bubbly i'm kind of surprised you won that game though yeah how's that hey you're putting damage up on the board that game i felt like i was just dead i feel like that was most of my games good game [Music] you
