sectors all right this is battlefield 2042 man have i been waiting to say that forever i have to give a big shout out to ea for inviting me to this event so that i can gain some early access and prepare the footage so that once the open beta is released you'll be able to view it now i'm not going to talk for too long because i'm sure everyone just wants to watch the gameplay and doesn't really care what i have to say fair enough totally understand that i just have a few things to mention first off i have not messed around with my keybinds and my helicopter sensitivity enough in order to be a decent pilot so i'm just gonna hop out of this but second i was invited with a lot of other creators as well as i believe some some press and there was possibly even some devs in the game with us now we did not have a lot of playing time to record all this so what you're gonna see is a lot of different type of gameplay some sniping some ar and i believe i might even have some vector gameplay which is not a very good gun to use on this map so you're gonna have to stick to close quarters at the bottom of this tower even now i did my very best to just kind of slap everything together and use all the best moments as well as just cool clips i should also mention that this is an older build that we were playing on which is exactly what the open beta will be running on so if you see any glitches it may have already been fixed as always please leave a like if you guys do enjoy and i will catch you guys in the next one nice dude's fantastique i'm out of here oh my god the gravel no that was the sickest play ever oh this is so sick this is so sick oh my god take me to the hospital i'm so sick i'm so sick right now i like that the cool down thing is just below my crossover when i've used the grapple oh that was a beauty headshot it's going on instagram right now oh god i broke nda nope that's a leg shot he's hurting and he's now dead yeah sniping long range is quite tough damn vector's actually kind of tough to control yeah you're right there is voip yeah well i just keep hearing enemies or like teammates going past me and talking so checking grenades is occasionally a little glitched but approximately based yeah the guy the guy in the the quad or the jeep or whatever keeps talking are you running mom i'm your son mum some mom yeah some mom guys i could use some help on this roof over here it's tough dude i'm coming i'll probably get shot in the eye yep this guy he's sniping me yep he just hit two sides in a row cool can i call him a dog here yes i'm not shooting anybody right now so if you can't spawn oh i want to go on the roof then hang it maybe you're on the point the team's not looking so good guys yes my dog's coming in i spawn right right another enemy pharah's in here nice to the vector once you start getting it's good it's good but once you get past like a certain part of your mag it's uncontrollable yeah i mean it doesn't have a lot in the mag anyway 90 degrees the graphics are so good that's so good i was expecting some like hurry up like battlefield graphics but not like this it's clear right yeah so clear it's like eye candy go puppy get him yes my dog is ruining people it's actually good it gets killed it's decimating everyone i was behind enemy lines though like right on top of them so so you said f is to melee right f hold f to bring out your knife up in your hands tap the punch well i just punched a man to death so hold after bring out your knife so you have to wait you have to bring out your knife then you do the execution yes they actually got to do that slide cancellation yeah my sense is way better nation that's a kill shot important back to base solid effect on target yeah there's some there's some really good flyers in battlefield games they go remember we're against like everyone as a content crew or maybe some like press everyone in here is like fps content that's going on reddit oh number two on reddit and you're going to watch them back and there's like the most average kills i've seen you know once the nda lifts and all that of course of course there it is and number two oh just a little over the top a little off the sides a little higher getting a haircut like a little bit higher number two please there it is that's the number two close shape you left the top maybe you do care because you love me expert doubt oh you cheeky little enemy we got him ladies and gentlemen that's the first thing that came it too [Music] oh yes this game is going to be a lot of fun with sniping oh yes let's go over there now have a grenade need a second to reload why is everybody shooting at me where did you find quick throw uh it's under your your uh person sensitivity stuff on foot how do you swap and open the door gentlemen we're going in so you're saying you could stop yourself on the zip for space and you can jump off it i mean that's not full control but it is controlled because you can spin around on its stuff and have your weapon now like how much more control do you want everything i want all the control can't just pause on the zip if that's what you're you're expecting i've been gaming what i gotta say i'm really feeling this game i feel like one-on-one yeah i'm feeling pretty good about it right now too myself and the game are at one i don't know if you have a knife by default my my guide punches do you have a knife connor yeah when you press f yeah oh you hold f if you tap it you just punch why you got your gun out yeah well i did it i did that that whole thing kind of backwards there so i held it at the beginning i didn't do anything with it i think i changed my field of view a little bit too high yeah turn it down i did 95 at max it's very increased what i've been doing so far is sniping yet is it good yeah all right we'll bring it down to yeah so press t or hold t if i remember you can add the attachments you want hold t once you're in once you're in the game oh oh you don't even have to unlock anything huh probably in the full game oh yeah that makes sense oh i just got sniped i uh i started my sniper spray off by spawning on top of a building sniping a guy out of the heli the pilot then sniped the passenger as he jumped off then sniped another two heli pilots like it was nothing and i was like was that am i scripted am i watching a scripted bit of gameplay is this me playing right now there's no way i found the enemy team well there's so many down here i found the whole enemy team over here nice it was not good for me oh my goodness you can be all the way up in this building too you can go everywhere my man heaven brother that's where i snipe the hell he's at the start i need to find how to get underneath there we go the grappling hooks away all right i haven't tried that oh yeah very first guy i sniped the guy using the grapple hook like it was mid-flight it was hilarious you
