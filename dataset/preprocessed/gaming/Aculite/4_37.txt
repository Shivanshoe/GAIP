[Music] we're going to use gadget x to interact with world markers cue and eat a lean all right i'm a pro i figured out the game making a guide tomorrow i'm not sure like the plate system because everyone can have like a certain number of plates right like you select how many you want yeah but that messes with your mobility and also you're louder right hi blacks hello you wanna battle you want to duke it out ally hit oh you want to go oh nice frag dude not even close oh you still got damaged by my need i didn't that was the teammate oh that was blacks he's my boyfriend throwing a nade imagine walking into another one i'd wanna duke it out you threw it where i was because i feel [ __ ] warned on you and gunned you down i'm punishing you get rekt help what the hell dude you can do that as if so this is world war three if you've been around for a little while you've seen that this game has been on my channel before and in fact this video was supposed to be sponsored and i felt like this would be a good opportunity to take the time to explain my thoughts on sponsorships and promotions that i take this video is not sponsored i chose to back out of that because i didn't think that the game was in a good spot at the time of our recording session i was playing with tom tomagraphic so you might be wondering why why are you telling me this why does it matter well i like to be honest about these things and as a content creator i always feel like there's a little bit of a weight on my shoulders for even just releasing a video that's not promotional or not sponsored whatsoever because as a content creator we're always trying to showcase the best or funnest or funniest moments that we can so that it's entertaining to watch which isn't always the case in the way that the game plays or the state of the game or whatever you're promoting right and that's not fair to a viewer or to somebody who's gonna pick up whatever that person's promoting if it's not gonna be working as intended now i wanted to edit up and release this video anyways because in between all the technical issues that the game was having tom and i did have a lot of fun i just don't think that the game is in a very good promotional state at the moment now it is in a closed beta so a lot of this stuff is completely understandable and i really hope that they do get that stuff solved because the game is a lot of fun i enjoyed sniping a lot i love the way the recoil works in this the maps are really nice but please nerf the vehicles oh my goodness we were losing our minds anyways gonna be doing a lot of sniping in this thank you for listening and watching and i hope you enjoy i like the recoil in this game though it's nice the one gun that i was using the last time i played yeah it does feel like it's not visual yeah see like it's hard recoil you just have to try to control it i love that and it's just more punishing the higher up like the longer you spray for how did you get into my lobby or did you join already i'm not in your lobby friends ad friend what's your name my name's thoma grafic nice to meet you nice to meet you too bro add as friend did you get a new request no just keep on bringing all this up guys hello hello where's going roger that dumb all right hello there stanton all right roger that roger that i want you to change everything about you i hate it i hate the way you look change it whatever whatever this is change it i don't like that what don't you like all of it just everything that i'm looking at i don't like it because it's too close to me no you know what i'm sticking with what i have wow i'm good i'm good and i'm looking good zero fox given okay let's go to a match look at you in your dumb balaclava again always you in the balaclavas excuse that is the nastiest angle i think i could have had oh yeah i like it oh yeah bud i see one i like that got the other guy nice i like oh i can't drop yeah that's very classic bare bones i don't have to worry about bullet dropping well you do at range at mid range it's actually a decent amount i got killed behind the column don't destroy my drone i'm probably gonna die i'm not in the best of spots all right good very good i'm just currently murdering every infantry ever that ever existed with a land run which is gordon is it by reindeer it is that time of year i wish [Music] [Laughter] oh

they're all around us oh my god how did he know i was there i don't like to brag but i'm pretty sure i'm insane you just bragged by saying that all right you don't have to nitpick tom i think what i'm gonna do [Music] is i'm gonna spawn the drone and then use that they go on a nice streak with again right and that's it that's the whole plan yeah it's a one it's a it's a one-part plan pretty much right boomerang you mean the thing that was cool it's got a boomerang oh yeah no i can't do anything about that great thank you for your help are you kidding me i hope you died of that guy yeah get wrecked get a freaking rest that is the fastest karma i have ever seen in my [ __ ] world i feel like that was worth seeing it on my end as i go back into my drawer [Music] in real life oh my god he found me yeah buddy victory we just needed our favorite map we did that became our favorite in that match for reload animations yeah all the animations are fully fleshed out which is nice yeah when you spawn though it does a an animation every time yeah it's like [ __ ] your bolts if you're using a sniper check the mag or something check the chamber heavy enemy watch out oh yes i am going to
