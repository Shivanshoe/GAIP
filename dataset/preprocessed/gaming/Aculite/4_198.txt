you didn't know a hit oh no he actually didn't oh but you know what we're using tracers so they probably know we're over here somewhere if there's another one he was at the far house dead ahead when you come out yeah that's the chairman house we have together oh no what if he was doing the same does I don't know what it's not very obvious what's watering what's ground everything no it's really not easy outs I think there's another guy here somewhere did you throw that name yeah that was mine they said the house see you anymore see like I feel like a lot of these new players they're scared to shoot and I remember being like that too because you're like okay gotta line up the shot gonna be left shut right yeah I'm at the time he's just so half the time it gets you killed outside as you can okay if I'm dead I'm dead here we go okay you living that guy I'll check this other guy oh he had a decked out a km deep sound III around Meg open his vest I'm gonna give you this mask okay chicken parm because you picked it up it's not found in red shoe it's really good we'll find another scab before it's over look at this like dude BP he's caught his 75 rounder with beefy in it no that's a lot of 73 to meg and MO oh my god I mean it could be partial at the BP at the top maybe but his other mags are full of BP so who does that alright Test complete well part of it part of it where'd you go okay I'll just scan okay don't don't shoot yet scabbit pier players up here yeah at the building huh well yeah yeah I say we wait for them they come this way they have to come this way yeah so yeah get firing squad this looks amazing if he has a thermal I'm gonna be very angry looking dude I was hurtin rate cuz if he has a thermal we're screwed I think we're good I think we're okay he would've shot if he had her mouth you wouldn't have picked that why do mm-hmm when are we shouldn't once they get to the end of that concrete bit yeah ones like near the vehicle in front of the vehicle okay I feel like he sees me doing I feel like I feel like he sees oh my god this is terrible isn't though he doesn't mm-hmm three there's really Oh No okay we're gonna have to stay spray him he sees me there's no way he doesn't I feel like this yes the trigger discipline oh my gosh this is so hard why are they not running the house okay this is really slowly one's going out skirts on the right side I think okay do it on take the top guy if he shoots we take him I don't want to shoot the guys down below because they're gonna slide into the water mm-hmm that wait we can kill this guy later for me be okay where's the side of assembly we're gonna have to kill these other guys on the shoreline I assume he's right right of the truck the fire truck he's just behind it he had the fire truck all right I think he's gonna go right I'm not sure well he has to there's no other way he goes yep I see you guys at the shore there at the stairs they're looking up hill yeah he sauce nice nice good shot down there guys to be shoreline something we both have the same idea that was perfect he could be anywhere on the shoreline here like he's behind the staircase I saw if you peek from up top yeah he's dead wait no that's a scab what if he's in one of these things no it was nice good job hey assic I was perfect we played that right it was worth the wait he almost got me he just missed my head whoo check the kills opportunity I got that guy yep you got every single one no I must have shot the second guy just just after you then if nothing really scares me all that much but waiting that long was scaring me yeah this guy has an m4 Barret no just getting an 8-iron but it's pretty tight I'm gonna check the second guy selfi oh the black rock or the same uh I think they're roughly the same yeah insurance fraud anyhow that's what I'm good cheating the system a little bit mmm-hmm gotta do what you gotta do I'm eight five five eight one okay all right see what we can do here so you're running along I'm up at the gas station okay so if you can hear that fire then yeah oh yeah I can do you want me to pick up his dog take four yup he sure if you want he's a seven that has an alpha rig was there a bigger bag anywhere I gotta tries it no this case water over here to view it I might actually if you can fit them yeah I'm not gonna have enough room to fit him Mo's and that's not worth that much no I dropped my wisdom scavenge a station I think two players it's very buying the bus area the other - nice I forgot how much recoil this thing add oh my gosh you know now more Lube come on what are we gonna do now adieu damn it I skimmed the tree lion a little bit oh he's doing the saiga task all right I know just got at the sv-98 with a red dot on it from my home in the box all right I know what I'm gonna do I'm scared no loot except for the sv-98 I'm gonna take the site it's just the red dot i dont have space for it what this guy was doing the same task I did not too long ago right yeah along with the shotgun you gotta use is like kill scabs on shore latch on a head shot or that I mean I'm folded like I don't have to do man is this tough alright go to extract Jane I could definitely fit more if I swapped out to armor and a rig and stuff but no not worth I'm trying to think what watching those guys for so long reminded me out on estate sleep they see I was gonna say Daisy yeah because I must defend me to have lying range often let's so you wait until they close enough market where they had a good spot to leave I'm the same with this game that's so funny like that that guy he saw us like right at the end if they had a saw the sooner though that would have messed up our whole plan yeah okay extract over here that's good mm-hmm I've only extracted spawning on the other side I never actually made it out but this swamp besides um we're careful the mine feel the bed yeah it does 50 damage to your legs with the first one next one you're dead that's learned that the hard way now we're out oh yeah we did it [Music] you
