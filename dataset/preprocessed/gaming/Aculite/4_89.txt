elo above 50 smackeroos collateral what if i do it with a crossbar 20 for it 20 for a one shot you broke his armor all right hell yeah we got one get that nickel actually come on man i need the nickel for my sprinkles on top of my ice cream just like that you go follow me 20 bucks i owe you a nickel to be honest i don't think this thing really needs an introduction this is an anti-material rifle now this is only a blueprint and they just released this weapon so i don't have it fully unlocked whatsoever like i said this is just a blueprint so i don't have all the best attachments i don't know the full potential of this thing so i'm gonna have to give it another shot but i was having a little bit of fun with it today and let me tell you the blueprint it's not great it is not great so any chance that i had when we had the opportunity to go for another crate or something like that stone mountain was kind enough to give me his rifle because he has it unlocked and he has i think just the longest barrel on it or something like that but he has a couple more attachments and it's a little bit better but what i can say is that this thing slaps it sounds so good and with the longest barrel the travel time on the bullets is pretty decent i think it's even comparable to like a car 98 maybe a little bit faster or something like that but i think overall it's the most satisfying sniper to use in the game unfortunately it only comes with a three round mag by default at least uh on the blueprint so you can gonna have to reload between shots like i said i'm gonna have to give it another shot but i got a couple games for you guys i tried using it as much as i possibly could but the 80s stock is uh it's a little bit rough so if you guys enjoy the video please leave a like subscribe for more and i'll catch you guys in the next oh yeah it's still crazy uh man all they have to do is like hit a couple numbers is like minus 15 damage bam meta changes i don't think they're they're they're not gonna change it until the season update like they always keep it they don't really do any big rebalances till season updates usually yeah yeah but the thing about the kilo is like it was it was kind of it was strong right for what it was but the time to kill was not as quick as this exactly like right now you can't it was like there oh now i understand why people don't like me driving backwards this is confusing [Applause] i'm just here to spectate that was the team white sound was it yeah yeah all right didn't say it but definitely the sound uh double or nothing oh [Applause] yeah they're back on their gear yeah the one guy down there at least so i'm not trying to stand in front of here broke them oh my god combo my dead silence come on now oh you got the kill for it too did i yeah i don't have any kills damn so that's the idea you just get one person to body shop break the armor the other person's just peppering with theirs they're all on foot like from over here green marker all right let's shake the hill he's not even moving i can't hit him i'm sorry how am i this bad knock out the knock we got one way behind is that from i see him no broke him oh you're getting
