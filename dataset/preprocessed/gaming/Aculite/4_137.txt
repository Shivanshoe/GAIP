finally let some air in all right almost went down the wrong pipe for your team all right should we do something like this this doesn't stay stairwell within here so an smg that was really close did you get him nice holy crap die the pistol doesn't no damage whatsoever pistol owns what do you mean because a shooter wasn't down he took so many shots okay we should have a guy on uh i don't think he's above us yes oh is that a bruin should i pick that up is that a good weapon i think this might be a good weapon here friend go here one down won't go there and the one that just perched in excuse me blowing into his mic this guy's back where we were yeah this is a fair and balanced weapon dude this is oh you're using the perimeter he's down he's down on parking he's down on top of parking and parking yeah just absolutely ruined him up here he's further over here oh he's inside there no he's not it's really cute oh what are you kidding me you really wanted i was playing that like so tactical i was like okay he's going to peek and he's going to feed me and dead eyes just dropped in right on gas station very close on the side of this wall relocating raj oh i got sniped from uphill nope right on me actually what did he kill me with oh nice shot right we have quite a few going here i'm gonna need your help never mind mental recall of the amr should be good we get one step now there's a guy following me come over here he might know i don't know who was he not to shoot me no i don't yeah he doesn't know that i'm oh he's there he's there when's it the building i think one's at the container oh yeah of the sideline i can fix you oh no please no i'm sorry tom it's all right he's on top of that roof i've just been shot gun by the other dude oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] well this is a predicament did you get away um sure define getaway sure yes oh no no okay i'm gonna get away oh did he see me don't come near me don't come near me i'm not going to you're in the middle of everything there oh and a bruin again we've won we actually figured out how to beat the game i could play someone right here moving here nice my god i have so much money okay that's not good nope i couldn't aim to the right mounted on the side already yeah we're safe for now there's a grapple somewhere yeah it's on the other side yeah okay i have so much money and i don't know what to do with it all don't worry tom i am coming it's just gonna take me a quick second here that's okay buddy people just keep coming out of the woodworks i get it what what he's inside he's okay guard me for a quick second i'll just uh i'll scan the area [Music] those two guys are fighting with three high three threat okay so we got one second floor um one's directly on the roof he's peeking that you could walk out and headshot him under my mind uh one is below the top of the main scraper one's with me right now dude so much for watching me oh you sorry you're in a drawing quite a hobby you're just chasing me i guess his buddy's on the roof i thought you were watching it this guy likes to run past me dude for some reason i thought you were on a heartbeat or something it looked like you had a heartbeat sensor in your hand no well kind of i guess looking for a sniper i'm looking for players in this game i feel like i'm playing open world survival sorry so i'm gonna do a tom clown get a guy on beep this way okay 45 out 37. might be on the roof definitely on route i only had one unbeaten okay also he had a grenade launcher with the munitions bikes oh yeah i've got munitions as well save the firing game oh my god they're still running okay i'm gonna get beamed i feel it it's happening peek it again i dare you that's what i thought this man in the shack [Music] oh he's here and yellow yeah he's in yellow not where i am uh yeah tallest with a claymore or something set up he's upper he's just one blown to c4 for no reason i'm blind so loud dude oh down another one another one yep being punched yeah it's a different team i don't rise he's gonna finish he's in the middle here appreciate it yeah you're welcome but headed your way gonna drop pictures [Music] yeah i got an smg but i got no armor plates on me right now come wait okay do you get that i don't know if it's necessarily a glitch does this guy already have his custom gear no um three plates down but um when you slide like down a staircase or something it locks your crosshair like to i guess central center yeah yeah i can't like start i don't know if i was just uh if i was just thinking things let's get the heli in then let's get the heli and get the heli out of here the rest again up top yeah oh we opened it oh pog dude wait wait see you later bud that's quite unfortunate that is quite unfortunate oh hell yeah someone controls money money money another red access key card within a bunker what we're doing okay these guys are most likely going to jump down i did not know this one was even here probably just waiting to blow up the heli yeah yep they're outside right side okay think that heli actually i don't know if you got hit markers from that i was shooting at the ellie when he tried to give i don't know if did you get hit markers with the halle explosion oh maybe i checked a c4 after i hit him a few times that's why i got the kill yeah he had no place look how much money we have oh my god okay we gotta go up somehow oh son of a bee look at this with 26k i'm gonna put like 20 should i just buy as much armor as i can um no like buy tell you what buy a bunch of airstrikes and just because we've got the hell advantage of that buy station just uh call them in random locations uav armor box oh yeah zones catching up do you think the enemies hear this that's what i mean yeah they hit enemy uav enemy uav enemy uav enemy uav yeah hold on let me just pop the one i got there we go back to normal he's got to be prone out there yeah oh no no no oh you stole that are you kidding it's gotta be because we're on your server you gotta be quicker bro you'll line that target up you pull that trigger bruh these guys aren't even looking trees they're dead nice oh no an enemy uav is overhead oh okay hold on let me buy one uh good stuff cancel it out okay i got one [Music] we gotta kill this guy out in the field okay he knew i was there immediately i get a uav question mark i don't know it's really weird on my end probably just a burn boy he's trying to jimmy now how is he rpg he literally knows exactly where i am look he's rpg'ing me everywhere hmm if he picks it again i've got shot now these guys are getting back flank though to be careful yeah they're coming up [ __ ] knows i'm looking at him i'm telling you yeah it's super strange they're coming up the right behind us focus on these guys [Music] oh i should not have picked the setup found him i don't have another aav what yeah i know so disappointed in you he's gonna get rezzed on blue yeah for us behind here should be guy close to us i think did you get the guy close left he was right here on yellow no don't get that guy behind it behind the blue containers let's swap guns here this guy's got a bruin disgusting we could really use right now runes here maybe they're gonna get beamed on the right they're probably gonna push through our building that's the guy initially down his teammates should be we should think about pushing over now bounced off the window did they move he's not in here why would you give this up legit it should be downstairs he might be it's it's last team he's up on the hill i'm gonna go down here yeah work under if you can got itself yeah he just rest his zone we won that game i don't know the uavs would hinder our performance i down so many people again just like i just couldn't hit anybody man i was getting beamed through walls people were pre-fighting with rocket launchers that guy with their refugees in the the house was very suck he hit me every single rpg he didn't miss a single one and i had to keep buying plates that was a video game and i think we played it you
