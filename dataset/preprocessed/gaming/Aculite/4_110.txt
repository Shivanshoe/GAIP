in the morning it's just how i am day and night yeah mask on you know mascot there's a guy going in that same entrance gonna try and i just couldn't pull my shoe what i just did a stone because that's fun there's no bloody parachute from let's set me up here connor what you doing then it's like it know it's like it knew i was in the safety of landing on the roof but because i landed in the alleyway beside it just at the very last second the parachute prom didn't pop up so i'm here okay i'll believe you this time perfect i'll leave you this time it's been a while i forgot what that felt like it's demoralizing trying to fold it it actually happened quite a few times like where you just get too close to a building or whatever i just won't let you do anything well because i was going to land on the roof and then last second i decided to land in this alleyway to get into the building instead of on it i figured you were going to go for the mallet on that guy why would they give me an x50 huh is there more guys in here [Applause] got one on the roof be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply [Applause] all right i'm not gonna touch my uh loadout oh come on one's right above me there's still more i wish they spawned you like somewhere safe well you could have landed down below with me that would have been safe yeah it's because i cut my shoe early so i had no spawn protection how many shots of the head is this thing like two okay oh stone is there anyone else in that building yeah one more did he see you i don't think so got one beep here oh my god i didn't even see him just climbed up dude he's got good snipe on him very quick should he fell yeah fuller [Applause] yeah i think that was his teammate another one in here did i just die maybe [Applause] they're fighting got one down yeah [Music] this guy just keeps coming after us i got you i'm just slid off the edge this might pull to us yes it will we can stay on the roof the entire time both teams must be right below us or something looking good came out what the heck are you doing there's no way that was the real play he tried it i mean i guess he was trying to time it with the gas thinking that we wouldn't check behind us or hear it maybe oh i still didn't get that kill i've got an assist elimination do you not have a kill yet no i got one down here tango we carried hard this match we'll see yeah we will see last team 2v2 [Applause] in front of me [Applause] [Applause] yeah broke his armor nice try nice try i played that wrong god i should have just pulled out my sniper and just pinged him in the head
