you're right the ending oh my goodness first game of the day we should just call it there honestly yeah i'm good great playing guys yeah come on next time we have a hit or high so uh bye well well well another year seems to have passed this one really flew by for me 2021 was probably one of the fastest years of my life blink of an eye and it's gone and i know it wasn't like that for a lot of people due to covid some lockdown situations overall the year was pretty tough for a lot of people however in the gaming scene i think we were very lucky with the perfect timing that warzone happened to drop in free-to-play battle royale that just offered some new experiences in general and just a lot of good times now unfortunately i would have loved this video to be a lot longer and not only include a lot of warzone but other games in general however i had a lot of issues in 2021 with hardware even software i ran into an abundance of issues with my software recordings and in general i just lost a lot of footage so if some of your favorite clips throughout the year didn't make it in it's because i didn't want to go back through youtube and re-record or download that footage and upload it again because it's already been compressed once and i didn't think it would look that great so i'm prepared for next year everything is already set up ready to go everything's running smoothly and i should be able to even post a little bit more frequently as well so honestly just a lot of good news i'd also like to take this moment to thank everybody who has been supporting the channel throughout the entire year years before because i know there's still a lot around whether you're new or you're an older viewer i appreciate every single one of you stopping by commenting even just liking the videos it all helps not only the algorithm for youtube and i guess boosting things up that way but it just tells me as a creator which videos everyone likes and they want to see more of whether that's just like a full good game of war zone messing around with my friends just doing absolutely ridiculous things or highlights from when i'm streaming every little bit helps and i do go through the comment sections now that i got all that covered i hope everyone had a wonderful new year and a great holiday i'm really excited for 2022. it's gonna be a lot of good gaming moments hopefully some epic some funny moments as well now i'm just gonna let the rest of the video play out we played this game on new year's eve stone mountain and myself and we managed to get the very last win on the very last day and i thought it'd be a fun little thing to show really hope you guys enjoyed all the footage throughout the year thank you very much for the support as always and i will catch you guys in the next one throwing stun upside [Music] [Music] you
