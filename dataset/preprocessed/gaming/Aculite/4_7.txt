[Music] so once again there's another update for warzone this time they brought quite a few changes to the gun play it brought some extra perks i haven't read through all the patch notes i just know that there was a lot of gun changes overall one of my favorite changes that they've made though is this new game mode that they brought over to caldera now with caldera not being one of my favorite maps just the color the lighting i've been over this it's just not my favorite i think verdansk was a favorite of a lot of people and hopefully we'll one day see that again soon but until then we gotta play with what we get so this new game mode that they've added is essentially rebirth island but the difference is it's on caldera with that they've made it so that the zone is a lot smaller and there's a maximum of i believe 50 people with up to teams of four so you have resurgence you can always come back as long as there's one member alive and it makes for some pretty unique gameplay on this map considering how hectic it becomes if you're wondering the attachments that i'm going to be using i'm just using the blueprint for whatever that godzilla breath gun is for the stg i have no idea what's on it and then i'm using a street sweeper to be honest i just can't be bothered to level up another weapon or make a new loadout i'm just i'm i'm kind of over it if anything i'm just gonna start picking up other people's weapons and using those had quite a few amazing games with these guys playing with stone mountain and fuglet really hope you guys enjoy i'll catch you in the next one there's a guy above me and uh two north it's all the way rooftop of eurasia that's damn it oh my god they're both under the silos there in between the silos [Music] help help i don't know how i'm alive me neither none of these okay 2v2 one's on the roof cracked everyone into the safe zone almost you're far away huh [Music] making a cross he's right above me yeah yeah one uh going up the roof he's going through he's gonna be able to pin that i agree you think i can run to the buy station no no no i'll come back with nothing you just get no dog mister going for an outside wrap here a chicken caesar he's already on the bridge he's on the bridge knocked him one out the other is up here one left damn look at the bridge he's in the bridge armor tags on him last guy yep kobe uh he's

oh my goodness i actually lived with one hp oh i'm glad man holy us being able to play split angles and and keep that alive was so critical man i finally got the snipe i was in his i was in a battle with this guy i was trying to find a hole through like uh the cement barrier at one point yeah the little one he feels like he knew man it works you know sometimes we fall apart when we're that split but sometimes it really works yeah all right land together big come up play together what are you eating you're eating already yeah i'm eating some lunch man what do you mean it's lunchtime it's

of sleep wait i gain an hour of sleep i love this listen i can't even add up three numbers to figure out how much my loadout's gonna cost i can't be bothered with changing the time forwards and backwards an hour i can't his memory is good though is memory is good pristine and you have to do it you have to do it like manually on your stove you have to do it on your microwave i know right what

you man appreciate that we knew it happy birthday team 14 months i think happy birthday like that a couple months ago kills on two years ago possibly do you feel the difference in the shotgun acolyte people would just ask me that did it get nerfed yeah they dropped damage 20 percent i mean at range yes up close no yeah they said they did it to compensate the uh increased health pool that makes sense they up the explosives to some of them i saw right here okay it seems like it's either capital or docks that is that or lowercase okay i actually need to go now you know what i'm noticing about this mode already that i like what's up it seems like it's specific areas that the map is going to and it's it seems like it's choosing better places uh like it keeps giving us capital and resort down here yeah we've only found a couple areas well you're actually leaving me crack down here to cover your second floor res what the heck is going on where'd this go how do we get upstairs outside somewhere what the hell was that oh geez he's in here actually i like them there's a guy with a rocket launcher i'm trying to avoid no i got shot once front of the cover a lot of people across the street now still got in here upper level i think we're getting clustered too almost positive there's still a guy in here huh there's one second floor fire station i'm so sad i couldn't secure like any of those kills for you i got one or two of them i'm on the shooter covering at least one more over there there's nobody's choosing to fight me still you're crazy hello hello i'm gonna get a meaning it's like an old building it's pushing me crack the big knocks i'm so good at video games is what do you need stone smg and maybe a little snipe well considering you just wiped out a whole damn team i'll go get some of their stuff two more to the right they're both on yellow building to the right here there was a guy here on you actually there's two there there's two there they were ground floor yep knock one okay i went too deep maybe his teammate ran upstairs didn't get to finish oh my side my side far corner outside of 10. oh he caught me he caught me with the sweet bit i got it here i

there's people killing me oh there's people at the lotto drops well okay when you knock again i'm going to sip up copy looking for an opener oh they got to get off the roof i'm leaving this roof yep move it super speeding crack one on roof they're above me they're inside the build they're gonna have to leave it they coughing one jumped knocked on my side anything that just happened in that match that was crazy the shotgun was popping off for you man it was good until i absolutely had to drop it and then no one decided to push me and i had an mp40 that could reload very quick so oh and that like in that late game too once you get into one fight the other team's gonna be right on you it was a good play that's a good uh it's a good game it was a good game it's definitely refreshing from rebirth yeah it's nice to have new uh it's nice to have a new rebirth new map to play basically with rebirth intensity hello hello how are you and no one responds to my hello just so rude nothing man
