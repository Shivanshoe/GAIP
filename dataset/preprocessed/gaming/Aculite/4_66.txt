[Music] [Music] wow [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh i love that the intense situations you hold down a fortress of a building in that case i think i believe is a mansion try to take it over from a team kill the boss with a big bundle of dynamite one hit and then you just fortify up and try to defend from the rest of the teams coming in but that is what i love about hunt showdown that right there the intense pvp fights where there's only one boss and you have no choice but to fight your way out i love that and that's what i'm about to show you some good fights we had a full day of just non-stop pvp in this game now this is a new map it's called the sal and they were i guess focusing a little bit more on the old-timey shootouts
