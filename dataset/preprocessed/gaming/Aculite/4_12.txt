[Music] [Music] [Music] jesus oh my god what is happening how many flashes do they have and they aren't pushing what there's another one oh my god the recoil that was awful yeah that was left so i tried pulling right and then it immediately went to the right so i pulled left one's inside of me he's gonna kill me nice that was nasty because buddies seems fun yep you're insane with those nades they just don't stop i don't understand i miss like this one nice got him nice okay this place is gonna say i hit him okay he was there with us 12. he's pushing he's got a rez [Music] no way no no way you're insane that was the downed guy i managed to snag the kill on is that where we can like re-package we lift off into the air like batman just pop it outside oh do you like throw it like a smoke no you set it down um there's a boat coming there is no ammunition nice hit behind him going to the beach i was ahead of him he didn't die does he drown now or what patch oh that's neat it's coming here we go oh i saw my soul leave my body yeah right pretty cool this is cool this is like literally my favorite thing in the game oh yeah this this is this is neat so we can probably just wait for next zone unless we see somebody below us okay let me see oh let's eject let's go let's go back behind us again okay look at the trees i'm not gonna make it as far as you i'll be about the same spot oh shoot i see him no he's not do you see this guy i missed it i might be dead here hit him he's still pushing he's right in front got him nice oh hey actually big fan dude hey buddy hey man we just parachuted in out of the sky i don't even know you guys were here i know i saw you coming down i was trying to kill you but obviously failed dizzy dude don't worry i'm not gonna finish you oh no it's okay do you think man do you know where his buddy is uh gg man you're a nice guy i need to turn you down in game or just boyfriend oh god i'm dead pharah's barking i'm getting shot at dude we're in such a bad spot yeah i missed my shot on the dude i started getting crossfired too the hell happened am i freaking oh my game's crashing uh oh i should kill them [Applause] the neat thing is i can pick you up now too like drag you around and stuff oh really yeah hmm that's awesome okay i knocked him uphill 195. his teammates up to the right of him yeah he's shot nice shot got him nice okay we need to move faster there's another team up to our right yep i don't have any boos so hopefully they have some and we can steal there's a guy yeah he was up at the shack he was running right to left i'm still getting remembering the controls of this game yeah we kind of just threw you right in didn't we oh oh i see him does he see us orange no okay if you got a shot you take it i missed i should have taken one earlier yeah i saw i so i'm kind of standing still but i wanted you to take the shot i think i just heard him get directly out of me nice yeah he was instant i'm so afraid i'm just gonna flick my mouse so hard that i throw something off my desk you need to clear off your desk let's see your mouse space it's kind of clear i'm just like i don't know i'm a little paranoid uh i see a guy 25 he's at the other shacks up ahead running down the hill towards us okay halfway down the hill oh my goodness he has a teammate somewhere oh yeah oh heard it any chance he can get a visual on him is he outside his own right now no he's inside he's in a white outfit just edges zone behind two trees i see him i missed missed again i think he knows that i'm meeting him that was a good nade too yeah he just uh fell back oh no we're being third partied yeah they're 260. i'll leave a long way to go for zone please don't kill us please don't kill us oh yeah this is the chunker oh no yeah this one's gonna hurt ryan yeah i'm dead yeah this part i can't help you with oh frick this zone is moving already oh that's awful oh yeah you just saw a guy on that rock which one across the road to your right probably want to get a healing comms get calms how many got i got five left we're good [Music] yeah shoot that guy not me perfect we love that oh he did see him oh i'm on fire dude i'm dead last take he probably has another gamer ah that's the big bang right there fourth place that was actually a walking pharmacy holy crap that dinosaur just scared me get him yeah i don't know if that's those were bots or not but i mean if they're just sitting over here shooting i'm assuming they are charlie potts those guys uphill uh north fire close 355 tip oh yeah i use the tip of the iceberg the other one made it further left i think i do fit that guy um the other one's behind that rock right there i keep forgetting i can just ping yep oh what the hell i'm getting shot at from behind what is going on here brother just emergency pickup oh no no well i'm in the shack how's it going buddy uh yes but i'm not a streamer oh you're your buddy dinosaur's taking me to his lair have mercy you shot at us is it a panzer yeah that's a panzer um i don't know what to do uh yeah i don't know either i'm just gonna bandage up here and hope for the best he killed the guy downed okay what we need to do is we need to get ah frick we need to clear this teammate out yep oh he's lovely prone right here at this garbage can um you don't see that very often what's the heck do you need meds yeah yeah grab everything quick um i'm gonna drop the emergency and then we gotta dip right yeah he's pushing unless that was me oh he's there knocked him oh my game is freezing pushing right i got him we're good nice do you take this uh yeah i just took a flare gun too we'll get a couple seconds here i'm coming don't leave not got much time i'm in oh we have a little time has ever seen a flying dinosaur before now i look amazing [Music] wouldn't call it in now why not that's loud yeah that's really loud kind of central zone so this might draw attention more than we would like i can't why did it go all the way over there i don't know did he shoot it straight in the air yeah there's a gilly he already took it knocked one up ahead of us five damn that sucks yeah okay these guys are dead nice good shots these have sucks we just gave up the freak package ah that's terrible okay well killed the ghillie got the drop after all aruna's three best my bad that had to be done zone's coming be like that rock yep he's moving from left to right yeah just gonna paint killer ones that's my boy he was lining someone else up do you know which way he was looking he's looking straight west okay yeah see if we can finish these guys off i think he's in the smoke there [Applause] yep i missed this twice big rock downhill from us that was a perfect nade there's no way that guy's alive i'm gonna cook that one there go nice use instant bar window long building it farther window right oh he's a quick beaker [Applause]  him nice we have we've zoned dude the only thing is we have to be careful the team uphill to the right um i'm gonna play hill i feel like he can hit that shot healing oh crap i'm gonna have to move in flanking left yeah no we both brought him this shot was just faster than mine no man they just got the freest game ever oh that was such a good game too like i'm happy but i'm also so sad that we lost like that i saw the guy pushing and then yeah i just had the wrong gun out and peaked the same angle frequently he's just a little bit faster on that shot nice try you
