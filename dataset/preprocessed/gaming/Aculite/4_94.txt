pursuit so well everybody else has been pretty much playing call of duty far zone paired with another og for the uh medium the long range i've been trying this ak with the rockets still because i've been wanting to level it up a little bit more and uh so far the recoil reduction you can get on is not bad even at range it seems like the damage falloff is not too bad either so as like an off meta weapon i'm kind of liking it but i gotta level it up a little bit more to test test like all the attachments out but that is not what i was focused on today i uh paired up with stone mountain and i tried i keep getting the comments about trying to use a crossbow so i put myself through hell i did my very best i pulled it out when i felt like i was able to actually use it at a medium decent range if you're interested this is what i was using on mine and i'll also show the ak here in a second once again as usual i have no idea if these are the best attachments but this is kind of just what i throw on my weapons and then i test them out for a little bit maybe they work maybe they don't and then i change things up from there hope you guys really enjoy the video it takes it takes a lot out of me to try to go up against the meta type stuff in in war zone when you got these slide canceling 360 no scoping professional players on the opposing teams and then of course i'm trying to use a freaking crossbow i don't know what i'm doing anyways i really do hope you guys enjoy leave a like if you did i'll catch you guys in the next one just climbing up the ladder you must have resin oh i
