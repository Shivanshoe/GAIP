from the vehicle all right i'll follow you just on green jeep on the left yep oh it's not me position yeah i guess we traded or something i don't know still someone handling i don't like this position honestly yeah it's awful i see we go up the hill we didn't have a choice though because yeah i'm gonna get we could go back to quarry and then up the hill these guys look fairly pushed up so i got a halo up there i just lose all momentum in the vehicle all right swap seats yeah okay we could go even farther for us i think there's a way you can get up here right yeah right here we even got a guy

they're coming out inside down that close guy nice background [Applause] [Music] stupid stuff like that i tried trading for you as fast as i could no dude it's because we fought the guys on the rocks early and i spent so long trying to get my old gear back that was messed up i had like five ten bullets in my gun um if we can no i was gonna say if we could go to the buy station but that'd be a little risky i'm just trying to make sure that there's nobody beneath us here nice shot he just ran someone over with the truck he's coming up in the truck yep we're missing a player jack okay i guess he's just down here somewhere relocating could he be underneath he could very well be underneath my rock here you want me to check um maybe you can just hold your side if you want yes he is he's there
