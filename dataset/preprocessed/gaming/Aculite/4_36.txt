[Music] exactly five seconds it's already said they're just a bunch of bots fill your mouth with so much air before you say that so um this mode is like basically a rebirth oh okay uh on verdansk but there's also special contracts that will give you like uh a custom loadout at the end of it a custom loadout like and c4 drones yeah like uh you know loadout marker and it gives you c4 drones which you could drive i've already done two triple kills with it freaking dragon they're awesome that's mental is that gonna be a new thing hopefully not because this is pretty insane no they've been in plunder they've been in some of the other uh modes as well in the past all right so we landed here actually right incoming bombers bombers inbound i was there right on my marcus hashtag i was there wasn't it down that one stone what did you want to do that's where it lands no no no it lands over here lands on blue oh sorry are we redirecting yeah yeah it's gonna land right there it goes oh how did you know predictions i'm a big brain as they say your brain's huge my brain's massive bro wait how did mg off the bat got in the shack yep he's running all right i'm not about you spawning with a cell phone oh what yeah it's just like and then you come back because it's resurgence it's like rebirth resurgence right this is insane already oh i got a loadout marker already oh it's a mission you got a load of mercury get a little coming in the bottom red second floor red are you acolyte oh no i just dropped load out towards you guys track them want a gas station too knock them there's two there actually they're going a little further i think assault yeah gas station yes just like that one of our last i love it i've been playing with so much battlefield i've just like immediately dropped the shield when you went down oh yeah you get your irish yeah i keep playing yeah keep playing iris uh yeah so when you complete that um contract that playing crash contract it gives you a loadout okay they just took the drone good was whatever of all the chances this guy happens to look this way yep there's still going to be a guy behind there's another one behind me on green yep did you knock blue knock the blue yup gotta be suffering re-knocked him good knock got your finish nice none yeah this is the uh because the third con the third step of the contract always takes you to all the guys here yeah and everybody this seems to be the most popular one that it sends everybody to are you ready get ready one of them i want to jump out here jumping out here we go looks like they're in it one guy's up with the shack on green above us yeah that's parachute bro gonna play it up i think one more paint underneath there's one down here back to left it looks like i think he's a head somewhere maybe right oh this guy now he's up how do you blow it oh detonate like that oh yeah they're all up there now they're up the zips they might jump down and panic if they're fighting or do we zip up them zip them up you want me to go from the other end no they're definitely up there they're just circling i don't know how many there are is a problem we might just be zipping to our death because we have the animations hold up i can see yeah i can rock at the top no it's i think it's a terrible idea i have two grenades though like if you wanted to rock it and then i could before i'm gonna send it to them okay they gotta well now they know we're here had to be done i'm going i'm going all right i heard another one right here truck outside there's too much crap here what's happening in the bunker guys what are we looking for oh you already looted it ah yeah you literally didn't uh the other side of the bunker as well he was cracked and one was on our level right behind the shack there behind the shack hp get out that wasn't you stone oh no oh he just jacked my car oh he's down nice nice nice nice nice watch out it's gonna blow the truck's gonna blow yeah no no no no no from across the hill no i found him i'm gonna start by racing uh i've got you history thank you all right do we want that second loadout or do we want to farm this guy's lower he's going to be over here over here try drawing him no there's a guy right here he's close to the wall he's [Music] he's too fast never mind i'm just better of course all right let's go get the loadout then um so it's gonna end it's gonna end in the got your finish it's gonna end in this bunker again wait the guy that i just knocked yeah yeah yeah oh you're insane of course i am of course what do we got up ahead here we already got teams fully bunkered in on the uh buildings there as well they hunkered down they're already hunkered down the graveyard behind it yeah we're gonna have to cut off we're gonna just hold the graveyard side [Music] here we go now everyone's going to rush in what happened last night oh man it's like a domination one list nobody goes in these guys are coming over from the left with my snipe on the first one hit the bat guy he ran behind blue building there he's going to try and cut the zone yeah they're capping this challenging this shoot there are they are capping it hopefully another team can test it team up in the hill to your left [Music] like the far left one dude i don't even think that we're gonna be able to win someone's down there now no they're not don't nobody contested at this game they had a wall down there too so how did they did they know it was going to end there yeah it's always heads in a bunker okay i know where they are so we have to hunker down in the bunker bunker in the bunker it's either that that seemed like being the play for them i don't think i'm gonna make it that far you can't go for the vehicle and run them over if you're super quick don't you grab the view before anybody oh acolyte sorry i used to ambient heal yeah i know right i'm always used to being yellow he's on my vehicle [Music] yeah if you buy from the station it's 25k i feel like they should always be having an event or something like this going well there's even more events in the next map oh guys pushing us from the shack here i thought i saw something left side where was his team did you get the ping pong uh 337 right there oh it's one of the guy that sees and like gets him up yeah it's only whoever kills him oh i didn't even know that he's coming back knocked one there's still more in the car nice down in the house two guys get the guy under me i don't think so oh yeah i did oh i thought i heard something i think we go left side whatever is safer a little risky [Music] like popping in there's definitely people here oh bombing yeah yeah yep there's lots of people here there's tons of people here do we want to just push trailers they know they know that was crazy yeah i didn't even get in there yet i hopped out earlier there's so many pings holy [ __ ] man i don't even know what to shoot at oh hi i'll show you bought that for you thank you one guy buy a station from that guy's teammate keep to the safe zone and get ready for incoming i feel like there's gonna be a team behind me oh [ __ ] the guy here hit him once oh got him there's one at bye yeah got behind me we just gotta hold them out and shoot the parachutes are we sure that guy isn't already in the bunker oh i hit him once but not twice okay maybe it was two i'm so bad no dude i don't have any ammo so i had to try to snipe what a bomb he missed he missed you a lot of course did you find somebody's son there's one in the next trailer over he's inside it i think there might be two in there do you want a bait i'm trying to find some guns out here ready one behind me in the corner knocked a close one i'm gonna get reset the other one was broken outside this guy's not sell frozen take your time there you go all done no that was not well done okay another vehicle coming over here i mean we're all alive it's well done i'll take it we need that deployable wolf later yeah yeah yeah in here in here ready to reload another one out in the field there i could just heard his younger brother yelling at him it's my turn now you died we're exposed anytime oh no that was a bad sign they're fighting broke bro there's one to the left too down left down right finish one hold on we're gonna have to have like one at the other side and maybe two at the zip well i don't i don't know if it's gonna end at this one i think it might end at the other one oh it's gonna end at the end oh yeah no it's not ending at this one we gotta go now bomb drone here i'm gonna take it if you wanna take the precision we do have enough for loadout should we buy that real quick get perks yeah i think so this guy right here oh [ __ ] dude soggy wiener got me i didn't even see him you gotta watch out for those soggy wieners man i know i thought i would have seen him but i i just saw him at the last second wiener took me out um where's the other one come on 10 seconds just call the loadout if you can yeah let's get the load out of here and then we go we got to take the bumper this one you can't jump down the sip you have to sit down so let's do the other side oh [ __ ] oh no i'm all around this dude two different teams even dude how is he seeing me [Applause] [Music] i thought i could wrap around here it's apparently 20 miles long this is going to be rough i'm going to sit in this pile of loot and hope that no one sees me in a second wait a guy that comes towards us i down the guy up with the shack by the way i see him knock him against your left lit nice nice don't know about that other team yeah they're coming down inside someone knocked him fine fine he's done me one more far out he's broken there's not a lot of teams left here actually there's we didn't kill that guy he's right below us two got him hey that's rude all the way over here too all right where's the uh this is we're gonna have to push the bunker yeah that's the entrance screen mark is the way we want in the zip line we're not getting in zip line that's just not happening i have two stun grenades we could but if we go up against controller players then we will die yeah or we could go down the zip on the right that's what we're trying to avoid but they're capping i'm in go go go go oh we've got plenty of time played slow play slow [Music] one behind the box there stunning one then we need to hold both ends it says under enemy control we got to neutralize it and then start to cap it i'll watch the flank where we came down i'll watch the other one okay i'll watch what's down here there's no way anybody's getting through over here i got this one locked down do you want me to just oh i gotta stand on huh yeah just stand on it okay here we go here we go we're getting it a truck just
