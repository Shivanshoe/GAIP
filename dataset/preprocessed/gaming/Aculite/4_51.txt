slayer surprised so i was very fortunate enough to get an invite to the technical test for multiplayer on halo infinite game has not yet been released but i assume they're releasing every little bit at a time for people to try out and i can tell you right now the grav hammer is still as good as what it used to be or at least from what you remember now having first hands on this game i can tell you that it's shaping up very nicely the last time i played halo was the master chief collection that they remastered for pc and even though that was fantastic to play it didn't feel new and updated for a modern title and if you're wondering sniping still feels just as satisfying as it did back in the day when you used to get home after school setting up a lan party with your friends sniping them in the head and then looking over their screen to figure out where they spawned to do it again i don't think anything will ever live up to those days those are memories to always be fond of but the sniping does feel good it feels exactly what you would expect from halo so with this being my very first time with hands on the game there was a lot that i didn't know such as the sliding you were able to sprint i didn't use that all that much there's a couple new weapons that i've never seen before but overall i think they're just trying to get a balance for the game figured out as well as making sure that everything runs nice and smoothly before the next test which will be bigger modes and bigger maps so unfortunately not everyone got an invite to the technical test but luckily my friend stone mountain 64 did get an invite so we were messing around in the 4v4 slayer mode just testing out the game enjoying it talking about it giving some call outs but anyways i'll leave you guys with the gameplay footage hope you enjoy please leave a like if you do and i'll get you guys in the next one i think it auto unaims down sights you when you get hit for the sniper yes it was always been that way yeah yeah yeah it's just i never really laid it off keyboard it's outside of the time we played it together okay i need to change my key lines for sure oh shoot yeah that was so close man oh shoot oh come on that hits me i'm killing it i'm almost killing myself too i did that actually i picked up an rpg earlier and got a couple kills that was kind of nice and we got sticky grenades and everything yeah [Music] frag out oh yeah right i'm not i feel like i'm not used to the fact that they're sprinting in this too oh right yeah it's not my instinct to sprint for some reason oh my god shotgun's op the automatic shotgun did you get that one yeah i do i don't know if there's another one or not oh behind us we bunted each other oh we love that it brings back memories [Music] oh yeah the plasma pistol man charges up one shot somebody with melee afterwards break shields bringing it back yup still works oh what is this i kind of like that thing that's fun it's a decent little rifle the guy with a shotgun oh man we lost that we're doing so well though not too bad not too bad not bad for the first game swapping settings dude that door just got like cs go vibes on that door yeah that's what this map reminds me you know what i'm saying yeah yeah yeah dust too yeah yeah yeah exactly thank you for pointing that out give me vibes right now it's like i like this map i'm not really sure why yeah it does too that's why have you tried this gun down here i literally just turned that guy into confetti here check it out check it out so if you right click i think it's right click oh yeah you can toggle it between like shotgun mode and long range mode and vertical but it happens down here it takes yeah this is the spawn down here it takes a little while to like the distance and it bounces off stuff ricochet yeah oh my gosh love it yeah it's selfies because you don't see it all the time right so that's that's why it's okay i feel like yeah well that's just like the halo thing is like the weapons are rbsop like that's the point of them mm-hmm you get the pat they are power weapons like you got to go risk it to get them or did you see like the clips of people grappling hook or shoot throwing grenades to launch the thing to them uh like when the rocket launcher spawns you can throw a a sticky behind it and then when the sticky blows up the rocket launcher will launch in the air in whatever direction so you can launch it to you okay that i didn't know yeah and if you get the grappling hook you could just pull it with a grappling hook okay it's so sick power weapons it's just bs man [Music] i'm just i'm just hard camping all the rifles dude i just keep going getting these rifles it's so good it's so good just pressuring these guys from so far away even if i don't get the kill i'm getting so many more assists because i'm just damaging everybody and softening them up do i have to hold this grappling hook i don't know what room that is it's a downside to sprinting because then you get caught out yeah that's true don't [Music] oh another one right under me in the courtyard got him tagged up under me oh my god i'm over the map there's a guy up top here with me very low no armor some kill them perfect one in the alley below you careful oh big heady i think this guy went out cop antenna [Music] ow guys on me power item up into the rpg up in one no sniper no he's got the shotgun man and antenna rooms i got big oh my gosh out of my mind okay found the rpg guy um it's like a neck and neck tie game right now off the rack off the wreck we're up by three now my friend got the kill baby here we go got one shot left as you kill that guy i almost got myself at the same time under me oh this guy over there i mark it okay right underneath you one below you as well there i'm gonna try and flank the guy market i'm getting ruined by nades he's right here [Music] no right under use hurt very bad in the corner right below you nice you
