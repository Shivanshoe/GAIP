he's going up the step he's going up the zip two two yes i just killed him before he hit the ground oh my god i'm clustering the top i'm so sorry i'm not gonna go tea bag yeah go tea bag give him a few we have like 18 teams coming here 18 teams just yeah what he said well there's a guy that came around the corner dead eat on me i think dude how am i dying so fast this is insane little head shots what that was there was one team on second he's just sitting upstairs in the corner let's do this man i'm telling you i think we might want to play trios people don't move i might be down and i [ __ ] died oh he's amazing so freaking good i'm going where i belong the salty mines salty mines all right there we go i wonder if he knows that i'm here no idea i got daddy to pop let's see oh my goodness dude he just killed himself with his own thermite i thought that's what i thought that was your thermite for a second midairy went to throw it he hit the corner oh snit yeah dude these people are just yeah i think you're right it's like duo's is almost like solos because it's solos with one extra person that's all it is they just rat so hard that it's like i don't know i think you're right i think we just go to trios we will have better games in trios or even quads than we do in duos that's why i don't even bother with solos anymore at least if there's two of them they're not just gonna sit in a corner yeah but once you're last alive it's like of course you're gonna do that i don't i'm not you know yeah i don't blame them i get it yeah i don't blame them just kind of how it's played yeah no way we're killing this guy camping in big red yeah he's gonna be big right yep i don't think he's gonna move either he's just gonna hold that forever yeah i think you could probably pair wait we might be able to parachute over from here no onto top big red yeah if we do the sideways i think we probably probably could oh wait but we got i want to try it yeah i want to try the parachute all right screw it let's do it bro let's do it send it i screwed up my jump that's okay we can do it 100 i went a little low i'm not so sure you got it though keep on pace oh i just made it [ __ ] diddy i don't got it all you be advised uav rtv for resupply so you two of them oh my god it worked oh my god it worked oh man snapped away get it up on instagram my guy they were literally both like this stone holding this angle oh yeah i mean how do you would you ever expect them to come on the roof yeah yeah we'd love to see that i think that guy's back the one i sniped i think i just saw him there i think you're right uav entering the ao you just throw away his truck a couple guys north too you're buying uavs yep i like it enemy uav overhead that's all i got there's a like a millionaire i bought an airstrike by accident uav entering the ao but if he kills us he's gonna get so many free uavs here uav injury that's not [Applause] or something oh down below how did i armor them then this guy self that guy sell i think i still talk you did not just precision good precision good precision play our vehicles are gone never mind these are the people that are always in chat saying use the precision use the precision you know we're in a building use the precision dude you got to use it it'll save you they don't use it you lose it it doesn't i mean you will thought it was good it's not gonna ain't gonna do anything bro i love that you can both go up at the same time it's great yeah it's nice especially for long ones like this oh shoot it's them is it them it's them dude hit him hit should we cluster it and then fly over yeah yeah yeah i can precision you cluster and we fly i'm totally done ready dude okay hold on and [Applause] hell yeah just don't kill yourself you're clustered that ends perfectly i hear him one on heart i'm gonna be on heart i don't have ghost me too wait i have you guys you think hey no i was done i have a trophy that missed me how cause i trophied oh stunning stunning again that's a good this guy hit two more claymores jesus dude not many throwables i don't know if this is the guy who parachuted in though another one in the back house there he's knocked this is probably his boy station dude what is going on there's a guy in that check someone drove off in the vehicle next to us one's on blue there cracked he's running back he's knocked should have shot me rather than ran you know this is the strangest game take this guy there's a hacker wait he's an ironside car 98 oh yeah he immediately knocked me okay okay oh my god from where no banned a hundred thousand accounts by the way yeah you guys they just banned a hundred thousand counts right yeah coincidentally there was a hundred thousand accounts also made the same day they it seems like they missed one unfortunately yeah i don't know how that happened welcome to another episode of [Applause] cracked this man's on a nice 20 bomb hit an insane double on us here seems like he's pretty crazy he's even bought skins well here's the thing he's got damascus he's level 16. my guess is that he has some type of hack that unlocks everything for him it's a claymore though oh my god almost coming around the corner for a nice second team back to back look at that i see i see nothing i see that if you squint really hard there just to the point where your eyes were closed i seen the guy this could be 8k gameplay we're watching right now controller gamer is this just aim assist yeah dude is that what ames does actually oh my god this look at his teammate his teammates afk bro no he's not he's not anymore oh my god dude no way in this episode of hector this guy's playing the zone right now his teammates on a freaking 20 they're the last there's 2v2 right now it's 2v2 he doesn't even have a kill he's going for the zone he's crazy yeah he's playing dude he's crouching in the building he just won the game he just won the game dude what wait he's gotta be boosting wait oh there's still two more no way dude there's no way fun i'm gonna look this guy up this guy's got a 1.13 kd 64 dubs though bravo my guy okay maybe not maybe not this guy's legit dude he's just chilling he's just out gaming there's okay now it's 2v2 i misread it earlier now it's doing the truck oh no he's just going to snipe him oh my god he did it stone dude is mike gonna clutch this game i don't know no mike's not winning there's no way dude he and mike's a 1.1 kd god right now though could he clutch i feel like he shouldn't do this might be the best thing i've ever seen a war zone i don't know like i want him to lose but wait he backed out he backed out you backed out of the game what i think he knew his teammate was cheating 100 percent he was being boosted i'm telling you i don't know man he might have random queued in and just being like you know what i don't deserve the dub and backed out no i don't believe it because if you're trying to get boosted you would want the win no yeah i suppose but i don't know maybe maybe because why would you lose if you want to win so we still you're going to get somebody to double i'm hovering i'm never oh we got it we got it we got it you [ __ ] ran over a hacker thank you you you killed the dude hacker a hero the truck is the anti-chief thank you thank you i love it i can't believe it the truck is the energy yeah because i don't think well the angle the truck was coming over the ridge at right like he couldn't head shot him he had no angle yeah i'm kind of confused why he left i mean yeah i think i'd do the same thing but like why stay the whole match that's what i'm trying to i'm trying to think about here why stay the whole match in order to leave right at the end if you're playing with the cheater and you know you're playing with a cheater and he's playing zone the way he was [Music] you
