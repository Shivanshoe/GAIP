[Applause] i feel really bad but if they when they go like they're gonna come back so then i'm gonna feel even worse wait there's only 60 people left oh yes find that on the roof above don't move don't move oh no no no i'm going to pop them with one shot in the head stopping power one's gone into the next hangar [Music] oh connor why'd you have to do exactly what you just said they were pretty good sports they're like oh come on like you know i'm sorry guys so if you haven't heard about this and i'm pretty sure everyone has at this point this is the dmr 14 and uh cold war weapon i'm pretty sure everybody's heard about this if i'm being completely honest it's actually come down to a point where if you're not using this weapon or you're not using the mac 10 up close or like one of those crazy shotguns i don't think the shotguns are that crazy now but uh if you're not using one of these weapons then you're put at such a disadvantage that you can't even compete with anybody in the game right now at least the lobbies that i get into i don't know i don't know how it is for everybody else but if you are interested this is what i'm using on it a lot of people uh tend to use the 3x i actually like the 2x better i just use the the very first 2x but uh i don't know something about like the recoil to it i just prefer having a little bit of a 2x because i like to spam it a little bit more and i was told not to use the very last barrel the longest because apparently the extra fire rate is better you guys will see in the video as you've already seen a little bit but if you want to copy the loadout this is what i'm using and this is my mac 10. both are just insane weapons they just shred through people so fast the uh the time to kill on these right now just makes war zone like instant you just don't even have a chance to respond but uh yeah anyways hope you guys had a fantastic christmas stay safe and enjoy the rest of the video oh they're taking a buggy they're at the buy station with the buggy [Applause] sorry guy dude i really am sorry poor guy turns around he's plating he's oh no i see death oh no did he react to you no no why are you killing oh i see right at the vehicle nothing we don't know where his team is he's getting shot from this way oh recon drone up what um no one in those buildings oh there are two three two here and one trio's right relax yeah yeah so they're all in there oh one below you on that thing maneuvering where's he coming coming up or staying at the bottom i can't tell now i'm out of the drone yep coming up [Applause] oh my god didn't sound like it was that weapon mark oh no the mtmr i guess you shot him one in the head one in the chest close fight we're clear well if he doesn't have himself he's dead [Applause] acknowledge big points he's got to go get him doesn't he on blue yeah let's next staircase over damn popping diddy one down got one upper here okay it's up clear in here okay does everyone have a ghost there [Applause] i'm good follow up can't see him anymore uh fighting in there okay armor no place no place uh there's down the left side of the forest here oh come on adjacent red roof uh the one we were previously at east to your building oh my god tom yes the one the one previously yikes feels bad uh yeah he's rest on the boy so spammable always disgusting enemy soldier incoming bigress how are you being shot from that was me was being shot fun i got him i don't know where the teammate is oh [ __ ] what's up is there a guy in there yes oh maybe that was the teammate he bought him no tommy boy that's horrible broke his bites behind the bed [Applause] i dropped into the ladder hole and i was just face to face with him mccann i had to run for my damn life and yeah you were you're only your only idea right into the background yeah i thought i was dropped like the toilet is still in the sink and he ran past me oh there's guys up on this roof oh we could send they're you a guy here man everybody has ghosts they gotta do something with ghosts don't know it's just like everyone has it oh god he saw me there's also one in the car dealership behind me no yeah 100 his teammates are on me what it's up to you a split dude i got the teammate it's a shame legit can't catch a break man oh no we have to go okay question is did he parachute off already no no you're sort of beaming the guy from rooftop still doing an outlook on uav oh yeah that guy just made himself a yeah it's pretty messed up it's pretty messed up man warzone's gonna be that's what i said like you're gonna have to give it a week they probably won't change it for a week look nobody's on beat why do i even use this thing anymore um come on oh no oh okay is he rezzing oh why is he spending so much time in the gas [Music] need my tommy back you crazy i don't even know what i can do [Music] there's a guy in this building here i just killed a guy outside [Applause] yeah there's one outside here i don't even get it last time oh god oh god oh no this is how it ends just like this i never got like 30 seconds on the ground yeah this is a rough match for you i had the worst game i literally can't do it i mean you literally did all you could you res me are the only opportunities you could and it was just the case of really bad timing on my part dmr is fair i think it could actually use a little bit of buff to the recoil maybe some more damage range but overall it's not bad i'd use it again i don't know if this is a good idea but i'm fully down on sending it that's a terrible idea [Applause] oh thank god broke one left one hp i'm dead left them on no hp i think it's been assassinated wait what oh my god oh god oh my god there's people from everywhere [Applause] are you feeling the game today or no yeah i feel like i can get into it you know the games just don't go as they are so you want me to try harder is that what you're saying no because like we're just not you know what the flow of the matches have been like so far just what it is with duos and solos all right i guess we're turning up hold on let me get the spray bottle okay now i got all the sweat on me nice oh you have to spray the sweat onto you absolutely okay otherwise i'm just too i'm too calm i just don't generally sweat by the liter or yeah like if you were to get milk would it be a gallon or uh no we go by leaders leaders okay good you're normal well i mean we do put our milk in bags so all right oh god oh god oh god shoot he's got the door and stuff already yep i bobbed and weaved and that didn't even matter [Applause] [Applause] um maybe it was shooting really slow though yeah look like unless there's some sort of fire rate build where you could have a fire rate attachment maybe okay somehow we actually are alive you and by we i mean me and by me i mean what he doing what is he doing oh he's in hall oh oh oh oh oh come on boop on the right side of it don't do this to me on the left wait right left now the right left fair and balanced weapon well i mean he doesn't have this thing built right he's got the longest barrel and all that so i can't just scramble yeah there's a team in on me you've got to be kidding me no mate not like these oh no it's okay i can buy you back we'll have to wait for a little bit though can you all stop killing off my teammates about that flow of the match it's me one of those days isn't it every time i spawn in i can't land anywhere without there being a full team no no no it'll be fine actually wait oh god we have to go we do oh we do [Applause] get out of your bunker i showed footsteps i hope you have a merry christmas damn dude christmas showdown how are you standing on this time to grab some goodies in there if they left anything for us right here right here broken one oh god [Applause] can you crawl around no no stay there [Music] [Applause] nice oh this guy built it terribly this guy's at the buy the voice over for that just said michael maybe they were originally snipers okay never mind nice that's uh it's very balanced i think oh he's still there still there pepper me on your v pepper and lip view how's the gun broke them picking right this guy built it terribly what is this one does this guy know see if he knows oh i think he knows i think this is the one sound a place on the other we're about to revive him what if i told you i can hit him i'd love you but you don't already forever oh holy guy in the middle of the airfield right here he's looking around i don't know he was uh left left building here left building here he's in it isn't it i don't know if i can pen this if you have the gun then yeah like he's close left i didn't know what he had i didn't know what he had so i didn't want to risk it uh i think i had the m4 yeah is it the cold one i don't like that gun it's not good there we go did you pick up the airstrike yes should i [Applause] do um or do you want to wait for the month on uh let's wait let's wait let's wait a little bit smarter wait you saw guys up there i think i saw guys yeah this was the satellite i can't really be sure i have 11 kills wow it's been a long game to be fair when did that happen though 16 minutes into recording i know we're good we're good yeah clear vehicle coming it's gone oh oh you got smart from uh fire station fire station be careful head down in the game shoot fire or pull one of the two well that guy re-peaked here like the guys in the vehicle yeah yeah i know but i definitely got sniped from behind down him again middle of the road here they're both should be one more oh my god so sweaty everyone's talking and everyone's just like pull on wait the only way to play now down number one teammate's beaming me in the graveyard i think his name is bob comet okay my turn he has the gun careful yes but i also have the gun ah the gun combats the gun the only way to win this game is to be sweaty and use meta weapons apparently so yes so sweaty tom broken oh no i can come up no i can't get down you're dead no i didn't really get down give up give up your team finish quick job no my loadout's been swallowed yep oh my god dude he's in the tower and one on his secondary roof a little bit of a bad spawn here tower is one hp i'm gonna go in second well done hey he's sweaty i like it i'm gonna turn it on now yep i don't have a loadout so i needed one of those it's too late in the game wait did you head shot him are you cheating again i'm proud of both of them why do i play with this guy big link oh yeah um stone's driving it i think [Music] yeah and they've gone this guy's got like a nacho hanging off there's a charm oh yeah it's like a dorito maybe that's great oh god his teammate's in on the inside is he pushing nope on yellow i'm in cover i'm on the fire frag out [Applause] okay i got daddy finish yourself broke him oh my god no way i cannot compete with the mac 10's rate of fire this ak holy that was the one thing i was really afraid of that he was gonna do yeah and he did it and he made the right play he just didn't finish the like he did he did try but then you started bursting him right yes i broke his plate it's right as he repeats one down roof the guy's gonna immediately raise his teammate you pan that no i was trying you were telling me that this thing has good good penetration yeah speaking again ah this is going to be a weird one it's trying to jump shot us or a camera one contact i think one of us should try one left oh to left to left broke that guy i think he downed him i think he downed him his last two teams i never got the cut oh blow them blow them in a safe spot okay that was the teammate and he dropped down i don't know that was definitely a teammate because the other team's on the left side somewhere he just got him off just killed him off supposed to be them yep 2v2 broke out yeah this is fair and balanced weapon wow that's the win we just had to sweat a little bit you know i had to get bring out the spray bottle pick up the dmr the mac 10. i just have to not fight anyone with a mac 10 because i just can't compete actually ggs boys hello oh it's him that's crazy what the [ __ ] i never thought i'd never thought i'd uh talk to one at the end good game gg guys holy [ __ ] this meta is terrible that's brutal you guys you guys killed me on the car like at the fire fire station oh
