there's a way stay alert [Music] yes lots of death in this one as you can see this is hood outlaws and legends and a big thank you to focus home interactive for sponsoring this video there will be a link in the description below if you want to check out the game for yourself i maxed out the graphics on pc and a game looks absolutely gorgeous honestly especially when you get to start in that open field map i'm not really sure what it's called but you get to start when the sun's rising or the sun's setting and get to take out like all the guards and stealth or at least try to most of the time i swear i'm partnered up with beginners and nobody knows what's going on it's a it's a good time it's a good time definitely some good laughs when they try to attack the sheriff because apparently they weren't paying attention to the tutorial and they didn't realize that he will quite literally pick you up and stomp on you he's the guy that i stole the key from in the intro if you guys were paying attention so you have to be sneaky pick up the key from him once you get the key you want to locate the vault room and then you want to steal the chest all the while an enemy team is trying to do the exact same thing so you have two teams of four and the game is pvp ve so once you get the chest you want to run to the extract zone with your teammates and use a winch system that can have up to two players on it and it takes quite a bit of time but it's one of my favorite parts because that's where a lot of the pvp happens and either team can win at that point as long as they extract it so i'll leave you guys with a solo match now please leave a like if you guys enjoyed the video check out the game in the link in the description below i'll catch you guys in the next one crossbowman here let's see if we can do this a little bit more sneaky this time i'll put this to good use the forest sends its regards god here i love that sunrise looks great [Music] so from my knowledge at least the last couple times that i played on this map i think i need help i think he needs help i don't really like to waste my arrows early on because i don't really know where all the chests are right now where i can pick up more but uh the sheriff should be in one of three places so see down the bridge or in this castle area here yeah i suppose he can be on the other side oh here we go tomorrow's written that's what i needed so we gotta find him first and they got the key quick must do it on their side oh he used assault there we go ty's the monk guy he can heal and heals teammates got one more damn i hit him up her chest wait that's my teammate oh mike look i came out of nowhere the crouching in this oh man you're so sneaky [Music] you just shot at me somebody shot me right in my head okay we have the key let's capture this point now so we can spawn here at least looks like somebody shot me in my head i don't know if there's that guy down below though no okay it was not teammate sees him oh he's up on the wall it's okay though because we have the key the states are alerted and they just messed up so when the towers get alerted or when the areas get alerted the big doors close so you can't just sneak underneath them and the only way you can open those is with the john the uh the barbarian looking guy the bigger guy with the hammer kick that down just for later for the people so i don't know this area oh he found it it's up top he should have saved his grenade he didn't need to he didn't need to use it okay i'll let him carry it he's a bigger guy get to the extraction point we fill up on ammo and stuff i assume we probably want to drag it towards our main spawn i think that'd be best oh if we die we can we can always spawn there wait for him to stand still there we go nice clean oh my god he's moving john's moving damn quick states are aware it's so tough to leave oh no he snuck up behind me oh man this guy is so sneaky always dying to this guy chest isn't too far we almost have it all the way there's no way that that shot just landed the only way i could do that is because the arrows are down oh god get away from me john i'm dead i'm dead i got him with my ultimate though it was worth it this is it final push he bit off more than he could do i need arrows the air is so bad gonna be careful my stamina as well if i run out when i'm trying to dodge people then i'm gonna be still coming in tough situation oops we blocked that oh teammates got him there we go marianne with the stealth attack and his grenades are so annoying they persist for so long they drain your stamina too this is it we can do it the home stretch as our teammates guard us come on shoot protect them out i have no stamina that grenade man i think that's it we might have just lost oh no they're using the winch right now yep that's it god we were so close that was a solid match we were so close though i wonder if i just stayed on it if i would have uh if we would have been able to do it i don't know god what a crazy match you
