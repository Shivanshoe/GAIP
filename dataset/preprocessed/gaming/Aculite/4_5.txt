it's too tough it's just too tough to hit a little bird i lied it's so easy it's never been easier come on give me this there it is there's like nothing more satisfying knitting those i don't know why [Music] all right let's test and see how the new map is excuse me no fly zone okay i love how we just have like excessive zip lines like they're just enormous meanwhile everyone's just gonna be playing sundance we can do this we simply just need to flank we just simply need to flank don't check a grenade please i need to live here man if it wasn't for that one guy that one guy turning around it's always the one no one has any idea i'm here this is how we win i actually quite enjoy this gun like this is just it's fun it's just a fun gun i don't know how we're gonna get this so far the map seems okay it seems like there's a few up top like let's take a look i got the it doesn't seem like you're going to get spawn camped as much as the other maps you can f1 and f2 are kind of side by side a little bit away from the middle middle ground of the fight like i think they thought this through when they were making this map because the downstairs you got c1 b1 and d1 which are all going to be like inside right and underground so it's going to be infantry only you could sit up on the cliff side snipe down on the guys down on e1 and e2 just first impressions really i mean it it might not play out as well as what i'm thinking but it looks good so far there's a guy at that cliff side over there where'd he go oh goodness oh god what did i get into get me out come on we hit these oh god worth it 100 worth it i think i killed him right out of cockpit dude like i didn't even blow up the heli just sniped him directly with the launcher can you get behind here oh is this nasty put a little spawn beacon i surprised nobody's doing that yet enemy forces control sector echoes where did you come from can you get oh there's a person right there i thought i was hearing something is it a spawn beacon yeah he was trying to he was trying to put down a spawn beacon so supposedly you can take this elevator i think this is the elevator looks like it anyways up to the top while being in a vehicle so you can take like tanks and stuff up to the top at least i think i'm under i yeah i don't think it would go down any further probably goes up for two perfect no idling turn engine off i really don't know how to do that to be honest uh nice look at that that's kind of cool you could get a tank down there but you got to be careful you could have just people waiting down there with c4s and stuff right damn he's fast going for another one there we go nice four man hell yeah damn it wait what the heck she's still alive my body's going all which ways okay um i think we need to be a little bit more aware of the surroundings i need to learn like where these people can sit it seems like there's a lot of ledges yeah so he's getting shot up from the right there's this guy over here traded it's worth it because no one's getting him up and no one's getting me up oh goodness gracious great balls of fire we're being murdered medic wait did we kill everyone oh this this character is gonna be so wild vehicle damage vehicle did [Music] i love that they brought the defibs back man it's phenomenal they should never stray from the defibs i think they're just iconic to battlefield and they make sense you have to be near somebody that's the only way that you can rest maybe we can sneak around here maybe there's some guys at the front they're losing this battle hold your territory i don't know if i'll be able to take this i'm gonna need more more members here but they can they spawn on it i forget i literally forget all of this yeah i don't think they can spawn here while somebody's capping it um i got 10 tickets left hold the line good work no patch we got another one you know what i i quite enjoy that map already i can tell it plays a lot better than all the other ones that they released it just seems it's well thought out damn he's most vehicles destroyed yeah i think well you know what a lot of people seem to be addicted to sundance still so no doubt that we're gonna have more variation i guess now that this character's in especially since flares can't stop the missiles and you can only do it from a certain distance right and you can technically just fly away from them if they're a good pilot that's pretty neat i do like that battlefield 2042 seems to be moving in the right direction you
