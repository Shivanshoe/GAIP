two there's a third actually wrapping around he's near the electronics store right under tagline under under yeah yeah i'm attacking it right now okay you should be flanking around i might have killed him he was on the sofas the red sofas i have a flashlight on i think i killed him nope my nade i'm under the escalator right now that's me by the escalator he can you why is that not you oh that's not yummy i can't hit him right now killed them i just missed like two easy shots this is me that's gonna be all the way down here yeah yeah how can i not shoot him through that dude i missed two shots

people get crazy and get here let's go level three this guy was 26 or psks yeah this guy was using no ass gas too i think they all wear did you leave any sks max no they didn't have any mags just ammo are you done looting this guy yeah go ahead and killers i can i can use that sure extract located that's a good run we live we live how long we've been here for like 10 minutes actually seven days now all right i gotta hit the drone down here we okay and you needed the satellites right uh that's down here to one of them ish yes yeah you had that signal question yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you just need to walk by you don't even have to mark it that's the next one after that locate first locate second yeah first one's uh is when i'm on the roof i think shoreline yep yep this one was so loud you want to go scout real quick sniper i don't know if the scav in that section right ahead of us [Music] it was a player he was like oh i know who got him might be more though oh one more no way it was just a bird flying boy i thought i saw nade getting tossed well that was the snipe that we heard yep sv but what was he shooting at though he was like a little four man he got it from a scav because it's like half durability oh what was he shooting at let me go die and find out i'll do my best to cover you thank you boss if you're here i just need to do a mission okay i'm all friendly wink wink maybe i shouldn't include the wink wink yeah that part might not be uh all that convincing wink wink oh he's got a head shot i'm not dead i hear the shots i see him he's like a hot rock over for me he pushed down to the road by the looks of it i see him i'm gonna try to hit him here is he down below or up top he's over the one rock over from you man that's not a hit like it's not really a rock it's just a little hill over here like the next hill over okay i'm pushing back in the forest i can't believe my helmet just saved me wow good stuff i'll shoot again just to kind of draw his attention that's probably i think it's the guy that dinked me earlier because he's suppressed well whatever ammo is using it's not that great apparently yeah he had me a couple of times too didn't go down loot the pcs up here real quick look out the windows dude he's dead nice he knew he knew exactly where i was oh what a bot that's crazy i was out of audible range too unless he's got like some sort of crazy headset i don't think he beats your headset no i'm in game two stance oh because it increases the range of which she can hear footsteps right just in case i'm gonna grenade it i'm running back across is that you yep running out from the cottages no that's not me that grenade was me but like i mean that shot nope i haven't shot i'm just sprinting out okay that's not good i'm on the bridge over the water now or working my way to you i gotta make sure nobody's trying to sneak a big rock or i'm exactly where i killed him you want me to shoot real fast yep i didn't hear it at all oh shoot okay i'm yeah i'm down where you were looking at him um beyond this rock though towards where we came from i heard a shot i don't know if it was at me or people fighting you know when i was pushing over that one guy the first guy we initially went after was down across the road i mean maybe it was a scav no no there's no way it's scav on the road he's definitely a player maybe yeah cool looking 8r nice m856a1 and i survived and i survived two what damn you can take his armor helmet if you want i think his helmet is this guy down to the blue fence offense yeah who's on the right side speaking all the way out or good i see him yeah okay nice i see him and then that gun is a slayer for this map oh yeah the site's real nice it's nice not bad at all it's cleaner than the voodoo i knew somebody else shot at me he's not that thick but another five seven i don't know if i like the scar man like it was definitely good during that fight but i feel like i just mean like the ergonomics on it is really rough yeah the idea sounds really it's it's ass i mean it's not ideal my my what a raid what a raid yeah this one's pretty obvious dude there's like a river running down here it's like a new area oh i got your scope whoops whoops got your skull lips that's okay all good [Music] you
