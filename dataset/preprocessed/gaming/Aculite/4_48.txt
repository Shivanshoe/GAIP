is oh wait we lost i thought we were doing so well i felt like i was i was in headshots there and there that's uh all right so this is world war three the game hopefully we never have to see this in real life that is just such a scary thought but i do like the idea of how they've named this because at least for me when you think about world war three you think about a modern version of the military as well as partially in the future as well and i think that's really the route that they've gone with this the last time i played this was probably in 2019 maybe even 2018. so the gameplay footage you're seeing now is from the veteran alpha test and i believe to even play in this or have access to it you had to have the game bought previous to when this test came out or became live and i must say it is shaping up nicely compared to back then when i initially played it it really felt like an early access game felt like they were just kind of getting their boots on the ground if you will and figuring out the direction that they wanted to go with assets and sound and all that type of stuff but my biggest gripe so far is not the tanks even though i i do agree they are way too strong from all the forums that i've read people seem to be uh a little frustrated with them and for good measure i do believe they're way too strong however that is not my biggest crime my biggest gripe so far is the sound design now i love the footsteps i love the fact that i can hear pretty much everything that's going on i've never had an issue with a footstep so far which seems to be a pretty big issue for a lot of games but that's not what it is at all it's the fact that i always felt like i had to turn down my volume and then back up at times the game becomes quite punchy and to give you a little bit of an idea of what i mean by that this is the sound of me driving on a quad just normally driving around there's no gunshots or anything going on and this is roughly the same volume as footsteps and then this is the peak level of explosions gunshots and everything else so as you can see there is a big difference so to save you your hearing i decided to edit the audio a little bit and put a limiter on it so it shouldn't be going over a specific volume when i play fps games i like to be able to hear explosions but i don't want to have the ringing in my ears afterwards now i didn't want this to come across as something extremely negative i just wanted to point out something that i noticed and i do believe it could easily be solved with just a little bit of tweaking here and there now i don't want to talk the entire time i do want to show you some live gameplay as well as maybe just talk about some first impressions as i'm playing along because i was pleasantly surprised at how far this game has come since i last played the models look updated the textures look great the lighting looks fantastic which seems to be a big issue in a lot of games if i'm playing a single player fps i don't mind the lighting to be extremely realistic where enemies can hide in corners and all that but when you're playing something multiplayer i want to be able to see what i'm shooting at so i'll leave you with the gameplay now i really do hope you guys enjoy as always please leave a like if you do that always helps me and i will catch you guys in the next one you think that's possible and probably not objective alpha one is under it we got him oh there's another guy down below as well [Music] i can't believe no one's shot me here i'm just sitting on top of a tank i missed him didn't miss him that time see the trick is not to scope in until you're ready to shoot because there is scope glint in this from what i've noticed see teammates got the right idea just prone in the back bipod up avoid the tanks at all costs hopefully they can take out the tank i think that's what they need the engineering kit nice well done we're whipping there we go maybe we'll swap to um maybe we'll swap to a gunner after this shoot where's that from right there bring out an m4 or something something we can charge in with somewhat i'd like to try out the ars again i can't be right he's got a head glitch i can't be left either oh okay that's an enemy tank enough for an airstrike i think i think this is an airstrike it's like a predator missile did i lose again are you kidding me right now like every time i hit it like a sick shot or something cool happens it's just the timing is impeccable and we just lose the game this isn't an active tank right [Music] those grenades are they're quite loud so the gunning feels pretty good i've kind of liking it what i've noticed about the recoil though is like much much like the movement it's very clunky i don't know if it's a bad clunky or not though did we get everyone on this objective no we did not we we definitely did not get everyone on the objective it's uh okay okay we captured the point careful teammate i really tried sorry i really did try couldn't save you when you get impede it really does really does emp wow i killed that guy really messes with your screen you can't see anything all your ui's messed up oh that recoil oh that recoil it's um i don't know how to explain it like normally normally recoil goes like up and down left and right but this one's like very jumpy when it does it after please move thank you but yeah it jumps around a lot after a few bullets [Music] yeah see like right there it was okay after those bullets though it's it's very punishing oh i took off his helmet too i had shotted him once it was really close good thing i proned i think we got both of them we got a we got a solid squad rolling out here see the cool thing about these objectives is they're linked so two of them are always linked at a time what was i saying earlier oh yeah i was talking about the link the linked objectives so let's get there too all right let me heal up for a moment the the objectives you kind of want to link them together there's generally too close by and then they link together so when one's being taken i don't know the exact reason why they link up but you always know where enemies can spawn then they're always going to be on the other one trying to recap it so you kind of want to rush both points rather than just the one gonna double bottom left of the mini map make sure there's nobody else here [Music] oh my mistake need ammo i think that's it was a good little flank the unexpected lead leg break didn't really help but uh i keep forgetting that there's tax sprint in this i don't know why like my fov is already my fov is kind of high so it appears like i'm running pretty fast already nice shot teammate with an rpg or something yo give me some gear i get the feeling that we're gonna lose this game this one as well i think that's gonna be three losses in a row looking at the point to the top the enemy team is pretty high up there he's also a high up there it's pretty much just a waiting game at this point we have half the points that they do so well anyways hope you guys enjoyed i think the game is shaping up nicely it's definitely come a long way for this test hopefully they can tune down the audio a little bit but overall i'm liking it i'm liking it you
