[Music] to my side fools [Music] and now life's torment is over well if you're ever looking for one of the hardest battle royales out there look no further this is it i'm fairly positive naraka bladepoint big thank you to them for sponsoring this video there's a couple things i want to go over first in the beginning it looks kind of like a hack and slash but that's just on the surface first couple games i found myself doing okay you know hack and slashing my way through enemies but as i found out going up against some players who've been playing this for a little bit longer that is not the case at all there was times where i'm pretty sure i didn't even touch the ground they comboed me so hard but personally i really enjoy games being especially multiplayer games being as tough like that as they are because then it forces you to learn so i set out and looked up a couple guides and all that stuff that essentially help myself be put on somewhat of an even playing field even though i still feel like i don't know what i'm doing so what is this game about well it is a battle royale it's focused on melee combat parkour heroes and abilities there's a bunch of character customization there's a ton of skins that you can go through they even have a bruce lee crossover so you can use nunchucks as bruce lee if you wanted and the game is playable on low end pcs so if at any point you guys are enjoying the gameplay please check out the link in the description below if you want to pick up the game for yourself it's 30 off currently until the 25th of february also with that there is a brand new season season 3 including a brand new battle pass as well as some extra skins and outfits because obviously if you look good you play good they've also added some new weapons as well as some new features to the game such as some new soul jades which is basically like perks that you pick up throughout the game you'll notice that later on in the video some of them are found to be really really cool one of them is basically like dead silence and it makes your footsteps quiet it's very rare but i guess we have dead silence in this game too so again link is in the description below if you guys are interested and you want to check out the game for yourself now initially my plan was to showcase some of the combos and stuff that you can do but i just don't feel like my experience is there yet but if you yourself an experienced player please leave something in the comments below to help new players like myself the biggest thing i've learned so far is to try to parry while people are doing their strong blue attack because it'll disarm them and then you can go for a counter attack one other cool thing i found out when i was watching and checking out a couple guides is this you can strong attack or do a charge up attack from a tree or hang it from a ledge something like that and create a lot of distance either between you and your enemy or to go and attack them it's a cool little trick i saw a couple guys used it on me before and i never expected it while i was trying to chase them down so i'm going to leave you with a full game now i managed to grab myself a duo who was hoping and praying that they were going to carry me and we actually had a very interesting game gonna be playing as the new character wu shen who you're seeing right now who is able to summon some darts to throw at people for his ability and then his ultimate he can teleport his entire team a short distance gonna be showcasing that gameplay now i really hope you guys enjoy thank you very much for watching and i will catch you in the next one i don't know where this guy wants to go did he ping somewhere oh he wants to follow me okay but i don't know what i'm doing are we live i do afk we're alive okay what do we got we got a great sword and a musket it looks like wait did he mark armor for me that is mine perfect thank you got a blue spear i still think i want to actually i don't know i do like the great zord spirit is really fun though because you can do stuff like that the great sword i don't think he travels far attack our enemies or i shall make you regret it coming the fight is over here you're more valuable dead charge up the great sword it's gonna rez no one knows never mind he knows gotta get out of here for a moment i don't like feeling voters there's another team here i need to get in there there's literally another team it was not to be this time yeah i think i'm dead the shadow will shortly begin to spread holes repaired i was actually at 1 hp get out that's chasing me i'm dead i'm so dead oh man he actually just chased me across the whole mine here i suppose this is a hot drop okay so we should be able to is there a fly there's a flower here the shadow thickens should we spawn here though i don't know if this is a good idea you only get one life of this i will never forget this kind of like a little sulfur is how could i run out who stand against it oh he died again i can grab some gear real fast i don't like feeling vulnerable this is just gonna be a never-ending battle here oh no yeah let them fight let them fight let them fight come on man just let me res him as long as i can get my hand on him here he will he'll never die it resets the counter a little bit holes repair dents pounded out oh no not him too i don't have anything to fight this if he grabs me with that hand he can slay me into the ground no he got me oh no holes repaired dents pounded out [Music] we got him oh my god we killed him can't believe it your assistance is noted that was so close that's quite the battle i don't feel like i did anything i don't like feeling vulnerable yeah we can get rid of these we only need two of those i think armor is always good grappling hooks is always great to have i think that one guy might have ran off kind of want my greatsword back if it's up here they're on us no attack our enemies or i shall make you regret it why do they challenge me caught him when he was trying to repair his sword what's he talking about soda soda poppin are you streams this guy's stream sniping fixed and fatal that literally ruins streams come on don't do that stuff yeah he's already dead but when we're fighting i'm not paying attention but you know where he drops and stuff like that's never do that never do that it ruins the experience it's like back in the day you used to be able to screen peak as people used to call it or whatever the power of cheese at my command i wish that that ultimate didn't take as long i guess it's useful though because i can you can also get vertical height with it what the heck attack our enemies or i shall make you regret it like the hunters become the hunted hey wait a minute nice grappler what a hungry thing tai chi rift oh god holes repaired dents pounded out that was really close i think he even grappled me there i feel more like my old self and now there it is torment is over him back down i feel more like myself perfect got a purple katana here what's bounce shell oh that's what was okay i was wondering what that was doing when i was shooting this thing it was bouncing off of walls i think we need to go this way the big old dragon's gonna get us the shadow will soon spread another annoyance down we're doing work i have marked the relevant armor keeps the world at bay what's nether step that your dashes can be performed repeated with less that's really good i guess i don't know what roll wind is it's this thing is like i don't know what half of this stuff does so just picking it up you know this should prove useful purify the souls of their film what is happening right now basically this is what it looks like when you don't know what you're doing i need to learn how to combo better i don't like nice good save good save chilling up real fast let my friend be healed oh i hit escape somehow now i feel like fatal i thought we won the game there for a moment i pressed escape instead of tab need to get more first oh the game's over he seems to be knowing knowing what he's doing because i really don't i've had a lot of fights this match kind of like in the dagger i might uh bring out the long story for the great sword the spirits were right a fine hall holy crap he knew immediately i don't like feeling vulnerable ah damn he double blocked us nice attack of course we won it's all part of the plan he caught me right as i was uh as i was trying to grapple him okay now we won now we win oh my god that took forever [Music] 24 000 damage almost 10 000 healing very interesting start to a game too wish i could chat to him you
