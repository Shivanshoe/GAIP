[Music] [Music] once again there's been another new update for warzone this time and they've even updated caldera to fit i guess more the atmosphere of king kong vs godzilla which is apparently coming so me and the guys hopped on and we tried to play some caldera me personally i didn't have a lot of fun if i'm being honest this map i don't think is for me anymore i enjoyed it a few times when i initially played it but the weather system the environment just the overall playstyle the map it just doesn't suit what i think warzone should be and that's why i think i'm going to be sticking to rebirth for no one however the only fun moment i think we did have was or at least for myself is when we tried mailing the very last guy when we made it to the end which apparently you can't do that with uh with no weapons i didn't know that there's no execution if you don't have a weapon your hands so we ended up finishing them off the old-fashioned way so after all that i ended up hopping on some rebirth for a couple rounds and the game plays a lot better for me personally i think i'm gonna stick to that for now we were a little bit burnt out but we had some fun games i hope you guys enjoy oh my god is this what brightness looks like oh the sun my goodness jesus is so much more vibrant isn't this better i already feel happier who knew color could make you feel happy we're going to live a winning strategy you guys do that and i'll do this and then we're gonna die and then we're gonna respawn again and then we're gonna die we're gonna respawn we're gonna get a load out and we're gonna die and we'll land on the loadout and get all loaded out and then we're gonna die much why is there so much dying involved in come back of this century this is rebirth see i'm now being
