did he go to the top yeah he's going up oh that was a shot that was another shot i hit him got him nice shot there it is that's what i'm talking about oh on the left tower left of the uh big tower sniper i see that left of the launcher tower hit right target dead assist nice once prone in oh i got the other guy too i think there's one prone in the front as well there's one zipping up trigger oh yeah he's prone to the front there actually he's pretty good oh yeah okay dead nice dude i got the range on this oh my god i'm insane that's what i'm talking about accolade nothing but head shots [Music] i'm finally understanding the bullet velocity on the sniper it's taken it's taken a long time it's taking a long time but i'm getting the hang of it i feel like i'm getting the hang of it i'm still not really happy with how slow the bull velocity is on the sniper and perhaps this is not going to be the only sniper in the game well certainly hope not upon full release but i i do question why they gave us this sniper with the slowest what feels like the slowest bullet velocity on a map that is essentially mid to long range no matter where you go now my initial plan for this video was that i was gonna have a little bit of a commentary and discussion over the top of the game explaining all the things that i like the things that i dislike but i really don't think that it matters right now this is a beta and from what they've told us it's two months older than what they've currently been working on now for me that raises a lot of questions like number one why are we playing on a two-month older build than what we could be playing on perhaps there's something that just hasn't been revealed to us yet maybe it's just not ready i don't have the answers i really don't and i'm not gonna pretend that i do but what i will say is i'm not extremely happy with the current version of this beta it is very buggy there is a lot of bugs seriously there is one bug in the game where i have to delete my config file so that i can fly a helicopter or even drive a tank because otherwise i just hop in them and they spin right a helicopter will spin right or i'll just completely drive straight no matter what i can't even back up so yes there is a lot of bugs there's a lot of issues however i do find myself coming back to play the game very often i'm excited for it i am i love the movement i enjoy the gunplay i love the fact that you can swap the attachments on the fly while that does pose some issues like the magazine issue that a lot of people have brought up you have two separate ammo types for your magazines so if you expend one ammo type you just swap to the other and it'll avoid reloading at everything else so yeah i believe that that could be fixed i don't think it's an overwhelming issue at the moment and because they've said it's two-month-old build who actually knows what they have fixed and what they're keeping in or what they are going to change but overall i am enjoying it anyways i'm going to leave you this in gameplay now just some clean crispy snipes hopefully it's uh it's taken quite a bit for me to learn the bullet drop in the the lead it's uh it's quick the movement in this game is very quick so i'd like to see the velocity increased maybe just a little bit who knows if this is even the best sniper for sniping long range we have no access to the everything else in the game so we'll see i'm also kind of curious your thoughts on the game if you've played it yourself let me know down below maybe it's not your cup of tea totally understand that as well but catch you guys in the next one love that there really is something about that headshot zone it's just so juicy it's got a pill for me i like that there's no grenade notification so it's easy grenade kills maybe one more no yeah we got him back in the tower stand still hit he's gotta reload at some point right wait double hit we got him i do like the sniping i'm getting used to it it's just extremely tough like because of how crazy the movement is that's why that's what makes it really really tough because people can just go left right left right slide around jump so getting a head shot is not easy by any means those guys are dead you guys are definitely dead oh [ __ ] we did that didn't think i was gonna get that this pistol also has a burst fire but i don't really find it all that useful let's go my aiming's still feeling a little bit clunky man grenades are so rough in this was that from somebody just shot me from a pill right on the mat 270 degrees oh game's freezing move out there to my marker see like how's he supposed to hit me when i'm doing when i'm doing that that crazy movement it's wild i do love that you can swap sights on the fly though like this it's just oh man it's just so useful who's shooting at me now oh my goodness somebody's shooting at me i just don't know where that was from okay there's a tank shooting at me i think there's a tank shooting at me i must be marked on the map or something oh he's coming up you can hear him oh my game is freezing oh my god what's going on way over here that's only a leg shot here we go that's an easy heady oh yeah oh that was quick getting the hang of it yes yes you know what they clean up this game though they have a solid game on their hands seriously it's just there is a lot of bugs some pretty uh some pretty glaring issues in this but it can be solved it can be solved tough shot man holy can you fly straight so inconsiderate of my sniping i missed him you got it i can't really see that guy there we go i can't believe we went like that i swear you chuck a grenade in there and like you're guaranteed at least two kills we got a lot of snipes this game so far oh the game's over well we had 52 kills did we i think i was only using a sniper the entire time some nice snipes i'm getting used to it the lead the drop it it takes a long time to get used to it in this game it feels a lot slower than everything else even the other battlefields i could be wrong but that's a good game though even though we lost you
