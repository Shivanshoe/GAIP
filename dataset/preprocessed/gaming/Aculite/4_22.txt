[Music] it's probably one of the better guns to start out with i think definitely did not want to drop this far not too far from zone thus that's nice that's one hit is that a headshot no i can't believe i killed him in two shots i get he must have been wearing a level one vest i think that's the only way you can kill somebody two hands he didn't have anywhere to go but i mean he could have went to like a tree or something no he had a level two vest i must have just double hit him oh we got another guy i shot [Applause] oh we got him seems to be a very popular hill right now see it's weird about solos you never know when somebody's just gonna show up so he's still quiet in this game too it's like kind of relaxing until it's not air drop oh it's a double i don't know if we'll be able to get both but probably get one [Applause] [Music] who should know me [Applause] this guy knows exactly where i am at all times back is my sound not high enough we got him i suppose footsteps in this game are kinda loud okay maybe we can go get the airdrop now okay i got the airdrop never mind i wonder if he doesn't know where it's coming from [Applause] how is this kind of dead i can maybe i can make him uh scared just keep pepperoni there it is finally that used to be the go-to if somebody's if somebody like doesn't know where the shots are coming from you just shoot kind of like beside where they are and they think that they're still being shot at even if they're behind cover then they'll tend to move and it works sometimes oh he had it yes we do in fact love that there's a guy already in the compound wow he actually managed to hit me with one of those shots his very first shot can confirm the gun still owns he's not shooting at the truck this guy take my quad oh no i'm going to be screwed no aren't i oh no no it's not too far oh my vest is not looking good oh my vest is not looking good let's go right down there oh i'm dead 100 i'm dead yep he's gonna die to the play zone he's not even gonna get it either everyone just died damn well i guess the arms out of place so no one's gonna be able to use that at least yeah we got a few people here yeah okay so it seems to be like the idea is to drop early so as long as you drop early you got people to fight which is fine like i don't i don't want like a ridiculous amount of people right i just wanna be oh shoot boy i'm coming sorry the amount of times that's happened to me today i'm actually sorry oh a good old car 98 okay we will we'll remember this building because i wanna i wanna be able to push people to [Applause] a shotgun [Applause] my plan actually worked out it took many matches but it so far not bad we have a 4x i can go get that car 98 now he definitely got the kill on the other guy i don't even have to get the car 98 i just grab this yeah there's got to be somebody in this compound over here hearing that qbu getting closer tag he's fine now i don't know if i should have shot but it might have been a free kill [Applause] [Applause] [Music] this guy gives me a head shot he's only got a one on i'm not in the best position oh oh we got him i might have some loot ggs guy oh my god you can talk while dead yes jesus crap out of me man dude man that's a pleasure oh give me a heart attack man gg man good good games man hopefully you win thanks man i've been having some rough ones well settle down you got it i'll do my best okay this zone is gonna start hurting a little bit more we're gonna have to be a little bit more cautious of our surroundings now as well while i'm running in i feel like i'm carrying too much ammo he's like just over there hey we got him [Music] he still seemed to be looking this direction i don't know if it was because he killed a guy over here or if he was still scared of this area see there's the things about pubg you gotta like you gotta worry about your surroundings you know you gotta try to think like the enemy yeah this is not gonna be an ideal run i definitely should have taken the vehicle i wouldn't got that kill earlier maybe but uh i feel like it would have been safer because i could have driven it to a house because it's like it's that time of game you go to a house or whatever you know cover your surroundings check the windows occasionally i'm going to take this and drive right up to the compound we don't have time for this there's no time his name is our stress and he's stressing me out oh my goodness honestly even if we don't win this this has been a great game so far look at this man game looks great honestly like it does but this is getting a little bit eerie why is it the time the shots that i take my time on i mess up i was lucky i was just judging based on where the where he was running through the bush okay so we got some shots at the far side suppress car 98 south east i'm gonna try to stay stay boosted up from now on i missed oh i freaking missed i shot a nice shot oh fraps almost had me well well well let's go right there it doesn't help that i missed i honestly think there's a guy right up here and one in the hut maybe one at the far corner but like this is the only area oh okay nevermind we just got the hut guy he's gotta be at the hut it's the only place i haven't checked you can't be doing that you can't be doing that man even if you're a new player pruning in the grass it doesn't work it just doesn't work hey we want it there's a couple times there where like i thought for sure i was gonna die even even the the gentleman who uh calmed to me in the end there i thought for sure he might even headshotted me because he was already he was like lined up for the shot he was ready that was a great match though wow pubg man pub g there's really nothing quite like it you
