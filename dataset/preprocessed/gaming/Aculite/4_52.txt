so recently they added a new game mode to warzone verdansk it's called iron trials 84 and it changes the game up a little bit mainly sniper headshots will no longer one shot beyond anything of 30 meters so this obviously makes things a little bit more interesting you can't one shot somebody in the head while they're running about or you know they're trying to gun you down at a certain range so snipers are not as viable as they used to be the reason because of this is they increased the health pool so your health is a little bit higher the plate system still works the exact same you have the normal amount of plates they also removed free loadout drops so you can no longer get free loadouts which makes things a little bit more difficult to come back from if you find yourself fighting it out in the gulag additionally if you do go to the gulag and you happen to win your gulag fight you come back with those exact weapons so you can drop down with something that'll at least help you rather than just running around with a pistol once you come back so with this mode it's only duos and i found i found myself actually enjoying it quite a bit later on playing with stone mountain here we're just doing some duo's because that's all the mode allows for and what we actually found out is sniping becomes fairly rewarding because you have to line up your shots correctly either one headshot one body shot or just doubling down on two headshots to try to take the guy out immediately so this kind of made the mode somewhat interesting because the time to kill has been increased so if you ever found yourself in one of those situations where somebody shot at you first you may actually be able to get behind cover plate up and then fight them afterwards so a couple more things to mention they did increase the distance of what you can fall without taking any sort of damage stone love this we actually tested this out you will see that in the video i won't give any spoilers but it's kind of insane and one more thing if you do happen to find yourself winning one of these matches they do give you a calling card personally i would have liked to see something a little bit more rewarding since everything costs more in the game loadouts cost fifteen thousand armor plates is even two thousand to buy so i would have liked to see maybe even just a gun skin something else hopefully they can add something like that in the future but i definitely found myself enjoying the mode a lot more once we got used to it if you guys do enjoy please leave a like and as always catch you in the next one yeah i'm kind of curious because we can try from like the different levels of the stairs um all right here we go do you want to go first not both do it yeah um i'm kind of a pro at this acolyte so watch yeah okay oh my god oh my gosh no way no way superhero landing no way that's incredible he's redeemed himself man i'm the best are you saving that to upload it to instagram right now is that what's going on i'm literally i literally just needed to tell my wife i knew i knew it no you gotta drop from at that height now okay yeah you're right i'm gonna get up here no you're dead okay here's noah here comes my instagram clip 360 360. yeah you what money money money dude what's higher than this where do we go now we have to go to hotel i think we ought to do this one and if we live on this we gotta go to hospital then i think we go knock it down my video is just gonna be called falling through verdansk yeah just testing the heights i don't okay yeah no you would survive from this i think yeah no you have to test this oh we should tell that we should just ping it so this is 26 meters high actually we should have done that on the other one oh shoot i think it's taller look look across look across that oh yeah it's taller it's for sure taller okay you wanted to go first not really but yeah decided the last one i bet it's 30 meters okay i'm gonna try and i'm gonna try and jump off of it let's see if that does it okay maybe you like it this is just the edge dead you know what i think your character did like a hard landing though so that's probably the max like your character like was it 26 or was it like 30 or something i think it was 26. okay guys stop you're not killing me i'm going up here the only thing that's going to kill me is the floor exactly they might be coming on the other side guy there's a red door here too okay this is 37 bro i use the stem it worked oh there you go you can kill me look at that they delivered some guns for us 37 yeah you're done 37. wait from from here from the very top i'm here i'm here yeah i know you're dying you're dying okay okay you want me to try the lower one you try the higher one well if you know i'm saying you're gonna die from this one you think i'm gonna die yeah yeah chat what do you guys think place your bets place your bets do i die or do i live oh there it is we found the height okay we should test this i feel like this nah that's probably oh yeah no that might work that might work i don't know let's see so somewhere between 28 and 37 this is 33. the other one was what 29 or 26 you said 28 i think was the other one okay five i'm going to do it i'm gonna do it okay four three two one oh that breaks your legs too i'm telling you i think it's 30 30 meters yeah i think you're right i think you're spot on you're like it looked like you landed hard on that last one when i jumped off that roof yep you know okay that's pretty good though that's not bad pretty high okay i don't really have anything set up to be honest so yeah you know i'm still sniping so yeah i figured really uh really going to go wrong we're ready we're ready i just i got it i we got to try it we got to experience it and then we tweak from there right like that's how even we play the normal game we just what if you're what it's like or 3x car 98 or something is the way now is that an xm4 with like an extended mag ground loot what's that 60 rounds in the mag what so i guess they buff the ground mag too yeah so we can actually fight back in some sort of way yeah this is looking way more instead of just great tech 9 with single fire and a freaking type 63 everywhere yeah the ground is normally just terrible there's also no stopping power no go or no daddy oh i'm being behind on me on me on me on me it's unlucky [Applause] two different things [Applause] if they survive they can redeploy teammate got their ass kicked they're rtb at this time victory rests on your shoulders they're targeting me i didn't think they were both there this is so weird man people take so much damage yeah look how slow your health regen's there wow okay yeah even though he hit me like four times and then i still managed to like pull dip cover again but the health regen is gonna be so slow yeah it's actually gonna take ages it's very slow you could get a load loadout too it's true this is like impossible i'm gonna drop it on this building watch the sky okay what do we use i'm definitely sniping i'm just taking both my guns screw it should i just go with an old loadout maybe what i was saying though is we might actually have to really start doing contracts like off early game usually we don't really land on scavs but that might be the oh crossing the road there in the boss 60 round mag into a guy this is why i'm saying though the pee pee you got so many bullets or even bull frog big mag we'll probably figure it out either way that might be the way you need something massive to swing out of that's true i think you're right they're crossing underneath us oh good calm down armored once knocked the back one no way through the trees so we just leave him yeah he's gonna die to zone out hit him with that buddy was lower though oh nice i don't know how that's just delicious dude that was sick shot actually a six shot from the year you know they were out of pocket wait first zone we gotta go dude uh no fourth zone it's fine it's fine i believe i believe okay i'm knocked but i'm not dead crack them it's all you start selfing i can't i don't have one he died his own literally died to zone dude holy first of all come on brother i got a ghoulie i don't win these time to earn your freedom soldier you got high health okay i win these i'm talking about nothing i'm beat but i'm assuming they're just riding the ridge if there's two so i would assume too oh ahead feet right right below just one nice cash craig here's a couple more plates for you and take half the cash it's not buybacks well uh who knows man maybe you make a play later okay i'm clustering that top building so we don't get force you want to cross left do you want to stay right i'm just crossing i'm just crossing we got to go zone kind of feels like we're playing pub g almost yeah yeah especially with the health being higher and the slower heals yeah that's very very pubg but you can still buy back and gulag which is incredible i don't know if i like this or not it's it's just strange maybe we're not used to it if we were playing pub g we would have already backed out of the game because my ass died right at the beginning uh that's right medium keep on the beat i think they're ghosted personally i don't think people are gonna be ghosted man they might but i think it's gonna be hard just holding this for a quick second yeah i'm watching our right under that bridge i'm worried there might be a push it over here can't see anything i don't knock them knock them nice not i got a plate box going up to top hill here i got a plate box if you need we're not in a bow uh yeah i could use a play box if you don't have full shotting on the right shooting on the right i broke them i'm replating here this is not a great spot crack one crack one cut just focus the plates oh dude i don't have uh yeah i'm done i'm going down it's all you there's four teams dude i can't even hear because my health is low yeah it's gonna be like that forever oh oh he pushed that for real i wonder what his health was oh he was full health yeah he went reinforced i don't know ars are weird i just feel like people don't die now yeah the sniping felt really good actually i got that knock on the guy on the right but that was only because i knew i had him cracked i'm kind of thinking sniper smg honestly i didn't use my primary gun my ppsh too much there it seems like it's going to be very long range focused i think we can pick up a gun off the ground that's exactly what i was about to say a krieg a milano like there's decent floor loot guns or we could pick it up off somebody would kill and then focus our having a clean good solid sniper long range game to outplay them with the head shots i think that'll do it i like it i'm down [Applause] my gosh this guy didn't even hit me one time he's not ready for this mode it's not ready for the iron trials he's not ready for the iron trials man oh here where do we go okay yeah let's do that that's what we need all right i think we go for left hill here or we try and get deeper zone we might have to play strats better here well we haven't been shot at yet so that's pretty good that's a miracle already a blessing in disguise we could just go like a way out here and just wait or we could just snipe this guy it's over there on the under the bridge down him love that guy a pop of hill somewhere we're shooting down at him [Applause] we can go get up in there want to get up in there let's get up in there kill confirmed he jumped down on the kill should be about here-ish somewhere hit with the shack crack jack crack snake that smiles back goldfish i was just saying though like i don't know i don't know what uh the spm is like in this birthday guy yeah i don't know why they're actually he's so how did he do that excuse me this guy's playing pubg who is this guy he knows how to use the motorbike get a tutorial out my guy yeah i'd stop for that oh never mind nevermind i'm not subbing all right yeah i'm on subbing that dude come on honestly if you die to somebody like so wait what huh it's gonna be so valuable that we stick together and play together as we're not doing right now because of me moving off to try and get greedy for a kill but that's besides the point no i think this is good did you take that satchel no i already have one okay i did the scav contract earlier i missed sick missed again sick getting back on his bike driving away missed against it there's a crack baby there it is there it is any chance you can get the finish on that it's probably like 14 shots got you baby guys he's forced to us anyways here so we're chilling i can use the practice yeah you could wait what's up where'd the guy go did you see him no i didn't see him somebody said a comment or something something like here maybe you're a reading chat maybe you're reading yeah yeah you're probably reading chat yeah yeah yeah yeah oh up on the left went back down you see that back door there yeah back there broke that guy great shot him great shot got him hit one the other guy's going to beat you on right building maybe he got me he got me that's right brother how are you doing shoot over i'm eight i'm gonna go you need some give me a couple yeah thank you let's um let's fly over i think we could go to the right maybe oh my god that was beautiful we love that and how many people left go for this w movement thank you oh hello bye-bye we should get top pool yeah i don't know if those guys were on top of pool or they were just in front of it shooting up at that time i'm gonna check fire tower i think he's talking about it he's talking about the counter angle here help me help you come on i gotta get roof i'm not gonna wait oh wait i'll wait just just go if you need no no it's gotta be double let me know three two one go good another one i don't have any hang on that crack let's do it love that iron trials are nothing now we have to actually coordinate get these headshots see that's the skill play right there right like that's where the skill comes in oh jesus oh holy holy oh don't warzone please stop the triple betty on the roof this guy's watching me right now he knows he just gave me a heart attack oh my gosh come on anybody on the right maybe still on the back there losing ground crackers yeah he's doing at me what the heck is there one closer so there was a guy in the hut or the house or whatever out here okay i cracked the guy shooting on the left he's still there i'm gonna get a replay they are not pushing towards us okay so they're gonna go through that little that runway there i got six plates i got five and a mini box i gotta have armor box too okay nothing in here uh how do we want to do this right side sniper did you hear that oh crap he's crossing there there's no he's gotta be right here they shot at two people that just crossed over towards blue mark though i tagged one of them we had a little while i got one stun grenade here i'm gonna drop an ammo okay i got two i got two stuns then here two two three other teams i got two two two one i got 22 stuns two joint thank you guys two other teams they're fighting each other maybe yes yep two two decoy might be two nope 2v2 here get up in the car yeah yeah we got we got big stuns here big stuns this way hey now inside this hit twice we push this hit hit pushing got it we love that we love that oh where's more i want to kill more that was a great game we had some sweet snipes that came together the combo snipe is just it's going to outpace any of these guys trying to use the lmg's ar yeah there's no way i'm too fast when the time to kill is this high it's like this is even though you can't get the one shot head shot if you've got the combo shot it's still a two to three shot kill at the like we didn't hit anybody more than three times yeah no kills three still so fast sniping that like a precision is gonna pay the coordination on the head shots though that's that's nice that was nice we haven't done that in a long time no because it's been noticed our first our very first game we ever played in this we did that we were up on a hill and you're like oh okay let's line it up three two and then we hit it we were playing warzone tactical back yeah exactly that was when we were playing warzone tactically then you know [Music] you
