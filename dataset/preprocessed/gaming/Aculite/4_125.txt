what is that helicopter doing oh he's got a king he's got a king i don't think we have to worry too much okay anybody need this anybody bloody need this we've got one there one there one shot it's okay don't worry oh my god well it appears both these guns have still not been changed or fixed well not the guns themselves rather but the magazines because that's the only thing that's broken about the guns i have two fantastic games to show you guys i'm going to be playing with jack franks good friend of mine fantastic content creator i will also link his channel in the description below i don't know what it is but i think we have some fantastic synergy we always seem to work very well together played together way back in pubg and seemed to carry over in this i'm going to show you my loadout now i'm going to be using the as val as was the spr208 i'm going to be using the 30 rounders in the as val since 20 is not nearly enough we'll be using it with the acog blue reticle since i finally unlocked that and the spr you can build kind of however the hell you want to be honest since the lapua rounds make a gun hitscan you can just build it for ads speed since it's gonna one shot in the head regardless so you don't even need to put a damage range on it a suppressor you don't have to do anything so just build it for ads if you want but this is what i'm going to be using as well as a semtex and a heartbeat sensor because you need to be able to weed out those pesky campers sitting in the corners gotta keep yourself safe and speaking of keeping yourself safe this video is sponsored by expressvpn big thanks to them for sponsoring this video if you guys do not know what a vpn service is it's a virtual private network and how it works is you connect to one of their safe secure private servers across the globe depending on where you want to be located and then all your information is secure from then on so nobody can track back to where you are it tracks back to one of their private networks which during covid times it's very important to keep all your personal information secure since a lot of us are working from home but not only that one of my favorite uses for this is netflix since a lot of my favorite shows and or movies are located in other countries sometimes they're region locked even happens on youtube itself what this allows you to do is connect to a different country and allow you to access them and it's extremely easy to use double click on it opens up i simply click connect and i'm connected to new york simple as that now it's secure and i can watch any shows that i want that are only located in the states if you're interested check out the link in the description below expressvpn.com aculite and find out how you can get three months for free okay playing to win connor playing to win play to win yeah but there's got to be memes in between there's always memes i feel like that's what half our games are just meme games i've done a bit of warming up i was playing multiplayer earlier oh yeah how was that yeah it was actually kind of fun i was just using the sbr and just one banging everyone oh man it's everyone's using it right now multiplayer trying to level it up yeah it's killer though the ads is so fast there's a lot of people here one two three four five six uh all right okay there is a guy on the roof with me oh i'm inside already i'm gonna die i think never mind ready yep behind you jenny oh my goodness do some work with that shotgun what is it it's this is the ground loot um uh what's it called that pump action one vlk yes yes yes so i had it i think it might have been yesterday the day before i found stopping power right off the rip and i threw it in this thing and it just one shots people it's so crazy ah we need about no oh no there is one more bottom floor two more i think or one more now well done see they've got cash you want to do that one yes and no i know how you feel orange box let's go it's okay i got this amazing and 94. we'll be fine okay i feel like the terminator or predator with this thermal this guy's it says he's up oh maybe that's just because he's like a little higher than us yeah oh we could catch him on the back side of the door actually he's right here i think he's in there yep i had a bad day he's friends just to both [Applause] got him poor guys i think this one came back from the gulag [Applause] um it was towards yellow i don't think it was the spy station okay these windows are broken yeah i hate this area yeah this area is a nightmare this is a modern warfare 2 campaign level isn't it is it i think so i think that's what it's based off it's the wolverine one where you have to go through the houses because the russians have invaded and you have a like an assault vehicle with you going down the street right i think that's i don't even remember that it's been so long for me yeah let's get that yeah i played the remastered version recently the campaign oh behind me i done him he was at the wall on yellow i clustered as well it's on the other side of the wall i got the kill did he go in yeah well done probably didn't need to use the cluster for that but i just did it just in case overkill is good good with me i don't think you can one shot headshot through glass with this thing i think it's very much like the car 98 yeah would fmj make a difference i don't know maybe i'm not sure if it's like wait what they're behind us yeah did we just kill these guys maybe they had ghosts chan man the guy that i killed was called bailey i don't remember what yours was i spied here it's possible i'm going to the roof of this building here might have some oversight i'm sure you'll just one click them anyways yeah they're looking at me now although they are in trouble down so yeah i knew it broke him [Applause] hit him he's downed he saw a present there you go well done i suppose it worked out you're going to the roof or we're going in the tower oh we got two to the left over here you're gonna be crossing are they underneath this is a nice little armored one [Applause] down the back one it's a balanced weapon jack it's a balanced weapon there's nothing wrong with it oh it's perfectly fair do you want to buy yourself froze here i can get there on time oh yeah you got plenty of time requesting recon scan for targets i say we just go right across the port wait let's not fight downtown yeah get the position yeah play for positioning i don't know if we can oh yeah we can eat there we go of this house i mean i'm thinking about it honestly yeah do we both we both have self so it's not like we can't yeah i think there's probably someone in that box or we could try for blue blue building blue building is really strong you know what let's pop it yeah let's go oh yeah there's a guy in blue one guy possibly you want to try pushing this is he ruth i got dead silence he might be yeah he's just roof yeah well he's on the stairs one guy one guy [Applause] he made the wrong decision he did unfortunately he was looking for lewd oh just two helis on top of is this going to be a prison ending i really hope this might be it might be those are not fun i lose all those all the time yeah you gotta be careful the guys from behind here where are they they're at the buy station on yellow i just have someone underneath us on the field in the field see right on yellow welcome hit him god that thing's got nasty recoil let's go on blue still reloading he's still behind on yellow yeah the guy that was just shooting at you killed him where did this guy go he was on yellow but i think he crossed over to the big containers okay i really need to clean my monitor that's what this game has taught me you need to clean your monitor yeah because you see like the specs of dirt or whatever right on your screen you think it's a guy running across an open field [Laughter] no is that just me i feel like i'm not the only person i i yeah i mean i i probably do it like once every two months i would say you know i don't do it very regularly i just really hate this area there's so many bushes yeah it sucks it's like playing pubg all over again yeah i'm in a really bad spot here someone just finally shot direct east there there you go oh chill right down him oh no i have to reload he's got a friend yeah okay i got him nice team wipe nope team white yeah he had a self res this thing sounds so clean suppressed yeah it's nice but i just love the sound of it unsuppressed as well deadly it sounds it's it's got some beef behind it it's got some beef behind it i like that that's great yeah it's going to be prison we're ruined yeah it always is it always is here jack all the time it's never not prison uh so someone did get out this jeep here okay there's a zip on the far side there's a zip on the back side of prison right here go ahead cracks that was the same team those two guys good spot holy i would have been dead right there okay two other teams left to be cb2 we could go down to the right of prison and take the inner tunnel we got time the sewer yeah i think so i'm just worried about the uh the towers 2b2b1 or we could just zip up to the bridge well that's an option for us if we need it i'm dropping yeah i'm joking just chill here see where it goes oh he's underneath left side [Applause] did you have a friend i don't know i just seen the glimp yeah that wasn't a team wipe what also doesn't show it if they have self-res okay which is so there's still three people in three teams sorry we're in the size oh this is gross jack this is gross not a great spot the thing is it's going to move right after this yeah the only thing i'm concerned about is that if we have to go up that rappel we're a really easy kill for someone up there and there's probably someone in that tunnel right now yeah i wouldn't doubt it please don't go to the prison don't go to the prison not like this yes okay okay can we we can get up around here or yeah we can yeah yeah we can go around the left side here for sure someone's gonna peek though yeah but in order to spot us they have to peek quite a bit yeah okay they're gonna have to come right off the prison unless they take bridge which is a very good possibility here we go i would imagine they've run across the bridge uh the comments or am i wrong okay uh repel repel oh i don't know actually oh because if he's we can wait i don't know jack i'm taking it nice well done two in a row let's go two for two well two for three whoa playing the zones working oh my goodness there's a lot of people here yeah [Applause] play chasing they might be there was two there right here i only have a pistol so do that one broke one's the other one's broke i'm gonna try and plank [Applause] trying to stick near you i only got a pistol he's on the roof on the roof ah they're shooting at me close on my right down i've only got 12 shots roof guys flesh well done double throw on me i need a decent gun here triple threat uh oh he's in the back door back door that's funny still double threat so he's probably east in the tower i'd imagine he's still up there i think he might have jumped okay we could take him oh no he's still up there yeah yeah oh he's dead good job there's still people fighting southwest in the camp do you need ammo we could go over to tower bottom of tower has an ammo box what did you have he's trying to take the chopper why is that sniper okay i don't know it's a thermal is it like the bewitching chopper guy is broken we're making a lot of noise there yeah we are take our chopper man he's gonna come out oh he's in the bunker we could take him if you want i got that zombie yeah let's get it let's hear lester oh you're crazy you're crazy you're crazy it's okay i broke him and downed his teammate any place i got nothing we're squared if you come back in here no no we'll be fine we'll be fine if you want cross back over to the right i'll try to watch are these chicken coops is that what this is i think so yeah this chicken's in the multiplayer isn't there like csgo make them follow you around oh that'd be great make like a train of chickens take them straight to the colonel it's like one of my favorite things to do and i don't even know why oh quad bike bike uphill i think these guys just rest one guy he just doesn't know where he's going for the buyer ah oh okay cracks got it his friend is probably in that same compound i'd imagine yeah my loadout's not great for distance right now yeah let's close distance teammate's not even here okay not currently there's the loader uh semtex hello over the wall maybe downhill yeah i got him [Applause] there's plates and stuff there yeah i'm maxed out gotta get to the safe zone that guy's always yelling at me tell me to go to the safe zone oh there he is welcome to season six yeah he has no idea where that even came from either he's going to come to the gap here you think he's gonna go gab i think he's gonna road left oh you're right broke [Applause] down [Applause] he's behind the tree here welcome to season six never mind do you still see anything enemy contact oh my goodness jack somebody fix this weapon please get it out of the game get these magazines out of the game i mean it's fun but it's so broken it's yeah it's pretty magnificent someone's saying sniper left i don't know a chat saying sniper left sniper left i don't know what that means it's a guy maybe yeah maybe i missed a glint it's tough chad i got these old eyes okay i miss things how old are you gonna i'm 25. ah i get enough three i mean yeah you've got eight years on me buddy this definitely reminds me of pubg days like checking all these hills like this it's our

valley i don't think he can come up right there i down that guy in the red mark these guys are hopping no no they're not hopping it's just one guy do you have a fully loaded class or something you can pick up there's a guy behind us downhill to the left yeah he got out of the attack forever that was rage in its purest form connor yeah killed him i'm gonna get this guy's ammo [Applause] there's a guy down in the ravine where am i being shot from i just down him on blue there's another one to the right of him do you want to push these guys take them out i got them here man yeah we gotta go with
