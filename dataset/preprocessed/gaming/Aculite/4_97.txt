just does so much damage this is all you're gonna see soon oh yeah just everywhere oh yeah [Music] and boy was i right are you gonna start seeing these things everywhere so so far what i've noticed is people tend to use one or the other but stone mountain and myself we decided to use both at the same time now one of these guns we're both using the ffar as well as the aug and it's very strange combo because both use ar ammo so you kind of have to watch your rounds make sure that you're either pushing to either eliminate the person and you know pick up all their ammo or you have to go and find extra ammo yourself and with how fast the far shoots yes you are gonna need extra ammo and uh are these guns strong like this is a hundred percent gonna be the new meta for at least a little while and uh i'm very curious to see how it's gonna tie in when they release the more i guess legendary weapons the lmg the rawl as well as the cx-9 that both of which haven't been released yet but you can only find out of crates right so i'm interested to see if either one will be able to compete with how fast these things can both down and especially with cod being a very mobile game you want to be as fast as possible and be able to put as much damage as possible while you know moving as fast as possible now both these weapons are really strong even before the cold war suppressor revert but now since it's been reverted are these things so powerful oh my god it's like you don't even have time to react it's uh it's gonna be a fast meta for quite a long time i think if you are interested in using them yourself this is what i'm using i don't know if these are the best attachments for both i was talking with my chat when we were live streaming this over on twitch and this is what i was told to use for both of them so if you haven't been leveling up your far and your og this is the cold war og i should mention then you definitely want to get on that because you're going to start seeing this stuff everywhere and uh you know dying in a couple bursts isn't always fun if you can't do it yourself honestly it's kind of nice to see burst rifles come back into the game because previously like they were never really that great you always kind of had to force yourself to use them and you're always getting beamed by like a growl or you know a kilo back when both of those were just like extremely strong anyways i'll show you guys the gameplay now but before i do i would love to thank today's sponsor which is honey if you guys have never heard of this before like myself and apparently you've been living under a rock then you guys have been missing out so what is it well it's a free browser extension that scours the internet for promo codes and automatically tests them at checkout i myself love this already i've been using it for a couple days and i've already saved over 25 on two purchases one of which was g fuel that's incredible so let me show you how it works go to my link in the description joinhoney.com forward slash aculite then whatever browser you're using in my case i'm using chrome i just click on add to chrome add the extension and i'm done that's it the nice thing about honey is that it supports over 30 000 websites so what you can do is you can go to the website and then go through the list see what's available see if there's any coupons that are a big discount for you and say if i wanted to shop for some new pants you could do that on one of those one of those stores or if you're like myself and you're a little bit more into gaming maybe you would need a new scuff controller you can go to the scuf website and you find the controller that you want go to checkout and as soon as you go to checkout it'll immediately scour the internet and see if there's codes available and it will automatically apply them for a nice discount and it's that easy really it's that easy so if you guys are interested and i highly suggest you get this it's free

could still be a ton of people alive it's just you gotta get a contract it's like a high-value target contract i think i haven't played it or seen it but the description to my understanding i haven't played it or seen it i haven't even written no i read the description but i think this is what it is you remember that game we played no no no no i read the description dude i know i think i know he
