i think we go to the roof oh no the vehicle coming through over towards the yellow yeah i'm going real on our building [Applause] guy over here on yellow uh got that guy pushing us i think that was a truck driver right here broke located what game are we playing right now i kind of want to go to the roof though [Music] [Applause] you know what that was probably the best thing we could have asked for right there that turnout yeah these guns are both great in fact they're fantastic when you pair them together so i keep hearing about the bullfrog and how good it is all the time and uh to be honest i think it's one of my favorite smgs now i don't know what it is about the the weight class of smgs but they tend to do a lot more headshot damage than ars i guess that's just call of duty balancing a lot of the cold war attachments don't seem to have the stats match up for what they actually do so this is the way i built mine and i love pairing this with the car 98 i guess it's just like close range long range however i use the carnity more of like an aggressive sniper than anything and i think that's kind of how it's meant to be used but uh anyways i have two games to show you guys with stone we had some fun uh messing around with this i think he was using a different combo himself i hope you guys enjoy if you're interested in copying this for yourself this is what i'm using i'll catch you guys in the next one i feel like 99 of my videos now start with train yeah you know it is a side effect of always landing in the same spot i don't mind it sometimes you just cut out the whole intro oh my goodness yeah if nobody drops here it's nice because then you just cut your loadout yeah throwing another game or something with a couple clips from uh you know some good kills an intro clip of acolyte dying to fall damage oh my god yeah you'll never get one of those let me see hold on look at how straight this gun is yeah yeah it's definitely up left it is ludicrously straight the first couple bullets it it jumps a little bit but it is ridiculously straight up left like i've just always countered it i don't know that was one of the reasons i was like that was one of the reasons i wanted to use this gun they're probably going to be off going towards the vehicles my guess nope right underneath what it's climbing up to the roof i don't know why he would drive to the exact same spot was but he died but i only saw one in it i remember them like once maybe it's on the hill there if you want to snipe him in the face you think about that you can stop talking and stop for us acknowledge oh i got the teammate kill wait that was you this time yeah so as soon as you said he's there standing still if you want to snipe him we both took the shot at the same time but yours hit second we've done that multiple times now [Laughter] here we go did just rez back there as well oh my gosh hitting him he's out of the game hey somebody was jumping on the roof back there and a res went up like oh from my station area yeah that was that should be the guy that jumped off yeah i'm pretty sure a shock came from over there they're on the road oh yeah i see him over there broke him broke the first hit him how did that unknock him he's behind the pillar right there and then i'm gonna hit him oh i think he just got knocked i think he just got knocked to the zone oh i'm dead i'm dead to the zone no don't die don't die get that vehicle please there's a guy off to your right uh near the shack what i can't mark him because i just have to run i don't have time i gotta get you i'll drive okay he got me loaded damn it get i tried squishing them and [Music] [Applause] let's find the boxes there i'll lock them in down down one more right there shoot can i get you in time you're quick [ __ ] have been targeted get your [ __ ] together i broke him hopefully he doesn't push that right side oh he's back at the hangers okay is his teammate that off hold on i have an idea we can peek from this top window oh this is actually genius until you get knocked no no don't say that don't say that stone a collateral headshot use we don't say things like that come on man oh he's crossing the road over there they're in the vehicle my body don't doubt him what what up in my guy we're going on an adventure he just raised oh no it's fine i broke him you ran inside no way how are you hitting me i don't know dude you see your cracks i just it just pops into the window it doesn't check any corners you're just going for the part down there i saw him i knew i knew this guy was looking down down over here he had to react this guy was looking at me though so i had to focus him right away i am kind of hoping they do something with the ghost change it just a little bit i thought they might with this sniper looking at us from blue repositioning knock them i broke them okay [Applause] i can drive feel free to hop out at any time and i'll just keep driving use this tent right next in here two of them the other one's back here got it nice [Applause] birds that means his teammate's back too right yeah because he got knocked out so his teammate must be flying whenever we're hunting this is the team this is not my it's not the hunt that's probably why i'm coming back over here maybe yeah this is the team oh more shots of me from red roof [Applause] there's a guy above me or beneath me oh yeah yeah above knocked him another one on the half roof above you as well dude i can't get up there over here damn it he got me i down him nice the other guy's back up he's jumping off he's pushing over to you or his buddy here actually i don't know how i just down that guy double semtex armor hit i'm not in this fight i'm i'm covered zone's coming i'm getting in the truck i'll bait good bait knock one the guy already jumped off too so this guy probably already he jumped off already one jumped off one i heard a pair the one guy popped his self already [Applause] yeah he's gonna die outside done 100 i'm gonna save the truck he's next to me here somewhere yeah he's right here um behind the hanger my side of the hanger is probably the best description [Music] how does that even work it doesn't make any sense he's like no you want to play the pinching game or oh yes in front they're gonna have to cross the airfield here sniper practice yeah let's play some outskirts i like it i like it we're going towards a big hanger they're our son knock two oh my goodness i hit him in the pinky toe hit him in pinky toe again knocked out there okay there you go okay two sniper shots though still didn't finish the knock target here i can drive if you want i'm driving you don't trust me well that way you can pop the uav when we get closer to something all right oh no the trophy's gone there's a truck right there truck and player i'm gonna try and run them over all right just through both the sem taxes there's two of them here i missed both of them i hopped out all right you're better oh my god the other guy just got squished mother trucker oh my god i juked them this guy's after me disabled get ready he's out hit him with it he's just down the hill there i'll stop him oh my goodness he's just laughing dude yeah that's because he doesn't have anything he's the first guy that i downed he came over the hill and just squashed him two on yellow building up the hill probably second floor camping with their aquarium feeding the turtle aquarium oh top tv one sniper there i don't even see this guy oh i do see this guy be advised you wanna stop and snipe them that's up to you you went around the far side of it now like behind this big thing yeah yeah all right well that's fine we can go for the other guys take a picture right after well done the play comes full that 85 round mag and just help left click that's it oh that's beautiful that's beautiful yeah see it's so good this combo with a sniper with that too because then it's like it's like having two guns because you got 80 bullets exactly and car 98 scopes in so fast this is great get used to this oh i'm rolling the truck by accident too far on the road there armored one they're pushing left towards this tree on yellow here truck is moving all right i'll take the truck again i'm driving rare actually this thing's really low health they're both sniping though knocked one and the other one's broken going for it squash them later clash them i didn't squash them [Applause] is that it yep they're dead nice he was just crawling they both had self-rest but he was crawling rather than taking it to avoid the uh oh a pillow yep and his buddy knocked me out it's okay we're still in zone i'll hold this yeah just take it if you want to push around right we don't have to [ __ ] up knocked one the one up high okay very low on the hill here is he pushing you oh my god that was the last bolt on this bad dude the mag and the ram is so small i'm getting scared right now it's not even that it's small like 50 rounds it's quite a bit it shoots so fast it does it shoots fast and uh oh i i just i needed to hit that last shot fortunately i did otherwise that would have been rough did you say these guys are back like the guys on blue i i think yeah he's behind the metal truck there relocating i'm gonna start pushing left [Music] i'll hold the angle he's back up running around left inside the garage here two there then two there we've got gas moving in this might be what different team these guys are fighting each other the one that killed me was a solo this is awful [Applause] i can't see this guy yeah i guess we pushed too far it was the same team yeah yeah those guys came back they were fighting this one solo neither of them killed each other and they were running around and even after we got the knock on that guy they still didn't the other dude didn't come out and go for the finish or anything yeah that was confusing he was just sitting inside the building there because he popped out of that right building when both of them ran to the left that little chest little shack on the right yeah he was just waiting in there okay that's why that didn't make any sense uh because you marked two guys on the left and then i was like wait wait you're fighting it there's a guy on your right exactly both of them moved off to a hundred percent i saw both of them move off to the left but as a dude on the right pop me he just popped out of the shack damn you
