[Music] oh no [Music] oh no there's number two oh my god we got him no stun grenade [Music] needed that was close that was so close oh my god that's brutal oh no i actually snuck right behind him we had no idea [Music] so i recently set out with a personal goal to get as many melee kills as i possibly could and i think it would have been a lot easier to use the cali sticks if i'm being completely honest this sledgehammer is what i'm going to be using though as you will see in the video it says knock knock on it it's the black ops edition it attacks a little bit slower than the cali sticks but i don't know it's just something about the sledgehammer is just fun to run around with now this is the the perks and stuff that i was using accidentally had cold blooded equipped i think this was a plunder loadout so i forgot that i even had this on for whatever reason normally i would have run eod or something like double time but i think eod would probably be better to run past claymores and all that type of stuff and then of course restock to resupply my stun grenades which i really don't like using i think they're kind of bs and i'd hope that they remove them or i don't know just make them ground loot only or something like that because they really just take away your ability to even fight but yeah anyways hope you guys enjoy the video and catch you guys in the next one we're changing it up no more train station immediately oh no oh no i made a great mistake didn't i maybe 18 000 people here he's above me right it was above me okay now we complete the contract yes hopefully without getting just obliterated beamed like some like mac 10 or something ground loot legendary the goal is to melee as many people as we can with the hammer that's all i want to do how well is it going to turn out probably not well i'm gonna try brent hi this thing does so much headshot damage i don't think i could really mail it no chance advised uav is bingo fuel rtv for resupply [Applause] oh jesus right here okay we got one we got one they go upstairs they did oh i guess money's on the ledge [Applause] he's gonna be running from zone [Applause] well no melee so far not it's not going well you know it's just it's not going well see if i can grab another uav self res i don't think is really going to save me unless i'm just outside the zone or it's end game i'm going to grow for a uav first though yeah i think we'll just go for uavs what is happening to his character everything looks like a nail okay we got two two we advise uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply i just killed him with it he just died [Applause] requesting recon over i can try it over here wait oh everything gg man it was a good sport about it [Applause] another guy up in here same guy [Music] no no did it just work again this is genius send the car off on one side oh no [Music] no way it worked again how is this working did i just create a new meta is this possible see it works in solos it's not gonna work anywhere else this guy is hovering where is he no he's down below don't be like that come on man this is definitely gonna make some people angry [Applause] oh yes it's hammer time he knocked him no way be advised no he didn't knock him oh no he went who's right here i deserve this i deserve this unless he gets killed by the uh yeah that didn't work i thought for sure he's going on my left oh we still have gulag you lose your fight is over perfect sort them out or capture the objective it's prone [Applause] there he is leaving my stuff it's good oh you took my weapon oh come on man took my stun grenades and everything [Music] [Applause] so i knew it i freaking knew it i heard you running that's how i heard you that's how i knew he was waiting for the buy station okay so we're at the end game question is do i play it safe or do i try to actually kill people gotten a few melees this is my weapon i need to go get my weapon hey whoa relax [Applause] everybody's shooting at me let's get out of here [Music] uh do i buy another self i think i do no way oh it's evening it actually saved me oh my god how i don't believe it what did i say end game the only way it's going to save me is end game excuse me there's another one there's another one even if we lose this i have to go for the melee last kill [Music] i was trying to send him to the ocean there he is [Applause] no i can't do it he's gonna win he's gonna win the throw the throw he didn't fall for the bait i thought for sure he's gonna go back around the concrete wall that was a good game made so few people angry with the melee but i mean it's called duty everyone's kind of angry all the time you watch now there's gonna be a million people going train oh how did he why did he not shoot [Applause] wait what is happening i really like the reload of this thing it's kind of cool i don't want to lose my money because like coming back is really tough i just wanna be able to get my melee stuff early on [Applause] where did he go maybe he jumped he [Applause] jumped oh he's gonna go first loot yep we got lucky i do not know if that was the same guy from earlier who knows who knows i think i just purchased it so this is why you can't read anything can't try to read into anything because people just keep coming back we have a vehicle back there we have a trophy system we're good this one just gotta get lucky not get killed that's it there's no other trick to it it's just luck [Music] never thank god for that trophy system imagine i didn't have that that was that was the end game right there we lost and there was nothing around this room without stuns it just becomes too difficult [Applause] get me out of here gas is moving in new safe zone located there he is almost had me i didn't even hear him like i heard him run around the outside for like a quick second but that was it where is he [Music] oh [Applause] uh i can't do this this isn't the thing yeah i wouldn't have been able to do it that's that's a tough push this guy's ghosted hmm [Applause] hmm where is he can't be on the roof can he oh there he is i don't know if i can do this i have an idea okay that works that works as long as i can get them a little bit low i can do it oh god this is gonna be a nightmare oh friendly recon inbound sounds there we go [Applause] where's this guy he's over here on yellow man these pushes on the rooftops are next to impossible it's all about movement at that point if i can't like slide past them or something and if they're playing on controller it helps them a little bit even if i use the stun grenade like there's not much i can do [Applause] that's why dead silence is so good it's probably a little bit busted for solos but i mean it's good you just you can't even be upset if you die to it this is just no counter maybe that's a reason to be upset i don't know we're gonna go way out here he's all the way at the buy station and now he's ghosted [Music] i'm terrified every single time i go for a melee like i feel like i'm just gonna die [Music] [Applause] that works way too well just way too well [Applause] um another trophy maybe it's gonna blow my other one [Music] um okay i know i messed up okay i think his plan was to come out the door there and just start shooting me what is i was driving past oh there's a guy in there what are the chances can you peek from that door or that window how good do you think we are yes yes i don't give a [ __ ] how good you are this game there's no oh i kind of know what he's saying there if he was wondering how i knew i was in he was in the room like i just opened the door and i jumped past to see if i can get a visual no way i'm gonna lose it i'm not gonna lose it the melee range just messed with me okay everything's fine okay he's at the other buy station uh this might be tough i mean this all of this is tough [Music] i have to choose between melee or using an smg and i'm trying to choose melee the most yeah no that can work mac 10 man my jukes were so hard i lost him time to earn your freedom soldier it's okay still got a chance you still got a chance issue is now is i can't see him maybe we just waited for a minute let's uh the vehicle hasn't moved wait did he blow up my other vehicle yeah cause that one was already there i think the other one blew up is that what damaged me so much if i can get my smg i might be able to win i can't get my smg i'm kind of screwed huh oh no i see him wait a minute yeah yeah i see him it's right there hostile foot patrol and we died behind the tree we're good got a sniper man i can't see him it's so blurry [Applause] you're a piece of [ __ ] why am i a piece of [ __ ] excuse me because i'm trying to melee people come on man i'm making the game difficult for myself i'll never understand that he tried to stun me [Applause] he lost the fight because i stunned him like what somebody's clustering the train or is there a fight at that building i gotta uh i gotta get to the buy [Applause] station friendly recon inbound oh uav entering the ao gosh i should have meleed him i had 100 guarantee that that was a kill [Music] this guy however be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply oh oh no i can't do it i can't do it i thought i had a second son it's because i don't have uh i don't have restock we're not gonna win this not a chance nine targets remaining and i think everybody's nearly ghosted so uh yeah [Applause] it's gonna be uh it's gonna be really easy excuse me oh there is a guy behind oh no not like this damn this thing really shreds the range wait a minute oh my god there's another guy down there oh this is awful this is so awful what do i do not only can i not see this guy this guy won't push over the hill right where are we shooting at me hey please [Applause] we can't do it right do i just i have to shoot everybody now right i can't do anything else less than five to go bring home the win yeah no it's too tough at this point yeah i'm getting sniped from i'm not winning this not a chance that's the same guy from earlier that got upset at me for killing him when he was trying to kill me the exact same way call of duty man call of duty oh that's it there's only one guy left 1v1 let's see i think the other guy has better positioning right hey he's inside the house oh they're striked in the wrong area wait you know where he is though you marked the watch him get out sniped oh he doesn't have to come on please i want the other guy to win stupid it's a shame you can't spectate the other player don't run out that way right at the front door what there's a little wall of cover this is not the smart play he's dead he's gonna die to the zone oh my god no way this is so intense i have no idea who's going to win the other guy beamed him he has a sniper though these guys outside the zone he went around the shack and he went to the right i betcha and now the zone's pulling to the other guy what is this game ending he's out of plates oh the other guy's gonna win yes he's done there's no way unless he hits a head shot much better he's dead wait the other guy's chasing him what is happening he actually pushed outside the zone to kill him he could have just waited inside the zone that's better than melee altogether that last fight only in solos this type of stuff only happens in solos post game death challenge oh ggs i [ __ ] myself trying to rotate early and i didn't have a mask so i took all my plates that was an intense fight also dude i'll tell you what my heart was pumping i was like where the [ __ ] i was just watching you guys back and forth yeah that was uh that was fun man good job oh yeah if you wanna if you wanna run some dudes hit me up oh that's nice all right sounds good take it easy that's wholesome look at that he was so mean to me earlier now he's so wholesome what what's going on here maybe it's the in call of duty moment that's what it is [Music] [Music]
