that is he alive no no no no no oh yeah I can hear him looting hey what's up thanks okay now I feel kind of bad I think he sounded like he would actually talk to me uh he must have had a big fight here there's a lot of dead bodies [Music] uh yes the hardest part about the new tarkov wipe choosing what you want to play as either bear or you suck I generally go you suck just because you can hear the English voice lines then and I can actually understand what people are saying so what do we have here you can just wait Brent so what do we got here [ __ ] terror group Patrick and Brent must be new unless they just recently added Brent but Patrick is definitely new still got work to do damn I'm so tired of this walking [ __ ] terror group nice it'll go with Patrick new voice oh there's a guy right there foreign the leaves on trees I was walking through I thought I heard something off to my left foreign was this an armor repair kit excuse is this new I don't I've never seen this before oh my God I'm so slow somebody give me a forklift oh my goodness I can't go anywhere this is so ridiculous foreign can you do it mid-rade no okay there you go there's my answer right there I guess so it um it doesn't cost money then right so you can repair up to 1200 that's big 90 of this raid so far we're almost there oh this guy's gonna hate me I'm so sorry I am so sorry I am so sorry it's the game's fault it's really not my fault I apologize I'm not leaving your gear though that's just how the game goes there's an airdrop coming in this guy is going to the forums right now oh I'm so sorry welcome to tarkov man this is uh wow quite the experience so you might be wondering I'm asking yourself why I'm not gonna just drop like something so I can move faster and you can't like a lot of this stuff is very valuable it's stuff I'm gonna need later on I probably shouldn't overdo myself with weight though like some of the stuff I could draw but is it really worth it is it gonna make a big enough difference probably not I am so sorry scrub Lord there is absolutely nothing I could do you walk directly on top of me that's just how it goes sometimes well we definitely have a new gun Running Animation that looks cool you actually like wiggle it back and forth I like that I really need salad was yeah I'll have to go uh hopefully get like a different spawn next run something a little bit closer to Med rooms and stuff let's go find some is it up nice extract you foreign I'm not getting Karma right now right thank you helmet I really hope he wasn't actually camping and it just happened the same way that mine happened we even brought in a little snack got a sight he must have looted um the the admin office office or something I don't know where you would get this stuff from otherwise not the most exciting run but we got a little bit of loot we got something out of it at least we didn't die I didn't lose all my best gear so overall not bad must be first here I haven't heard any gunshots or anything oh my what [Applause] it's official m855 is the worst day among this game foreign that's for sure works on his helmet come on yeah there's still a guy beneath a we have to uh he's got to be hurting right like I haven't even heard him after that though it's not my button the crazy thing is I saw like another bullet hole or like a red mark in his face so I don't know if it didn't just if it didn't register or what's going on there that's why I didn't want to use this ammo I don't really have a choice early wipe though that's all I have access to that's not him is it no it's like a bush or something I didn't hear any footsteps so he's got to be close right maybe not I just saw him last second I shouldn't have repeat that oh man the downside of bad ammo big even bigger nice good finds good finds it's a wiggly site oh if I like that or not I keep checking the window like thinking people are gonna just show up out of nowhere essentially and you know what I'm right I'm not right very often but this time I'm right okay that's where I'm hearing stuff sometimes and it's not me but it actually is me that's not me I don't think he heard me oh maybe this was the md5 guy we heard [Applause] no way that's his friend right that had just been a lucky spot foreign goodbye foreign why did I aim that was pointless every time every time I aim I die once again we're losing fights we're winning fights and then we're losing fights kind of liking this site ever seen this one before 12th and Adar foreign can't take that I need this armor though I definitely need this armor I gotta figure out how to fit this for a task is that a scav or a player running I can't tell that's gotta be a player right oh yeah smart play play smart play smart play smart play smart we'll know right here if he's dead [Music] oh shoot I don't think I killed him oh I did kill him always gotta be careful with teammates you never know it's happened too many times to me I got it with the grenade no way that was a nice throw that's kind of far damn how does this guy have all this gear it's it's day two of the of the white like maybe you went to reserve I think Reserve still has a some good gear there I guess it depends on like which Maps you go to I've just been focusing on questing this is level four and we're taking that it's helmet how come he's got like all these bandages and stuff laying on the ground oh maybe he was trying to use it and then like as he was using it he died that makes sense God this is so op man second day of wipe you got this like come on fixm-80 um How can I be like this single fire too how do we get out Smuggler's boat could be a play it's up I honestly I did not think that grenade was gonna reach that was a pretty hefty throw I noticed you feel like I don't know if this is accurate or not or if it's just Placebo but if you kind of like whip your body to the left while you're throwing with your right hand I feel like while you're moving forward as well the grenades go farther foreign
