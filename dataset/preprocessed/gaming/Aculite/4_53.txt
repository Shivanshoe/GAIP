why do you need night vision because it's dark is it night time and there's a power so ireland oh i brought i didn't have enough time okay guys here's the thing we're gonna go from this room and this is gonna be awful and we're gonna go we're gonna yeah this is going to be terrible i [Music] [Music] well we're dead on the stairs poor tom he really attempted to teach to the worst squad ever on how to play a new game especially a tactical shooter such as this this is zero hour now i've been looking at this on my steam wishlist for quite some time now and i was waiting for it to have a couple more updates so it's got the necessities in it now visually it's not the best looking game but i much prefer something that runs well as opposed to something that has a lot of visual fidelity so basically how this game is played think rainbow six siege and exactly what it should have been because that's the vibe i get from this game it's meant to be played extremely tactical however with the squad i just i honestly don't think that's even possible so we like to meme around a little bit and poor tom he attempted he really did attempt to teach the squad since he had first hands on the game but this game is really neat because you're able to set up your whole class or whatever you want to use ahead of time you know i'll show the rest in the video i don't want to spoil too much so you get to learn along at least a little bit with us but you can slow your movement much like in tarkov use your scroll wheel to do that and crouch go prone all that type of stuff and apparently the maps even have procedural placement so like certain couches and stuff will block corridors that normally wouldn't be there and i thought that was really neat it took us a little while to learn the game but i definitely felt like it was necessary because you really don't want to be pulling out your mag in the middle of a gunfight [Music] anyways hope you guys enjoy and if you do please leave a like and i'll catch you guys in the next one what i have no idea what's going on right now you see where the pulsing thing is stone nothing it's there's a hostage with a bomb strapped to him i put a mark on it so we you kill him like siege but the objective is not the light it's i brought a frag for nothing you're the one who turned the bloody power off i did one of you does the hostage want to live in the dark actually being streamed yeah oh this guy down here oh where are the enemies i die around that corner with a grenade [Music] how many may actually have infinite or yeah i think so oh i got shot from the long call there i just oh okay that's you what's our objective if you go left there's do you see where the mark is jack redmart i always turn off my lasers okay so i put a red mark with i couldn't open the door because it all looked like windows your left corner let's go yeah yeah there it is good kill what's the yellow how did you see him i want to see how many are left don't worry about that one is above you jack you debated me that wasn't mine how do i confirm again so yeah press f to confirm the kills and that will take them off the thing at the top but it looks like you've killed four so far judging by that was jack yeah ace it's it's you pretty good it's connor and jack who are left so go to the bomb and so two more enemies right no no no it's just because we haven't confirmed the bodies yeah oh red is nice even if you're on the defending team it's red you've got a few kills there connor that was nice yeah i don't know what just happened all right should we do night vision then because if we got someone stream sniping they're just gonna turn the lights off every time i don't feel like it was that dark that i needed night mission that wasn't too bad with it use the planning table to find the box oh here we go again all right all right so it's on second floor one on a wall here yeah so right click it cause that's what the pulses if you press one two three and four you can toggle you're talking about a wiener stone i thought you actually mean okay i put a red marker on it red markers should we try to put it down on the wall here click on the roof click on the roof all right nice good job tom nice i forgot to put sights on my gun [Music] yeah they press five and they can view cams okay they had a good crossfire yeah he had a small middle room there with a no windows in the back oh yeah give me a door trap oh yeah fortified the area oh i've just got einstein's i forgot all right camera yeah definitely customize your loadout before getting in the match i'll put a camera in here as well it's full size yeah you don't bring up a mobile phone or anything it's just there hope these guys just don't shoot me right away can we trigger tripwire bombs not tell your own wife they're friendlies uh yeah it's fine oh nate or something i don't know it was like a beep beep beep yeah should we just defend that i mean if you want no i'm holding the roof right now for them to use cameras and check the staircase got another one staircase nice i don't know how to i can't ping anything because my ping is a different bind it's probably sad oh shoot one more on stairs that staircase yep you're dead con no no i'm not dead yet i'm going straight right i came here i'm gonna play a bit aggressive here and push up what's the different staircase we're talking about there's a car yeah he's got he went up the roof right up the roof on the staircase right above you oh shoot it was the staircase i thought it was on the other side of the building there's two of them coming down got one of them i think that's the last two oh no there's too much i'm assuming they went back out on the roof or something we can use the camera when we're dead too so i can just sit here in the basement oh watch the hostage camera behind us the staircase where we went up okay okay coming up roof side yeah on the roof now hey there you go or myself i wish i knew which way is which is enough i think i dropped oh shoot i just fragged myself you're fine don't worry you're fine i think i killed one please mine's not mine it's not like it's not like you're streaming or anything it's all right [Laughter] somebody's opening a door near me i heard that i see one up on your floor shoot like what was the button oh wait it was just a little one on my level yeah i'm not traded nope there's two of them on that staircase maybe just hold in the corner wait for him to come in yeah but you were safer in the room i think you think so there were like three four angles to peek from oh let's go underground tunnel over pulses over here [Music] all right hold on flashlight off wanna ready to head behind the car i can stun left left guard standing oh i sound right car you might find that useful stone if you press five you can see the map when you're on the attacking team a minor gun with the grenade check him right cameras down yeah good job there you go got him nice oh i almost got the trade dude rainbow six siege days are paying off let's go baby oh played is that it look at that i only got negative one first of all almost i almost came back from negative uh i was down i was i almost beat i almost got above negative one thousand score there really good i'm bad that's good it's alright all right make sure to put a flashlight on yeah yeah mainly just saying this for myself elsewhere you guys i open the main door by the way sit in that room to the left i mean they'll hear it but they'll look around everywhere by that time they're dead and they repel on these windows here yep oh god sounds like they're doing just that okay kill one bottom floor one outside as well i got your stairs if you backed out i can cover your we made someone rage quit what can you move to the right a bit some squeeze past yeah i'm watching a cam on that roof there if they come i'm toggling it i'm watching the very bottom level yeah i'm watching that too oh you're not watching the second floor one okay or i don't know i uh i don't have my what's a ping button a z by default yeah put them on a middle mouse yeah i gotta change that this is such a nasty angle no one could ever yeah you can't look all the way down at your feet though there's somebody moving this door i mean um one more i think nice guy that as well slaps dude really high damage i love these things there's no other way for them to get over here though right no but they can repel windows if you turn around yeah i'm pretty sure he's in that room you run in ready okay i can flash it oh you got it [Music] got him nice oh you don't you don't need to take the roof because yeah no we don't need the roof jesus yeah they're in there by the way yeah i'm going in there i might be able to just don't hit the hostage all right all right with me right there i was gonna thank you guys oh dude turn back on yeah i don't have night vision oh my god oh my gosh dude you got one job i know let's go guys trying to flash me dude i got wallpaint i don't know if you saw him i think we tried it dude i'm fighting someone with my shield i see the hundreds right how many over killed three i think there's there's one on the lower check behind you though don't take hostage i'm trying to no he killed me last game two of them damn it you got one together got one stone you got one oh i did hell yeah i traded pros don't fake they're only four total nice jack this is successful yeah yeah we can look in through the windows no i want to do the back alley i think the backyard i'm going to get back in there's a really yeah my plan is just to go through the top and work on that staircase i found a really cool entrance to get into the first floor right shield connoisseur there's not much i can do if i repel oh yeah that makes sense i'm gonna spawn over here from two different angles what's this i found a really cool spot where'd you want me to go come come come i don't know if you know it you probably know it but we might be able to get an angle through the window here that's the plan man over here all right i don't know you probably know it but it's pretty sick oh i can't go over anymore and up here you can lounge you've seen a guy oh no i go in through this boat [Music] he was in the back room so one's in a hostage yeah we're coming in here now so i'm killed checking hostage room peek over me there you go oh right here killed another one i think there's only one or two left one he shot me through the door mad i was there i thought i killed that guy what blasted [ __ ] yes nice there's a dead person in the basement southwest if you look please no that's not a ghost jacket that's tortured but that man is tortured i hear them repelling your meaning i see a repel camera or no no oh maybe i see one repellent here i've put mine down no dark right now you don't got a flashlight no he's not repelling he went down yeah but i don't want to put it on so i know he didn't yeah i mean when they go dark it means they've got mvg so you'll blind them when you look at them jesus shout out to the hostage again okay so i killed this guy there was definitely one repellent oh nate nade it's on my level oh i'm so blind we just agree literally blind it's horrible oh you got that one that was sick you're still very stunned on my screen actually get me out of here behind uh by the hot somewhere by the hostage room i think i got three hp it would be it would be your right stone if you're facing towards super powerful you'll end up like that mate if you don't gotta stay there okay why does he look golden it's so weird opening doors looks like a trophy finger i just love gold oh there's another one over here [Music] one dead up top well done well done you think they're gonna cover that door yeah like you just made them leave the match if you if you're getting killed and they leave the game i've i've got a camera there but have you got your c4 still what oh yeah second yep come with me are there little spiders as well this is very graphic one of those stairs you got me he's gonna be on your level stone was he up or okay he's on my level yep he was upper floor upper floor bobby i'm already confused goes to the secondary staircase did we win all right what's that gtv got three dead yeah you got four in that one round yeah rapping rabbit find that power box find that yeah wherever the power is we probably should have put a part a secondary mark on the power i don't know where it is here this is where the hostage is in here though no basement basement oh there's so many doors i feel like i'm going to nightmare ready for you i was not ready for that all right you'll now go into that level if there's a door i can check underneath with my door cam okay there's no time of attack there's nothing here thank you there's literally nothing just a little door that's just a little small room yep there's a door right here fog is that like a secret door or something i got him got the guy defending it right here they were holding upper why are they move the hostage last no position is red ping lower level here one in there for sure did you top level construction for sure also lower level common construction here on the opposite of you yeah we killed him we got him i'm gonna confirm it ah he's just defending the lower door use my door cam loan i'm almost positive there's a guy on the staircase with me somewhere i'm coming from very top now accurate this is the floor above me there's a camera here somewhere i don't remember where i saw it i see it that's where i wanted to place one too spread in come with staircase behind you guys oh it's camera oh sorry dude like reactions of a cheetah you're so freaking lucky just said i was coming through that door yeah i wasn't i was listening is he on is it on this floor i think they might i think they might have taken him down to basement i've cleared them i just stunned i'm working a room here i'm gonna try to peek through the window here nothing in this room i think they're gonna be down here there's a dead guy a way to get the basement from outside you want me to cut power or no uh i think i
