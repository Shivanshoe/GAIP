oh what if it's them do they raged in the comms i want to kill him again do it again please it's got to be though i'm actually pretty sure it is i think he's running i kind of want to mail it in here melee almost got the sticks yeah because then like when you kill him it's an instant so you hear the calm it's instant he's he's evaded me acolyte got yeah he was super angry oh my god dude i knew it you were right i'm mad the first time so you can take that guy out oh shoot you mad okay dude come on you got this oh look at the hits oh he doesn't even know i'm so bad though i can't hit the final shot exactly he's like one hit one i got a reload though what do you mean you're supposed to pull your shoe before you hit the ground all right listen i'm just giving the people what they want okay that's what i'm doing here you know we ought to try shotguns i keep saying i want to do this yeah i want to do like a shotgun only game where we just maybe like an smg in a shotgun and we just rush people with vehicles what do you think i think [Music] okay so like shotgun and growl or something i tried to push it i'd probably rock shotgun kilo chuck and kill did you kill one i killed one yeah there's still a guy in here though okay about that nice interesting got a little bit of money building up hang it i don't know where he's going he's probably just going down the road oh someone killed him poached oh man i guess better than nothing i think they just called it a loadout at the buy station [Music] i don't know if you want to fight them [Music] yeah they're gonna have their light out let's fight them all right they're still at the station there i'll repeat it station crossing over towards me [Applause] knocked him inside yeah there's one on me here i'll try come with me i think the other one was at silos more oh yeah he's crossing over now just goes immediately for the res yeah why did he do that yo he was screaming in some other language there [Applause] ramming it up still oh yeah we got the ram going are you ramming two i'm ramming you're ramming someone was just here i think wait i don't even think i need any because i have well what else could i get oh he's on roof

supposed to be right ahead just just oh there he's at the wall i got a couple armor hits on him i'm closing explosive uav i don't know if there was another there was another they were hiding in cemeteries that's actually not a bad idea there's a lot of places to like you can blend in there mm-hmm he was probably just baiting his teammate unless somebody's got a uav and you don't ghost then you're kind of screwed or like somebody do you have a plate box i can draw from a rooftop or something i'm good do you have another uav in pocket no i got an airstrike get in swap swap with me you drive [Music] online [Music] two inside ground though i think we push those guys out oh i think they're going up to roof nope too ground it on the desk broke armor eliminated but not i'm going to check backside we still got that guy on the roof team wipe on one okay we still got that on the roof do you want to try to push it together slinging a stunner no hit okay should i play range here and see if i can get an angle or push with you uh i'll push with i got my stuff back in a second here i got air strike too maybe he jumped maybe he jumped during the gunfire sniper shots at us there shouldn't be one super i think or maybe that guy came over from super actually maybe it's just a straight what if he was just lagging in the air above this place um could be someone just called in a loadout i think yeah oh yeah police i don't know just in the field out there he's landing on it his buddy he's landing on it you're pinging me feel them there if you do you want to drive over to them they're running kind of towards the yellow house yeah do you want to parachute over and over okay they're in the field no no okay yeah no i missed oh no did he cross yeah they're both back there on the hill air striking there we go the female will hurt on the back side of the hill did you air strike him yeah he's went left he went left he's in the parking lot to your left going in he's right here at the wall i can't get out what the okay didn't let me out any more plates good eyes on that spot um no i'll be good with this okay thank god for the trophy system i just baited the vehicle and me still stuck in it yeah but i knew you weren't gonna die because the trophy was there right right there on blue nice dude you're still i'm still hydrated all day holy what is happening here that extra mag capacity just saved us oh my god oh my gosh dude what happened to this guy's body well we got fat money now i'm gonna get this boundary yeah i'm insane you're nuts dude we got so much money let's go get a self res again grab this truck drive through our vehicle or we just go to our vehicle because we still got the trophy on it yeah let's do that good call rams not bad man pretty good it's just been a while since i've used it which one the ram yeah yeah it's good it does a lot of damage you can control it it uh does very well that's the thing it does it doesn't feel like i really need to control much um yeah it's not bad i've never driven through here before i got off see if i kill this uh bounty here intercept dude i just saw this guy and he's still in the gas maybe huh all right he didn't come on my side so he's got to be going around the other oh my god he got me he's inside got him now there another wiping right rams nuts you know what this is why ram's nuts what a game i you know it's great playing with aculite everybody always asks what's it like playing with acolyte oh look at how much money i have right now does that answer oh my god oh my god 50k bro this isn't even stimulus okay we need to go buy i have an airstrike we should go buy we should go buy for sure good luck what if a fire sale came on right now oh my god don't say that ah just buy a couple of uavs that's not a big deal okay there counters up uav entering the ao i almost want to just call in here i'm just going to air strike so i'm grinding out of you have a gas mask yeah i'm good with that do we need an armor box dude i got an extra gas mask for fun i got an ammo box right now you i got an armor i'll take i'll get an ammunitions box then okay can we call in like 50 uavs and then we don't even use it we just stand there and keep buying i know right they're shooting at each other i think they're really good broke armor behind the planet he's broke again he crossed over i'll just do this rather not let them uh we got a team on the roof we should definitely wait for that zone to be to be out of zone i mean it's about to be out those guys are probably going to jump off though we might be able to beam them do you want to take the hill on the left here i'd like no cause red roofs would be it's going to be out it's going to be out yes yes good call i think we tried they just pushed it over and get on red roof here we can get on the other one oh one just over to the east guys on the roof to your left careful copy copy copy dude i'm breaking everybody's armor but i'm not not killing anybody this guy might not come up what the heck that's a weird shot stunned him [Music] edge of this roof is in but oh we got this other team yeah it's okay you can take them down nice down can you remove your pink oh it's mine oh should i airstrike it uh no i think he went in okay i think he just fell down in we should probably think about dropping off um i think actually maybe not we're still we're still in it's two teams one in there and one on the counter it just sucks like if there's a guy in there he can just walk out and beam us again i'm gonna air strike it see if i can get right there okay i'm gonna drop off okay yeah there's definitely a guy in here this is a vehicle there you're losing ground unless everyone's rotating zones rotating these out back two of them down one first out dad found him get down i'm parachuting now i thought there was more for some reason all right what are these ram plays like damn dude 18 kills we had a lot of kills there oh you got like four back to back now yeah we've won a lot today they've been good games too i think it's because we've been playing pretty smart like we're not just throwing it on people yeah we're not just over sending it we're definitely we're thinking about thinking it through a little bit just a little bit a little bit not too much there's definitely been some good reactions from you to save us yeah that one guy i thought he was the only guy on the kill contract and then i heard one footstep and you're like there's another one you
