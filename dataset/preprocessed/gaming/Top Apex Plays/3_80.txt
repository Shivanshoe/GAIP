let's get into today's clips so guys from today's video title you can probably tell this is another special episode of top apex plays we'll be focusing on some of the craziest and most random fails that we've ever uploaded on the channel everything from friendly fire with grenades driving tridents into places that they shouldn't be and zip lines that lead your team to an unfortunate end all of that and so much more failure as we all know we can't always be lucky in apex legends anyways without further delay we hope you enjoy graveling [Laughter] when you're in a gunfight and you come out as the victor always be sure it's safe to celebrate before you do flying solo and i still made kill later oh my god what let's check this quadrant charging a machine 5. all right just speed up some luton

there's just no escape from the grenade that was even bravely run away oh hello look out grenade paint [Laughter] oh [Laughter] recharging shields [Laughter] who else remembers when this gravity

somewhere what [Music] [Music] [Music] oh you don't want to be like this this is disgusting this is awful in every way if i could kill it i would but i legally can't but i've considered it we
