[Music] hey guys this is isaadeptic and welcome to top apex plays if you'd like one of your clips featured in our videos complete the form in the description below but without further delay let's get into today's clips out one minute at the whole squad down so did you know that there's a quicker way to remove watson fences instead of picking them up simply snap your fingers and remove any last node that you place down oh it's near every now and then you come across an enemy that isn't really an enemy and sometimes they give you free stuff what's that sound full squad in apex we know that the crater is powerful we know that the volt smg is powerful but we also now know that these cable cars are equally as scary setting a portal so guys now that we are fairly into season 13 people are looking ahead to the future of what's coming next and of course we'll be getting some events happening this season apex legends data miner someone who leaks found this banner in the files showing off a killing time limited time banner despite this ltn returning we don't actually know when we'll be getting it or which event it will be part of however there's been a lot of discussion about a potentially time travel themed event in the future for apex legends now of course if you've been playing apex for a while you'll remember the genesis event where we went back in time to revisit original king's canyon and original world's edge which in the community was very much loved however those maps were only around for a short period of time and people wanted more further evidence to support that this may be the case is that respawn developers such as connor ford or as you may know him hideouts recently posted a poll on twitter asking about original apex legends stating i'm curious would anyone ever like to see an og apex ltm from apex legends space characters and day one weapons only and perhaps just king's canyon it's highly unlikely that we'd go back to an original apex legends experience with all the weapon stats being changed to how they were on launch but for some elements such as maps like king's canyon and world's edge we can definitely see them returning again let us know what you think in the comment section down below and if an event like this happens what do you want to see most [Music] [Applause] so after finishing up in this imc armory a team pulled off the old strat by placing a trident above the jump pad in the middle effectively nullifying this rampart's escape however what happens when the trident they use to trap you becomes your escape plan [Music] firing enemy shield in storm point always be careful when flying over these big mountain areas because some of those places can actually get you stuck and lead you to an unfortunate end shut him up good [Applause] up back [Music] kilda hooligans that's a wrap on today's video don't forget you can send us your clips using the form linked in the description below be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications for more top apex plays videos this has been isodeptic and i'll catch you next time run through the money the press will be calling my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdie is back tell me i'm garbage i'm going through something that's why i ain't calling phone and progression it's all that i wanted to follow and effects and i summon it because i got problems on problems on problems on problems on problems or problems i solve them i run through the money the pressure be calling left on my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdies back tell me
