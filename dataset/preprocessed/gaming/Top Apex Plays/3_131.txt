[Music] hey guys this is izadeptik and welcome to top apex plays if you'd like one of your clips featured in our videos complete the form in the description below but without further delay let's get into today's clips all right no no yes oh right here sometimes when you're playing as fuse you don't need to see your enemy to take him down we wipe the bloody floor with that squad [Music] [Laughter] are you [Laughter] oh after this valkyrie got her team attached and launched straight up it couldn't have gone any smoke worse so fast [Music] [Music] so guys if you play apex legends quite a lot you'll probably be max level which is currently level 500 and like many of us we've been wanting to get above the level cap of 500 for a very long time and possibly have the introduction of a prestige system similar to call of duty currently the system works where you go from level 0 to 500 earning gun charms and badges to display on your apex profile however across social media recently the prestige idea has come back into talks and there are a lot of ways in which people would like to see respawn address this now why haven't we got this system already well this may be because of cross progression currently we know that in apex legends cross play is very much a thing but cross progression isn't just yet and so this is believed to be the reason why we don't have any increase to the level cap as yet think about it if you wanted to move from pc to console or console to pc you'd probably want to take your account with you however currently you can't do that and so you would lose any level progress you currently have so the theory as goes is once that cross progression is in place a prestige system and level cap will be increased for players just as a side note it's also mentioned that we should be getting cross progression sometime this year not only would this allow us to show off new badges and reach greater heights but we're also curious as to what the reward may be for actually reaching a top tier level and prestiging if you have any cool ideas for what this could be let us know in the comment section down below [Music] so in case you haven't seen it yet there's a rare lobby animation where a marvin bot comes up to sear for an autograph oh [Music] on storm point at the barometer location these players were able to somehow glitch this rampart into a bridge all right oh yo where are you are you after being knocked this octane was self-reviving but got a massive help from a friendly fusel this all allowed them to safely revive and retrieve their banners it's [Applause] uh fighting immediately she missed literally all her shots bullets [Applause] idiots oh new team reloading that's a wrap on today's video don't forget you can send us your clips using the form linked in the description below be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications for more top apex plays videos this has been isodeptic and i'll catch you next time run through the money the press will be calling my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdies back tell me i'm garbage i'm going through something that's why i ain't calling phone and progression it's all that i wanted to follow and effects and i summon it cause i got problems on problems on problems on problems and problems so problems i solve them i run through the money the pressure be calling left on my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdies back tell me
