[Music] recharging shields [Music] hey guys this is izadeptik and welcome to top apex plays if you'd like one of your clips featured in our videos complete the form in the description below but without further delay let's get into today's clips [Laughter] lookout incapacitated sometimes you may lose your gunfight but if your enemy decides to stand there and gloat they may get hit with some karma a tear to give us here another taken down sometimes the hardest part about apex legends is trying to pick up the right weapon here reloading [Music] all right it seems now in the firing range ammo respawns much quicker something nice and a good little tweak for anyone testing out weapons [Music] dude i needed that that's what i was looking for bro [Music] [Music] so guys the time has finally arrived happy season 11 launch day we hope all of you have great fun on the brand new map using ash the brand new legend and shooting down fools with the brand new car smg not to mention if you're getting the new battle pass then great because that's the subject of today's topic so there's been some discussion around social media as to whether in the future there'll be more heirlooms added to the game and with more heirlooms being added the option to switch between one or two between each legend and the reason this is struck up is because of a shot at the beginning of this battle pass trailer here we see gibby using this ground emo that's brand new to the season spinning around a fire lit twirling stick now not only does this look awesome but other legends in their ground emotes seem to have items of their own such as fuses guitar crypto's handheld game controller watson's nessie plush toy and some others that you'll find scattered throughout legends ground emotes so we pose the question to you and the community that are already discussing this could this mean that heirlooms may become more frequent in the future and if so could we see gibby wielding this fire twirling stick with apex legends releasing editions of the game such as the very recent lobo edition that came out today we can only imagine that in the future there'll be more ways for us to spend our money on the things that we want to show off that potentially being multiple heirlooms for each legend so what do you think let us know in the comments section down below ready in some cases if at first you don't succeed with your weapon just throw it off the map oh got one enemy down reloading reloading seeing this cute little nessie get a bump on the head was just too much for this enemy bloodhound [Music] fart is unapologetic as am i finish him [Music] what [ __ ] [ __ ] is this this is death or glory not a race where you get the prize for participation [Music] one more one more [Music] right the [ __ ] it well guess i will die oh guys right here is that's a wrap on today's video don't forget you can send us your clips using the form linked in the description below be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications for more top apex plays videos this has been ice at eptic and i'll catch you next time right through the money the press will be calling left on my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdies back tell me i'm garbage i'm going through something that's why i ain't calling phone and progression it's all that i wanted to follow and effects and i summon it cause i got problems on problems on problems on problems on problems so problems i solve them i run through the money the pressure be calling left on my blessings i feel like i'm falling the birdies back tell me
