i found a crazy easter egg if you look on the nulati background you will see the matcha team leader very sassy right well if you go to the new collider location and then fly into the collider three times one two three you will be teleported to this strange location if you look closely it is the same location as the lobby background this place is so strange could this be an easter egg for the next season or the event i think they are trying to rebuild the mecca team leader to fight the monster again look here you can see his arm and then if you go to him you see it is missing [Music] what could this mean does this mean that the og map is coming back like for part two
