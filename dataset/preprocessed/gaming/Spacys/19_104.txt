i was just trying to play a match of solos but the battle bus left me behind i was the only person left on spawn island well that's what i thought till i ended up finding another player they seemed as confused as me he was super nice and friendly [Applause] then zone started to come so we swam all the way to the main island after hours of swimming we made it safely we said our goodbyes and then parted ways later that game i saw this player in trouble so i saved him [Music] it turned out to be the same player from the lobby i decided to give him the win [Music] please help me find him
