[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with ghost of tsushima if you enjoy this video please become a priest and whenever people come to confession simply say that all will be forgiven if they subscribe to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel so here i am in a beautiful forest with my uncle aggressively chasing me around in circles i was hoping to have fun playing this game and not be reminded of memories i'd suppressed but i guess it's time to stand up for myself i attack my uncle but every time i hit him he just asks to be hit harder fast forward several years and now i'm a samurai which is pretty cool but on the less cool side this idealistic island i call home is being invaded by the mongols a little known fact about me is that i completed a phd on the art of being a samurai before i started my youtube channel or you know whatever i watched the movie the last samurai with japanese subtitles on so same thing anyway my uncle from earlier gets captured during the fight which is ironic but yeah i find myself fighting his captor in an attempt to save the big girl this is a real debate though as it seems as if you can win this duel but no matter what you do you eventually get thrown off a bridge and die well implausibly i didn't actually die as i wake up on the beach the last time i woke up on a beach was because i drank too much and made such a fool of myself my now ex-girlfriend broke up with me i can't believe she ended things because i got a little tipsy i was just living my best life or maybe it was because i had intimate relations with her sister mum and dad but yeah what an overreaction on her behalf ah well at least i've got my trusty horse and if this isn't cinematic i don't know what is look at me riding through the fields but then reality sets in and i go and ride on the footpath because this is a god damn society so i need to rescue my uncle and it's time to start looking for leads in this big open world i approach a fort and i believe that's a man impaled on a stick right at the front gates which doesn't exactly scream welcome home maybe put a tasteful hat on him or something but yeah it seems the mongols have taken over this village unfortunately i'm a pretty big deal and can swing a katana like a champ i'm literally also a lord so if you're not going to bow to me i'll probably slice you up pretty aggressively some would call that an abuse of power but i didn't spend my entire childhood training to be a samurai not to be bound to probably wouldn't have hurt to have arrived here 15 minutes earlier but oh well my heart was in the right place let's move on i decide to jog because i'm not going to let a mongol invasion ruined my exercise routine they might be butchering the local families but they're not butchering this physique i continue exploring and come across some farmers and it finally happens i'm finally shown some respect thank you for bowing mate i don't know if you didn't get the memo lady but i'm a lord samurai so it's probably best if you bow and then you can get back to being a depressed rice farmer i don't believe i stuttered so i proceed to do what all good lords have to do sometimes unfortunately it looks like you can't hurt the innocent so i guess well played sucker punch productions you got me this time alright look i've gotta get in character and act more like a samurai so that this video can be ranked the number one most immersive educational gaming video of all time i have a friend who may have information on my uncle so i decide to go and meet up with her who knows she could be the positive influence i so desperately need right now and wow we're actually expected to live life according to the bushido the way of the warrior and demonstrate complete self-discipline i proceed to squat up and down on his lifeless body so that my nuts repetitively smack him in the forehead alright her friend has been captured and she said if we save him then she'll help us save our uncle later he's being held at this camp but if we alert the mongols they'll execute him and all the prisoners immediately which could be funny but no will have to be sneaky ah yes early video game stealth segments where all the enemies are conveniently looking in the wrong direction so that we the player can get used to the controls you love to see it i find one of the cells and so i bust on in there and bro i wasn't expecting a parade but a simple thank you would have been nice you're really going to sit there giving me the silent treatment i swear to god some people at least this guy is more appreciative and he tells us that stabby girl's friend is being held at guantanamo bay well i can't actually remember the name of the bay but we plan to go there and rescue him as hopefully our uncle is there too honestly her friend is probably dead but it's cute that she's hopeful man all this murder is exhausting i think i've earned a bath unfortunately i arrive at some natural hot springs so let's go samurai were historically well known for and i quote sending it for the boys and so i proceeded to send it off the top of this cliff instead of being greeted by scores of beautiful women it's just this one guy in his underwear who has objectively terrible posture i guess you can't have sinful pre-marital relations if there are no women anywhere so that's a pretty smart play here's another fun accurate historical fact the japanese were christian and jesus was the first ever samurai i picked the flowers out of the vase in front of everyone to assert dominance this guy then shows me where the town sensei lives as he wants me to meet him are you even a sensei if you don't live on top of a mountain with precariously built mossy stairs this is my guy and i've gotta say mate the man bun bold top haircut combo makes you look like a registered sex offender we proceed to do more stereotypical sensei stuff like walking really slowly while looking epic out of nowhere a gaggle of mongols jump ass but fortunately i have one piece of armor on my right shoulder so as long as they only attack that one specific shoulder i should be perfectly fine like they'd even get a swipe in though as i'm truly a big fish in a small pond some would say i'm a big boy at a small boy's pond and insert other pond metaphors here that help demonstrate how big and powerful i am the sensei then has something to tell me and so he runs up and stands uncomfortably close to my face do you not understand the concept of personal space or do you want a little bros smooch because i can honestly work with either one he actually just gives me a bow which is kind of him because now whenever a fight gets too hard i can just run away and shoot arrows from a distance unfortunately for the big man this is where his journey ends holy [ __ ] he took that like a soldier did it even flinch or look at me i'm out of here thanks for the beau grandpa so to rescue stabby girl's friend and my uncle we will need help as it'll be quite a battle it's time to win over the trust of the local militia groups which is almost certainly not what i should be referring to them as first though i crack out the flute and play a little hot cross buns fire here's a pro tip for you if you want to seduce a woman simply whip out a float or recorder and blow your way to a better future i arrive at a bridge and this guy needs my help him and the people of his village were forced to flee but the mongols won't let them cross over and i'm personally just struggling to see how this is my problem i do decide to help but i don't care about his family i just want the xp so i can upgrade my fighting abilities this reminds me of the other day when this kid asked if i could buy him a six pack of beer so i took his money and then punched him in the nose and walked off there's no moral to that story anyway the coast is clear you may now cross the bridge and i suppose the whole bowing thing has just gone out the window huh you're all peasants i'm the lord you realize that now you're all crying jesus it looks like the mongols had you trapped but in reality you were all trapped by your pathetic little emotions after witnessing the biggest sook of 1274 a.d i need another bath and so i eat myself down into the inviting river below is there nothing fresh water can't fix i can't just swim all day though as we desperately need more allies i meet this lovely woman and assist her with renovating her home i'm kidding it gets really dark again this monk where stalking helped the mongols slaughter her entire village including the children honestly i feel bad for her but she's genuinely the worst stalker i've ever seen and we keep almost getting spotted i guess she hasn't had the same covert training i've had when i used to sneak into my neighbor's house and smell her panties i mean playing spotlight with my mates the monk leads us to a mongol camp and we approach them and talk it out like adults because sometimes words solve conflict better than weapons ever could kidding we kill everyone again without even double checking that they were the bad guys which actually seems pretty irresponsible we have a quick chat and decide to keep the monk alive for questioning but i guess my friend forgot because yeah that's honestly pretty bad self-control on your part big girl i help her get revenge on the guys who killed her village because xp gains and it looks like there's one survivor in this building do you want to come over here and slash this defenseless person up for no reason as well you psychopath anyway she says thanks and that she'll join us when we raid the bay sweet the art style of this game is actually so nice but yeah i come across some suspicious clues also known as fresh corpses something went down here recently and i detect this because if you look very carefully you can see this guy is still alive and crawling around in agony as a noble samurai i think i meant to end someone's life who's suffering as we always take the high road i then run into an old friend who is the leader of the straw hats which is pretty lame but at least they're sun safe we're ambushed and have to fight our way out of this mess together through the power of friendship trust and me bumping the difficulty down a level we emerge victorious as a result he and the other straw hats agree to help me when i raid the bay which is nice of them i will move mountains fight armies sail seas and do anything else it takes to rescue my uncle so he can inappropriately touch me one last time this game is actually cool i really like it but not as much as i like you thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
