carefully making your way through one of the lovingly crafted hitman levels to eliminate the intended target like a professional assassin leaves potential witnesses moving through a location eliminating literally everyone like a psychotic alpha chad is the future today we'll be visiting the biggest bank in new york city we're not going to be opening a super saver account however we're going to be murdering a lot of evil rich people and several innocent employees and customers who just wanted to cash their birthday checks i've put the difficulty on master meaning a single gunfight could end everything and we'll have to rest out the mission i also haven't taken any lethal guns or equipment i'm bringing a tranquilizer a feather duster and several blueberry muffins should i discover that i'm allergic to dust mats or get hungry i'll be absolutely chilling so the first thing i notice is the mission is called golden handshake thank god i'm always sufficiently hydrated i guess i line up for a while waiting to be served and to truly immerse myself in the mundane banking cue system i then decide to cut the line and proceed to steal this woman's can of soda right out of a stupid little basket i walk over to the security guard who saw everything and stare into his eyes and he doesn't say a single word line cutting harassment of women petty theft and he's not even bothered i then pick up this slippery when wet sign which will surely lead to a cheap life or two the security guard then brutally guns me down in front of everybody so i suppose he's just extremely passionate about workplace safety on that note make sure to like the video if you made it through heroin-free january and congratulations that's a huge achievement round two and i decide this time to head over to the bathrooms it looks like this bank has co-ed facilities which i can't imagine would go down well with my homie jesus christ taking a pre-marital dump right next to a woman is far more intimate than sleeping with her i grab a fire extinguisher off the wall and use it to clobber them both over the head i then snap their little necks take his pistol which is huge hide the bodies in a laundry basket change into the security disguise and of course put the fire extinguisher back exactly where i found it in case of an emergency i don't want to get shot again over another failed safety procedure with my new clothes i'm able to access the upper floors i find a bank manager sitting by herself making for an easy target it's apparently an interview room but i interview her face with my feather duster it's hard to play the feather duster off as badass as it's not even one of the cooler cleaning tools like who even needs a duster just get a wet cloth that works better i'm considering starting a cleaning tips and tricks channel but for now we need to find the armory and get some bigger guns i decide to lay a trap and so i drop my gun on the floor so that a patrolling guard picks it up he's like oh my god some silly goose dropped their pistol no need to sound the alarm it's just an unexplained firearm on the ground it's not like someone did an actual terrorist act such as moving a slippery when wet floor caution sign i follow him through the bank and realize another problem we have is all of these security cameras on master difficulty there are loads of them so disabling them is a high priority the plan works and he leads me right to the security room i sneak in and take down the cameras now we can kill without being judged i head into a private staff bathroom and burst in on some larrikin banging lines off the bin you can tell he's good at equity trading as he suffers from addiction and his tyres flung over his shoulder as he's too busy to fix it i eliminate him and take his clothes thank god agent 47 stayed consistent and also flung the tie over his shoulder otherwise people may have realized that we weren't the same person too many people on this floor know that i'm an imposter so i head downstairs and locate a break room i figure i'm acting a little awkward so i try and do some normal office stuff and turn on the photocopier clearly agent 47 doesn't understand how it works and paper starts rapidly firing out instead of offering a helping hand to a fellow employee who's struggling this woman goes to snitch on me so i punch her in the nose apparently i don't know my own strength as many guards hear this and the situation begins to escalate at alarming rates i understand whistleblowing when one of the accountants is laundering money for their people trafficking mafia uncle but all i did was incorrectly use a photocopier these people's ethical codes are confusing i put some mileage between me and the break room they're trying to contain the situation but didn't actually close down the bank they're not going to let a few corpses stop that red hot investment hustle which i think we can all respect i steal this guy's crowbar because why not it immediately and somewhat surprisingly comes in clutch as i use it to beat this grandma to death i then noticed there's someone in one of the cubicles and so i bust that open with my new tool and sure enough there's some jump inside i put on his disguise and it says job applicant this is an interesting development as if i could get a job here i could destroy the company from within i follow the interview signs and approach the reception desk excited for my new career path ugh please go away you're so not in my league the same's unnecessarily hurtful but i find a lot of solace in the fact that i'll be viciously murdering her sometime soon i find the interview room and after quite some time i realize i've broken the game remember when i murdered that woman with the feather duster well she was on the interview panel so now i can't show them what a great little banker i'd be i handle this like a professional and begin projecting my frustration onto anyone i can find i even pull out a gun and fire like a madman completely throwing the mission you see i studied accounting at university before i became a youtuber and i never got to interview for a big firm so this is kind of a big deal for me also it maybe probably will help us complete the challenge so it's worth a restart i proceed to die a warrior's death flashbanged and forever labelled as mentally unstable this time things are going to be different i head upstairs beat the grandma to death again and of course mr big nuts and then make my way towards the front desk in my applicant outfit the receptionist is very happy to see me now that she knows i'm an accountant my old accounting mates and i used to always laugh about how much girls wanted us women don't want money or muscles they want innovative and sound statistical excel spreadsheets hello jared angus and dan i hope you're having huge big sex i approached the interview and it's quite nerve-wracking well at least it was until i noticed all the answers to their questions are on the posters behind them unfortunately agent 47 is also an expert at seamlessly blending in and answering the questions in such a way that doesn't make it seem like he's about to try and kill everybody the scene is reflected in a pool of blood flowing from the body that's very graphic mr thomas yes i get the job and this may be the happiest day of my life i message my mom saying i got a job at a huge bank in new york city and she replied with hooray a real job at last one i can tell my friends about clapping emoji i've beaten the same grandma to death twice yet that response is still the most savage thing that's happened today i disable the security cameras again and then use my new disguise to head upstairs to the highest possible level i'm welcome but only if i agree to being searched why is it always the white guy who gets frisked this kind of racial profiling makes me sick to my stomach not all white guys are terrorists well actually by definition i think i am but they got lucky the upper floors are where the real investment magic is happening these guys are some of the most honest professionals who truly care about managing people's money the only people who are more noble than these brave men and women are nft sellers nft sellers are genuine and what they're doing definitely isn't a pyramid scheme that's why i'm happy to announce the new modest pelican nft collection if you want one simply paypal me say ten thousand dollars and then just screenshot one of these only screenshot if you pay for it though and only one person per image pinky promise i reach the lion's den the ceo's office an employee a guard and an electronic lock system are blocking me from entering the key card is on his desk and so i throw one of my muffins to distract him it doesn't really work he just stands there for a moment and then does a frankly clean 360 chair sit i throw a second muffin and this guy hits another 360 chair sit i'm being clipped on by an executive assistant and it does not feel good eventually i make it happen and grab the card this gives me access to a pretty disappointing break room so i turn off the wi-fi modem funnily enough this is what my mom used to do when i wouldn't do my homework i never thought the same tactic would work at an international bank they really need to upgrade their systems her office is also quite disappointing not a lot of natural light it's got a sad vibe it wouldn't hurt to bang in a skylight and maybe put a few pot plants around but hey i'm no interior designer i'm just a humble disappointment to my mother the only part of the building i haven't scouted is the basement so i make my way down there once we've cleared that it's time to commence the purge i make my way inside and get frisked again like at what point do i speak to hr i'm a valued employee now i head into the lock boxes and there's the woman i robbed earlier standing on her toes balancing on her stupid basket throwing shapes not only is this a truly impressive display of calf strength it also solves the mystery of what wealthy women do when they're banking given the growing suspicion around my strange behavior it's time to start killing i head into the tech room and there's a guy playing a crappy game that clearly has less bugs than battlefield 2042 if you know you know i fire a tranquilizer into him and then break his neck while hiding the body i stumble across the server room so i just start turning everything off as the more chaos the better this works well as when people come to investigate the disturbance i kill them too i then decide why not just pull the fire alarm and send this place into a complete spiral sure enough the guards go into a frenzy look at this man going around combat ready for a firefight i guess his plan is to shoot the fire to death with a shotgun another more senior guard heads into a closet so i follow him in and smack him over the head with an iron i picked up earlier if you've got a crinkled shirt no one will take you seriously we've now got a great disguise and an hx7 submachine gun that we can open carry i proceeded to come out of the closet but not in a brave inspirational way in more of a literal way i head upstairs and realise this so-called bank is worse than we first realized many of the staff have to work in this glass cage with no privacy whatsoever and i imagine it would make watching adult videos on your lunch break incredibly challenging but not impossible i can't just stand around making tasteful workplace observations though i'm a busy man i begin again starting in the low traffic areas every guard i take down stealthily is one less i'll have to inevitably fight when the shooting starts i bust into a cubicle and there's a couple debating whether they should rob the bank or not honestly feels like something you should decide at home that's just poor foresight and planning also my guy had a mac 10 on him and chose to have a panic attack instead of defending his woman imagine choosing to have a panic attack that's kind of cringe i attempt to use a photocopier again and lure over a guard i also found a briefcase so for the people in my comment section who get mad whenever i don't equip a briefcase this one's for you at this point i'm really getting aggressive like that was a knife thrown into a cleaner's head it's all good though i bet she thinks dusters are a crucial cleaning apparatus i locate a second security wing and just stroll in because i'm part of the gang i slit the throats of two guards and one of them bleeds all over the desk and keyboard this wouldn't be such a big deal if i hadn't just murdered the cleaner once that blood dries that keyboard will never be the same again and trust me i'd know my keyboard got covered in well it doesn't matter what it got covered in the point is i have a couple of shotguns that i'll remember for later i continue the sneaky approach of luring unsuspecting men and well actually just men as women aren't allowed to be guards in this game i did once ask my girlfriend anna to watch my seat at a wedding we went to and when i came back one of our friends was sitting in my seat so honestly great decision by the developers no of course it's to do with the disguise mechanic as agent 47 wouldn't be fooling too many people if he came out wearing a corset or you know whatever female guards wear i wouldn't know as the hitman franchise never taught me i slit this tech support guy's throat covering him in blood i then hide the body in the closet and back up in the ceo's office i decide to make a stunning and certainly brave play this is the moment when agent 47 went from the game version of himself to the movie version i almost calculated everything but as i throw my knife at blondie he just managed to get a bullet off before going down shots fired in the ceo's office isn't ideal the entire detail swarms in and i perch behind a side table blind firing i'm one shot away from death actually one shot not the one shot your friends call out in shooter games i escape into the break room as the remaining guards try and rescue the vip i figure i might as well take another fight now i don't like to be judgey but they do a truly awful job of keeping the ceo safe they didn't even have their guns out like it just doesn't seem a logical time to holster your weapon given a bald dude just emptied three mags into your comrades this is a big win but these suited lads aren't my biggest concern as they only use pistols i can take a few pistol shots but the fully automatic weapons the guards downstairs have mean another mistake like that and i'm dead while i'm up here i do a textbook breach and clear on the investment guys upstairs they offer little resistance it's poland all over again the banks still won't give anyone a personal day they all just get ordered back to their duties it's quite a toxic work environment if they don't start treating their staff better then they're going to have some serious morale issues if there are any survivors i hope they join a union and get treated properly as the only way to rally against big business is to do it together i noticed the photocopier i turned on earlier is still on and so i rush over to switch it off i'm trying to kill everyone here not the amazon i then change back into my job applicant outfit as i feel i need the powers of this green vest thing to get me through the final testing moments the only thing stronger than diamond is the will of an accountant i take out the first guard with a knife he was sleeping and i'm pretty sure the guys down here don't know what happened upstairs their security protocols are a joke that being said on the positive side no one will be slipping on spilt liquids so pros and cons using the maze of lock boxes i weave in and out picking them off one by one the more i kill the more my confidence grows and this leads to an extremely dangerous situation thinking all the guards are dead i tactically breach and clear the main foyer of the bank and it's all going swimmingly if not pretty sadistically all of a sudden a whole bunch of guards come out of nowhere and almost take me down right there on the finish line unfortunately i managed to escape and then do the mature thing and camp out in the bathroom until it's over i then go around the bank winning gunfight after gunfight it's extremely impressive i'll take this moment to invite you to my discord server we're running a stage event tomorrow where you can ask questions live and pretty good time to join i proceeded to make a water bottle mural which took way longer than i care to admit kind of beautiful though 0 out of 5 star mission rating i'll admit that if you're looking at this from how the game's meant to be played then yes there was some collateral damage but it still seems harsh if you enjoyed this video i appreciate you hitting like and thanks for watching i'll see you guys very soon with a dying light 2 video i love you lots [Music]
