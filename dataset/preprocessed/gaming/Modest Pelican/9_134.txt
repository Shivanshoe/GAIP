[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with JTA if you enjoyed this video please persuade Vladimir Putin to hire you as part of his new Russian government so you can influence the nation about my content as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in Los Santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories all right so today we are going to rob the casino it's actually happening first though I need to clear something up a few people have said the sons of virgins aunt gangster when we definitely are like stealth our motto might have only been five foot four in high school but now he's a registered sex offender and Crosby accidentally said the N word once and we all identify as straight white males which in 2020 is probably more stunning and brave than identifying as anything else we keep our socks and sandals on when we have sinful premarital sex and I barely ever wash my hands before dinnertime so yeah we're pretty gangster also you might wonder how we actually exist if our parents are virgins well like I've said before Jesus is a son of a virgin and I'm not saying we all like Jesus but yeah I'm definitely implying that if you're not 100% convinced that we're the most gangster gamers in the world yet just to look at how sassy stealth our motto is when he shakes his index finger okay so we've got a couple more heist preps to do and then we should be good first up we need to get a security pass I feel like this is the 15th security pass we've got but anyway we need to sneak into this woman's house and steal the pass this home invasion mission is an immersive experience for Crosby and diet but stealth amato says it doesn't compare to the real thing I then steal a police cruiser to get away and the boys and I decide to do some GTA roleplay please pull over your vehicle all right as you can see I've pulled out a shotgun and if you move this car I'll shoot you in the head license and registration kinds whoa can you take that can you take that bag off your head um I'm so sorry I didn't realize you guys were Caucasian have a great day next heist prep is helping out a rapper called a young ancestor who sounds like a once in a generation musical talent basically he wants us to dump this rental car he has which seems innocent enough I guess we can help you out chief no problem we then roll the car which breaks off the boot and discover that there's a dead hooker in the back Wow young ancestor is an absolute idiot I mean who does that who throws out a 1000 thread-count high-quality Sheriden bed sheet just to soak it in a bucket of warm water with some oxy clean and the bloodstains will come right out this is what Gretta tunberg is talking about we need to stop this consumer wastefulness and start recycling if everyone bans together and starts reusing bloody bed sheets the environment will be fine anyway we give the body to some cannibals so that they can get rid of the corpse and I for one I'm glad to see that at least to this community of savages is recycling we also helped young ancestor destroy some evidence and I borrowed Crosby's flying motorbike to do this I know I've been saying I want to buy one of these bikes but I've changed my mind as it's just too easy and boring I'd rather drive around in a nice car pretending I'm not dead inside we then have to steal some power drills from a construction site one of my subscribers joins the game and his car has an anime girl decal I've recently noticed that most of my subscribers have anime girl decals so I'm not sure what that says about my community but anyway look at how realistic this construction site is all the workers appear to be moving around but none of them are actually doing any work that's a mind-blowing realism the elaborateness of this heist preparation didn't slow down there though as we then pretended to be garbage men so we could plant trash bags filled with bugs at the say no and then later pretend to be the pest inspectors yep if you have Geoff's YouTube content it's good I'm gonna play a Geoff's Channel Crosby trying to pick up the scab ago you want lion just stares at her intently all right mod I take up this game I kill with white wine all right my k/d is 3.2 no no no it is 5.7 no no it is there's a puddle on the ground oh yeah now though it's time to get serious it's time to heist wow that sounded so cringe but yeah we have a big decision to make we can either go with the sensible option and disguise ourselves as pest inspectors or go for the reckless option and enter as young ancestors entourage you know your boys went as the cringe entourage and I got cosby'd to spit some top-shelf mumble rap because here at modest Pelican gaming we are all about that immersion well that's deep you're a lyrical genius Crosby also I wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone who donated to any charity supporting those affected by the Australian bushfires I leaved a donation page in a recent video and many of you helped out and I really appreciate it if you still wanted to donate a link a GoFundMe page that is being organized through click and yeah thanks again you legends we meet young ancestor who seems like a cool headed a lad who is in control of his surroundings and just kidding he shoots a yoga instructor for no reason so we quickly bail probably shouldn't have gone with the disguises that are dependent on the guy who killed a hooker and fed the body to cannibals but you live and you learn at least we're inside and now it's all about stealth if we don't alert the guards will have longer in the vault to grab the cache and therefore make a lot more money easy claps this is where thick man excels and I'm quietly confident we can pull this off but the catch is we had our silenced weapons taken from us I wait for the guard to walk past me and I proceed to go in for a stealth kill but instead throw some sort of wild knife haymaker I panic and try to stab him again but end up kicking him in the ribs several times while he screams in pain this alerts every one of our presence and just like that we have completely lost the element of surprise now I'm calling [ __ ] on that one chief and but we decide to just to go full steam ahead and shoot everyone likely with a quiet kid in class shortly after we come across our next obstacle keypads that need to be hacked the hacking of these keypads sort of reminds me of Connect four but instead of bonding with a friend in a fun light-hearted competitive game you have to memorize these patterns over and over again until you lose the will to live it's fun for the whole family the best thing about these keypads is as soon as you hack one there's always another one to hack and Crosby found a secondary safe and stole about a hundred thousand dollars from there which was nice but now every time we take damage we lose thousands of dollars because the money is in our bags we are literally bleeding money on top of that mid heist I have to pay wages to my executive assistant so I'm actually going backwards I also don't understand why I'm paying her $300 a day I'm the victim here and I'm offended the boys start drilling into the vault will I stand guard and by stand guard I mean I trashed some of the computer screens while crosby pretends to make phone calls he's using a pretend phone to call his pretend dad it's heartwarming stuff we get into the vault and it's crucial we are efficient as after two minutes a deadly poisonous gas will fill the vault and kill us if we're not careful I proceeded to fill my bag one stack of bills at a time it's the definition of inefficient but just scoop them up in your arms and shove them in the bag champion I guess it's almost impressive how quickly and accurately he is grabbing h1 I haven't seen such inefficient precision since Iran started shooting down commercial planes with one minute left I'm feeling confident I'll get another stack of cash but then surprise another keypad hack excellent news I love these keypad hacks they are greatly enhancing this gameplay experience we take as much as we can which was only a pathetic 660 $3,000 and then the gas comes in so we have to bail we patiently wait for Crosby to exit the vault but his controller disconnects and he doesn't change his batteries fast enough so we fail the mission Wow we redo at all and this time get 1 point 1 3 million much like Jesus we died and then were resurrected to improve the world for mostly ourselves but still uncanny similarities now with all this money on us we have to escape and every time we take even one bullets worth of damage it costs us several thousand dollars it's tense gameplay I was really worried that they weren't going to be any more hacking segments but thank goodness I have to do several more pattern recognition puzzles are exactly how I like to spend my evenings so apparently we set up an escape route as fire fighters that should ideally let us out without too much trouble being the pros we are we accidentally go out the secondary exit which lends us a long way from our secondary getaway vehicles on top of that the boys boys boys have clearly been skipping cardio because we can't move faster than a slow jog if the wheels have officially come off if you're drinking water right now which I hope you are please pour some out for this heist attempt because it's dead well flaying I press up on the d-pad to whistle for my getaway car like how you whistle for a horse in Red Dead Redemption needless to say it surprisingly doesn't work fortunately we managed to get away and Crosby did invest in some solid getaway vehicles and we are finally on our way out of here thank god that's over we then switch cars to lose the heat and meet the buyers who buy our dirty thought cache with their clean Christian money I'm pretty nervous to see how much money I just made but hopefully with the first time bonuses and all that it's decent in two hundred and twenty six thousand nine hundred and ten dollars what the actual [ __ ] brah I could have just worked as my own executive assistant and made more money I mean I know we didn't execute the heist with precision but still that is so bad we celebrate with champagne that probably costs more than our takings and then Lester hooks up with this Asian lady and is now in a biracial relationship Wow Crosby stands on top of his own skimpy anime girl sedan and then shoots himself in the head the seriously I'm pretty sure if you draw a Venn diagram of the skimpy anime girl community and my community it would be a perfect circle on the positive side we have almost 1.4 million dollars and it's time to make some purchases but firstly motto decides to buy himself a top-class practical vehicle a nine hundred thousand dollars spent on a deluxe ride-on lawn mower he would have to do the entire heist another three times to break even but now great purchase mate he customizes it so the decal says the cherry Papa always on top you always remember your first these sex offender jokes are carrying more weight with every single video I swear it doesn't even have a reverse gear you have to use your feet like the Flintstones quite a questionable purchase I decide to buy myself a mansion in Vinewood Hills which is also debatably a huge waste of money but it's definitely a nice place with a feature that actually blew my mind an indoor waterfall had I known it had an indoor waterfall beforehand I would have paid triple of the water pools at the bottom so the ferns can stay hydrated it's so beautiful I'm in trouble when people realize 90% of my content is just hydration references but anyway the heist is done and we have a new house which is pretty baller I also put all my cars in this garage most of them are just the free ones you can get because robbing casinos pays less than most unskilled jobs US bank robbers need to start a union it's a joke how little we earn so thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
