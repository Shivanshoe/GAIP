[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with red dead online if you enjoy this video please convince cardi b to change the meaning of her song whap to water and pelicans as this really helps spread the good word of my channel congratulations to zach k for being the first intro chosen you win nothing but you now have all of our respect our story starts in west elizabeth just north of little creek river what an average name for a river but what i'm about to tell you is a tale of toxicity emotion and is also highly arousing so take off your pants and get ready for some questionable content so here i am in the woods getting swarmed by grizzly bears my mate stealthorobo logs on and yes he is a hot female character in literally every single game we play you've gotta admire the dedication he says he just likes looking at the booties while he runs which i think we can all appreciate we ride to strawberry so i can change into my fresh jacket and beanie combo look good feel great we head out to do a little hunting but quickly come across something else entirely if you look closely that's not a real alligator that's a man and he flips off robbo which i don't stand for so i tie him up whilst also explaining that if he tries to escape will simply end his life he wasn't responding but he also wasn't trying to escape so either he can hear us or he likes being tied up i can work with either our prisoner seems a little parched so we throw him into the river so that he can enjoy a drink kind of embarrassing how quickly he drowned but anyway loads more players rock up and suddenly our little hunting trip has turned into a riverside bar mitzvah well actually it's more like a christening because robbie keeps dunking people in the water i send this guy laser beam 272 893 a message asking him to kill everyone which was pretty manipulative of me as i'm guessing he's a pretty young kid i don't know why i did this i guess i've just been playing a lot of among us recently and i now live for setting people up for failure this triggers a chain of violent events and the server begins its inevitable freefall into pure toxicity as the gamer on game of violence escalates normally i'd enter into it and start firing my weapons at will but something comes over me and i feel this deep need to finally bring peace to the wild west this is a bit of a u-turn for my character arc but if i can achieve this goal i'll share quite a few similarities to jesus he turns water into wine i promote the drinking of water our parallels are uncanny i invite everyone into my crew and then lead them back to my humble camp they're all pretty infatuated with my pet dog marto's mother i even spend 14 gold bars on a campfire and seating just so we could sit around looking wholesome if this isn't commitment to my new way of life and a gross waste of premium currency i really don't know what is you see the problem is i realize that i've become a leader to these fine lads and i suddenly have a huge hunger for power i no longer want to sit around talking about which bible app we should all download i want to take over the world if i learned anything playing grand theft auto san andreas is that in order to be taken seriously as a gang we need to stop respecting the police and women i mean take over a hood and establish some turf black water will be ours before sunrise tomorrow my new crew and i ride out but little did i know just how much things were going to escalate when you've got laser beam 272 893 on the back of your horse tenderly holding your waist you just know people are shaking in their cowboy boots with fear before we begin the gang conflict i decide it's best to do a team building exercise to ensure that we're all on the same wavelength no one is talking on their mic so a simple bounty mission should help us find some coordination as a group i'll be the first to admit that it's genuinely concerning how many times this body has rolled down the rocky hill i'm all about taking prisoners but at this point it's a borderline human rights issue we're going to have to answer to the international criminal court for war crimes i swear we couldn't be more ready well this guy is now wearing a sky blue nightgown and i assume getting his crotch all over my saddle but you take what you can get also a debatable choice to ride with me as i wouldn't say that i'm on track to win gold medal in dressage this random lass comes along and gets onto my steed she came here to steal my horse but ended up stealing my heart what a woman i mean i did go into voice chat for a while and it was so laggy and broken up that i won't bother including any that being said i did hear enough to know that that isn't a woman it's a man still pretty cute though honestly it's kind of impressive how well we're all harmonizing like for example this old guy came out of the woods and attacked me and all the lads just knew to immediately kill him without questioning the ethics behind it i do respect his hustle though so i invite him into the gang which is rapidly turning into a small army we all ride for blackwater to commence our peaceful protest well it will be peaceful so long as everyone agrees with exactly what i'm saying and bends the knee like i am bringing several guns with me and i do have an itchy trigger finger that apples and oranges we arrive and this npc looks at me wrong so i attack him some will argue that he never even saw my face or said a word but i must set an example for my troops this is now an npc extermination red dead edition and we will take down every single one of these malakas even if it takes us all night it's funny how life works isn't it my ex-girlfriend said i would never amount to anything and now look at me i'm leading an army of epic gamers to war while she sits around finishing off her esteemed research which could potentially help solve world hunger via genetically altered artificial meat what a nerd this woman who's actually a man also goes down more than my ex did as well wow imagine if she watched one of these videos and heard me talking smack like this that's a problem for another day today my soldiers have fought bravely as we revel in the well-deserved victory i will admit a few of these npcs have outstanding composure under pressure but sometimes it's wiser to flee or fight not just sit there waiting for the river for real if this isn't one of the most beautiful online gaming moments you've ever seen in your life you're lying to yourself we can't invite any more players into the gang but even more randoms have joined the fight we are rapidly growing more powerful and capturing black water was a huge win but only the entree it's now time for the main course saint denis it's amazing how simple it is to move around as a large group obviously i'm kidding it's a nightmare especially with the lack of voice communication the energy is high though which i love but i need to organize my unit or risk a potential mutiny then my prayers are answered and a train arrives moses parted the red sea so the israelites could escape the egyptian chariots whereas i happened to be near a train station and opportunistically used it as a mode of transport you tell me who's really working miracles here now this is synergy in its finest and most pure form it reminds me of a couple of weeks ago when i was having a few white claws with the boys i mean some dark manly malt whiskey with the boys talking about our feelings i mean talking about intercourse with women anyway we wanted to get some mickey d's but couldn't drive so we told my mate's girlfriend who was having an allergic reaction to peanuts she came over distraught to help him with the epi pen but he was fine and then we asked her for a ride to the big m synergy also this random dude has rocked up and i'm pretty sure he was trying to snipe our crew earlier there may be no direct communication but it seems the troops have reached a common consensus that this man is dead weight it's funny how they can uniformly organize the repetitive murder of this guy but can't ride their horses along a path unfortunately i've made a small mistake and failed to recognise that the train wasn't actually heading towards saint denis we all pile into a wagon but i'm about as good at navigating as i am at driving this thing i get a bit tempted to splatter this big girl and he selfishly destroys it all what a dick i now feel like i'm people trafficking or something but the important thing is we make it to saint anna this grandma is right to run as we're about to peaceful protest our way to a better society for everyone a society where i'm a dictator with unclear political values it's actually amazing how many of us are here just look at that mini-map there's 10 of us here that's the same number as i'd rate you you're a 10 and i mean that seriously you're a 10 and maybe you don't need to hear this or maybe you do but just keep doing your thing i feel like it's a pretty weird time in the world where many can't see their friends and family and it can be quite isolating so just keep being a legend and yeah i heart you and kind of a weird time to say that while we're massacring an entire city but we are doing absolute work here we get another wagon for drive byes and i hop inside and proceed to get scarred for life she is one scary lass but if she let me dim the lights and wear my second favorite pair of sandals i'd still hit this reminds me of the purge or something because honestly local law enforcement cannot deal with our presence a few other players tried to take us on which was perhaps the bravest yet dumbest act i've seen in recent times this guy love his rage was quite persistent also what is that game attack my man's heart is bleeding it's hard to know exactly how many npcs fell but the place is a graveyard and the turf is now out i think i speak for the whole gang when i say this peaceful protest is going extremely well the train eventually swings back around and i decide it's time to initiate the final phase of this operation you see if we stay on the train it will go through all the towns and cities in the state and therefore we can mobilize this task force it goes well but i can tell the crew is starting to get a little bit jittery as the potential for a mutiny's spikes i don't know how they're managing to tie me up and i can't stand for that i need a common enemy and so i'm so sorry love is rage i know you're probably listening to blink 182 and crying right now but you made your bed and now you'll have to sleep in it he rides up to the train clearly seeking forgiveness for his violent misconduct earlier but all good leaders must do what is best for the greater community i'll admit this is unnecessarily savage and i truly believe lighting the body on fire as well as dragging it behind the train was complete overkill but in the words of winston churchill after he was defeated by the huns it is what it is and plus i needed someone to soak up the toxicity it's a classic misdirection all good things must come to an end and i'd rather die the hero than become the villain well subjectively i'm a hero some would say i'm a terrorist robbo drives the train to a bridge and is the first to jump into the water below nightgown man follows suit giving us all a stunning and brave flash on the way down the mutiny then happens at the most unlikely of times as i'm joined by none other than faze coco pops the guy that used to wear an alligator hat and that we drowned at the very beginning of this video as i'm debatably jesus i obviously don't die but they think i do and the rest of my gang jump off the bridge out of respect of course i follow because i'm a slave to trends so that's the story of how we took control of a red dead online server using inclusive behavior rather than toxicity i feel like i'm giving an anti-bullying lecture to year 4 students and we did drag a man behind a train for like 10 minutes but let's just enjoy the wholesomeness of this moment for what it is if you're hunting down more
