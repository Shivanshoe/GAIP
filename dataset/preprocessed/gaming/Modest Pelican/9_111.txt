[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican herewith Red Dead online if you enjoyed this family-friendly content please name your legs modest Pelican gaming and then spread them as this really helps spread the good word of my channel does that even make sense anyway don't worry guys I'm not dead well maybe I'm dead on the inside but really no it's very sweet when I miss an upload and everyone asks if I'm okay or you know if I'm dead it's just nice to feel wanted I guess so yeah today we are going to try and make some cash for once as we're pretty poor I seem to always get distracted fighting other players so I'll be doing my best to practice some self-control but firstly though I need to take down these witnesses as they're stitching on me because I committed first-degree murder in public the snitches get stitches and gamers get the Jayma that's a stretch but yeah I'm patting Mattie's unicorn horse and then this guy called Lowell try smash shoots me with a shotgun I take my revenge on his gangs later but as this is precisely what we're trying to avoid Maddie and I ride off into the night together also I'm still a thick boy so I guess she can enjoy a big sweaty man holding on to her because safety first and just like my Boy Scout coach always said but don't tell anyone I won't give you your rope tying activity badge okay so this is my moonshine Shack business I bought before we get into that though I see if I can fight an alligator with a knife and no I cannot I show off my shack to Maddy who's extremely impressed and I mean who wouldn't be we're talking three pillows on the bed that's some luxurious nasai ask if she wants to take a nap while I watch from this chair and she politely declines I was into watching people sleep before it became a cool thing to livestream and also before it was consensual viewing anyway I don't have the money to brew up a batch of moonshine so we need to raise some funds on our way to town to find work we decide to take down a rival seller also look women throwing themselves at me this is such relatable content to take a sip of water if you can relate to this content I've been figuring out how to do these missions stealthily and all you need is a bow and arrow I then destroyed their moonshine stills and hey presto that's one less competitor for real though all this murder has got me thinking so does this Cardinal red beanie work with my rugged beard look speaking of looks it's weird how much Maddie's character looks like herself and how much my character looks like me if I was younger skinnier and remembered to moisturize before bed we decide to do a legendary bounty and track down the notorious criminal known as the Wolfman the big girl is apparently hiding out here somewhere and he's kind of done because it's freezing and he might catch a cold no one likes a sneezy amalaki these days champ I last saw him and I feel like this is kind of a catfish I was expecting a werewolf man but he's just a regular man who's trained wolves which is still kind of impressive but yeah I don't know the speaking of catfish I once went on my friends Facebook Messenger and started talking to girls pretending to be him I was chatting to this one girl and no matter what she said I'd always reply with that's hot I asked her what she was studying and she said nursing and when I said that's hot it came across really flirty and she seemed to like it I then asked what she did for work and she said she was a diving instructor and so of course I said that's hot she said not really because she only teaches kids and when I replied to that one she blocked my mate so yeah we'll say mixed results anyway we deliver the bounty and pocket a call $40 for our efforts Maddie proceeds to kill an innocent mountain goat for no reason and then we head back to my distillery so we can put through this order of moonshine I don't have all the upgrades so the best I can do is weak move shine for $60 but it's better than nothing while we wait it's time to sit down and figure out some solid business strategies to see how we can differentiate our product and stand out from the competition nah kidding we're just going to destroy our competition by murdering everyone and blowing up all their equipment again is this honest no is this effective yes Hotel trivago reused jokes aside trivago chef is doing terrible even before the recent economic crash whereas the modest Pelican gaming managed fund is way up so invest smart invest with Pelican fund management how smooth would it be if Pelican fund management was a real thing I should just use my moderate amount of relevancy to set up a pyramid scheme but anyway yeah we take down a bunch of other moonshiners as it will help our business long term and then come across this dodgy ass cowboy his horse has died and he wants a ride into town I tried to stab him but the game won't let me so I reluctantly accept his request moments later he opened fires on me and so I tie him up somehow though he shoots my horse while still tied up and so we come up with a cunning punishment for him and his friend this can also act as a valuable life lesson never trust anyone go into every situation extremely skeptical and ready to act in irrational ways it'll improve your mental well-being we wait a long time for a train but it never comes so I just become the Train these are actually new citizens I'm crushing as the other ones ran away and we shot them I also crushed Maddy but hey quality train content is becoming a huge part of this channel I then meet this guy called shadow kiss who is super chill it's always nice to have a friendly encounter just kidding I'm sniped from across the river using every ounce of self-control I let it go and prepare to sell this moonshine now I don't claim to be some kind of brilliant entrepreneur well not that often anyway but selling a batch of moonshine for $37 51 the supplies cost me $60 seems like a bad deal maybe that means $37.50 profit or something let's say we take the wagon and luckily don't get attacked by any players and sure enough after all that I just lost $22.50 not a great return and definitely not a great look for modesty Pelican fund management sign up now unfortunately the smartest player of our group is hopping on now the man the myth the legend stealth amato someone once called stealth o martyr grannie McFate oh and I still laugh about it Wow the big girls been here for all of one minute and he's already taken my spot on the back of Maddie's horse don't get too comfortable sweetheart I was her everything once too okay so I think the problem is I didn't flavor the moonshine and I also don't have enough upgrades yet so we have plenty to do it's back to work and of course by work I mean killing many many more people from government revenue agents to of course more competitors we have a quick break for a game of chicken which I lose badly I thought being hella thick was meant to assist with this sort of thing then in one of the biggest double power plays of 2020 simultaneously motto makes me carry my own corpse on my horse while Maddie steals my signature cardinal red beanie just wow I have no words given we have a small crew now we decide to do our murdering with knives only for an extra challenge I've got to say the close quarters combat in this game is something special and just in case I wasn't already being made a joke of by my own gang they then both get red beanies off my various corpses look I don't even know who I am anymore that beanie was my identity they're stealing my whole image what's even more frustrating is you can't deny how good motto looks in it while I'm busy stabbing someone else another player ties me up mid-fight his name is golden walrus 101 so you know that he means business Maddie then tries to save me what a simp but then another player comes in and Randy Orton's out of nowhere everyone just starts dying but my game glitches out and I can't break free so I just lie there like my ex-girlfriend walrus cuts me free but with my game still glitched I just chill like this in the middle of the bloodbath eventually I break free and go to wave at him but motto shoots the guy in the face because he is just honestly emotionally unstable eventually everyone sees fires and we all just Crouch walk around unusually close together and if this isn't the pinnacle Red Dead online experience I really don't know what I then shoot this guy in the head with an arrow and seconds later he tweets at me saying that he just ran into us and I shot him in the head with an arrow his recap of the recent events are extremely accurate he should be proud and also sorry I guess mate it feels personal now because you made a tweet about it we then come up with the perfect plan where we will poison our biggest competitors moonshine without them knowing then when they sell it to their customers it will kill them and put them out of business sounds like it will also kill many innocent people who are just trying to get a buzz going but let's not overthink the consequences of our actions that's for nerds the problem is if we get spotted they'll know we tampered with it and won't sell the shine so I have to remain undetected of course I completely mess this up and we resort to the tried and tested plan be it kill and destroy everything but god forbid we increase our marketing budget or create a customer loyalty program No murder is always better anyway the moonshine business is really starting to come together but we need some bulk cash and the best way to get cash is by collecting things on the bright side motto is riding on my horse again bros before hoes no actually I shouldn't refer to my good friend Maddie like that bros before strong smart independent funny and well-read hos let's be honest though the biggest ho here is motto like has he even ridden on his own horse once today and yeah collecting things isn't the most interesting job but it gives us a chance to chat and catch up on worldly events with Maddie figuratively and in regards to motto literally carrying us from location to location we manage to collect an entire set of earrings which he can sell for several hundred dollars and just like that we're rich I now have to decide whether I make the smart business decision and upgrade the moonshine Shack or make the vein aesthetic choice and upgrade the campsite you know damn well I upgrade the campsites because I'm trying to embrace flex culture my tent now looks way better I've got a little table it's absolutely popping off here he has an actual bed so she's living like a queen and motto has something that resembles one of the thoughts I made with my mates when I was a kid it's not going to keep him warm or dry or keep the wind off but at least he's got a place to bring girls back to it's not very private but as mentioned earlier I actually prefer to watch anyway Wow feels good to have actually been productive on read dead for once and I'm looking forward to getting the moonshine business pumping also if you're in the mood for more questionable content you could follow me on Instagram and Twitter might be the best decision you've ever made probably not though otherwise I really hope all you legends are doing well and to coping with everything that's going on in the world right now thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay class [Music]
