[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with vigor if you enjoyed this video please get a job at a takeaway sharp but when the food is ready don't yell the customers name just yell subscribe to modest Pelican gaming or Die as this really helps spread the good word of my channel let's begin today's educational story time with Pappa Pelle where we're going to learn how to dodgy Australians went from completely useless players into the ultimate non-virgins who have much physical relations with women first though welcome to my CD yet whimsical cabin in the woods and of course welcome to vigor a big thanks to bohemia' Interactive for sponsoring today's video they're the same guys who developed a daisy which as you legends know I really love so I'm excited to check this out the games currently available and free to play on xbox and soon Nintendo switch if you're interested to play you can click the link in the description all right so this cabin axe is your base and if you're wondering yes it has a dark basement that would be perfect for well let's just say no one's going to hear anyone screaming for help down here on a more wholesome note it also has a spectacular view of a freshwater lake perfect for marine bird-watching or drowning unwanted guests you're perfectly safe at your cabin because the real action comes when you enter a combat encounter whatever you take with you to an encounter you risk losing if you die so for our first time I decide to bring a Thompson submachine gun with only like 20 bullets which is a hugely questionable decision also a bold choice of Outfitters not many you can pull off a beige turtleneck but frankly I look fantastic we load in and today we'll be joined by Australia's favorite pin-up boy stealth our motto we proceed to wave at each other repetitively because real bros kiss I mean wave there are many maps in vigor and you can play each encounter however you like you might loot one building and find exactly what you need and decide to leave right away like this building and on a side note I know this is post-apocalyptic Norway but the kitchen is busting the owner of this residence should be ashamed have some self-respect but yeah you could also try to kill many players unlock safes and collect air drops which would be risky but offer a far greater reward it's at this moment we come across our first ever opponent it's always best to start things off on a positive note so you can use the initial constructive experience as a platform to propel yourself on to bigger and better things just kidding I die immediately by a guy called fortnight game for three six this is rock-bottom okay at least things can only improve from here and so what we lost the Thompson but now we're rocking a v's ad 58p let's go round two the stealth Omar toe and I also set an ambitious goal for ourselves we're going to attempt a challenge where we need to win three encounters in a row we can't just escape quickly either we have to get involved kill people and clap some cheeks as we attempt to gain that position we come across another duo I managed to kill someone through a bush which is absolutely insane after this clip goes viral I expect cloud 9 to have a lucrative contract in my inbox his teammate fails to realize I've flanked him and so I proceeded to pump him full of lead as well that's a lot of nice loot for your boys now it's just a matter of staying alive maybe getting to the airdrop and escaping quickly just kidding we both get rinsed almost immediately therefore keeping none of our loot at least I leveled up on the battle pass and earned a red helmet as part of season 3 rivals and tactical no fashionable well no not really but god damn it's an alpha display of confidence I also upgrade my cabin so now it passively produces wood and the more you upgrade your cabin the more it gets repaired I now have blue tarps on my roof to protect us from the weather ladies please form an orderly line at the door because I can keep you dry in more ways than you know the so yeah there's resources other than weapons everywhere that you can use to improve your shelter crafting table build guns ammo and so on now I promise things get better but we're car in what I call the awkward adolescent male flirting stage of gaming remember when you were like 16 and tried to talk to girls but you'd always just panic and instead of asking how they were you'd proceed to release a high-pitched screeching sound soil yourself and then waddle away like an Arctic penguin well maybe that was just me but anyway the point is for the next few rounds we panicked a lot but we also grew as players and fast forward to round seven and we decide we will collect our first airdrop also I dressed like I'm in a biker gang now so don't screw with me or I'll break into your house take all the frozen food out of the freezer and then let it spoil as we move in to collect the drop another team beats us there I was about to say the bush is thick but I think only Australians call large groups of trees the bush anyway the bush is thick that's just facts and after a sketchy gunfight they tried to flee with the precious cargo this was their key mistake though but because just like a thirsty man in his 50s his overly invested in a female's twitch stream because he thinks one day she'll be so impressed by his large donations she'll stop the stream to get on a plane and fly to his city so she can show him her feet in person we don't give up a motto also manages to snipe the other guy so just like that we're on top of the world after a while a wave of niccola radiation comes through and we actually almost died but made it back just in time one successful trip down two to go I also put back on the turtle because my neck was cold the following round has terrible weather conditions but I've equipped the new silenced mp5 aka The O'Jays sneaky stepdad and it should do the job it's relatively uneventful but as we try to leave some dodgy melaka is waiting for us but fortunately I managed to get him look at that he captured the air drop so that's two successful trips down one to go the stealth amato is what some might call a big deep lair his tactics are risky but when they work it's a huge flex somehow he talks me into attempting our third using nothing but a Magnum if we win then eternal glory and Express access to heaven if we die then well let's not talk about it and go down no I'm down so okay could have definitely got the kill had we brought in actual guns so yeah three wins straight challenge reset and back to square one this proved to be the low part of our story but at least that added some perspective to vigor some would say my vigor but yeah the lesson here is don't listen to stealth our motto ever the things turned pretty dark as we'd win some gun fights but then take too long to escape and die from radiation poisoning or get clipped by another player I also regret saying don't listen tomato because the other day we were fishing and he was like hey watch this and started walking on the water I was like wait bro are you the second coming of Jesus Christ and he said yes so that's pretty cool he then turned all my water into wine and I couldn't stay hydrated which was frustrating anyway I then decide it's time to do something I didn't want to have to do we need a bit of luck so I put on a red vest which is now going to be my lucky red vest this makes the red helmet to look like a ghillie suit I've also upgraded my cabin so much that we have indoor tarps now this is officially more luxurious than where I live in real life okay bad luck that it's snowing in this encounter as my red vest sticks out like ah well I guess a red vest but come on if you saw a guy wearing this running straight at you you're going to freak out also 1% of the time it's actually pretty tactical as you can barely see me against this red cabin in fact people will probably just think i'm a movin' red cabin I'm nearby phone rings and so I decide that I may as well answer it if they don't want to come across as rude I wasn't aware this reveals mile okay to the player who called I can also now see him and he's sprinting right at us motto proceeds to kill the big girl and how did that go for your chief now you're dead and I'm still well-dressed we secure the airdrop and manage to escape safely so one round complete the challenge is back on round two and it's currently poorly lit and raining and all I can think is thank God I have my sunglasses on so my retinas don't get see it you can still get sunburned when it's overcast these sun safe we decide to turn the tactics up to a million percent and utilize a radio tower this briefly shows us where all the other players are on the map so we can tactics this situation we notice there's a team at the bard house which is where the safe is and so we had over there now the old boys boys boys or I guess here just the boys boys would have stormed right in but we're trying to complete a fun-filled Christian challenge here and so instead we camp outside after a short while the two wannabe cat burglars try to flee and we engage in a gunfight do you like how I'm trying to gloss over how many shots I just missed like that's 25% of all my ammo gone and I didn't even get a tag unfortunately I managed to flank one of the guys and I give him what we in the industry call a lot of bullets into his body what I'm quickly learning is that once you discharge your firearm it attracts other players and now that I think about it that's just common sense and I'm sure we should have carried that knowledge over from all the other shooting games we've played but hey tactics we managed to kill one guy but his friend runs off into the distance with plenty of loot we probably should leave but I'm a dumb youtuber and motto is always optimistically ambitious so we decide to hit the air drop it goes extremely smoothly with no complications and we leave the area safely in one of the stranger things I've ever experienced motto asks me to take off my red vest so that we can complete the challenge without being spotted straight away I respectfully decline these are the moments that determine if this video will be satisfying to watch or bitterly disappointing ensuring we comply to the rules we made up for playing aggressively we head straight for the safe it's somewhere inside this military bunker and I must say I don't like it we might well have the drop on the team below us but we're extremely exposed up here from anyone who might third party I then spot a player trying to escape and nail him several times somehow not getting the kill this is the one time in my entire life where I scream he's one shot he's one shot and it's actually true I can't describe to you how many times I've missed absolutely all my shots and then called out to my teammates that is one shot I then tactically fall off this ledge because I apparently have poor spatial awareness I then go to bandage myself but accidentally discharge by firearm giving away my position tactics Marto manages to get one of them but this other guy is a different breed he's a gamer who's come here to game today he kills motto in about one second and now he's aggressively pushing me with the confidence of someone wearing a red vest but you see the thing is I'm the only one wearing a red vest here and so like a lion leaping and tearing his teeth into a gazelle that probably had a wife and kids I take the big no huge girl down I'm pretty insane as I now get three people's loot because I take stealth Amato's gear the challenge is complete as I go on to escape the encounter well I guess motto died but no point crying over spilt water plus he'll be resurrected in three days he's Jesus the thanks again to Bohemia Interactive for reaching out to me I had an absolute cracker of a time playing this it's a lot of fun thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
