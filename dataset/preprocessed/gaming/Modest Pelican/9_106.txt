[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with GTA san andreas if you enjoyed this video please start an only fans account but instead of sharing nudes just share photos of pelicans in helmets as this really helps spread the good word of my channel I'm going to miss saying this loading screen picture of a good Christian lady licking lipstick off her teeth we spawn in and I'm still dressed like og CJ with his iconic white singlet tucked into his undies combination he would get teased more about it but you know this is a guy who carries around an m4 an RPG several aziz explosives and a chainsaw all neatly tucked into his pockets so people think twice today we are going to try to hunt down Big Smoke a former member of our gang who betrayed us so that he could get rich selling drugs we've all been there we also need to kill officer Tenpenny a corrupt cop who's been blackmailing CJ and recently tried to have us killed attempted murder can really soil a relationship this cop proceeds to get mad at me for I guess appreciating some low resolution booty so I do the mature thing and savagely beat him to death only in San Andreas can you kill a cop and remain on a one star wanted level it's like a police chief should we send in support units this guy is literally murdering our officers in broad daylight and he's like yeah nah mate he's probably just having a rough day get him a Snickers anyway we need to throw on our gang colors otherwise what's the point a dollar sign chain to show that we don't even attempt to hide our awkward public erections a green Fedora just kidding I don't want people to think I have sex with a different beautiful woman every night the three-quarter length green shorts with my favorite socks and sandals as Footwear all brought together with a white t-shirt and a cap because the UV rays are harsh in California and Sun safety is gangster let's go the timing of this actually couldn't be better as a few days ago we looked at the green vs. purple alien war currently happening on GTA v servers but this is where it all really started of the Green Grove Street families versus the purple ballers our gang is on the backfoot at the moment but we're doing our best to take back as many hoods as possible a big smoke is hiding somewhere in the city but if we can control enough of it we'll find him this is also a pretty special moment for my channel as this will be the last GTA san andreas video you know how Netflix leaves every episode on a cliffhanger to make sure we watch the next one and see what happens well I do that with my content but usually never actually finished the series it's bloody genius marketing mate and today that changes though and I'm both happy and sad about this as this is my favorite game of all time and I want to say thank you legends for the support especially on a 16 year old game some of the episodes have amassed over 1 million views which warms my cold black heart all right enough monotone emotion let's take care of these busters I wanted to get a cinematic shot of me pulling into the driveway of my mansion but as I went to do a u-turn I drove my car off a cliff and then it exploded and in this game you can't insure a cars my life looks like we're back on the bike and I must say it's actually pretty appropriate given CJ is back in the hood like it's the first mission the problem is the only kind of person worse than Kim jong-un is a cyclist but no matter how many times you try to kill either of them they always bounce back I meet up with the crew and they're all watching Shrek hentai which is pretty cute but then the news comes on and Tenpenny is having his court trial the jutsu systemic corruption he is set free serving no jail time as a result the entire city goes into a complete riot ain't nobody gonna be right in mah whoo I've said it before and I'll say it again this game makes me feel so white like seriously I'm so white that I'm about to bring a gun to a school a nail gun and some other tools so I can fix the bookshelves because reading expands the adolescent mind so yeah while Santos is in a full-blown riot it's absolutely popping off and there are people looting TVs and fighting each other and for some reason this hooker thinks it's a good idea to shoot a bunch of my Grove Street homies I must say she does way better than I would have hoped before of my guys couldn't take her down we might have to pencil in some shooting lessons I guess a cop cars are being torched and sweet wants to just go back to Grove Street and secure the block I give him a ride and hear that incredible mission complete sound play out I wish that song played in real life every time I came I decide I better check in with my girlfriend and see how she's coping with this whole city rioting she's a real emotional rock for me and the love of my life unfortunately I'm a slave for publicity as I want to be famous so I do what has to be done and murder her I mean it worked for Caryl Baskin so why not me does she's so well-known killing your spouse is free real estate all right time to get our hands dirty what up but before we handle the grave straight problem I'm in debt and owe a favor to Caesar the leader of the los Aztecas another gang he's dating my sister and has helped me significantly so I'll help him out as we're about to leave a homeless guy pulls me from the driver seat and wants to brawl now I'm not saying I have the perfect solution to the homeless problem but I mean it is a solution Wow I'm kidding I sometimes vie homeless people lunch in real life and then just chat with them it's really wholesome and then I stab them well sorry I can't help myself I'm eight Caesars gang nice baby blue bandanas no wonder you're struggling to control your territory you look like you're about to drop the hottest mathletics hip-hop track of 1992 anyway Caesar and his boys are in a savage gang war with the Los Santos fargo's these yellow guys and there are so many gangs in this game I'd love to see the next GTA have gang warfare like this back when I played as a kid I learned a lot from gang warfare like whenever we took a new hood so we could push more crack as demand was rising I realized it was the core economic principle of the market equilibrium and that being said when I tilted the camera to try and watch CJ getting some it taught me sex wrong as they just casually sat next to each other the school bus trips were never the same for me with my debt repaid to Caesar it's time to take back the city so we can find out where big smoke is hiding a big sexy here seems to have forgotten that were actually allied with these guys and then he just not Charlotte Lee waves at them you're sending mixed messages there chief so it's time to take back some hoods which means a lot of gang wars this is highly illegal sort of like when my neighbors were in that sex tape of course they didn't actually know they were in a sex tape I just filmed it from a nearby tree and look I don't mean to toot my own horn but it had exceptional cinematography the process of initiating a turf war is just walking into that area and then shooting a few of the opposing gangsters the three waves of reinforcements will come to try to stop you but unfortunately for them I have a military-grade m4 assault rifle the more rivals you take down the more friendlies you can recruit and soon you will have a small army following you around of course as we established earlier they're not the smartest in Los Santos but they offer much-needed emotional support imagine you're in the middle of fighting over a hood and some well-dressed Malaka pulls down a sniper rifle you'd be like hey bro isn't there some sort of unspoken rule that we use gangster weapons only like Glocks tech nines and ak-47s and hold them all thug like on an angle you're just a filthy hardscope er eventually we managed to take back enough territory and I get the call from suede that he knows where Big Smoke is hiding let's go geez the homeless have had a really tough time today I mean he just got tag-teamed by a hoe and a footlocker employee it's time to get ready as this will be a massive fight I stock up on ammunition to be precise I buy 1365 fragmentation grenades because there's no such thing as too many explosives I test them and they work great I'm sure you guys can relate that it's incredibly embarrassing when you buy frag grenades in real life and they don't work but this lands me a four star wanted level because law enforcement doesn't understand how to enjoy a healthy work life but one thing they do understand is personal space I simply walk into the Johnson family home and they respect my privacy it's time to take the big girl down it's time small I just roll Charlson brothers gonna take that fat fool damn the man who betrayed Grove Street families is about to meet his end as we're approaching his crack den I noticed there's a strip club here that I forgot about and it would be rude not to pop in I tell sweet I'll BRB and get ready for what could potentially be the best experience of my entire life wow this is tick tock dancing in a nutshell right here anyway this girl isn't my type I'm much more into this girl look at that shirt all buttoned up and the black vest so conservative it's hot as she reminds me of my ex I killed not the one I just killed the one I killed about three episodes ago why have I killed so many of my girlfriends it's getting a bit excessive and now though it's time for smoke the Johnson Brothers finally rolling in together again and then CJ says he wants to do this alone and sweets says okay he'll wait for me in the car I was being polite you're actually going to wait in the car I'm not your mum going into the shops to quickly grab a loaf of bread we're about to fight our biggest and strongest enemy and you're just going to sit here and vibe in the car and can't you bowlers see we're having a private family moment here show some respect all right it looks like it's just me then I need to steal this arm and SWAT tank so I can use it to ram the wall down and access the crack den you might be wondering what the gun on top is a 50 caliber mounted machine gun nope it's better it's a water cannon hydrate or die great big girls you're getting a little soaking tonight I managed to ram through and then I noticed two people who are showing why you shouldn't become addicted to narcotics unfortunately it's nothing a little water can't fix and now look at them ready for church I make my way through smokes crack Dan and he has everybody working for him he's got the ballers the Vagos some of the police force it's insane I no he backstabbed us but the man sure knows how to flex his wealth you can't deny it and check out this giant statue of himself and perhaps a little narcissistic but it's extremely lifelike almost photorealistic he's even got a private strip club in here but this girl is awful at dancing too if you want something done right you have to do it yourself this is how you dance sexy and sorry to my viewers for dancing so provocatively after fighting my way to the penthouse suite I reach smoke a smoke hey CJ how was one sure Hajin what was me oh my dude you literally just said hey smoke and he's known you for years and could easily recognize your voice thank god you're a good pole dancer or I don't think you'd be going places the smoke pulls out a shotgun and the fight is on and this is a satisfying moment as this man betrayed us all for money I know I'm meant to be shooting him right now but check this huge trampoline out imagine the double bouncers you could do on this bad boy a dam maybe I should betray my friends and sell more drove he flicks the lights off but I have a secret weapon the thirteen hundred grenades which I start throwing everywhere and this results in a lot of self-inflicted pain and I learn a valuable life hack don't throw grenades in a small poorly lit room eventually I finish him off with my m4 and ask why he betrayed his lifelong friends and he says because he wanted to get rich I appreciate the honesty their champion Carl Johnson MAME the Tenpenny then arrives to kill me and take all smokes money he proceeds to implausibly miss both of his combat shotgun blasts despite being two meters away which is well it's pretty great he attempts to flee in a fire truck as half the police force is out looking for him and sweet picks this exact moment to get involved I guess thanks for finally doing something but I mean I am just safely following him in this car with a seatbelt on I'm not entirely sure what you dangerously hanging on like that is achieving but great energy sweet leaps onto my sports car and after one of gaming's most iconic chase scenes the Tenpenny accidentally steers the truck off a bridge crashing into the sewer below suffering fatal injuries as far as storylines go this is top shelf the CJ has proved to his brother he's focused on the gang again and they defeated their two biggest threats see you Brown officer I guess the biggest lesson to be learned from this game is that if you sell enough crack you could build a giant statue of yourself and have a private strip club so I guess get out there and start pushing product lads and lasses a lot of you requested I make a GTA san andreas playlists so all 10 videos are now nicely organized in the playlist section again I just appreciate the support on my content so much and look forward to making many more videos for you to hopefully enjoy you guys are such legends until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
