[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with daisy if you enjoy this video please start sending risky photos with someone but as soon as it starts to get really hated just switch it up and spam them with pictures of my pelican logo as this really helps spread the good word of my channel sometimes i turn on my recording software with no real intention of making a video but then something incredible happens this was one of those times and the story i'm about to tell you is one of survival friendship and honestly a few questionable ethical decisions observe here how little innocent pelle jogged over to a church to seek refuge and forgiveness but instead of being touched by god or i guess a cute priest i was gunned down by two big girls who look like they're part of a special ops team this isn't the story i wanted to tell you though this was just online bullying but more importantly an example of the brutality we'll be facing the real story starts now i'm a fresh spawn and i can instantly tell that my randomly generated character has a big girthy appetite for adventure the weather is bleak and nightfall is soon approaching i managed to translate this street sign and i quickly discover that i'm miles from my friends mato robbo and domi are all out there somewhere and the boys must reunite i'm also getting hungry and thirsty and i'm kind of lost so we're basically already at rock bottom wow it actually instantly got much worse as it's now raining and the temperature has drastically dropped it's hard to keep up with how quickly the wheels are coming off and usually at this point imminent death is already guaranteed then suddenly through the woods i find a small settlement and it brings with it a wave of optimism maybe i can find the resources i need here or you know just as good a baseball cap and literally no food whatsoever at least there's a water pump here so i can suckle on poseidon's teat for a red hot minute but zombies are everywhere and i don't even have a shovel to defend myself with this isn't looking good so i have a drink and lie down in a shed to die sometimes you've gotta listen to the voices inside your head and simply give up immediately then i remember the boys need me i pick myself back up and find a machete in a garden shed we're now armed and ready to go for a knife only nuke i also find this dress and obviously i look like a million bucks but it's not a practical choice for the harsh climate i find a suitable middle ground in a savvy pink cap and set off to find my mates it's now a full-blown thunderstorm my clothes are soaking wet i'm starving i'm freezing and i've even contracted influenza i'm as good as dead and a wiser man would give up but they say in these dire moments there's something called hysterical strength say a mother lifting a car off her child after a road accident or more impressively the boy is trying to meet up in a storm after a long hike i find exactly what i need a pair of red pants i wouldn't say this drip does a great job of camouflaging me and more clothing isn't exactly what the doctor ordered as i desperately need antibiotics but at least when i die i'll leave a beautiful corpse minutes from death i stumble into a quaint country house and on the dining table is a cult 1911. by some kind of miracle there's six bullets in the magazine this is what man must have felt like when he first discovered fire a slither of hope like a fat guy at a shooting range i'm armed but hungry i begin looting and suddenly a dodgy malacca and speed dealers tries to jump me with a kitchen knife he slashes my shoulder but i pull out my cult and put all five bullets into his chest we could have been friends big fella you brought this on yourself i searched his loot and the man was a walking bloody grocery store a soft drink cans of food a fresh pear we are living large now lads and lasses but are hardly out of the woods yet i'm losing blood and we're still sick i'm also not sure if this man is dead or unconscious so i do what all good orienteers should do and chop his corpse up into tiny pieces not very wholesome but a necessary safety measure the man even had a fire set up for us what a great guy is this allows me to stabilize my temperature and dry out my clothing i rest up for a moment and then set out again i hear shooting and i can see players fleeing this town it's something straight out of a nightmare there's a base being built on top of the police station and it's clearly not a place to make friends i run in after the guy with a shovel out and i'm not going to take any chances here sorry champion but it's survival of the fittest i take his pair and a gun he had and leave his unconscious body in the house he'll wake up and be just fine well probably not but hey i could have chopped him up into tiny pieces as well and just kidding i did chop him up into tiny pieces can't be too safe the conditions are still terrible but i'm not too far from domi when i say not too far i mean daisy's version of not too far like it's still going to take me about 30 minutes to reach him but now that i've got food and weapons it's significantly easier to travel for reference if this is the actual world this is dayz i finally reached the huge city of electro and beeline straight to the hospital i need to get medication for this illness or i'll be dead by morning there's nothing here not even a shot of morphine that i could use for recreational purposes but then i see him domi he's unarmed and being swarmed by zombies but seeing him fight the undead really turns me on i mean really turns me off we decide to venture up into the hills where we know of a country hospital that could have the meds we need unfortunately while looting for supplies he's swarmed yet again i can't let the man die and so i swoop in to help him out he gets pretty messed up during the conflict and so i bandage him as the alpha unit is wearing a mini skirt it sort of looks like well let's just say you'd need a premium subscription to see something like this on the big screen i also give him influenza it's only a kilometer or so up the road so it shouldn't take long i'm not sure why i keep alternating between the metric and imperial measurement system but what do you expect from a dude making youtube videos from his couch another incredibly lucky moment but this place has tetracylene pills the exact medication we need this is just so lucky and i can't wait to tell domi the good news as he's in pretty bad shape when i say bad shape i mean bad shape domi is literally seconds from death i force the pills down his throat which sounds bad but i'm saving a life here he says he's starving too which is a shock as this is the first time i've heard of him being hungry and i've got heaps of food he's so polite which is rare and welcomed but at what cost tommy at what cost i scrambled trying to open some baked beans with a fire axe and then my boy dies in front of my very eyes he's dead that's it the game's brutal like that and now heaven has another angel no bro should have to bury another bro but i give him the funeral he deserves and dump him by the river a good night sweet prince we were so close to mato and robo as well as they're just over this hill with nightfall approaching and no food left it's damn good to see their familiar faces and hey a 75 survival rate for the boys isn't too bad i mean you wouldn't flex it but i've seen worse mato proceeds to completely break the whole wasteland survival immersion by rapidly leaning side to side which i'll admit is incredibly seductive but stay in character god damn it i'm not even sick anymore and we finally have this welcomed feeling of harmony and peace for about five minutes you see the higher you climb the further you have to fall and we didn't realize just how dark things were about to get a fresh spawn finds his way into the hills and tries to surprise attack the lads realising this was a mistake he flees to the fields but it's too late to beg for your life big bopper you're a dead man walking what should seemingly be a pretty easy kill quickly escalates as the fresh born starts punching the lads to be honest i respect his bravery i'm hesitant to get involved as it's just as likely i shoot one of the lads as it is that i shoot him eventually they get him but zombies have swarmed in as well all in all a terrible fight for us as mato and robbo have taken enormous amounts of damage and to be frank this is extremely embarrassing and now robbo's on his deathbed and nightfall is basically here so we need to set up a fire and fast we're seriously considering eating this rotten human what is happening to us all of a sudden another player is here it's some sort of sick twisted disgusting cannibal in a pink dress and oh it's just domi he's back he got super lucky and spawned nearby and thought this would be a funny prank we almost shot him so this is where we're at it's now pitch black we're freezing we're starving and we can't figure out how to get a fire going i guess we're dumber than the men who first discovered fire after all which is pretty confronting in fact it's so grim that domi and mato have now cuddled up on the ground together in the fetal position and are spooning if you're wondering what robbie is sprinkling into their mouths right now it's uncooked human meat this is a new low for the boys as we have to choose between starving to death or salmonella poisoning we need yet another miracle and fast it seems the big man is on our side as that miracle comes in the form of a fire barrel that we do manage to light we're able to cook up some medium rare lightly salted human steaks and though we're all quite sick again at least we'll live to see another day well i mean maybe this forces our hand as we need to find more medication once again i'm regretting shoving like seven pills into dummy's mouth back when he died the first time as that was our entire supply in hindsight that probably killed him faster so here we are four bros trotting through the woods together trying to find a place where we can make a life for ourselves after about 30 minutes we need to stop and make camp and as i'm fetching wood the unthinkable happens i hear screaming and crying from the house we've chosen to bunker down in and then i see it domi's dead again this is just not his day i put on his hat as a sign of respect and we continue forward without him we find some canned food battle countless zombies and robbie even manages to hunt us a goat which provides us a weak supply of food we use this as a platform to set up a campsite where we can gather our thoughts and make out you heard me but finally we've done it we're safe for about five minutes we go on a supply run and a hostile malacca open fires on us tagging up the lads and then falls back no one shoots at the lads and gets away with it i do my absolute best to take him down with my pump action shotgun but even this isn't ideal as i'm firing rubber slugs no joke rubber slugs it's all i could find i'm not going to be able to kill him but by god i'll give him a nasty bruise he seeks shelter in a barn and we all circle the building ready to move in for the kill now i love dayz it offers an extremely unique experience that i thoroughly enjoy but it does have its fair share of glitches there's this one particular glitch that we all learn about right now where a player looks like he has his fists out but he's actually wielding an mp5 submachine gun in this moment of panic and confusion he guns both mato and robo down leaving me by myself with his black magic i quickly realized why he was confident enough to fight us all at once this man knows what he's doing i pull out my trusty shovel and start swinging it around like a maniac as nearby zombies also join in as they're attracted to the gunshots i managed to knock the man out but i'm bleeding like crazy and i'm apparently the world's slowest field medic my screen goes black and white to indicate that i'm absolutely screwed and as i struggled to stop the bleeding the guy i knocked sits back up he's the god damn terminator well actually i guess i only shot him with rubber bullets and then hit him with a shovel but still in a heroic moment i pull out my bolt action rifle and put one in his head ending this nightmare once and for all it's just me now the lads are all dead robbie mato little dummy they're all gone i don't want to be in a world without the boys boys boys so i put a gun to my head and no i'm kidding i take all the loot we bowling now check out my guy i'm a soldier thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
