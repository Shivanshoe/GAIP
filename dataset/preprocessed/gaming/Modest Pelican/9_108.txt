[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with JTA if you enjoy this content please become a dates a biologist and name every species you discover subscribe to modest Pelican gaming or die slowly as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men are retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories alright this might well be one of the most emotional videos you watch this decade if you thought backdoor Girls vol 15 was inspirational then you haven't seen nothing yet I organized to meet the lads on the rooftop swimming pool at the casino and this is for one reason only to show off my new tattoo you see people aren't taking the sons of virgin seriously like Melman the giraffe 63 who commented saying you guys aren't gangsters why would you be proud of being a virgin well Melman I definitely bang hundreds of chicks on the daily if I was married to all of them imagine thinking premarital sex was gangster what a simp anyway I feel this Princess Bubblegum g-string tattoo just lets people know that I am in fact a gangster with a light salting of sophistication the lads arrive and we decide to have a quick diving competition and Crosby sort of just slips into the pool while being shot by the police so I guess zero out of ten the stealth acabo attempts a reverse dive entry with a high degree of difficulty but doesn't even make the water so I guess three out of ten then stealth I motto like an angel descending from the heavens front flips from the rooftop absolutely obliterating the competition with perfect execution the two out of ten so yeah congratulations stealth Oh Cabo I can't just heterosexually vibe with the lads in the pool all day because I've got to make some serious cash basically I won this flying deluxe Oh at the casino and I want to add two heat-seeking missiles to it because well they're heat-seeking missiles I about 1 million dollars to buy a mobile operation center and then I should be able to upgrade the car so it's time to hustle the lads keep teasing me about my wheels though so first I head over to los santos customs and purchase the most iconic rims I can find a questionable use of $75,000 but you can't put a price tag on letting everyone know that you don't close the curtains when you fap I want the neighbors to watch if Gerald's missions are currently paying double so it makes sense to do a few jobs for the big girl you come across a wide range of people in GTA online this guy's mullet is the stuff of dreams and this guy is literally me if I was secretly a communist because I'm not a communist I'm not like trying to build up a YouTube gaming channel so that I can secretly push my communist agenda I mean if I even had a communist agenda which I don't all right so job number one we've got to take out some Salva henchmen I'm not entirely sure where he got it but Crosby seems to be trying to easy people from a BMX bike which I mean is an Alfa play but questionable strategy choice we clear out the boss's hideout and somehow he's not dead a god I hate two looters shooters where the enemy's adjustable at spongers it's so grindy oh wait he is dead we just have to take a photo of his body kinky just like that $37,000 in the bank next up we have to steal the drugs yes now this is gangster I love drugs man I do two or even three drugs every minute hear that Melman the giraffe 63 I bet you regret writing that comment now you long-necked non-virgin high leaf-eating [ __ ] on another note what on earth is Cabo wearing in fact the only thing saving his outfit is that fedora women love fedoras especially when you send them unsolicited dick pics wearing only a fedora and then feel bad after you nut so you donate 50 percent of your salary to their twitch stream I mean I wouldn't know I'm not a communist I mean I'm not a simp God so many things that I'm not Wow seriously though I think Cabo needs to stop sexually assaulting the innocent scientists and then executing them it's sort of making me question his mental state but hey somebody's got to do it I guess mission complete $32,000 in the bank all right now we've got to sell the drugs in this truck I ride on the roof and it's great because I can provide suppressive fire on the potentially very dangerous civilian vehicle it's also a great time for a brewski life hack fill up your beer bottles with water so that you can stay hydrated Crosby keeps trying to drive under low things to knock me off it's pretty malicious online bullying but the important thing is we get paid $37,000 we have now paid off my dollar sign rims no regrets though we continue helping out old mates Gerald with his various errands we break into a meat factory and inside the safe is a secret formula for what I can only assume is the elusive krabby patty my man spongebob is so progressive he's out there tearing down society's social constructs every time he smashes that thick underwater astronaut squirrel the $32,000 the other way I'm making cash is by doing some VIP work for example assassinating some targets and of course the flying car helps but it would be a lot more helpful if it had missiles we're out here doing the most futuristic yet 90s hood drive-bys on armored cars so it sure does take a while of course we get it done eventually and to paid handsomely I do another hit because they just pay so well and aren't very risky unlike yesterday when I got a cheeky under the table handy of my boss's stepsister anyway as a youtuber I'm self-employed so yeah I don't know if this joke is funny because I actually have stepsisters so to get the last of the funds I need to head over to my nightclub it's good to see the place is still pumping seriously I appreciate you supporting my business during this difficult time man I remember when I used to love going to nightclubs when I first turned 18 we used to play the straw game where you would just get a straw and drink random people's drinks that they were holding when they weren't paying attention I drank this one girls drink and she was so angry that she threw it on me but then she saw I was wearing a fedora and we ended spending the entire night together premarital hand-holding but then I found out the girl's dad owned a multinational company and was a capitalist boot licker so I killed her entire family because communism is the future I mean we had a few Bacardi breezers and then went our separate ways as we had different personal interests yeah so anyway I now own the mobile operation center let's go it's got this big empty white space which is honestly pretty underwhelming but it does have a small living quarters and even a fruit bowl I'm actually really excited about the fruit bowl not sure why there's so year I go to drive the deluxe Oh into the operation center but as I'm a massive potato I didn't realize you also have to buy the vehicle workshop it costs just under 1 million dollars I take this news well and let out my emotions in a healthy and safe way by driving into oncoming traffic in my jag antic expensive truck all I know is that I'm not giving up on the dream are you guys witnessing my personal character arc progression the six months ago I would have given up we all know it also on the positive side stealth Amato has bought himself a vehicle that doesn't look absolutely ridiculous it's genuinely so weird seeing him drive something so normal we do some more VIP work like this one where we have to deliver cars and I mean you could say it doesn't go well I really don't even know how something like this happens if the car that needs delivering gets so stuck that several stepbrothers tried to take advantage of it man this channel is really being propped up by the adult entertainment industry eventually one of the lads cracked it and exploded everything we still get paid ten thousand dollars for some reason so cash money I am determined to make that full million though we keep doing job after job gone are the days of us killing each other over and over again the sons of virgins are like an oiled machine right now it's truly beautiful to witness after many hours of hustling I'm still $600,000 short at this point even the most hard-working of people would simply give up what's the point of having amazing classy dollar sign rims if I can't explode everyone with heat-seeking missiles for no reason in 1978 Michael Jordan was cut from the Laney high school basketball team yet went on to be one of the greatest sportsmen of all time this is my Laney high school moment but me attaching weapons to this flying car is far more inspirational than MJ story well maybe not but it's pretty damn close the lads have to get off for dinner so I contact a few of my most loyal subscribers to see if they're down to make some money they're not just down there the answer to my prayers acetic Diesel has the final mission for the Doomsday heist ready to play him my boy Ryan and devoted Penguin give me a very generous split of the takings some would say this is exploitation of my viewers but I did some what kind of half-heartedly suggest we do an even split but they were like yin-er yin-er yin-er you need the money you poor melaka well hurtful but thanks jeez it took like five entire videos for us to complete the Doomsday heist it feels weird doing it in one minute but who cares this is the fast four hundred and fifteen thousand dollars Ryan then says he has the last mission of the casino heist ready to go which genuinely gives me PTSD however he has done a much better job with the preparation missions and we just walk in the front door passing his staff it's pretty straightforward we inefficiently grab all the money and then to make things even easier the game glitches out and gives us all the weapons like literally every single weapon in the game it's quite the meme but sure does work and is better than a ceramic pistol of three hundred and eighty eight thousand dollars I feel like I'm using cheat codes you kill Esther having a bi-racial kiss in what must be the hottest cutscene of the 21st century of finally lads and lasses I can purchase the workshop for my truck and this is what I've been waiting for this is my moment to shine exactly like MJ did the seriously if I don't have a Nike shoe deal in my inbox by tomorrow afternoon I'm approaching added ass I proceeded to finally purchase the weapons upgrade introducing the weaponized deluxe oh the 50 caliber inbuilt machine guns are the perfect tool for clearing out crowded places do you suffer from social anxiety well that'll no longer be a problem when you gently remove all social interactions from your now much larger safe space if the police arrive don't sweat it just switch into hover mode and use your heat-seeking missiles to explode them all so swiftly that you'll forget they even have loving families make driving great again with the weaponized deluxe oh the smart way to get home safely all right for real this car makes two strong targets so easy no matter how armored they are I don't think I'll use this deluxe oh all the time though as I like driving around but still it's a good option to have for some fast cash I head over to eliminate the last target and another player oddly tries to defend them which is a really bad choice for their longevity but quite fun for me now feeling pretty accomplished I noticed a new potential threat for the sons of virgins you may have already realized but there's an alien war going on in many GTA servers around the world at the moment and it's taken over social media it's the green alien gang versus the purple alien gang and they go around murdering each other I think next episode if time we get involved let this be a message to all purple aliens out there who I'm choosing to side with also almost everyone who appears in my videos has some sort of social media which I always link in the description stealth acabo even has a youtube channel so if you were seeking some fresh content he has the fresh content anyway thanks for watching you absolute legends and a huge thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy Oh
