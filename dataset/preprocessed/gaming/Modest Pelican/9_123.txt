[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with thick men and today we're going to end the coronavirus if you enjoyed this video please call your dog modest Pelican gaming so that when you're out in public you can loudly shout its name as this really helps spread the good word of my channel today we travel to a five-star hotel in Thailand to foil a terrorist plot as two extremists are planning on detonating a bioweapon somewhere in the city apparently it's the corona virus and I promise I'm not just desperately linking this mission to real-world events for relevancies we'll need to blend in with the rich tourists so naturally I dress as a clown we'll take in with us a silenced pistol a frag grenade and a fresh fish our targets are sister yildiz and avec NAB Azov he can tell is 100% a terrorist because he lives in a country east of Turkey and has a beard anyway these big girls are pretending to be a self-help group which is their cover story for being in Bangkok they've set up a seminar on the top floor of the premises but fortunately the agency booked us a room here so I grabbed the keys from reception and follow this guy in a funny hat sorry that's probably pretty disrespectful to Thai culture the Hat is great and if turned upside down would make an excellent pot for a pot plant thanks man that really boosts my self-esteem I love starting off a double assassination with a warm fuzzy feeling inside anyway culturally appropriate hat guy shows me my room and it's got a really nice view of the river and the good people sailing ships are great there are tall ships small ships large ships but most importantly there are friendships all right so it's time we check out this self-help seminar Wow ho try walking a mile in these big our shoes so sorry for bringing laughter into the world this is just great now I have to murder people feeling self-conscious the seminar is pretty interesting it's like an affluent art exhibition had a baby with one of the PowerPoint presentations I made in year eight I steal an amputation knife from one of the displays because obviously I'm going to you amputation knife sounds hilarious if I was actually here for self-help as far as red flags go I'd say this slide is a big one but too many are afraid of death they think it's the end but it's not death is the beginning like seriously self-help courses are meant to teach you to love yourself exercise and be thankful not embrace death this entire seminar screams we're about to let off a biological weapon and kill millions anyway I need more intel on my targets I stumble across this couple having a domestic dispute as the girl is ready for them to sign up to this course the guy however is having second thoughts as he's getting a bad feeling I guess he's the only one here who's actually reading the slides so his name's Jeff which is sadly my name in real life and us Jeff's must stick together his girl was trying to persuade him to go back to his room and put on his weird red culty outfit but he refused so I follow him as maybe I can borrow it looks like he's staying on my level two which is perfect I then spot a potential thicker woman for my thumbnail but to my utter disappointment her sarong is loose-fitting when I turn around to follow Jeff into his room the door shut and I'm subsequently locked out the sort of regretting bringing the fish instead of an electronic key card hacker right now but yeah the booty really let Old Vic man down today so now we must commence operation penetrate Jeff's hotel room I'll need a master key card or something so I begin sweeping the hotel but then remember I'm staying right next door I attempt to climb on over and it goes reasonably well until this soldier is like I'm eight what the Pierre doing get down what a soldiers even doing here but yeah climbing across to his room isn't an option I continued searching but then notice the ashtray hasn't been emptied in ages yes I'm an assassin but I'm also a valued guest here and this lack of cleanliness will be harshly reflected in my TripAdvisor review I try to climb again but this time upwards I'm again surprised by some staff members who call security and now I'm apparently being hunted obviously not ideal and now I'm sort of just in my hotel room by myself and I'm not even in the mood to cry and jerk off or whatever normal people do in hotel rooms there's no option to put these robes on or take a relaxing warm bath either so instead I attempt to lure a garden with the fish this works surprisingly well and our continue leading him in by throwing the amputation knife as well this old-school pointy helmet outfit should give me the cover I need this looks perfect for when you've got a guard the hotel at one o'clock but invade Cambodia with King Rama and the boys at four I also get my fish back so thank God for small miracles operation penetrate Jeff's hotel room part two I still need a damn keycard so it's time we widen our scope a little bit also side note the ferns and palms in here are beautiful huge props to the gardener's for keeping it so lush because indoor plants are very hard to maintain trust me I'd know I recently bought like twelve I find the hotel manager who's sure to have a key card so now I just need to wait until she's alone well stalking her I hide behind this pillar but thick man is simply too thick for it and she easily spots him Wow is it everyone's goal in here to hurt my feelings first I'm a creep and now I'm fat I think agent 47 will genuinely need a self-help course after this I'm now being hunted again and this disguise is compromised and honestly Jeff can go Kim so there's probably a lesson here about not looking at women's booties and getting distracted or something but I'm too alpha to learn from my mistakes the speaking of thickness I miss Haven Island where there were unlimited booties what a tropical paradise honestly there's no point to this cutaway I'm just under unreasonable pressure from you legends to have thick thumbnails for every Hitman video so yeah we got it I climb back up to my room and yeah this feels familiar at least the guards on this floor haven't been alerted yet and then flat Judas exits her room again somehow I managed to just sneak in and I'll take it at least it's something I explore her room and it seems there's a naked man passed out on the floor who's probably been roofied that's so cute I find his clothes in the bath and now I look like a 45 year old aspiring DJ who's overly enthusiastically spinning beats at kids birthday parties at least I'm not compromised and so we commence operation penetrate Geoff's hotel room part 3 but this time with far more violence the sometimes you've got a step back and assess the situation like the other day I was in my bathroom washing my hands with soap and I thought wow I never filled this soap dispenser up how does it always have so much soap in it it turns out my girlfriend has been filling a tub for all these years so yeah I broke up with her immediately because who knows what else she's been hiding from me anyway I throw a fire extinguisher at this staff members head and then throw my fish at the other staff members head sadly though neither of them have a key card on them I then spy on this guy showering for a while and take his disguise I should now be able to freely move around the premises with the image of his naked body burned into my retinas I also learned that there's even more soldiers at the back of the hotel but there doesn't seem to be much else going on here apparently my fish can be thrown through doors which makes me feel slightly better about bringing it over you know anything useful I continue to generously apply more John wick to the situation but simply cannot locate a damn key card but finally though I stumble across a room being cleaned it's being cleaned by women only which is kind of sexist as it implies men can't clean which we definitely can we can clean up a game of call of Gd well that didn't even make sense but yeah I find a keycard in the room so good news there at last Geoff's hotel room has been penetrated i unshaved my amputation knife and the guy's just sitting there on his laptop in fact he's working on a damn Excel spreadsheet Jesus way to fill the Jeff stereotype do you really think our name needed this it feels wrong attacking a fellow Jeff when he's unaware so I throw a coin to get his attention and then when he notices my presence and looks into my eyes I Drive the knife into his stomach there can be only one his cultish robes are here too and so I say goodbye and head upstairs it's slightly concerning that I haven't actually located my targets yet but I feel like we're moving in the right direction I see a fellow red boy and decide to trail him he then heads over to an open window and stares out pondering the world and life decisions perhaps for example the questionable life decision I make to push him out the window in an extremely public area not the most tactical play of my life but it made me smile and as the Dalai Lama once said a simple smile is the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others I find the self-help ceremony I believe I'm starting to think this is almost certainly a cult now of the guards want to frisk me so I'll have to ditch the weapons it seems a shame to ditch the frag grenade I've been carrying around with me and so instead I toss it out the same window I threw my red buddy out of if the fall didn't kill him the dispersed shrapnel from the explosion certainly did I head back upstairs and find both of my targets which is convenient always good to know the location of who you're killing as I'm looking for an unoccupied hotel room to ditch the rest of my weapons the alarm is sounded and everyone begins to panic I guess you can't throw explosives inside a hotel after all and in fact isn't that the exact same reason I was sent here to eliminate sister Yildiz annoy back for detonating explosives in public needless to say I killed quite a few but end up getting gunned down Wow I reload and this time don't push him out the window because I'm a professional I ditch my guns in an empty bathroom and now it's time to enter the belly of the beast my uncle used to always do this to me when we were playing airport security and this part was way more fun than the cavity search all right so I'm in it's time to self-improve I take the conveniently left seat up the back and wait for something interesting to happen the stepsister yielders walks in with a red scarf and actually there's a lot of red going on in here is this a communist fuelled terror group commies are all about sharing and caring but also often the ones who enjoy killing the most it's hard to gauge where they're at Abby guy Beck strolls in and starts preaching to us about death and he's a bit of a wet blanket he then puts his hands in the fire - I guess flex his pain threshold it's probably fake fire but I appreciate the showmanship he then literally just asks me directly to go and have a word with him in private and I'm just like yeah short chief let's get out of here this is all going so well far better than getting into Jeff's hotel room that's for sure he then starts preaching his embrace death Metra and so I drown him in the prayer bowl which sort of seems like bad luck like am I going to be cursed for six years I'll always have my internet lag or something what do you reckons worse being drowned in holy water or lagging ever so slightly while gaming hardcore but yeah the agency then tells me that sister yel des is planning on leaving the hotel she's clearly more switched on than old mate deciding to flee from the terrifying bald Android looking malacca rather than going to a secluded place and turning her back she's also got an escort that is no joke for soldiers so we'll have to be coming and tactical I say g'day to Jeff and then put back on my way to disguise also just kidding these soldiers are really bad at their job probably wouldn't hurt to give the head a little swivel from time to time when you know a killers on the loose I take the unconscious guards disguise who I knocked out earlier I also realize I forgot to grab my weapons from the bathroom but I do still have the fish on me as the guards don't count it as a weapon but I would strongly disagree grab a handgun from the table and roll out straight through a video camera so hopefully that footage gets conveniently destroyed it's a long shot but I mean it worked out for whoever killed Epstein so here's my target she's just chilling on her phone and there's guards everywhere is she then no joke points her phone at me and takes a photo it's like I'm trying to see how many times I can get recorded while carrying out this mission I grab a propane flask and gently place it at her fate this isn't going to be subtle but it'll do the job more for the sentiment of it than any other reason I throw my fish at her head and then shoot the flask taking her out a GG mission complete and we did really well zero stars so firm handshakes for everyone seriously though why so low the only unnecessary murder was Jeff and I had every right to do that at least the people of Thailand and a bunch of seedy middle-aged white male tourists who were visiting for our work are safe from the coronavirus love you legends thanks for watching and a huge thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
