[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with mafia if you enjoy this video please go to the flat earth society and change their theory from a flat earth to a pelican-shaped one as this really helps spread the good word of my channel alright so we play as tommy angelo i used to be a humble taxi driver picking people up from the side of the road and basically just doing god's work i wasn't the best taxi driver on the east coast so i decided to join the mafia instead and that was honestly a pretty bad recap but we hit the main points so now i'm a member of the salieri crime family and our organization is currently very weak and no one's actually died yet i just thought it would be symbolic to walk through the graveyard like this anyway the don wants to strike our rivals where it hurts the most we're going to destroy their gentleman's club of course i have to do it because i'm the new kid on the block i thought initiation ceremonies were meant to involve lighthearted banter and risky unprotected foot rubs between the boys but i guess setting off an explosive in the middle of a densely populated city is just as welcoming i'm also no demolitions expert but i can't imagine puffing on a malbro red right next to said explosive is the wisest decision sammy and i head off together and my briefing is to eliminate the manager of the club a call girl who's been snitching on us and then finally destroy the place sammy asks if i can just scare the girl and not kill her it sounds like someone has a crush and probably also syphilis i drop him off at church which seems extremely unfair he gets sacramental wine and fresh bread meanwhile i become some kind of radical extremist oh well it's time to do what i do best infiltrate building stealthily and perform skilled assassinations let's take down the iconic corleone hotel i'm grated by this big girl and as i make my way into the establishment i'm immediately offered casual sex this place is disgusting and sinful i mean this girl is strutting around with a pearl necklace and that should be censored seriously what a flex we get it you have an impressive collection of affluent jewelry i find the manager giving a speech but i obviously can't kill him here as it's far too public i decide to book myself in for a session and follow this lovely lady up to one of the hotel suites wow that's a strange painting to have hung up in a 1930s hotel this is perfect because i can ask where michelle is the girl i need to eliminate she tells me and then my finger proceeds to slip like eight times in a row ah well at least she won't be able to alert anyone now that she's unconscious or maybe dead it's hard to know i take a multivitamin because nourishing your immune system is important and then head to michelle's room she throws a vaz at me which is pretty mean and then pleads for her life i tell her to leave town and never come back unless it's to apologize about the vase with that handled it's time to take down the big papa i'm going to have to finesse this situation just kidding i pull out a shotgun i found upstairs and take him out in front of everyone i probably should have tried to find a more subtle approach as this place is crawling with morelo's men they're actually little snakes head glitching on the stairs what is this call of duty i now have to find a suitable place to plant the bomb and as this is a linear game i will actually just have to do exactly what i'm told sort of like this guy who looks like he was having a grand old time before i showed up tied up in a clown wig i think we can all agree that's pretty hot i plant the bomb and then do an epic tnt jump to the safety of the rooftops where i escape call me dream also no shade but whoever washed these sheets really sucks at removing the brown stains why don't you get yourself some bleach pour it into a bucket soak the fabric for 45 minutes and then drink the bleach because you suck at laundry i end up shooting everybody at the funeral which seems disrespectful and then sam and i escape in a hearse that literally still has a coffin in the back i feel like things have gone from 0 to 100 awfully quickly i just killed like 50 people my old errands involved staunching the local baker for protection money and now we're here we do manage to get away but because of all the heat this has brought onto the family we have to lay low for seven months we do still have one profitable racket selling liquor which back in the 1930s was a big deal this guy is the bar manager luigi who's a trusted friend of the family i'm also banging his daughter sarah who's not nearly as cute as him i leave the room but then comes straight back to say that he stopped sweeping when i wasn't watching which is disappointing i'll have to dock his pay on one of the supply runs the whiskey sellers don't show up so i head in to investigate i spend way too long playing with this swing as for whatever reason the physics fascinate me and poorly think something is definitely wrong here and i wonder how on earth he managed to draw that conclusion is it the blood splattered everywhere which suggests something or someone was horrifically dragged through the barn or is it the pile of corpses damn he's good i see the dodgy melakas who are hijacking our whiskey and do what i apparently now do best murder everyone fedora on fedora crime you just hate to see two men who clearly both get a lot of punani shooting each other super sad stuff we hear gunfire and my boy sammy is pinned down and then gets shot and this is obviously a setup and it seems that morello knew about the mate and has ambushed us we kill a bunch more of his men and then rush to see if sam's okay honestly i think he's milking it a little bit we get it mate you got shot what do you want a purple heart i signed up for tailored suits and everyone being scared of me not constant gang warfare not that long ago i was driving drunk people home from the bar and now i'm a serial killer which can cause quite a lot of deep emotional scarring if don salieri doesn't pay for at least 8 psychology sessions i'm talking to hr at least it's just morello's gangsters it's a victimless crime or so we thought i realize this setup is a police operation and so we've been mowing down law enforcement which isn't great these men have families children wives side chicks for god's sake they're civilians what has tommy become still sickest killionaire of my life get out of my game i'm on fire against all odds we managed to escape and so here i am in the pouring rain somewhat poetically driving a stolen cab thinking about the hell i just lived through might as well go and visit luigi's daughter and get laid i mean it can't hurt marry me okay wow romantic if you ignore the fact that she sounds like she's under duress and i'm covered in like 15 different people's blood the don wants to mate in the park and he has some heavy news but frank his best friend and accomplice has betrayed the family and he wants me to take care of it geez there's a lot going on right now so i use this brief moment of respite to take a jog around the park and cardio can lower blood pressure but more importantly further strengthens the immune system i might have night terrors from all the homicides but the common cold can't catch me they've organized a nice car for me and so i walk up to it and press y it's a different button to enter vehicles than it is in gta i do this quite a lot and it really takes the shine off my whole gangster persona no one has seen frank in days and it seems as if he's trying to skip town with his family i head to the seedy part of town to see if anyone's heard anything there and there's a man taking a leak on a mattress unfortunately for our viewing pleasure it's a family-friendly leak as they've removed his peony progressive and fun i drive around all day chasing clues and talking to people and then finally little tony says i should go to frank's house i wait there until he's picked up by morello's men who probably should have started at frank's house that seems reasonably obvious but the important thing is we found the snitch i follow them to the airport and it seems they've completely closed the place down to the public damn the morellos have some serious connections perhaps i joined the wrong crime family maybe i should switch sides but again leading a story no can do however in real life if your family starts to fall apart just leave you can always meet another partner or have some more kids it's no big deal if you can't conceive just steal a kid they're absolutely everywhere playing in parks and around schools they're small and uncoordinated as well because their motor skills aren't fully developed making it easy to snatch one right up i'm going to have to keep a low profile as i want to avoid an all-out gunfight again i do love how members of the mafia insist on doing everything in tailored suits i'm always getting chased and climbing walls sure it looks fresh but it's wildly impractical i managed to take down a guard who isn't paying attention and then see frank being escorted to the aircraft hangars my guy is about to try and escape the country so i've gotta be fast i work efficiently like a ghost wasting no time except to quickly put two guards on top of each other so that when they're found people think they're lovers i managed to get around the back avoiding most people and now it's time to face frank he's like sorry bro they threatened my wife and kid but i'm no symp so i pull out a pump action shotgun and graphically take them all out i'm kidding i let them go and don't even get so much as a thank you just a tiny nod through the window which makes my actions feel underappreciated i then head down to the bank and open a junior savings account because big dreams start small then i fake frank's death with him gone the salieri family is a shadow of its former self as the morellos only grow more powerful unfortunately paulie has a job for us that involves buying more whiskey which went super well before so i don't foresee any complications doing the exact same thing again the job's going down in an old parking garage which they were kind enough to block off for us we're apparently going to be buying off some canadian lads who are waiting for us on the top floor i see them waiting and i pull into the car park nothing's gone wrong yet they're all smiles and the whiskey tastes great and they were immediately gunned down by morello's men and half of us die in one sweeping moment the only positive is i have this extremely godfather like tommy gun moment and i'll admit it made me pretty hard the canadian boss gets clipped badly but he's pretty chill about the whole ordeal at least we managed to get the liquor although getting it out of the parking garage is proving to be quite a mission picking a mating location with only one entrance is now seeming quite naive i genuinely think our crew needs a strategic coordinator we escort the truck which also gets pretty dicey and if things don't start getting better quickly for us we could be wiped out soon we need to take down morello thanks for the love on the first mafia video i'll definitely finish off the story with a final video soon thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
