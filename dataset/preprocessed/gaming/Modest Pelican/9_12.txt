dying light 2 has an interesting take on the zombie gaming genre and like its predecessor is heavily focused on parkour there are however no guns because besides everyone who likes shooting zombies the streets are crawling with the little malakas so it's far safer to get around on the rooftops they're green and lush and you'll even find other survivors up here like this guy we're stealing from your lover's husband's field voice of an angel and this is a building not a field but close you'll also be faced with a range of challenging ethical decisions like should you help people who are in need anyway i was keen to check this game out because i enjoyed the first one and so i load in pick my settings and then the game crashes immediately it's crazy sometimes other humans die sometimes i die and sometimes my entire console died it's next level immersion the first thing i have to do is complete the prologue this teaches me how to jump and leap around i make a friend called spike and he's like hey bro can you collect some honey for me which i mean i do collecting honey is a surprisingly huge part of this game a bees are a pretty fascinating insect i guess it's getting dark so we find a mansion to spend the night in the people who used to live here had one of those wholesome end of the world parties where you gather all of your closest friends and family and then all od on pills and end your life together i love that this guy thought he should put his hat on before he parted ways with the world he either wanted to look drippy or was genuinely worried about the uv rays i have a beer with spike and we watch the sunset together he then says he has a bad feeling about me and proceeds to straight up abandon me i'm sure he'll reach back out when i'm 18 years old or if i become famous he did give me a bat before he left so silver lining i head out to find a place to sleep because apparently the 8 bedroom mega mansion wasn't adequate the game advises that i sneak past this horde of zombies but i didn't download this not to fight these things i beat each and every one of them to death from the safety of the truck's trailer who needs guns when you have two foot ledges i arrive at my new temporary home and hit the sack i'm quite envious at how fast this guy falls asleep the sun comes up and i've gotta reach the city so i can find information on my long lost sister who has aids or something it's important i get there before dark because that's when the zombies are at their most dangerous the issue is the only way into the city is through some dark sketchy subway tunnels what could go wrong to no one's surprise a lot goes wrong i'm attacked by an undead heifer and bitten so now i'm infected which isn't ideal i then meet these tunnel guys and my character just wanders over and is like hey champ how are you this also doesn't go well who would have guessed the hockey mask wearing psychopath with blood dripping danny's neck didn't want to cuddle i brawl my way out of the sewers because i forgot to mention i'm the best fighter in the world i reached the city and freedom at last except just kidding the locals try to hang me just a good old-fashioned public execution so the kids have something to talk about this man saves me though what a beast i thank him by spamming b and skipping through everything he has to say the open world has been raged and our new friend is going to help us find a cure for our infection that is one goal yes but my personal goal will be publicly executing as many locals as i can i want revenge and it will be sweet my boy shows me these little gardens that people have made and mostly just how to steal from them i proceed to gather some more honey premium beehive gameplay the bees do play a crucial role in fertilizing plants and just because there's a zombie outbreak doesn't mean pollination has to stop now that it's extremely dark and terrifying we figure it's the perfect ambience to break into a hospital and find a cure to my infection i'm no detective but i don't think a qualified hospital staff member was willing this bad as they have brutally crushed someone i'm then required to carefully sneak past a bunch of sleeping zombies honestly good on them as there's nothing more healthy than getting a full night's rest the game then just goes full horror and it reminds me of when i played outlast too my mate crosby absolutely stitched me up and uploaded a video a year ago called modest pelican yells at man in wheelchair rare footage this is awesome i find the medicine and escape the hospital and just like that i'm a healthy man i make my way towards the church as that seems to be the base of operation for these larrikins on my way i spot a few of them holding a funeral service for one of their fallen comrades there's nothing more sentimental than burying your friend in a pile of sand in the middle of the road well at least they tried to bury him he's kind of just half sticking out i proceeded to start swinging my broken shovel and take one of them down while the rest panic and flee i will never forget that these savages tried to hang me i arrive at the church ready to repent and drink holy water or so i had planned but there's a sign saying out of water i can deal with the hangings the beheadings and the undead chasing me around medical facilities but this is a bold direction for the developers to take the story in the little community they have here is just as bad this man has a sign saying if life gives you lemon add vodka that sign is twisted there's no water so why would that man be encouraging binge drinking which dehydrates you faster this town is a joke look at this dumb ass kid looking at the floor like she's never seen a limestone tile before read a book i offer to help some guy get electrical parts for his electric fence because it's the only way to progress the story not because i'm trying to build rapport outside the town is where you find the real questionable characters i found this lad chomping down on a squash it wouldn't be that weird if he wasn't standing next to his friend who is being absolutely demolished by roaches i take this opportunity to gather a little more honey i'm basically a beekeeper at this point it's lit i find the electrical parts but there are zombies absolutely everywhere unfortunately in high school i was the kind of lad to skip out on having sex so that i could stay home and grind call of duty zombies with the boys that was mainly because no girl wanted to have sex with me as well as being one lanky unit i also went to an extremely christian school and they taught us that if you had sex before marriage you would rot in the fiery pits of hell being tortured for eternity as you can imagine it made it pretty hard to get laid i got an over the pants wristy once though so yeah pretty cool on my way back i noticed an injured citizen being nursed by two men apparently she had a stomachache it becomes clear that they're too weak-hearted to euthanase her so i step up and do what has to be done i run back to the church so my man can fix his electric fence he does it and it kills one of the goats i assumed the electric fence was to keep the zombies out not to keep in the goats doesn't seem like a great prioritization of resources as those parts were quite hard to get my next task is to find out what's been happening to the water supply as apparently it's been poisoned now this is a quest i can really get behind some people are saying there is no water some people are saying it's been poisoned let's get some answers i break into this apartment via lock picking and roll up on this woman who's surprisingly calm and happy to speak to me this almost never happens when i do it in real life she's like silly me instead of giving my husband vodka i gave him water which i tell her as poisoned she may have just killed the love of her life but her heart was in the right place stay hydrated i run over to find the big man and i have the option to either tell him that the water is poisoned or give him the vodka i decide not to tell him and just give him the booze so that hopefully he dies and i can hit on his wife later without feeling guilty now it's time to figure out who's been poisoning the water in the first place i clear out the water facility by slicing and dicing my way through a horde of zombies i put this dope shock attachment onto my blade and it's quite satisfying to use the only thing that would make this more satisfying is if i had a daewoo precision industry usa 12 combat shotgun i meet the man behind it all and he's like sorry bro i poisoned the water to try and kill some thieves who were stealing it the problem is the thieves didn't actually steal the poisoned water batch so he accidentally killed countless innocent men women and children these are the same people who tried to hang me so i tell him his secret's safe with me as i say this as a win-win he accidentally committed a genocide i'm intentionally planning a genocide potato potato and plus he gave me several bags of flour for some reason so if i suddenly want to start baking small goods i'm sorted it's now time to prepare for war in the book of matthew it says if anyone slaps you on the right cheek turn to him the other also if anyone takes your tunic let him have your cloak as well but if anyone tries to publicly hang you then message your mate jezo and form a kill squad so that you can run through the streets massacring everyone i made jezo on the roof of a tall building for cinematic effect it turns out he's a far higher level than i am and supplies me with new weapons strong blades a bow c4 explosives and even a boomstick shotgun that you can fire twice and then it breaks we majestically leap off the building onto the highway but i miscalculate the jump and fall to an excruciating and rather embarrassing death jezzo competently makes his way down and revives me i appreciate it but i'll forever think he's weak for not euthanasing me we scout the vicinity for our first target and then spot a man sitting by himself looking kinda cute and lonely jezzo places a c4 behind him and fortunately he has the spatial awareness of a dead hooker and continues sitting there cluelessly contemplating his existence the detonation goes off and the man wears the explosion like a champion in his spare time i guess he tanks for overwatch pro teams so i cut off his limbs we forge forward murdering anyone in our path who has a pulse we then come across another funeral i'll never understand why these people feel the need to bury their dead on pavement this would be an incredibly shallow grave and given there is a literal zombie apocalypse maybe sticking to the textbook six foot underrule would be wise either way we sprinkle a healthy amount of c4 around i guess they thought we were doing it in a respectful way like there were roses or something because they didn't seem too bothered kill confirmed we reach the church town and run around picking off the fleeing survivors i've said it before but i quite often think about what i'd do if a zombie apocalypse broke out first thing i would do is ditch my girlfriend anna yes we've been together for almost eight years but that doesn't make her any less of a liability for a petite girl she eats quite a lot and it'd be a tough decision but one i'd make quickly next i would go out to anna's dad's farm where there's guns food and safety he'd ask where anna is and i would lie and say that she just disappeared i'd have to live out my remaining years with the guilt of what i'd done but i'd be living those years with a full stomach of nourishing food preferably prepared by anna's dad after some time i'd take the risky journey to a major city and find a radio station where i could transmit a message to as many people as possible i'd then pull out an ipod classic from my pocket one that i'd kept switched off this entire time ready for this moment i'd plug it into the sound system and let it play the struggling survivors would pause for a moment wondering what they were hearing could this be a message from their loved ones maybe a rescue mission for food and supplies no it is rick astley's hit song never gonna give you up and i would have just executed the most brilliant and possibly last rick roll the world would ever see i feel that i've had sufficient revenge from the hanging attempt and can now rest easy we held a discord event the other night where people could ask one question on the main stage this guy wanted to know why he was temporarily banned oh and then i warned you for um nancy imagery in general oh my god and then super chaos muted you for talking about drugs despite warning that was on christmas oh man make sure you join the discord it's where dreams become reality link below thanks for watching i appreciate it hit that like if you enjoyed this video otherwise i love you and goodbye [Music]
