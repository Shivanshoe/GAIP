[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with JTA on mind if you enjoy this video please tell all the currents of the world to complain about the lack of questionable content on daytime TV and to request my videos be played instead as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories I spawn in my shower and I regret many things but this thick princess tattoo sure isn't one of them the so last episode we fought in the ongoing alien war for the green guys but I think we've more than earned an honorable discharge and it's time to get back to our roots you see the problem with being a green alien is that Christian babes don't want to have pleasurable premarital intense eye contact with you even when you aggressively chase them down it's bizarre so yeah Vic alien is retired and thick man is back in business today we continue the loose and frankly unoriginal overarching plot of this entire series where we try to get rich it's time to attempt the pacific heist first though I owe it to the world to try and bring peace upon this alien savage city and end this war once and for all I'll do this in the only logical way I can think of by hydrating all the violent extraterrestrials I can find the stealth amato changes back to a conservative outfit and as we're about to call in a fire truck a player in a jet tries to bomb us on his second strafing run I attempt to shoot him out of the sky but my laser cannon is no match for his military aircraft but back in the day we would have had to run away from a fight like this but now that I own a deluxe Oh with rockets it's a different story it may genuinely be the most disgusting car of all time but it's going to hopefully do the job I haven't had an aerial fight in this thing before so I'm more nervous than the time I lost my virginity was anxious so I asked if we could turn the lights off but she was confident and wanted to leave them on as a compromise I brought out a strobe light it was like smashing at an EDM concert and she said I was really good for my first time what she didn't know is I was having a seizure from my undiagnosed epilepsy but still a victory royale all the same anyway I run out of Rockets and as I'm respawning my car the dodgy Malaka accidentally crashes his jet we proceeded to kill him over and over again and I even get some help from a fellow green alien blood in blood out I guess we just keep bullying this guy until he eventually locks himself in his garage where's your jet now big girl you can't pad your precious kill death ratio when 3 alpha Chad's gang up on you using the power of friendship I mean not friendship something better the power of bloody uncensored Japanese adult videos anyway the lads hop off for dinner which gives me the perfect time to hydrate the soldiers and end this current conflict did you know sufficient water intake could have prevented most major international conflicts the Joseph Stalin was actually on the fence about going forward with his violent communist agenda but he was simply thirsty on that particular decision day and he went ahead with it Adolf Hitler was notoriously dehydrated and even internet edge meme Lord Joseph Kony only built up an army of African child soldiers because he wasn't getting his daily intake of glorious h2o water saves lives I even try and hydrate some of the purple aliens because I'm all inclusive no one will go thirsty on my watch the purple are certainly more hostile towards me I guess it makes sense I was at war with them only 13 days ago but still show some class I managed to get my firetruck stock and no step-sibling even tries to take advantage of me which is incredibly disappointing I've done all I can to end the great war and hopefully bring peace to GTA servers worldwide the lads get back online and naturally I start the day how old thrill-seeking intellectuals should by jumping off a building but rather than opening the parachute at the last minute like a Normie adrenaline junkie you just never opened the parachute and died now that's a real rush we decide to meet at the local skate park to prepare for the highest and also because only good things come from skate parks when I was younger I once got punched in the jaw by a messed-up junkie at a skate park in character-building at its finest but back then I was also dating this twin and she used to always come and watch me ride my BMX bike it was really cute one day I made out with the wrong twin and so she stopped coming to watch me and also just broke up with me completely of course I tried to reason with her and say that I was simply confused but she was all like you should know me better than that and we're not even identical twins he's literally a male with a penis anyway the boys boys boys are getting new outfits so Marta and I head over to meet them for a cheap laugh I tried to knock out motto when he's not paying attention but when he goes in for revenge he clean knocks out this lady for no reason wow he's actually bringing back some pretty tender memories of that method up junkie from the skate park not going to lie I then realized stealth amato was that method up junkie jeez the world sure is small it's funny how it all goes full circle like that a crosby comes out dressed like young ancestor and in a rare moment of teamwork between motto and die we end him it's actually Crosby's birthday today so I guess this was his present happy ninth birthday big fella I guess stealth osimo is going for a timeless old man whose overly nice to underage girls look we're ready to heist well first of course we have to get some snacks which should have been a relaxing errand but I ended up robbing the convenience store and shooting the cashier we've all been there Oh Crosby saves us in his CD white van so now we're ready to Pacific heist our Lester always here but never does anything to help he's like a lifeguard at the Olympic 100-meter freestyle heist prep number one I also forgot to mention rock star gave me $500,000 as a reward for playing last month which is nice what isn't nice is this one of us is going to have to change Jesus Christ this is so embarrassing I mean don't get me wrong we all look fantastic in these legs spreading fine straw fedoras but still also look at the vehicle we have to drive I haven't seen this much seedy white van action since last Saturday afternoon when Crosby and I went around abducting kids and contrary to popular belief it is actually illegal to do that we're just lucky the police officer who caught us had a good sense of humor and that one of the kids we took was the officers trial we negotiated his release for our freedom and all shared a laugh at the coincidence so this mission we have to photograph fans to find the right one you think this would be easy but we almost failed because we took so long the stealth OSEM oh and I just sat there doing nothing but good energy from the boys who needs to watch a top 10 plays youtuber when you have low speed ban clutches right here on this channel the stealth osimo has to be the most wholesome guy in our group sitting here in a white suit watching cartoons just kidding he proceeds to get a lap dance normally this would be quite sinful but those long socks cover all the good bits so we're still family-friendly thank God all right so heist prep - we've got to take these jet skis to an island and then abduct someone how fitting I feel like we're in a coca-cola commercial right now but funnily enough this mission offers a more authentic World War 2 experience than battlefield 5 even with the jet skis and helicopters this Normandy landing simulation is more immersive speaking of immersion a lot of you guys don't know this but I turned down an internship at Amazon working directly with Jeff Bezos so I could make youtube videos instead it was a great opportunity especially because my NASA internship had fallen through awake earlier you say it was double xp weekend on call of duty and I wanted to get the gold camo for my m4 to impress the boys so I skipped to the interview so yeah I could literally be on a satellite in space counting that Amazon bread right now but instead I chose the hood and by hood life of course I main uploading mediocre gaming content so don't be so quick to judge because you don't know me or my story the seriously thanks for the support I love you please subscribe it's the only thing that makes my penny hard anymore heist prep to complete while we wait for Lester to call for heist prep 3 we vibe at Crosby's crappy apartment for a while it looks a lot like my old apartment what are the chances of us having the exact same family photos twinsies stealth Oh Simo watches more cartoons but sadly doesn't get the follow-up lap dance he was chasing meanwhile Crosby and I get really high while motto judges us for our bad life choices the way he sassily shakes his finger like that really riddles me with guilt don't smoke weed kids or it'll ruin your life because everyone knows that if you smoke weed then later that day you'll burn alive in a horrendous traffic accident it's pretty crazy heist prep part 3 and is Lester trying to seduce us because it's working anyway we've got to go and intercept another crews heist so we can take their equipment or some honestly I don't really know I was too busy undressing Lester with my eyes we'll be taking you guessed it a white van it's like the universe is trying to tell me something right now like by a white van in real life Jeff and get back on that horse champ maybe I will you know this is actually pretty dog of us to roll up on another crew like this I don't know if there's a heist ethics code but surely this would be a gray area imagine if you tried to rob a bank and at that exact moment another crew tried to rob the same Bank everyone would just stop and laugh at the unlikeliness of such a thing happening in that moment there wouldn't be robbers civilians bank clerks bad guys or good guys it had just be humans laughing and embracing that precious moment realizing that we're all the same on the inside and then the cops would come and shoot all the bank robbers in the head as their brains literally painted the inside of the building red we proceeded to steal the tech from this van so think watchdogs it's all very silicon data mining action analytics recognition machine quantum computing we then run a distraction play in the black van so Crosby can finish stealing the equipment and just like that another heist preparation is complete it feels good to be back making money again hi sting with the crew and we'll finish it next episode I also want to start investing heavily in to businesses soon I bet I end up buying something stupid though I always seem to be reckless with my finances but hey you can't put a price on making the legends who watch your videos smile a warm smile is the universal language of kindness and will help build immediate trust with strangers you can then use this trust as leverage to lure them into your van I hope you're all having a great week thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay class [Music]
