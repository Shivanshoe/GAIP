[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with JTA online if you enjoyed this video please send a card to your Valentine but don't include anything cute or erotic just write the URL to my YouTube as this really helps spread the good word of my channels mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times of these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so I wake up in my new mansion I purchased two last videos I'm not sure why I have dresses in my wardrobe not sure what old thick man likes doing any spare time sort of screams serial killer but hey at least I've got a double sink in my ensuite so that every night when I brush my teeth I'm reminded that I'll die sad and alone we currently have four hundred and seventy thousand dollars in the bank and it's time as always to make some money I hit the bong like I hit my kids standing up strong and tall like an alpha male and then roll out this mansion is sick except for the fact that there's no garage access from inside the residence like not even a covered walkway so if it's raining you're going to get wet unlike any girl I've ever been with did kidding I've never been with a girl unless you count roblox sex chat rooms which most people don't I don't make it far before crosby says to come back and check out his car and it's literally just the same soccer mum SUV he always drives around thanks gamer very cool in the seconds I've been gone some guy has started smoking outside my house so I kindly ask him to vacate the premises is he trying to pretend at this mansion is his or something I guess I used to stand near beautiful women and pretend they were my girlfriends but they kept on getting mad calling the police and telling me to get the [ __ ] out of their bedroom the speaking of beautiful women remember how stealth arroba used to be well let's just say not pleasant to look at featuring mouth herpes well my boy is now a bit of a hottie I mean it's a pretty weird thing to say but he dummy thick now he also drives a yellow pickup he tells me that he's basically designed the perfect girlfriend for him but in GTA online which might be the saddest yet most beautiful thing I've ever heard in my life we head down to the hairdresser's so that he can get a power woman haircut and Wow Robbie I know you like role-playing but that's just a sexist and Crosby shows me his new car as he was sick of us teasing him about being a soccer mum it quickly becomes apparent that he has purchased a higher class SUV but still clearly a vehicle a soccer mom would drive well at least the sons of virgins are more diverse now I guess stealth Oh Robo is a little minx and Crosby is a mature woman I also noticed the hairdresser's bathroom is co-ed which is frankly not very family-friendly and could encourage premarital mischief did you know that fifty two point one percent of the world's population engages in sinful premarital hand-holding also fifty two point one percent of you who watch my videos aren't subscribed to me coincidence I think not there's so instead of deflowering your palms subscribe to my channel it's what Jesus would want so yeah as you can see I fail to win the flying motorbike for like the sixth time this week I've been logging in every day spinning this bloody wheel and I seem to always get reputation points which is the equivalent of asking your parents for an Xbox but instead being put into foster care seriously though Robo took one for the team making his avatar thick you've got to respect the man for putting my future thumbnail potential above his immersion realistically though he could have gone thicker you see now that's where it's at hot damn you're a lucky man sir and Crosby's connection dropped so as we waited for all the boys to log in we sat in the hot tub together if you haven't had a virtual hot tub together with your bro are you really bros Wow imagine if this is the first video you're watching of mine can't imagine this is a great first impression anyway a while later a lot of the lads log on and it's time to get down to business a crosby whips out the party bus and I'd like to introduce you to ex goichi GG our friend from New Zealand his name used to be thought patrol but it was banned so he changed it to this basically he wanted the cringe just name possible and I think he nailed it xq g JJ proceeds to murder everyone and spoil the bus party which is online bullying so we all report him to xbox live support staff so that he can be banned he's had a run-in with the law before and will now hopefully learn a valuable lesson about online gaming respect we do our absolute best to keep the party going despite the bloodshed but the party bus is actually just a means of transport for the main event we need to get to the docks and now driving two kilometers to the docks would normally be a relatively straightforward exercise but with a crew this large even the simplest objectives become quite complicated I mean I'll admit I'm definitely part of the problem but for example we finally get a few of the boys into a practical family bin and then just get blown up by sexy Robbie and have to start organizing everyone all over again actually you know what most of the problem is just Robbie blowing us up with a rocket launcher all of a sudden a random player joins the session and I can tell by that smoothping he clearly lives locally to me I ignore stranger danger and try to jump into his helicopter but stealth afield Oh fires a ray gun pushing me into the rotary blades thus ending my life in a pretty horrific way but by some miracle we make it to the docks and finally reach the tugboats a few of the lads purchased these things for like 1.25 million dollars each and I'll be damned if we're not going to breathe in that sweet Seabreeze air and become what I always wanted to be when I grew up a Somali pirate a lot of random players seem to have joined the session too so it's getting spicy we decide that if we're going to sea we best take a helicopter with us for maneuverability if I don't say so myself it looks extremely cinematic having two stunning and brave tugboats bobbing up and down in the ocean one of the random players seems to have landed a car on stealth OSI most ugh so I used my cargobob to take care of the situation I consider dropping the car into the ocean but then I'd have to pay for insurance and that counters the overall goal here of making money and so instead I place it onto this warehouse roof along with stealth Oh field though so that he can provide covering fire for the lair while I was doing this rubber destroyed Gucci's tugboat with you guessed it a rocket launcher and the wheels really have started to come off this seaside adventure I think the key problem here is that Robby is a Scorpio and gucci is a Sagittarius and those star Saiyans really clash I'm kidding it's because they both have daddy issues anyway feel those doubts sniping our own men and not the random players so I have to parachute down onto the roof and take care of the situation it's a full-blown civil war between the sons of virgins and it's not the first time we've collapsed and I'm sure it won't be the last on the positive side we still have Simoes tugboat so at least we can track out to sea and fulfill our dream of becoming Somali pirates also the random players have turned out to be subscribers and quite pleasant travel companions so things are starting to look up Iguchi then proceeds to destroy the boat killing all remaining survivors in the process I swear we need like a summer camp coordinator to well coordinate us I decide to give up on the pirate dream for just a minute and instead take my subscribers to the vanilla unicorn this was simply a test though to see if they truly are believers in family-friendly content but they failed the test when they entered the premises Robo decides to get a girl-on-girl private dance and quite frankly I've had enough of this inappropriate conduct I shoot the bouncer in the head so that all the NPC's flee but Robo stays inside and he's angry that his prepaid dance was cut short the madmen or woman whatever then starts massacring my fans right in front of me he then kills Dom HR who's one of our mates and so I'm forced to put the big girl down Wow things sure did get out of hand most of the lads log off for dinner because they're weak I just snort a line of G fuel and then snort a glass of water straight afterwards so now it's just Crosbie myself and these legendary subscribers and what do you do when you have a bunch of loyal fans who are the backbone of your YouTube channel and support what you do well you put them straight to minimum wage work you see it's been a while since I've sold drugs and so I visit my desert cocaine lab and sure enough there's a batch ready to be moved all these guys are actually much higher levels than me and seem to all have flying motorbikes so I'm kind of feeling a little bit useless right now unfortunately Crosby lends me his which is incredibly kind as I can now keep up and ensure the product gets delivered a just kidding he kicks me off his bike and I fall off but luckily I have a parachute just kidding I didn't pull it in time so here I am in a minivan supervising from a distance as the new and improved sons of virgins do the actual deliveries I finally catch up to the boats and sit shotgun whilst we finish the road honestly I'm not sure what they would have done without me the important thing is money is finally being made why stop at dealing drugs though I head over to my office and start plotting bigger and better things I'm going to set up a subscriber fueled Empire and I'm not taking advantage of them because this is valuable work experience we're not actually in the voice chat with these guys so I just point at the truck that they need to make the deliveries in I tried using this method in real life with my girlfriend I pointed out the vacuum then the dishes then my crotch and then she left me with the lads busy making me cash Crosby and I head over to the casino for a drink and maybe a cheeky slap on the pokies unfortunately the game doesn't let you gamble whilst your crew is on a job how the hell am I meant to become a dictator if the game forces me to help them after a while I salute each and every one of the brave men who assisted me today also a salute to Rockstar for giving me 1 million dollars just for playing I use my newfound wealth to buy a tugboat of my own the dream lives on she's a real beauty too but I'm not quite sure what to name her leave your suggestions in the comments and I'll pick the best one but for now I take the base towards the city do you like how I couldn't think of a name for the tugboat so I just asked you guys to come up with one the exploitation never stops if you've never driven a tugboat during a sunrise you really should it's honestly quite invigorating I dock at the Santa Monica Pier and while I wait for the lads to arrive I decide to shoot everyone in the vicinity a wait I guess these jokes aren't really funny anymore so I mean I just decide to enjoy the view of this blissful ocean with everybody on board we make only briefly stopping to send it over this jump chat somebody clipped that so yeah this is fine they'll have to stop chasing us once we get to international waters so at last we are Somali pirates our next objective is proving that the earth is in fact flat I quickly realize tug boats are extremely slow and this was maybe a questionable purchase but I've got something big planned for next video involving it so yeah self-promotion anyway we sail for literally thousands of hours there is an attempted mutiny but fortunately there were no casualties and we're able to keep going we are pretty interested to see what happens if you just keep going and then all of a sudden our boat explodes it must be the government going to great lengths to keep the fact that the earth is flat hidden they benefit greatly from keeping this secret we decide to just swim for it and the seas are rough just like my virtual roblox sex life eventually though we seem to hit an invisible wall or something and decide to just fight each other and then stealth Oh Robo drowns me what a way to go so there you go it turns out it's actually impossible to tell if the world is flat or round so I guess it'll just remain one of life's many unsolvable mysteries I suppose that's why Somali pirates exist they're just water heroes out there trying to find proof we decide to celebrate by attending a party at the Playboy Mansion but I'll have to pause for a moment as there are actual topless women here which is frankly not acceptable for my Christian music channel so we kill everyone at the party but I'm only going to show the footage of us killing the dudes so I don't get into trouble just in time too as Crosby arrives and is by far the youngest in the group we sure did save his innocence then it was time to run some sprints and this is probably a great time to end the video as you didn't subscribe for track-and-field content so yeah a pretty strange day to say the least but hey at least we got some cardio in thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
