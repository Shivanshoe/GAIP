i decided it was time to clean up gta online and so i customized my car to look like fake taxi for those of you who don't know fake taxi picks people up and then if they don't have enough money for the fare they pay in other naughty ways this is as big as i could get the logo but it'll do the job let's go find some cheeky little malaccas who need to be taught a lesson in purity now finding players who willingly hop in a car is actually quite challenging and most of them just kill you which is fine as we're not here to catch murderers we're looking for something far far worse after much effort i park outside an ammunition store and a lad called qfg hops into the taxi i start flying and my boy just sits there patiently waiting but i know what's on his dirty little mind i fly out over the ocean and dump him out of the taxi so that he can be cleansed by an extremely long swim and some salty sea water like the video if you would have hopped in the taxi meet thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories i wake up in my apartment and you may have noticed that my online character looks a lot like agent 47 from the hitman franchise it was pure coincidence plus i've got the ever stylish speed dealer sunglasses on so copyright crisis averted in real life i'm unintentionally also becoming agent 47 due to male pattern boldness it's convenient that i have this apartment inside my music agency building i wander outside and notice that they have a live camera feed and one of the cameras is just pointed at my personal quarters so when rockstar do this it's for security and safety but when i do it i'm a bad roommate and a pervert rest in peace shower cam but i'll always have the memories and the footage outside it's a simply lovely day in los santos so i decide to go for an adventure while i wait for the boys to log on some big girl and an oppressor is flying around destroying everything so what could go wrong i hop into my porsche maycan which seemed like a great idea when i bought it but i'm now definitely getting upper class mum vibes i mean i love a rich mom as much as the next pervert but it's just not the image i'm going for we need a beast of a car that has some bde we need a pegasus ignis also known as a lamborghini sean fkp-37 it costs 2.7 million dollars so we'll need to make some cash i immediately have a head-on collision with another player called mcnuggetman350 which was so bad my game started breaking for once i decided to do the mature thing and i ask mcnugget if he has insurance so we can sort this out like adults he messages back telling me to kill myself i'm pretty strange but i end up in some kind of car drain meat where we're racing around it's pretty wholesome just a bunch of random players all vibing together like this up the top of the drains there's some npc bikini girls who thought this would be a great place to dance in the shade i guess doesn't seem like a place for a party as flash flooding is no joke that's why i always carry around a caution when wet floor sign in case i end up showing girls a photo of my gta character things escalate massively as everybody starts killing each other until it's just mcnugget man and myself left standing i do what i have to do and put a bullet into his head i then walk off all cinematic for no reason stealth oh cabo then joins the server so it's time for the moment you've all been waiting for tennis content yeah i i somehow end up winning in a fiercely contested match cabo doesn't take the loss that well i'm going to be honest with you he proceeds to torch my suv well technically it's a medium suv which is the dumbest sounding thing i've ever heard hey i'm going to drive my medium suv to work like shut the [ __ ] up this concludes our tennis segment for the day so i hope you enjoyed these premium sporting insights and crosby arrives in his new car and i honestly don't know what happened to our group and why we're all playing racquet sports and driving soccer mum cars all of a sudden but it is what it is it's now time to go and help dr dre recovery stolen music so that we can get paid and buy an expensive car that we'll grow bored of in a few hours we arrive at my agency and get ready for some fun-filled family-friendly entertainment we've got a lead on one of the stolen songs down at our country club we fly out of the agency in a helicopter and as i arrive at the destination i notice there's a woman parking in a disabled car park the boys and i agree that we must do the heroic thing and block her from taking it but she seems completely unfazed by the helicopter crushing her sedan we teach her a lesson and at least now she can park there guilt-free there's a security office here so we head inside and bullets start flying there is unbelievable collateral damage as many of the water coolers get shot and leak everywhere i don't like to cry on this channel but seeing god's nectar wasted like this brings me damn close we hack the security terminal and it leads us to the location of a stretch hummer there are two kinds of people who get around in stretch hummers rappers and sad white guys who think splashing money on exorbitant materialistic items will impress girls and get them laid i'm the latter we follow the hummer but i'm not exactly the greatest pilot and my air vessel has seen better days i try to set her down on a rooftop but i misjudge things and fall to my death nothing like an accidental suicide to get you in the mood for rescuing hip-hop music i steal a car from some dude wearing a scarf and t-shirt literally the dumbest combination of clothing items you can wear like if you're cold put on a jumper bozo it's just in poor taste unlike crosby's car now that is a refined vehicle what a perfect gentleman we stalk the limo all the way back to the mansion ensuring to hide our cars in bushes so that we can stay off the radar we now have the address of the stolen music track mission complete and carbo has decided to keep the banshee so that he can modify it we head back to the agency and i'm going to be honest business isn't booming there's only a thousand dollars of earnings in the save we're a little light on income probably because i keep chartering private helicopters and we have two receptionists for some reason i don't think we've signed one musical artist either it's almost at the point where i'm ready to work with kanye franklin calls and gives us the address of a lawyer we need to incapacitate now the definition of incapacitate is a confusing one we'll get to that in a moment on the drive i try and do the nice thing and pull over and wait for the lads but i get rear-ended by carbo this entire video is just minor car accidents i swear the kind of content i'm sure you subscribed for i take the high road as i'm sure carbs was just messing around in life it's important not to be petty and turn the other cheek instead we arrive at the lawyer's house and crosby is well and truly ready to go franklin said to blend in because it's a garden party but i think dressing like a member of seal team 6 is just as good as we make our way around the side of the house there's some guy who's stealing my entire look imagine stealing someone's entire character and then using it for your own youtube video series i mean for yourself i murder him in cold blood which really kicks the garden party into gear it's absolutely popping off as guards and guests get filled with bullets i only noticed after but the game told us to use a stun gun on the lawyer but none of us notice this because we're alpha males who don't listen to instructions and crosby decides the best way to incapacitate the lawyer is to beat him with a baton but he hits me instead he then just starts viciously beating dead bodies like honestly i think crosby needs a hug and 12 weeks of psychotherapy i decide to just execute the lawyer because i'm sick of his carrying attitude and then it becomes clear i definitely didn't understand the definition of incapacitate i think it's a dumb word to use because it could suggest killing him like i'm dressed like agent 47 a literal hitman i mean i'm dressed like a cool new creative character i invented round two a new garden party and a new house i roll in guns blazing as bodies hit the floor i proceeded to accidentally execute the lawyer for a second time failing the mission the lads were less than impressed and for our third attempt they banned me from participating in the next incapacitation i had to just wait on a rooftop and be looked out but when i was selecting a weapon i accidentally jumped to my death imagine you're enjoying a few mimosas with the homies and then a bald dude's corpse just rolls on by anyway we capture the lawyer and shove him in the back of a red rolls royce and peace on out of there it just goes to show that if i don't participate things get done faster we arrive at the agency and in a world's first crosby waits for this npc to cross the road rather than just splattering him i've never seen this before and i'm genuinely getting concerned for crosby's mental state icarbo wants to do up his banshee that he's somehow kept alive this entire time i decide to come along for the immersive experience he takes forever to get to los santos customs as the big dumb idiot got all these tyres shot out by another handsome player while he does up his car i make the brave decision to sell some of my old vehicles this is quite an emotional thing to do but i need millions and i never drive these anymore i had a lot of good memories in this minivan but its top speed is the same as a brisk walk so it's gone i also decide to sell this supercar that i regret buying i managed to give cabo's new banshee a little love tap on the way through sorry mate i went to spin the wheel and got forty thousand dollars leaving us with a balance of over 1.5 million dollars the lamborghini dream is getting closer i sell a few more cars but now it's time to infiltrate the mansion and recover the stolen music on my way back to the agency i have a head-on collision with yet another car and these car accidents are getting out of hand you know where you never get into car accidents on buses one of the longest memes i've ever been a part of is the omsi 2 bus simulator joke that's been going on in my discord for like four years i get asked daily by members to make a video on this [ __ ] bus simulator game so after all this time i'm caving to the peer pressure and doing a short bus sim segment so i tried for like 15 minutes to figure out how to actually drive a bus around weirdly i've actually driven a bus in real life once and i swear to god it was so much easier than doing it in this simulator eventually the game just gave up on me and just started driving the buses around itself cutting me out of the equation completely i could zoom in and out and it annoys me that people were standing when there were so many spare seats safety first i got a bus stuck in a mountain somehow but i figured out how to use the windscreen wipers which is a huge w 10 out of 10 best bus simulator game i've ever played okay now that's covered it's time for the actual mission we drive to the party in a red rolls royce now i'm no criminal mastermind but this is the exact car we kidnapped the lawyer in that being said we are on a budget and i can appreciate the savings actually maybe we're pretending to be the lawyer right now i honestly have no idea anymore the party is absolutely popping off there's supercars and broad shouldered babes everywhere and crosby seamlessly blends in with some dance moves that are straight fire i used the fountain as a bidet i was going to make it look like he was drinking out of it or something but as long as water is getting in i'm chilling we're all having a great time and then security pulls a gun on me and it all kicks off they say trash the party so we just start murdering everyone at what point have we crossed the ethical line like these guys just stole some music and in retaliation we've killed hundreds of people the only reason the song is so valuable is because it's unreleased so maybe dr dre could consider just releasing the song moving his schedule around seems like a lot less of a big deal than basically turning into isis the billionaire escapes in a helicopter and i steal one of his cars to chase him not just any car though the exact lamborghini i want to buy it's actually such a nice car sometimes the super cars are a bit over the top but i like this one the big girl escapes to his private yacht so we get jet skis and chase after him despite there being plenty of jet skis cabo hops onto the back of mine because real bros intimately wrap their arms around each other's waists we clear the yacht using facts and logic and then kill the billionaire himself we steal his phone and just like that we're one stop closer to saving dr dre mission complete but i'm still a million dollars short for my lamborghini which means it's time to grind we head out and start doing mission after mission to make some extra cash we were out there killing people doing tron battles for some reason the most notable accomplishment is when i was delivering my special cargo for a big payout it was kind of grindy so i was watching a bus simulator guide on youtube to figure out why i couldn't drive the bus i ended up looking at the video for too long and crashed the plane into the ocean ruining all the cargo despite this i got the cash and purchased my 2.7 million dollar lamborghini i dropped another couple of hundred thousand doing it up and it's such a beast seriously my new favorite car but i swear to god if this [ __ ] goes on discount next week i'm quitting grand theft auto forever in fact i'm quitting every game except bus simulator and becoming an exclusive bus sim channel if you enjoyed this video i appreciate a like i love you [Music]
