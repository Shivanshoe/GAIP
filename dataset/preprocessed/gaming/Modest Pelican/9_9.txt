welcome to raft where as the name suggests you're trapped on a raft in the middle of the ocean and your only goal is to survive unfortunately for us the ocean is full of rubbish which we can use to our advantage sea turtles might be choking to death on plastic straws but at least my resources are growing i could eat a plastic straw and not die i'm not sure what the story is behind me being trapped on a raft but my character managed to grab his journal before he got washed out to sea god forbid he grabbed some food but at least in the journal there's a photo of my wife literally the hottest woman i've ever seen in my entire life a small island approaches which is exciting and i decide to explore unfortunately my raft begins floating away and i can't stop it so i guess i live on this island now it's actually a pretty swell little place watermelons grow there's palm trees and i didn't even have to commit a genocide to become the legitimate owner the sun goes down and unfortunately my new island disappears which isn't great so here i am floating around in the ocean without any hope so i proceed to eat all three of my watermelons and then swim down as far as i can so that my lungs fill up with water and i drown rule one don't leave the raft like the video if you think drowning is uncool i restart and begin gathering as much junk as i can again honestly i'm making mr beast's team c campaign look like a publicity stunt there's also a hungry shark that swims around your raft at all times so if you slip into the water you get eaten alive i extend my raft a little bit because love big rafts and this time i don't explore the island because personal growth the shark continues to ride my ass by constantly attacking me and burning through my resources let's call this shark mia which happens to be the name of my ex-girlfriend she was always angry and a phenomenal swimmer so it makes a lot of sense i continue improving my raft and by sundown i have enough materials to add my crown jewel a crimson floor rag which i feel really transforms this raft into a home i gather some more junk and then build myself a crude bed to sleep through the night on overall a hugely successful first day i wake up extremely dehydrated and close to starvation my character eats more food than anyone i've ever met it's like he's bulking as it turns out using my precious resources on floor decor and then sleeping for eight hours isn't a luxury i can afford right now a storm rolls in while i madly try and find something to drink i fail miserably and collapse dead rule 2 ensure to build rugs after water purifiers i restart again but this time with a great attitude i prioritize collecting floating barrels as they hold the most before long i have extended my raft and constructed a water purifier this little contraption turns the salty sea water into god's precious nectar using fire palm leaves and science we can now stay sufficiently hydrated at all times i don't sleep because i'm brave and instead i use the night time to craft a fishing rod i can now catch fish which i cook up on the fire when my parents divorced my dad would try to cook for us sometimes and once he bought a whole tuna from the markets he didn't want to cook it straight away so he just put it in the bathtub because fish live in water when they're alive it started to rot but he didn't want to admit defeat straight away and so he scaled it anyway but he scaled it the wrong way so fish scales and blood went absolutely everywhere mum came to pick us up and we were covered in semi-rotten fish guts it was a real learning experience day two and i'm not dead yet which is a huge milestone my vitals are good and i even build a sale why pay full price for sea of thieves when you can construct your very own pirate ship here while fishing for atlantic salmon i slip into the water and mia is there waiting she is one crazy fish and this is a stark reminder of the constant danger we're in the big girl is constantly biting my foundations so i build a spear and prod her with it until she lets go she then just swims around staring at me all passive aggressive like which really brings back the memories after many days of saving the ocean by cleaning junk and also ruining the ocean by overfishing i have a huge breakthrough i build several nets on the edge of my raft which collect the objects we run into so i can spend my time doing other things that's passive income now that my raft is in a decent spot and i'm satisfied that i won't drop dead due to malnutrition i decide to anchor and properly explore my first island we might be working in unison with team c's but i'm really giving the middle finger to team trees i may have also upset a fragile ecosystem but the wood goes to good use as i begin construction on my cabin it's going to be lit mia proceeds to ruin it just like she ruins everything it would be funny if she watched this video but i doubt raft content is up her alley she's probably too busy screaming and getting lip injections which again kinda makes her look like a fish and a shark is a fish it's like the developers based this crazy shark after her days of collecting building and improving my raft go by although i have a system it can be difficult to ensure there's always enough food and water there i am adding a little candle next to my bed to improve the feng shui and mia returns madder than ever i quickly switch to my spear and charge the broad stabbing her several times in the face in this glorious moment mia dies it's funny how life works out isn't it she once told me it was weird that i wouldn't introduce her to my parents and now she's sliced up in my meat cooler so that i can cook her on the grill later i continue work on my cabin but then disaster strikes my raft becomes stuck on the island and no matter what i try i can't dislodge it and to survive in this game you need a constant supply of material so every minute we're trapped here we're closer to death i paddle and paddle but achieve nothing to make matters worse another shark is rocked up and is destroying my raft again we'll call her mia 2.0 post breakup mia which was scarier than relationship mia she didn't return my hoodies and clothes she chopped them up into little pieces this video is basically therapy for me if i'm being honest i even demolished sections of my raft in desperation as i was getting hungry and then i realized my anchor was still down as you can see i'm the smartest person on the internet the days go by as i keep grinding up resources i've got the net system pretty much gathering most of the ocean trash and it's oddly satisfying seeing it work my little cabin is also coming along nicely as i turn this raft into a home i install some gardening pot things so i can grow fruit and vegetables you couldn't pay me to garden in real life but for some reason it's fun in a game i even build a scarecrow to keep the seagulls off my crops and will name him mato in honor of my mate mato as they both have warm smiles this introduces a new problem as the seagulls enjoy pecking mato's face off it's horrific to watch as he's the only friend i have out here life is simple on my rapidly expanding raft and then i see an island bigger than anything we've come across yet i must take over this new land and make it my own i drop my anchor and prepare to infiltrate this tropical paradise the first thing i encounter is this bouncing little deer looking all happy and angelic i proceeded to chase it down with my wooden spear but this cute little malacca is built different i spend literally an entire day stabbing him and finally it dies and what i can only imagine was a relatively slow painful death i've never had this much trouble killing a small woodland creature and it turns out i can't harvest it either so this was a complete waste of a day i reattempt an exploration of the island and immediately spot a bird that isn't a pelican i stab it with my spear which angers the prehistoric avian creature and it starts dropping rocks on my head dinosaurs are cringe on top of all of this a warthog roams the land and it loves charging me down like it was a hog rider from clash of clans i need better weapons to fight these animals and so i begin the process of building a furnace so i can eventually craft a bow i establish an underwater mining operation that would make bp oil wet with jealousy mia 2.0 comes and says g'day every now and then ripping up my nets just like she ripped out my favorite hoodie it was a grey hoodie that said ski perisha on it and i'll never forget it and press f to pay respect to my old favorite hoodie and even sadder news the seagulls have brutally maimed mato and pecked his arms and head right off so now he's just a torso on a stick how am i going to give him goodnight smooches now that he has no face i push through the emotional pain and continue mining and after several days i build my furnace a huge accomplishment but we've been here for so long i'm out of other crucial materials such as wood this is largely because i invested it into the beginning of my new mezzanine level for my cabin it's going to look incredible but potentially could have waited until later with no other choice i whip out my spear and prepare to take the island by force i charge at the warthog but calling this stick a spear is misleading as it took about 50 hits to kill that happy bouncing deer earlier it feels like i'm doing no damage to the hog and close to death i'm forced to flee if i died here i would have cried not even joking i say goodbye to the island but next time i spot a huge landmass we'll be ready the days roll by and my nets keep gathering i decide to treat myself and cook up shark mia number one that i've been keeping in an esky she tastes better than ever before then another large island approaches and i prepare for all out warfare i put some seaweed in my furnace and craft myself some vine goo so that i can make a boat science within seconds the boar is charging right at me but i retreat to the water and exploit the game mechanic of it not being able to swim this is immersion shattering as warthogs are actually great swimmers in the real world everything else about the game makes perfect sense but this is a step too far i want swimming pigs in the next update i kill the beast and then decapitate it for some reason i then go and get a well-earned eight hours and prepare for day two there's another vulture on this island and before i can safely harvest this place it needs to die the fight starts and this bird makes the final elden ring boss look like a blind toddler he keeps doing strafing runs with me and boulders but i managed to hit it pretty consistently after two whole in-game days of fighting it dies and i'm crowned king of the world by myself as i'm the sole survivor the winners of war get to write history and this bird will go down as an evil dictator who committed many heinous war crimes i gather everything there is to gather on the island and i invest it straight into my boat now it's time to show you my finished raft i spent ages floating and gathering materials with my now quite extensive net system downstairs i've converted my old quarters into a production room and guest bedroom i've hung the wartogs head right above the guest bed to make visitors think twice about pre-marital relations i installed the cute little cat because it's drippy i've added in trees because why invade islands when you can just become an island if you come up these stairs it leads you to the love shack or my bedroom which includes a crimson decorative rug that i've been wanting since my first attempt at this game i've also got a fully operating clock that i built from driftwood i guess over here is my little table area with the subtle decorative feature of the vulture's head up on the top level is my crow's nest where i've put another tree and also a nice big couch if i'm on lookout then i'm reclining on a shaze this is a society finally out back i put mia's head on display to show the other sharks that i'm not playing so yeah i survived 100 days or however many days this was i'm keen to check out the gta online expanded and enhanced next video if you enjoyed this content i appreciate a like i love you guys see you soon [Music]
