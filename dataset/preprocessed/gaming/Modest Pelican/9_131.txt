[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with Red Dead Redemption - if you enjoy this video please become a funeral director and tell people that their loved ones would have survived if they were subscribed to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel okay so this is the story of how stealth Amato and I somehow found ourselves being held up at gunpoint and forced to sing well but before we get to that strangely arousing situation we need to go back to the beginning of the beautiful thing about this game is the community is extremely friendly in Grand Theft Auto online if you try to be a nice guy you just get turkey slapped with the thick juicy [ __ ] of a flying motorbike whereas here the most dangerous thing you'll find is men playing as female characters it's always awkward when you send a dick pic and she sends one back so here we are in the town of Rhodes minding our own business and we come across another player we say g'day and he shoots me in the face with his revolver the stealth amato and I realized that it's on us to stop this gamer on gamer crime we need to ensure this stays as a safe Christian server we need to become the red dead police right now my character looks like the kind of guy who'd sell his own children for one sniff of a permanent marker so we need to make myself look more legitimate I actually bought this new Mexican inspired look last video the beanie poncho combo with the suspenders for a hint of modesty as they cover my bosoms as you can see though this outfit gives me no authority over people observe how I try to make peace with the guy who killed us moments ago next thing you know we are in an endless cycle of murder and hence we started our new lives as policemen if these Spurs don't say family-friendly or Die I really don't know what does so here we are ready to serve justice and then all of a sudden our first Purple's in - please don't ask you didn't step off the vehicle ma'am step off the vehicle respect my authority don't make me shoot a woman she's never happened before what do we do just surrender no so yeah upon further investigation it appears that the first person we tried to arrest was from China so there was a slight language barrier issue as officer stealth our motto doesn't speak fluent Mandarin because he's an idiot we are forced to let her go we do however use this opportunity to practice our police siren we also decide to try and practice our policing methods on an NPC so that we are better prepared for real players this is like our police academy training well I am loading the volunteer onto my horse motto discharges his firearm into the man's head it's at this point I realized that we are now officially bona fide law enforcement officers and we decide to get deep into this roleplay even talking exactly like police officers do as a wife and kids watch worries it's here four to five or four in my pocket I can do it now properly in character we ride for the city of Blackwater to keep the pace there unfortunately a gaggle of bounty hunters attempts to kill us as we weren't always men of God for example motto is not allowed within a hundred feet of a school and I've been permanently banned from McDonald's for being a little bit too happy about my happy meal apparently it's not that kind of toy but anyway we are on the road to redemption we defeat the bounty hunters and honestly we are looking so cinematic right now I guess this game makes everything look cinematic though let's be honest on our way to Blackwater we stumble across another player and decide to pull him over for random breath testing he's surprisingly compliant but also a ghost so I don't trust him I don't have a breathalyzer either just a lantern so it's all very professional all of a sudden though he makes a run for it which is exactly what we've been training for [Music] sir please pull over your vehicle officer Martin opportun always clever thank you sir thank you sir Oh No oh my god this is the odd part of the job to confess to you belly what's that I've been on this job for 25 years now and I've seen some [ __ ] farewell it was so far we've done quite a poor job of making this server a happier place that's for sure like I was just instrumental in driving a double suicide but at least it's only up from here during the shenanigans I also lost my hat wish I could say the same about my virginity but anyway now no one respects my authority anymore like I tried to reprimand this booty bandit but because I was not instantly recognizable as a law enforcement officer he took me right down red beanie or not we continue making arrests regardless of evidence because that's what good police officers do that struggle we this is for your safety as much as it is for hours man this question is that actually modest Pelican so if that is the case I'm a huge fan of subscriber right I appreciate your support so much but you're under arrest so we made the arrest and I can tell this guy is one dodgy melaka because he has subscribed to my channel anyone who watches this content is almost certainly at least to some degree a criminal we take him to the lumber yard for questioning where's the drugs thanks to your father's basement I've seen him for 25 years kisses so yeah I accidentally killed the guy which was an honest mistake like come on if we beat ourselves up every time a suspect died we've never get through the working week humdrum earth 44 turned out to be a massive legend so we recruited him to the force for a while motto and I decided to keep doing amazing police work basically chasing people down and yelling at them that they were under arrest the alleged perpetrators would often try and make a dash but our general ethos is to try not to use lethal force unless we absolutely had to our new recruit made the arrest like a boss but then constable mato decided to use a stick of dynamite and killed not only the criminal but also said recruit all I can say is outstanding job he did what he had to do we then decide to introduce an intricate tax system where players would be forced to pay us with goods say a deer carcass or something like that if they tried to run and didn't pay well then they would have to sing the song nasty girl and we'd let them go free it was a simple yet fair system we're not asking for much man asking for the chorus of nasty girl by MIDI a predictably gamers weren't too big on the singing and would often resort to senseless violence in a desperate attempt to get out of performing for us stealth Amato and I don't give up easily though and we decide that we won't rest until someone in this cruel world sings the inspirational tune nasty girl for us making arrests was also becoming quite a challenge as we kept running into high-level skilled players I tried to restrain this redhead and she ended up killing us over and over and over and over again until finally I got her back we use this brief moment of respite to flee Blackwater and make haste for saint-denis on our way this NPC asked Amato for a ride and because this is the first time a woman has talked to him in the last six months naturally he jumped at the chance it was a huge catfish though so I used nonviolent force to take control of the situation and mato shooter it worries me that he is considering being a police officer in real life fortunately we did end up taking some of her gang as prisoners and I'm not sure if you guys have tried out the new fun in the Sun Beach DLC but they've added in water skiing now it's a great update as I was thinking to myself that the one thing missing from this gameplay experience is recreational water activities so I'm super psyched to see that Rockstar is implementing that now somehow Evel Knievel survived that entire experience and then proceeds to die from a brain aneurysm that's just how life goes sometimes isn't it I must say we are doing a mighty fine job keeping everyone in line we are perhaps the best to role players in online gaming right now period only a stone throw from Saint Denis I decide to swing by kant and visit my dog that I haven't seen or fared in like six months i immaturely called my dog Matos mother but that doesn't get old for me and also look at my tent right it's not much just a sheet but compared that tomato he literally sleeps on a wooden board out in the rain actually who the hell gave him a wooden board I can't have him getting used to these small luxuries we arrive at the city and it's time to make a game as Singh please pull over your vehicle sir and fast you step off your horse you've been drinking some esse baby you sound underage boys we got a runner hops up dude hey every corner so we have you got it right we go there as a way out of this there's a way out of this just sing the something nasty go by maybe there's a problem what's the problem [Music] having successfully achieved our goal the guy who tried to ruin the whole thing returned for round two he said we should stop bullying little children mate we are simply policing the server to the best of our ability I tried to arrest King heat 93 but this was not his first rodeo or maybe you're under arrest for impersonating a police officer did you ever think about that he just dropped a year no reverse card on us [ __ ] we can Opilio need backup oh he's gonna start doing its death don't do it I'm not gonna go girl [Music] [Music] [Laughter] so yeah the one time in his entire gaming career that motto chose not to adopt the shoot first ask questions later approach we end up being taken hostage and forced to sing like angels I don't know how many of my viewers are police officers I know lucky is but yeah feel free to use this video to train recruits at the police academy or whatever I'm sure they'd learn a lot otherwise thanks for watching you legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy you
