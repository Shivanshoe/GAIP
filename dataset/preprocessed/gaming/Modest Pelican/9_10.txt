i tried the training mission in hitman for the first time ever and i made a pretty horrific discovery basically they've set up this fake scenario in this dark facility so you can practice for real world missions they even explicitly tell you that all these people you see everywhere are paid actors and ask that you be gentle because humanitarian crimes are no joke so here i am practicing and i take down a guard i don't kill him i just knock him unconscious but i get caught the guards close in on my position and i'm like fair enough lads you caught me i decide to bait them in and then i turn it into a fist fight sure it might not be good sportsmanship but no one's dying so how do they respond they open fire with real bullets i can appreciate method acting as much as the next guy but jesus christ this is a training drill i'm left with no choice but to return fire and suddenly there's a lot of dead actors everywhere they even give you high-powered weaponry to take in with you why are they giving us so much ammunition to take in it's like they're secretly hoping for chaos i did some further tests where you can do literally anything you like to these poor actors and you'll always get the same response excellent work 47 like the video if you're sufficiently hydrated today we travel to italy to eliminate two corrupt individuals anthony trout and richard mcgee they are each wearing the same hat which is honestly pretty embarrassing for them i'm taking in a rather classic loadout a silenced pistol some coins and fibre wire this mission escalates kind of drastically but we'll get there the first thing i need to do is find these two privileged white males and so i make my way to the hairdresser i sit down and wait for my appointment seamlessly blending in despite having literally no body hair the hairdresser gossips and so the private investigator is napping on a nearby seat this is great information and so i steal his scissors to prove that i'm the alpha and then leave i search far and wide for a napping investigator and eventually i find him he's tucked his polo shirt into his swim shorts so you know he sleeps with hot women daily i lure him into one of the bathroom stalls and then use my new scissors to end his playboy lifestyle i then discover he was not the private investigator but rather a bathroom attendant no wonder my man was wearing swim shorts because with a job title like that he really would be drowning in punani i continue searching again for the pi and find the real one taking a power nap and can't hate as it's a great way to recharge i throw a coin at his head and then follow him through the back streets he stops to make a phone call and it seems he's meeting a high profile target at the pier shortly this guy hasn't noticed that i've been following him for five minutes and now he's yelling into his mobile and probably should have chosen a different profession he heads to the bathroom to take a leak and again i throw my scissors into his head i then take his clothes hide the body and gather all of the spare change out of the toilet bowl don't judge me as assassins are mostly paid on tips i search around for a while and eventually locate the woman he's meeting with she's like hey do you mind if we talk somewhere more discreet like big girl i heard the phone call you're the one who picked this location needless to say we have an extremely productive meeting the location she picked sure is seedy and i find two agents chilling in the bathroom together which isn't weird at all i decide to do a little social experiment and i turn on the tap so that the water overflows and to my absolute delight one of the agents comes and turns off the tap saving god's precious nectar from being wasted what a king i look around for my targets but can't see them anywhere so i head back up to the main town i attempt to access the main mansion but they don't let me in as i don't have any girls with me i then notice a sneaky entrance is being guarded which will surely lead to some answers i decide to follow the guy in the suit and he leads me to a cafe where he's sipping on a latte having caffeine this late in the day is just poor sleep hygiene i need to poison this man's coffee and take his clothes i find a waiter having a cigarette and so i choke him out in an extremely risky yet brave play in the kitchen i find some rat poison but the issue is the other waiter is cleaning the big man's table he's really giving it a deep cleanse too and so i have to just do it with him right there watching unfortunately he's extremely concerned about suit guy having crumbs on his table but completely unfazed about his stomach lining eroding from poison the plan works and he makes his way to the bathroom to throw up or die the cubicle he enters already has a guy in there so i guess he's just abandoning the core concept of privacy i take a kitchen knife i stall out of my pocket and stab them both the amount of dangerous agent 47 can keep in his clothing is genuinely impressive the disguise is ruined however as it's covered in blood so both of these deaths were completely pointless but the important thing is we're growing and learning i decide to do things the old-fashioned way and just climb up the side of the building sneaking in through a bathroom window i spot my first target richard mcgee which absolutely sounds like a made-up name it's too crowded to make a play here but at least we finally found him i head to the top of the building and burst into a room and then just punch a weed dealing hippie in the face i proceeded to steal his joint and then i break his neck because he saw my face harsh but no regrets as weird as the second most dangerous thing in the world second to only my girlfriend when i forget to hang up the wet floor towel after a shower we now know mcgee is up there surrounded by security but now it's time to find anthony trout which also sounds like a pretty made-up name like they thought of a good first name anthony and then panicked and just set a fish the intel did say that he's staying in this mansion so it's time to find a way in i walk a short way out of town and spot a car accident some flower delivery man hit a cyclist but honestly it looks like he's milking it you got hit by a car you weren't forced to smoke weed i steal a flower bouquet from the van and then decide i'll go undercover as the flower delivery guy i'll need to take one of these guys out also why is he kicking the tyre i feel as if it doesn't take a mechanic to tell you that the engine is the problem i skillfully eliminate the cyclist who's now crying on a bench maybe instead of crying he could change sports i then take the other two down and become a delivery man i ditch my weapons and now they'll happily let me inside the mansion who isn't going to trust a guy whose shirt says eurosped the mansion is now my oysters no one suspects a thing delivery men always run around the entire estate before dropping off the package it's normal i find the property owner whose pink sweater hung around his neck indicates he doesn't understand the concept of consent i go and say g'day but he doesn't appreciate my niceties and i'm forced to run i tell the butler the flower delivery is here and he shows me the pink sweater guy's mum's grave it's all quite sad really a pink sweater guy's mum tragically died and he's pretty cut up about it i lay down the flowers and then wait in the grass like a ratatat on heat when he comes to pay his respects i throw a hammer at his head drag him over to the industrial motion and place his unconscious body inside now as much as i love a good family friendly life or two we need to focus our efforts on hat boys the issue is that security teams are no joke so i'll need a better strategy i sneak upstairs which i'm definitely not allowed to do as the delivery guy and find the deceased mom's room i ring the surface bell and quickly go and hide to see what would happen no one comes there are staff everywhere and no one bothered no wonder this poor woman died she was probably ringing this bell for days and ended up dying of thirst i beat the out of some of the staff in her honor eventually i'm busted and one of the guards asks me to leave which is fair i've been here for ages on my way out i notice the butcher is open and so i take a gander at some of the thick meat that's on display this woman stares at me for a moment and then shrugs i take huge offense to this gesture and end up murdering everyone in the store i hide the bodies in the freezer and then dress up as the butcher this disguise surprisingly lets me run straight through the ice cream store up the stairs and all the way to the top of the law office building where i find a guard only an italian gangster could make a wife better singlet and a fedora look drippy i drag his body up to the hippies apartment and put them on the mattress together now if anyone walks in they'll just think these two are cuddling together there's a security room above mcgee's office and i decided to just send it inside and clear the place out it actually goes extremely smoothly and would be a lot cooler if i wasn't wearing these clothes agent 47 does not pull off this attire at all he looks like a reddit mod gone wild or like he's about to start doing a little tap dance i find a crowbar disable the security system and then watch from above waiting for mcgee to walk under the chandelier a quite a satisfying way to take down a target as mcgee is now eliminated at this point i decide why not kill literally everyone else as well it's time to ensure that the sweet italian town sapienza is family friendly forever so it's decided but first i want to use my crowbar to see what's inside all of these closed shops as i've always wondered i commit the crime of break and entering and someone snitches on me which makes sense i wasn't exactly being subtle about it my threat level is then immediately upgraded to hunted which means they'll shoot me on sight i brutally murdered two florists than to cyclists on a public road yet the crime that ruins me is curiosity unfortunately there's an ica safe house nearby and so i waited out interesting that the agency can afford to pay 300 actors in a secret underground facility for training exercises but they can't put a spring mattress or a bowl of fruit in this apartment wow i decide to start my killing spree at the funeral home as it makes the most sense i patiently wait for one of the church staff to enter and then throw a kitchen knife into his little head meet agent psalms 47 he'll teach you about god and then i'll even let you meet god the 47 honestly does an exquisite job of blending in it's pretty convincing i proceed to take down multiple unarmed tangos in the church grounds i also hit some of the local clothing shops as my green best rampage continues i sneak back into the mansion and kill a few of the guards who are on lookout i then take off their clothes and throw them into the ocean which sounds incredibly sadistic but is kind of hot sometimes when i'm making these kill everyone videos my inner ethical voice speaks up i think it's because the little npcs complain and beg me not to murder them they do get their revenge if i make a mistake so keeping things quiet for as long as possible is always crucial i walk into the mansion's kitchen and know exactly what i have to do i put on a kitchen uniform and tell the chef i'm here to revolutionize food i have a great time cooking my spaghetti sauce and even ringing the dinner bell for the property owner he doesn't come because i put him into an industrial mulcher but it's still nice eventually though i turn off the stove as we have a much more important mission to attend to i fire several members of the cleaning staff team which is always a challenging conversation unless you utilize the old knife to the head method there were a couple of incredibly close calls but i scraped by not raising the alarm i even electrocuted a few of the dodgy malakas to keep it fresh and best of all i found a samurai sword in the attic this was the perfect weapon to find as i have a little score to settle down at their hairdressers you see they gave me false information about a napping private investigator there was way more than one person napping but on top of that i find hairdressers way too stressful when they're giving you a bad trim but it's too awkward to tell them and then you have to pretend you're happy with the result this is likely just me projecting what i'd like to do in the real world of course i'm joking i could never do it as i don't even own a samurai sword this incident really raised the alarm as you can imagine lots of witnesses saw and so i bailed down to the water and find a secret entrance i have the key card as i took it off that lab coat girl who i had that great meeting with there's loads of highly armed guards down here in the secret lab and so i kill a few of them and take their guns now armed almost as well as your average american citizen i roll out and start the cleanse i surprise a few agents on the terrace with my pump action shotgun i actually saw a funny story about a real life hitman the other day so in 2013 a chinese businessman named tan yoo hai wanted to take out a competitor and so he hired a hitman who was happy to take the job the hitman then hired another cheaper hitman to do the job so he didn't have to work pretty smart except the cheap hitman then hired an even cheaper hitman to do the same job this cycle repeated itself five times the fifth guy was getting paid such a small amount that he told the original target to just fake his death because he didn't want to risk killing someone over pennies as so many people knew about the hit the cops eventually found out and every single person went to jail the moral of the story is if you want something done right do it yourself of course don't go and kill people but if you do get a hitman you can trust at least with the entire beach clear i'm free to steal the street performers tips without being judged silver lining this map is genuinely quite big with loads of npcs so it took me a while to find them all one thing i'm a real stickler for is trespassing and i notice a bunch of tourists running right into the pink sweater guys estate sure they might be on holiday but they simply have to respect the local's culture and privacy it's disgusting it was a long process but eventually all but my last target mr anthony trout were eliminated i drag his unconscious body that i prepared earlier over to the infinity pool and detonate the explosive a fitting end to an extremely successful mission over 200 casualties but no witnesses and both targets expertly taken down a pretty good effort for the world's most dangerous assassin who still can't jump thanks for watching if you enjoyed this content i do really appreciate a like i love you and goodbye [Music]
