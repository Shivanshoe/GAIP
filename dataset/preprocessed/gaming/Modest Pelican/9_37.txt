[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with far cry 5. if you enjoyed this video please become a barista at starbucks but instead of writing people's names on their takeaway coffees write modest pelican and scream out loudly as this really helps spread the good word of my channel welcome to america and more specifically the state of montana a beautiful place to live if you ignore the fact a psychotic cult is brutally murdering everyone still pretty breathtaking views their leader is joseph stade and as you can see he's quite an aggressive guy that being said i probably would have gone to church a lot more as a kid if there was less singing and more eye gouging joseph is such a scorpio we've been sent in by the government to arrest him because it's apparently illegal to kidnap and murder everyone he's pretty compliant which is a big surprise but as we try and extract him in our helicopter his boys take it down and we crash the power of minecraft stands he then makes overly intense eye contact like he wants a little smooch so i proceed to flee the scene and not a great situation and to make matters worse the cult assumed that us trying to arrest joseph was the beginning of their prophecy in a nutshell they've started what's known as the reaping where they will now purge all non-believers more killing more torture more fun for the whole family unfortunately i find a baseball bat and then spot two malakas staying warm by the fire i proceeded to take them down and i'm thrilled with how satisfying this is i did however assume they were part of the cult they could have just been camping this is a bad area to be in and i'd know i used to live in a dangerous neighborhood there were 35 sex offenders living there and so i moved away quickly as i didn't need that kind of competition i escape and meet this bold guy who tells me that there's no way to leave montana it's literally me in 10 years i now get to create my character and i decide to make him a ladies man women love two things in this world thick healthy mullets and of course the new modest pelican merch we didn't expect so many sales last week and i'm really sorry if you missed out but you can now buy all merch and sizes again for a few more days it's good to go and the link is in the description and thank you so much for the overwhelming support now let's go stop murderous radicals by murdering them i shoot the water to test the graphics because everyone knows that's how you test graphics i'm basically a game developer you can also play the entire game in co-op so i ask my good friend aches if she wants to join she's up for it but before the session she levelled up a bunch to flex on me i'm running around like a caveman and she's got a fancy sniper rifle and wingsuit we find a boat and cross the river to discover john seed's region who's a high ranking member of the cult also a couple having a romantic bath together which is quite cute we proceed to kill everyone and in the process accidentally the prisoner uh are you gonna help him i don't want to help him that's kind of weird kicked him in the jaw they've got like a dui church here that's nice yeah it's pretty cute it looks kind of cute i think i've cut on their side we forged forward as our target is now clear escape montana but first i turn on friendly fire so we can become more immersed wow oh oh my god i'm tapping my tongue i'm burning so much oh my god you look haggard now right too that's so [ __ ] rude we then find a plane and suddenly we're saved we can just fly this back to washington dc and tell the president that montana has become a sovereign state and the army can come in and deal with everything just kidding i decided to kamikazette because leaving two mia junior deputy sheriffs with wing suits and baseball bats to deal with it is a far better strategy aches and i locate a trailer park where we should be able to find a new vehicle and some loot the cult's raping is well and truly underway and these guys are impressively efficient we kill the members and as i'm freeing hostages i see him joe dirt this man with his thick mullet is going to be my best friend forever joe says we need to find his friend who has a plane so that we can escape glossing over the fact that we just had a plane we move out it doesn't seem safe walking through the forest on foot as we're just little snacks to grizzly bears which is flattering but not safe we kill a bunch of guys patrolling and as an australian it's hard to tell what level of violence is due to the cult and what is just normal montana life i find a flamethrower while ace fixes the truck look at us destroying gender stereotypes this channel really pushes the envelope soon aches will be driving the vehicles i'm kidding can you imagine what do you think happened here it looks like a bit of a crime scene you know probably just a clearance now like a discount sale you know yeah they get a little hectic maybe like black friday yeah it looks like black friday like for the apples i guess yeah the flamethrower gives me way too much confidence and i just charge on in there burning absolutely everything this causes a slow and likely very painful death for me and my glorious mullet we need to find this plane and we figure heading to the next main town is our best option so we can gather information about its whereabouts we are immediately distracted and successfully take down a supply truck whoa that's a lot of [ __ ] ammunition are you actually stuck help me step bro i don't remember the part in the porno where they have to kill a bunch of dudes are you out yeah god damn i miss my chance aches needs to go and take care of something in real life and so i decide to explore a little i come across this last hunting and buy a new hat off her because sun safety is absolutely crucial i then burn her alive because i feel she overcharged me and i'm really trying to embrace the montana culture as that's important when visiting a new place respect embrace imitate i agree it is about the journey you know just making memories and having fun oh my god is that the wrong guy yeah oh [ __ ] this is badass you see one guy watch this go foxtrot nice good kill shh after potentially the best covert operation since project ice worm we liberate falls end that's a real project during the cold war the americans built missile bases in greenland without telling denmark what they're up to cheeky malaccas we then meet this preacher called jerome who wants to be my bff but my mullet brother joe dirt is still my number one to enormo oh oh my god hey i actually wanted to use the bose thank you i think you just turned this town against us and we just helped them build that whole place then we turned it to their enemy in like five seconds the good news is jerome told us where the plane is being kept and so we make our way towards the airfield axe never misses an opportunity to flex her wingsuit on me which is hurtful but undeniably graceful we're about 200 metres out and then out of nowhere stumble across a hunter who looks an awful lot like the other hunter i burned alive earlier most likely identical twins and definitely not repeating character models i'm still immersed we buy some fishing rods off her and proceed to have the most intense fishing experience of 2021. i know people are being forcefully baptized and stoned to death but i'm craving a salmon fillet as it turns out ankle deep swamp water is not the optimum place to catch salmon we approach the airfield me armed with actual weapons and aches holding a fishing rod i love how much the far cry franchise wants there to be constant explosions this suits me as i love exploding things ever since i was a kid my mates and i once taped about 25 sodastream carbon dioxide cylinders together along with about 500 sparklers the explosion was so surprisingly big we had ringing in our ears for days and got completely covered in dirt everyone came out of their homes and the police were called and we had to hide in the drains for hours and that's my vietnam experience we finally locate the guy who owns the plane and he's clearly weak as he doesn't have a mullet not the kind of guy i usually enjoy doing business with but he tells us his plane has been stolen we reluctantly agreed to help the big girl axe then proceeds to beat him to death let's get his plane back oh my god wait what the [ __ ] oh my god they had like literal target oh that is it's pretty dark that they're shooting an actual person but it's like very like it prepares you for the real thing right yeah true we arrive at the estate and start murdering everyone i know they're cult savages but this cabin is truly delightful a home away from home up in the pine forest hills they might tie people to stakes and use them for target practice but hot damn do they know how to unwind afterwards we locate the seaplane and axe insists on flying this is quite the power play as she has all the fun while i proceed to look at the back of her head as a ponytail flails in the wind i'm obviously the kind of guy who claps when the plane lands but not this time as the landing caused all my vertebrae to shatter he's pretty happy to have his plane back but we've barely celebrated before another wave of cult members arrives they're not too happy with him trying to escape so we defend his property while he does stunts in the air i mean objectively it's impressive flying but i feel his social obligation should have been to stay on the ground and help he tells his heavily pregnant wife that they're leaving and she's like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now yeah this is our home we're going to stay i don't feel like this is the best place to raise a child and we did just kill like 50 people getting the plane back so you slash we could all escape but no let's put the kettle on a mission complete but we've now been marked as a threat to the cult this basically means truckload after truckload of radicals will attack us until eventually my character loses consciousness when i wake up i'm being forcefully baptized by none other than john cede one of the guys i needed to find he's pretty keen on the idea of killing me but then his brother from the introduction tutorial rocks up and he's like nah don't be a dick bro i think i have a crush on this guy is that bad does that say something about my character um i think it's called uh stockholm syndrome okay fall in love with the captor what about a porn addiction come on who doesn't he's not addicted to porn yeah but you are i'm not addicted to porn i just watch like a few hours a day as we are being transported away our truck is t-boned and we are rescued by none other than big man jerome he seems to have forgotten that axe beat one of his comrades to death with a baseball bat earlier which is great news we've now got to shoot our way out of this absolute mess it's such an epic gamer moment and then egg says she has to go to bed because time zones what's up everybody this is aches and um i just want to say before all right you guys should buy pelly's merch what a strange thing to say just unprovoked with thanks abandoning me just like my father did i'm forced to fight the endless waves of cult members by myself but then like an angel descending from the heavens my brother appears and takes a bullet for me it's the man himself joe dirt we fight together we bond together and eventually a helicopter rolls in to evacuate us from the area as we fly off in a helicopter his mullet flails in the wind if i'm being honest it flails just a little bit more majestically the next ponytail did i ask the pilot to get us out of montana so that we can contact my colleagues and finally tell them about the truly horrific war crimes that are being committed within the united states borders i'm kidding that's a dumb idea instead we land immediately and recruit a bunch of country folks so that we can fight these lunatics outnumbered 50 to 1. the american way the mullet way the pelican way i don't know why i'm trying to leave this video on an inspirational note but this game is fun as hell and i can't believe i never played it before thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy
