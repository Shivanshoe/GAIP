[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with hitman 3. if you enjoyed this video please make an only fans account called wet and wild but only post pictures of pelicans in their natural habitat as this really helps spread the good word of my channel results and discretion are my speciality welcome to argentina where we've been sent to a lavish vineyard to eliminate our two targets don archibald yates and tamara vidal we're bringing in with us a red silence pistol because it came with the deluxe edition so i feel like i need to use it to avoid buyer's remorse a violin because girls love classical string music and some lethal poison because syringes are always a good time especially when you share them i walk up to diana who'll be working with us today and she hands me an invitation to the party she wasn't always just standing awkwardly with her hand out like this there was a cut scene where she tried to pretty aggressively hold my hand outside of wedlock that filth does not belong on youtube though i'm sorry for even showing it it's now time to seamlessly blend in to our social surroundings it should be pretty easy because thick man doesn't have any clear and obvious physical traits that would make him easy to pick out in a crowd i spot two baddies taking a selfie so i decide to get in on that action probably not the most strategic decision being photographed while on a hit contract but celebrating positive self-image is important the event has attracted some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world it's also attracted this lawyer who is quite a handsome malacca he's got a meeting with our first target don yates so i decide to orchestrate a little plan i get it because of the violin i have in my pocket i guess you know a content creator is reaching peak form when they make several violin references in quick succession man my dms are going to be flooded with nudes after i post this video surprisingly that small fall knocked him unconscious my man needs to take some iron supplements i steal the documents he was delivering and also his briefcase which i feel really completes my look the security here is insane so for now we won't take the lawyer disguise i want to just play it cool and probably explore the winery first if people are drinking and dancing and i decide that now is my moment i put down the briefcase and prepare to serenade every single person in the vicinity as i hit the stage a guard picks up my briefcase as he thinks it's a bomb threat top 10 saddest gaming moments in an angered rage i throw my instrument shattering it into pieces i'm now down a briefcase a violin and i've made a scene not exactly a red hot start but at least i've located tamara vidal she's walking around with our colleague mrs hansi diana we'll have to assassinate tamara quickly as i'd hate for her to be sexually assaulted like i was earlier i make my way to the eating area and over here two chefs having a heated discussion one of them forgot the torch to light the fire pit and therefore dinner can't be cooked if we can find a way to start the fire maybe we can lure don down from his mansion i continue to explore and come across two very serious big girls having a conversation about how they need to eliminate diana she doesn't deserve to die at most she just needs a few mediating sessions with human resources about physical boundaries while i listen i steal a bottle of red sometimes it's nice to treat yourself i then follow blue beret guy as he's planning to eliminate her while they take a tour of the vineyard i can't have that so i toss the bottle of red into some lavender bushes and he goes over to investigate some people might say that i have a gambling problem especially my clinical psychologist but i decide to take a chance and i put one into his head he conveniently falls into the plants so i drag him a little further in and take his disguise we now don't have to worry about his little plan or rolling an ankle while we jog around i might look like the kid who spent a month in paris and now thinks he understands high-end fashion but at least these sneakers offer sufficient joint support the question is how do we kill tamara when she's got this much security and always stays in highly populated areas i decide to sneak into the staff only building and see if i can find a lead getting in here was almost effortless but still a lot harder than infiltrating the capital building i grab a bottle of pinot noir and throw it at this waiter's head a poor innocent guy is probably going to have long-term cognitive issues but his disguise will hopefully give me more freedom i also find some rat poison which is fun there is actually a lot going on down here armed guards boxes of juicy grapes and then all of a sudden i see her a thick toolbox you see i wasn't allowed to bring my own briefcase on this mission so the fact that i lost one but now have a second chance is like a gift from god i then find this secret passageway and figure that it would be rude not to have a gander at the top of the stairs are two guards who probably only took this job to feed their families as the economic situation in argentina is tough right now i proceeded to pull out my immersion breaking red handgun and shoot them both in the head twice i don't know why they were able to take an initial bullet to the head i guess they just have great work ethic i then dump their bodies into some water which i can't imagine is particularly sanitary in a winery it turns out they died for nothing as i don't find anything particularly useful down here i decide to bail but on my way out one of the workers has picked up my toolbox i politely ask him to return my property and he is smart enough to comply with my request it's time we go and find don yates as we haven't even seen him yet i slip my pistol into the toolbox and head up towards his mansion i saw a waiter go up here earlier but unfortunately the guards are too smart and they want to search the box unfortunately i'm still esports ready and i throw the box up over the wall so i can collect it after being frisked but then this happens it falls agonisingly close but out of reach meaning i've lost my gun and my beloved you're probably surprised to hear that i didn't just turn off my game and cry myself to sleep no i forge forward because i'm a gamer gamers don't die they respawn i was trying to think of the most cringed thing i could say but i bet you that's on a t-shirt somewhere being worn by a divorced dad i find a torch which is a great start the young chef doesn't seem to be in too much of a rush as he's busy chatting up some argentinian babes i once hit on an argentinian girl at a hostel and she no joke said you seem nice but you're far too pale in my opinion that's kind of racist so sorry that i use spf 50 plus like a responsible beachgoer white men have definitely had it the hardest in life i like the fire myself and just like that dinner is on its way it doesn't take long before waiters start serving food and so i decide to play a little poison roulette as i'm dressed as a waiter i can tamper with food and meals and no one will get suspicious so i put the rat poison on a random steak fingers crossed i finally locate the don as he's come down for dinner to give a speech to the guests my poisoned meal is also on the go so let's just hope it ends up at the right table the big girl proceeds to say a few heartwarming words and then this poor guy eats a large amount of rat poison that's an awful lot of bronifa comb for one human to ingest and he might have some ongoing blood clotting problems if it's any consolation tamara saw him throw up and almost got it on her dress so we'll celebrate that almost victory if you're wondering why i'm not using the lethal poison injection i forgot you can't use it on food so yeah when you take into account that i misplaced my gun and broke the violin almost immediately it wasn't my best choice of loadout i decided to use this opportunity to explore the mansion as dawn and most of his guards are downstairs eating the place is pretty deserted and so i head upstairs to the master bedroom i proceeded to sniff his wife's underwear i mean steal his car keys but there isn't too much happening upstairs in the attic however is a different story there is a goddamn medieval broadsword and a pirate saber i finally have the tools i need to finesse don yates whilst also maximizing my dps this really is a room full of traits as i grab a hunting rifle off the wall and know exactly what i have to do i scope in on the dodgy malacca and i'm really hoping he doesn't watch this killcam because i hard scope it pretty badly to my surprise i get away with it no just kidding of course i don't i end up trying to fight all the guards off with the broadsword it's quite a spectacle it actually goes surprisingly well but inevitably guns beat sword i reload and we need to scope out this winery properly and ensure we don't miss any details in fact we're going to have to add a little subtle spice to this mission to avoid another all-out gunfight i head back to the entrance where people are still waiting to get in how socially embarrassing for them i then put on the anemic lawyer's clothes that i knocked out ages ago hopefully i can persuade don to talk with me in private and there we can make our move he's having a second helping what a greedy boy summer bodies are built in winter champ i tell him i have the documents he requested and he needs to see them urgently he tells me to wait in the guest bedroom of his mansion and doesn't even make eye contact greedy and rude i don't even know if i want to give him fake legal advice anymore i make my way to the mansion and find the guest room i notice there's a spot on the table to place the documents and so i lay them out ready moments later he comes in but unfortunately he's being chaperoned by several incredibly big girls i start the presentation by going through how all of his associates have died under suspicious circumstances i know an awful lot about it because i murdered all of them in other missions i decide that i've got to make a move now or i risk losing the moment i actually remember saying the exact same thing to myself moments before i was brutally rejected by that argentinian witch it's time for a big d play while don's distracted i sneak over behind his guard and choke him out i then head over to don and eliminate him in an excessively violent way i guess i could have used the syringe here but this just seemed more creative i hide the bodies as fast as i can and seconds later his other personal guard comes in to see what's good before he can gather his thoughts i take him out too and somehow get away with the whole thing this was a whole lot more successful than my parents marriage don archibald yates eliminated but the job is only half done the party is still kicking on and security is everywhere how do we assassinate tamara well how do you take someone down in a crowded bar you spike their drink trust me i would know as i'm stalking her to try and find an opening i overhear that she's hunting down a glass of pinot noir i had a bottle of pinot noir earlier but i threw it at a waiter's head for cinematic effect i would normally say no regrets but locating another bottle turns out to be incredibly challenging i decide the best course of action is to pull out a shotgun and eliminate absolutely everyone as if they're all dead there can be no witnesses no kidding i just wanted to see what this would be like now we'll go and find the pinot noir and do this all sneaky i search the cellars and the factories and after a long while i find what i'm after i'm also genuinely curious as to where agent 47 is putting these bottles as this is a family-friendly channel with intellectual humor that is far above that kind of insinuation we'll move on i head to the bar and get ready to serve the guests it's surprising that the other bartender doesn't get suspicious of me tampering with the drinks maybe he thinks it's a barakah and i'm just psyched about ensuring our patrons get enough vitamin c and magnesium tamara begins sipping her fine wine while diana happily chats away i feel like i'm queuing with randoms because i'm carrying this mission hard what has diana done today except indulge herself and cross physical boundaries in the workplace at least the poison is working as tamara hobbles off to the bathroom to be sick she's also courteous unlike that random dinner guest who threw up all over the bin in front of everyone he was a bit of an attention seeker it was kind of pathetic i sneak into the bathroom when her guards are distracted and there she is completely unaware and unguarded i feel ethically okay with this form of murder as she could drink some water before she drowned i mean at least she'd die hydrated which isn't great but it's definitely better than dying dehydrated tamara vidal eliminated and we earn a three star rating which is actually incredibly high for me if you enjoyed this video press like it makes me moist thanks for watching you legends until next time and as always stay classy you
