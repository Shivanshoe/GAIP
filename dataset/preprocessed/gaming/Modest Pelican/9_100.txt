[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoy this content please become the next pope and use your huge societal influence to encourage people to subscribe to my channel also bless large quantities of water so people can hydrate spiritually as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories alright so i changed the spawn location to my house in vinewood hills because i miss this place i especially love how it has two toothbrushes by the sink because it helps me pretend i have a loving partner and not clinical depression today we'll be trying to finish the heist but first i want to show you a fun-filled family prank i discovered a while ago first you steal a luxury civilian car and then attach several remotely detonated explosives to it this is also a bit of a social experiment you could try yourself in real life to test if people will be rude enough to steal your car this right here is why i'm the sixth most popular christian prank youtuber enough of that though as we have to go and meet the boys boys boys also known as our bank heist crew in today's episode i'm going to include a few live moments as it's been requested a lot recently so i let the lads know that i will be recording our voices and crosby is super supportive of helping me keep the audio quality high i'm gonna put my fan on the max so the audio quality [Music] oh my god not sure why he's talking in an american accent but anyway yeah usually we're just busy having highly intellectual wholesome conversations that help us all grow as individuals such as this one if i could actually fight you in real life and like dominique i reckon i could bash any of the boys enough messing around though we've got a bank to rob our crew today will be crosby stealth omato and stealthosimo who many of you already know we've nicknamed gandhi i did this episode a while ago where stealthosimo was meant to be gandhi but he looks nothing like the og mahatma gandhi but the nickname stuck we proceeded to all head back to the apartment for a pre-heist glass of chilled h2o same story on the bongs you look like the colonel from kfc i've been just like gone oh no no not innocent it's not the innocent ghandi god i'm pretty sure that that's a man stop god he stop now that's enough gandhi's eyes were bigger than his belly he just went straight in for it without checking we've got two more heist preps to do before the big job so let's go we're going to be driving what is culturally appropriately named the slav mobile i have an honest question for my female viewers if four pasty epic gamers yell jeers at you from this fine sedan while you were walking down the street how many of them would you try and have sex with if you didn't answer all of them then you're lying to yourself now you might be thinking wow these guys are extremely mature and intelligent and you'd be right to think that the stealth omatos iq is literally one million as proof of this you can observe us engaging in some scholarly banter you see when mato dips his head down it appears as if he's engaging in premarital fellatio why does my head lean over towards your crotch when i do that get out of there get away from that oh yeah from the back of the strip looks like i'm sucking why are they just still doing it it's been like 10 minutes of driving you're still just doing it now it's getting weird i'll stop just get a little weird [Laughter] so we need to ambush this convoy that is transporting the thermal charges we'll need these to break into the bank's vault we put the difficulty on hard because we're hard that was a penis joke and if you're new here that's kind of like the backbone of this channel i guess seriously if penises didn't exist i'd have to make naughty female anatomy jokes and that'd be difficult as i've never seen what's down there actually no telling people to stay hydrated is the backbone but that's more of a public service announcement than anything else our military helicopter proceeds to blow up the slavomobile killing all of us at once relatable alright round two and this time we take out the chopper right away because as i mentioned earlier we are some of the world's best and brightest it's all going really smoothly and then out of nowhere crosby dies and we fail i think this might be the first time ever that it's crosby's fault we failed something and between you and me i'm thoroughly enjoying it what follows could quite frankly be some of the worst gta gameplay you'll ever see in your entire life i kept getting nailed in the head so i went way back behind everyone else to snipe but still got nailed in the head it was insane this actually reminds me of this video i once saw called aussie babe gets dominated by thick russian woman it definitely wasn't family friendly and i was so shocked i could only watch it eight times in a row but not in 1080p only 720 because i'm a man of god also stealthomarto's driving need i say more eventually we do steal the truck and it only took us seven or so attempts i must say it doesn't fill me with confidence for the actual heist but it's a good place to build from i guess next up we need to steal our getaway vehicles which is frankly pretty thoughtless regarding pollution why can't we just jog or ride a bicycle to minimize our environmental footprint everyone's busy blaming factories and airlines for global warming when in reality the number one cause of pollution comes from thoughtless bank robbers we proceed to start gunning down the gang but there'll be no gulag for these dodgy malakas speaking of the gulag imagine if it existed in real life like when you died it was just you vs someone else who died and you both got given an m4 assault rifle and the winner was reincarnated imagine if you died in a car crash with your partner and then had to face each other in the gulag it'd be such a difficult decision like would you flashbang them and then rush for the quick ko or hold a peek at spawn and play tactically for the headshot crazy to think about anyway we deliver the bikes to the drop off and then get ready to prepare for the main event let's have another trap we're making multiple stops all right man i said i'll score so this is crosby's other version of the slav mobile that we culturally appropriately call the greek economy slav mobile i'm allowed to say that because i have greek heritage well i mean a large portion of my family is greek i don't technically have greek blood in my veins but i do say malacca a lot so that's basically the same thing unfortunately stealthosimo has to leave us which is an incredibly sad gamer moment he's done all the heist prep but won't get any of the reward press f to pay respects while we wait for the boys to get online i ask mato to help me out with something this is what being friends with a youtuber is like standing still so he can hit you with his car repetitively and get a cool looking thumbnail speaking of youtube thumbnails and disappointed parents stealthomarto is going to start making videos soon this will truly be a great moment and i'll let you know as soon as it officially starts up also on a personal note thanks to all you absolute legends who have subscribed to this channel i can't believe we're actually on our way to 1 million honestly i can't thank you enough alright heist time and we've brought in the one and only stealtho robbo he's one of my best mates but quite frankly a huge liability for an operation such as this show some maturity robbie we're trying to hide here just walk into the cage i push through [Applause] we couldn't be more ready let's go make a moderate amount of cash we proceed to drive over to the pacific standard bank and i must say it's nice to be doing a traditional robbery like this we've done the heists in a strange order for some reason but this feels like a good one the hostages have to stay scared or they may call the police so we discharge our firearms regularly seriously can you imagine if you were trying to deposit the cash you got from selling your girlfriend's kidney and four dudes with clown masks walked in and started shooting everything i can't imagine anything more arousing i'm in charge of using thermite on the gates it's just like rainbow six siege except no one's telling me to kill myself when i fail a 1v6 clutch so once you have the cash you can't take damage or you lose money our tactic is to have crosby pick up all the banknotes so we can protect him and save as much as possible that's a man in peak form right there he's got the hand-eye coordination of an upskirt photographer it's time to get the motorbikes and get out of here we are working like a real team right now and all seem to be on the same wavelength unlike the other day when my mate came over and was like yo jeff are you thinking what i'm thinking and i was like hell yeah brother let's go fap to old episodes of ready steady cook and he was like nah man i was going to say let's go to the pub and it was kind of awkward but then i convinced him and now i feel we're closer than ever because of the shared experience anyway for some reason we decide to try and complete the mission in a cheap way by stealing a helicopter from the police station so he can fly away safely crosby does some parkour and climbs to the top but in an awkward moment the heli doesn't spawn next thing i know we've wasted a lot of time and are in a heavily armoured swat van barreling towards the checkpoint with 11 seconds remaining we come close but ultimately fail the mission it's safe to say we now know exactly how the japanese felt in world war ii for our second attempt we just take the motorbikes and don't try any glitches like the good pure lads we are this goes well and i don't even crash my bike on three separate occasions trying to take a shortcut through the mountain all i'm thinking now is how will everyone spend their winnings i also officially mark this as my favorite heist of all time the modern technology combined with that classic heist feel offers a money-making experience that has a little something for everyone who do i think i am some kind of entitled heist critique anyway stealth omato has the audacity to call me a bad driver but just witness this more importantly we complete the heist and i pocket a cool 302 thousand dollars for my efforts look at that cinematic celebratory shot right there are you watching a modest pelican video or a martin scorsese picture also that thick robbie ass i'm currently sitting on 850 000 but i'm saving for something special right now so i do the mature thing and don't impulse buy anything stupid which is genuinely rare for me stealth though robbo buys a strawberry face mask and fully upgrades a compact car which might be the best use of 500k i've ever seen stealthomato mods himself a nice porsche and crosby i assume just buys himself two and a half thousand lap dancers at the strippers all in all a pretty successful day on gta online i hope all you legends are doing well thanks for watching and a huge thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
