[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with The Witcher 3 if you enjoyed this content please get a job as the person who chooses elevator music and replace it with my videos audio instead as this really helps spread the good word of my channel so The Witcher we play as Geralt of Rivia and don't worry if you forget where he's from he'll remind you every 45 seconds anyway our current objective is to find ciri who is a girl we basically raised as our own we trained her to fight monsters and now she has disappeared and might be dead not exactly father figure of the year I'll admit but check out the rotting severed head of a Gryphon we carry around with us to help show women that we are emotionally stable I asked the innkeeper if he's seen ciri and he's like nah mate can you also leave there's some bad men coming to the bar I'm like yeah nah shut up big girl I'm a drink and then the bad men rock up and make fun of my hair this limited-time decision thing pops up and I decide to buy them a drink in an attempt to resolve this tense situation without anyone dying the bartender appreciates me doing this and as my reward for keeping the peace he says I should visit a man called Hendrick to find answers I then burn the guards alive and cut them up into little pieces because nobody talks [ __ ] about my hair it's like my fourth best feature I set out to try and find Hendrick and apparently he lives here which might be the most depressing town I've ever seen in my entire life I meet this dude who tells me a story about how the Wild Hunt came through here burning the village to the ground and slaughtering dozens I come on brah it's not like this was a desirable place to live before it got trashed Plus do you think sulking about is going to fix anything nobody likes a silk just find a new wife and kids I locate Hendrick and he's looking a bit under the weather so I check out his house he's got a secret basement and the wild hunt clearly didn't find it so maybe you should have hidden down here chief think it through I steal his valuables and also find a note that Siri might be after bloody Barons castle so let's go for any of you that watched my first Witcher 3 video you may have realized I called the wrong guy the bloody baron which was very dumb of me thanks for all being so understanding though like Brad here who said that is not the bloody baron you dumb mother kill yourself good video though thanks Brad that's harsh but fair I find the castle using my seasoned Witcher senses and the mythical GPS map system and make my way inside most of the town flee because no one likes witches we're basically an oppressed minority but we don't even have rich white private school girls sticking up for us it's really rough I make my way to the castle gate and the guards won't let me in because those dancers I slaughtered at the pub earlier were the bloody barons men but for God's sake I slaughtered those guys as a joke now what I've got a deal with the consequences anyway I refuse to learn anything from this I pay this old-timer 15 gold pieces and in turn he tells me about a secret way into the castle he's right - you can swim underneath it which seems like a huge architectural design fault like you might want to put a piece of corrugated iron in front of the hole or something anyway I don't mean to flex but look at how incredibly competent I am at swimming underwater it's magnificent stuff I make my way through the caves and a water hag attacks me water hags are much like normal hags except far moister honestly this water hag is kind of sexy though I emerged from the sewers and have a chat with the bloody baron he says it's fine I slaughtered his men because he has a job for someone with my skill set and finally someone with a good sense of humor but first though I asked him to tell me about ciri which he does through a cutscene but not just any cutscene an interactive cutscene wow this is so immersive this game really makes you feel like you're a thick tone - young woman wait how old is ciri I better check that okay sweet she's 21 years old we're good yeah ciri hella thick she's also fast and can slay wolves no problem I quite enjoy using her dodging ability to dodge wow that's some well articulated content I then made this poor little girl who is lost in the woods and so I asked her where she lives and she tells me straight away it's called stranger danger kiddo no wonder you got lost in the woods because you are clearly one stupid child I continued through the woods following great car who walks at an inconsistent pace which really triggers me for some reason and between you and me I'm kind of hoping a wolf gets her we stumble across this poor guy and Greta asks what happened to him and Cirie says he fell yeah great white lie bear Siri I hate it when I fall down the stairs and my body gets ripped in half it really dampens my afternoon I killed the werewolf who pushed that man over using facts logic and mostly just my sword the Baron then tells me about how he fed and looked after Cirie and the dumb child so I guess he's a really kind and hospitable man he says he'll tell me where Syria is if I helped him find and reconnect with his missing daughter and wife who do I look like mother fing dr. Phil I kill monsters for money that's my thing anyway with little choice I reluctantly agreed to do this I searched each of their rooms for clues using my powerful Witcher senses that also show me where the chests are so I can steal their stuff let's be honest they've been missing for more than 24 hours they're almost certainly dead so it's a victimless crime I also find this tales Minh which is a solid clue as it's quite a rare object I tell the Baron BRB and ride out to seek advice from the local pillar upon arriving at his heart we see that he is being harassed by some of the Barons men who have had a dicey relationship with thus far to say the least I have an option to pay them to go but I can't afford to keep bribing everyone so I kill them all nice the pillar is like what's going on big fella can you help me find my goat her name is princess I'm really getting the runaround here but I agreed to find her so here I am a skilled warrior ringing a bell trying to find princess the goat it's rough times I locate her and while leading her back a huge bear attacks me and at this point I half hope it kills me so I don't have to KMS later on a girl to the goat rescuer at your service milady I return princess and the pellet does some spells and [ __ ] and tells me that the bloody Baron and his wife had a carriage and since they didn't give the baby a proper burial it turned into a horrible little monster called a botch Ling how horrible could a bottling really bather I go back and get the Baron to show me where he buried it and yeah Wow that's pretty horrible this thing looks like Lord Voldemort and the purple Teletubbies crack baby I have another time decision to make and I decide to save the little cutie so we can turn it into a Lubbock in a god damn it sounds like I'm just making names up for these monsters basically though as this soon-to-be Lubbock in has the blood of his wife and daughter in it then hypothetically it should be able to lead us to them no problem a bunch of wraiths show up because they smell the baby and want to eat it I guess that's disgusting behavior to be honest like if you're going to eat a baby at least eat a normal human one not a repulsive purple infant on a rare serious note the combat in this game is really fun we perform some more spells and [ __ ] and next thing you know it's glowing and flying although still ugly as sin now things just hit 11 out of 10 as I have the realization I'm following a glowing floating disregarded fetus a very unique gameplay experience that's for sure it leads me to this family house and they tell me yeah na yeah na yeah na yeah na yeah na yeah na yeah they're in the big city of oxenfurt yo Legolas looking champion um thank you I say farewell to the lumber kin who turned out to be a remarkably laid-back travel companion honestly I might even miss her and dad asked though wow I'm joking I'm joking Wow okay so off to oxenfurt and it's quite a ride it takes me a reasonably long time everybody is also pretty tense due to the ongoing Wars so there isn't much hospitality going around the guards won't even let me into the city even when I ask really nicely and politely I feel like one of those dudes who slides into girls direct messages and asks them nicely for nudes it's like I know I've never met you but I asked nicely what more do you want send me some damn nerds please kind stranger is so not being able to get into the city isn't great but I decide to try something out that I highly doubt will work I mean I know it's not swim safe to take a dip well there's the storm but I just full send it an attempt to swim across and this works surprisingly well as it was only like 50 meters to swim across and I'm now inside the walls and that was almost too easy I guess no one in this realm knows how to freestyle but May which is really working in my advantage today I had to wear the baron's family is and made his daughter who tells me that she ran away from home and won't come home as her father is a massive dick he's actually the reason his wife had a miscarriage because he drinks too much well this all of a sudden got a bit heavy for a YouTube video and the poor girl sure has been through a lot I proceeded to steal everything I can from her hideout as these days I'm less of a monster hunter and more of a common house burglar and when I'm not casing houses I'm apparently escorting goats I ride all the way back to the Barons castle to tell him the good news about his daughter disowning him a long while later I arrived and thanks to my awful horse control I wind up slipping into the swamp it's here I realized this game has fast trouble well sometimes I forget that not every game is far cry 2 anyway I'm back and I tell him his daughter hates his guts and isn't returning which he takes really well now just kidding it emotionally murders him that can't be an easy thing to hear he tells me more about ciri at least and apparently she stayed with him for quite some time yay another interactive cutscene and oh my god so thick that horse is so thick so he had a fun little race with her and it looks like they had a fine and dandy time together right up until the winged beast swooped in on them but then he says he won't say any more until I find his wife like brah your family hates you get over it we'll have to find mama Baron next time though but I guess the lesson here is if someone even a stranger asks you very nicely for naked photos you're obligated by the law of Sidi surprise to send them some it's destiny thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
