content as this really helps spread the good word of my channel so i've been somewhat addicted to gtarp lately it's unhealthy because i don't go outside anymore but it's also technically my job so my girlfriend can't get too mad my career highlight so far was when i planted meth on a 14 year old girl and got her sent to prison yeah i'll give you i'll give you your first bag for free and you just let me and you we'll do it together excuse me i'm gonna call the cops hello officer i'm in postcode 633. officer this woman's trying to sell me sell me a bag of meth and i just didn't know what to do so i texted you he gave me the mess and she had the peer pressure into doing it what some kind of sick joke oh my god she's in cuffs it's not all family-friendly christian pranks though as i'm currently in the process of establishing a motorcycle gang i've got quite a few members rolling with me such as mr barry taxi self-proclaimed number one taxi driver in the city everything they're all the lyrics hanging out bikinis zucchinis martinis oh my god he's a god he's actually a god i will [ __ ] give him leadership of the gang i've also been trying to chat up this girl lulu as she's rich and has connections in fact she's married to one of the local gang leaders who's apparently not too happy with me shooting my shot this really is so much fun and the organic moments that happen while
