red dead online a truly beautiful gaming experience galloping on your horse through the lush meadows as dozens of wild animals frolic beside you except when you're trying to hunt then the animals do their best impression of my father and leave me alone to starve for all its beauty however this online mode has been neglected which has led to many people asking rockstar to save the game i agree with this as i'd love to see more updates more love and more ways to emotionally damage my mates as you can see here i've hogtied my dear friend stealth omado and placed him face down in the mud while he was afk if you squint your eyes you can see that he is in fact inside the left testy of a penis i think this artistic demonstration says an awful lot about humanity a rockstar you did email me once saying that you liked my red dead videos which actually meant a lot to me so if you are still watching i ask that you please continue looking after this game as the foundation is there but the potential is massive amado and i realize that it's been a hot minute since we've updated our drip it's time for some makeovers with the bros so we ride out towards blackwater i like to ride with my machete out as it makes me feel medieval we reach the city and i spot an opportunity for a courageous double kill to my absolute surprise i get both of them in quite a spectacular way the citizens of the town don't clap or applaud my accomplishment rather they run to local law enforcement i guess black water is full of six nine's ancestors as they're absolutely all snitches this forces me to execute a bunch of innocent people before they can rat the average lifespan in this era is 35 and i'm probably shaving a couple of years off that all they had to do was gas me up i hitch my horse up because this is a society and then make my way into the clothing store i don't know why but for some reason i enjoy making my character look nothing like a cowboy i purchase a new white soft sweater welcome to the wild west mato tried to make himself look like a pimp but it kind of turned out more like willy wonka if he had an aggressive meth habit he also paid big money for the throw up a mode so he just keeps gagging and spewing everywhere we couldn't be more ready before we get down to business there's a side to this game we neglect we don't feed ourselves or our horses as we never have enough supplies this leads to our health and energy cores always being low so today that changes i proceed to accidentally buy myself 30 cans of overpriced apricots i hope the big man loves canned fruit next step is to hunt some animals so he can eat nourishing meat mato tells me that he's landed a big kill dinner is served well no respect for this thing we eventually find a three-star white-tailed deer and herd it down to the river i tie it up and then just start laying into the hoofed mammal landing body shot after body shot i'm in a cashmere sweater punching a frightened woodland creature this is peak alpha we take the deer back to camp and it's always nice arriving back here my upgraded tent is great for the wet weather mato even upgraded his sleeping quarters from a plank of wood to a small shelter his mother would be so proud in fact she is so proud she's also very wet i'm getting a lot of mileage from naming my dog mato's mother we cook up a storm it's actually really wholesome look at the big man now though it's time to make some money as we ride off another player arrives at our camp and she seems friendly so i decide to make a move i attempt to give her the rest of my three-star deer carcass as a dowry so that i can legally wed her i'm unable to put it on her horse so i just dump it in the mud i assume she's pretty flattered right now we've got trouble though she's here on a mission and there's bandits everywhere even worse my fresh sweater is now covered in deer blood which is going to be incredibly hard to wash out in hindsight vibrant white probably wasn't a great choice of color laundry day is going to be an absolute undead nightmare we helped the last capture the gang later and she says thank you by trampling me with her stade as the probably love of my life rides off into the distance i do the mature thing and attempt to kill her hostage but i fail the lesson here is if you open your heart and let women in they'll destroy your clothing a true story one of my ex-girlfriends actually chopped up all my clothing i was playing halo with my mates in a garage and i lost track of time in fairness it was like six hours we were pretty into it i glance at my phone and i have like 20 missed calls from her i've got messages from my mum and her mum it was crazy i'm thinking someone's died so i call her back as fast as i could and she says who is she woman i'm flying around in a banshee sinking beers in a sweaty garage with seven dudes this is like the most virgin activity i could be doing now that i think about it it explains a lot like why i'm so concerned with the condition of my new virtual sweater we've gotta talk to anthony forman who's perched up in saint denis roughly one kilometer away reaching him would be a simple task for most but this is mato and myself we're talking about so i'll speed run you through the process naturally we would like to test out these new fire arrows so we ignite some of the local citizens as a victimless social experiment a word gets out and a city-wide manhunt starts for the two of us and we're forced to murder a baker's dozen worth of lads and lessers we then chase witnesses through the street executing them in an array of creative ways it gets too red hot so we steal a wagon and escape marto chooses to slab squad on my head rather than riding shotgun which i think we can all respect eventually we make our way back to saint denis for the second time but we figure it'd be rude not to take the tram i run after red attempting to board but i'm brutally crushed the conductor is credited with the kill suggesting that this was no accident toxic i run after the tram but it's too fast so i instead decide i'll just aggressively kick myself not metaphorically i genuinely stomp myself which takes a lot of willpower as my old corpse still looks quite frankly stunning in that sweater i then talk to anthony foreman and accept the mission to secure the last diamond we're yet to recover my current girlfriend of 7 years really loves diamonds she keeps saying [ __ ] like hey look at that girl's diamond ring i wish i had one of those on my finger it's like stop being jealous bozo that's her property we ride into roads and the lighting is next level we've been tasked with infiltrating a meeting at the local parlor house but we decide that a covert operation is cringe and we just start firing arrows into everyone arrows are cheap and we are bowling on a budget we murder loads of enemies it's great most of them are actually trying to kill us too which is a happy coincidence and a welcome change from our usual antics how cool would a wave defence style mission or gamemode be where you have to defend from an ever-growing onslaught of enemies that gets harder with each wave dare to dream the sneaky malaccas loaded the diamond into a wagon and took off into the countryside i pull out my flaming shotgun and begin igniting everyone humanely but then i'm thrown to the ground wow we find the wagon but my sweater is now completely soiled in mud unfortunately bleach has been invented so i should be able to get the stains out and then i might just drink some because why did i buy a white sweater we steal the wagon and ride to safety mission complete and we pocket a call 107 dollars for our efforts not bad but i have another business venture that i've somewhat been neglecting my moonshine shack that i purchased in the middle of a swamp also this is the moment mato went to get some food and i put him face down in my penis art when he comes back to his xbox you can truly appreciate the range of different emotions and realizations he had in the singular word he says jeff i asked the big girl to brew a strong batch of moonshine but to maximize the profits we will need to flavor it i'm missing the key ingredient blackberry i guess we're about to set off on a quest for blackberries it reminds me of when sam and frodo had to reach mordor except there'll be less annoying tiny people and more sexual tension before we leave we quickly get high on our own supply and then proceed to slap each other over and over again as it never seems to get old hey hey we ride off towards literally the other side of the map so we can forage bushes and then a woman asks for our help her friend's been captured and we agree to save him if she started walking backwards i know there'd be a beeping sound as there's most definitely a dump truck hiding under that cotton twill skirt we decide to attempt another knife only challenge this time it goes surprisingly well if there's one thing red dead did right it's the melee animations this game really makes you feel like you're a psychopath i cut him free and on the ride home he tells me his tale of abuse and horror the real horror however is the paycheck we received for rescuing this guy from the local law enforcement of 4.84 cents next time i save someone i'll first use this 4.84 cents to run down to the general store in strawberry and buy some scented candles and a couple of bottles of lube so at least i can enjoy being railed by the sheriff we ride to the hills of somewhere i googled and find plenty of blackberries well rather i found barely enough blackberries because marta kept eating them but i think we can all agree he earned the right to treat himself on the ride home i take a shortcut along the railroad and then realise it's elevated out of the swamp which is frankly great city planning as this would be a real flood zone with no safe way off i sent it and my horse bigger d dies a ghastly death motto kindly uses a bottle of horse reviver but it's in vain as we arrive back at the moonshine shack for reasons unknown to me my horse leaps like a bloody gazelle straight into a pillar and kills itself again this stallion needs jesus and a hug what happens next may shock you so viewer discretion is advised how much these costs that's right i got you oh i just drank horseradish the moonshine still hasn't brewed yet so i do the only sensible thing i use all my gold bars to completely pimp out the bar first things first i buy a band expansion for downstairs i wouldn't describe them as hard workers as they sort of just stand around looking more suicidal than my dead horse we take the initiative and have a good old-fashioned band practice i guess we find it surprisingly amusing [Laughter] i also drop another 15 bars on some hunting decoy they did not skimp out on the decorations i'm not saying it's overdone but there's literally a crocodile spider-man on the roof i think i like it but i honestly don't know the only thing that's certain is marto is contributing very little to the band right now my man kicked the original musician out of his seat to sit there looking pretty and he sure does look pretty we spend the rest of the brewing time doing some good old-fashioned fishing mato catches a huge catfish which is actually super impressive as i can never catch anything i was trying to get a nice photo of his accomplishment but i feel the man floating dead in his rowboat kind of ruins it what an attention-seeking dick having built to this moment for a couple of hours now it's time to deliver the precious moonshine cargo other players can steal it so we'll have to sweat as we approach saint denis there are some revenue agents checking carts it's a tense moment but fortunately the dodgy suit just oddly looks at the side of the cart and not inside if he got up on his tiptoes or took a wander around we'd be cooked but fortunately he doesn't understand the core concept of checking inside a cart delighted with ourselves we ride for the pub it's at this moment i spot a blue dot on the map a blue means friendly but i'm not about to take a chance on my blackberry moonshine i don't usually shoot first but i pop this little sombrero wearing malacca in the head leaving him broken crying and with trust issues but our merchandise safe we deliver the shine and make a cool 226 dollars not bad now while mato and i fight to the death i want to say again that this game needs some love i have a great time with it but i only ever play when i'm making a video that's purely because if i played all the time i'd have run out of things to do years ago and i like making content on it i know that it isn't as popular as grand theft auto but it still sold over 40 million copies which makes it an unbelievably successful game if you released some cracking updates and maybe even made the online portion free to play you'd have players coming back in hordes which would surely make it a viable business option bank heists and more businesses to run seem like a no-brainer but there's so much more you could do what about for example a rancher update where you could buy upgrade and run your own ranch maybe outlaws come to rage you from time to time and you have to defend your homestead undead nightmare is still in my opinion the best dlc of all time could we see zombies one day or maybe that's too ambitious but i promise it'd bring players in you know the entire of mexico is already right there in game waiting to be explored but you can only get there by using glitches there's so many better ideas than mine out there on places like the reddit you really don't have to look hard it feels like the entire framework the world the beautiful graphics the gameplay the npcs the towns and the cities are all right there it just needs some fresh content if you enjoyed this video leave a like and thanks for watching i love you [Music]
