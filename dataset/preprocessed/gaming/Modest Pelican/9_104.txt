[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican herewith world was a if you enjoy this content please open a hotel and then lock people in their Suites until they have subscribed to me also charge the dodgy malakas double for the Wi-Fi as this really helps spread the good word of my channel big thanks to focus Home Interactive who reached out to me and asked if I wanted to make a video on their game and I was like holy heck yeah I might not be a good role model for my kids but I sure am good at killing zombies and kidding I don't have kids don't call child services just yet but yeah the new game of the Year Edition is now available on all platforms and there's a link in the description and top comment if you wanted to check it out yourself it comes with new missions weapons characters a Russian wife wait no sorry no Russian wife but it has a horde mode and can be bought separately or as DLC if you already own the game today we'll be tackling the new French episodes I'm going to play as this dodgy melaka because the Hawaiian shirt says I'm a sensual lover whilst the cigarette says I'll stab you at the train station if you look at me wrong I'll be joined today by stealth a robo featuring a timeless and frankly quite sexy bowl haircut motto featuring a questionable red beret and Maddy who's a dude she actually wanted to be the girl with the red beret but motto stole it from her which may honestly be the most alpha thing I've ever witnessed let's go Martell attempts a 360 quickscope with a shotgun and it might genuinely be the worst attempt at a 360 quickscope I've ever seen in my entire life mate phase Granny mcfar toe we need to reach the chemists so we can substance abuse pharmaceutical painkillers I mean steal a heat pack because my back is sore from carrying the team I mean find a cure we make short work of the various zombies and then for a little practical joke I shoot my teammates in the back I didn't realize there was friendly fire look I never claimed to be teammate of the year however I will claim that I look quite charming in this vivid canary yellow blouse we reach the pharmacy or as it's pronounced in French pea harm Aki it's been completely looted which is a shame because I'd literally kill one of my teammates for some Hydra lights right now we continue through the dimly lit streets of Marseille and I discover my new favourite way of killing the undead with a tomahawk there's something quite wholesome about disemboweling the very same people you used to see at the grocery store mere weeks ago having taken some damage I apply a medkit by hydrating my forearms now this is a game mechanic I can get behind water is love water is life I'm all out of med kits but on the bright side there aren't a thousand angry zombies running at us in the dark just kidding here they come a while ago we played through the New York missions and basically there are these moments where you have to bunker down and defend a position if you can work well as a team coordinate be encouraging and support each other emotionally you can avoid being overrun again kidding we almost always get overrun to the point where everyone is out of grenades health packs and viagra I mean ammunition I definitely don't take viagra when I play video games that would be really weird we defeat the Horde and then motto gives us a tour of this art exhibition he says this one is called vertical pac-man because by eating upwards his defying social normalities by the way of innovative virtue wow that's actually pretty deep he then says this one's called nike lady go sit sit damn he's good we continue to fight our way through horde after horde and it goes down to the absolute wire I have to witness Maddie died in front of me and then see her turn into a zombie it's absolutely horrific imagine having to kill one of your mates and then shoot the head off their lifeless body well I guess the decapitation was completely unnecessary but let's go we get that sweet tasty victory damn Robo with the red hot carry any single girls out there want a big strong man who can protect them you could be mrs. stealth Oh Robo I equipped the gold skin for my ak-47 because sweat mode has been activated ah good it's daytime now I can finally stop crying uncontrollably because I'm so scared of the dark I proceeded to immediately throw a grenade by mistake at my teammates I'm starting to feel like I wouldn't be the person you'd want around during an apocalypse in real life I can imagine someone rushing in and being like yo the entire colony is being eaten alive someone forgot to lock the gate I'd have to slowly raise my hand and be like yeah sorry Karen I had a few too many watchtower beers and then went for a stress-reducing stroll outside the walls sue me anyway motto is busy trashing this car because he said a girl called Zoey used to drive one exactly like it Zoey also happens to be the name of his ex-girlfriend but I'm sure these two things aren't related we need to make our way to the industrial elevator so we can catch a ride to the missile launcher on top of the mountain for real though I genuinely think the worst part of a zombie infestation would be the constant forced jogging being in lockdown and all I decided to go for a jog the other day to get some fresh air and I can safely say it was the single dumbest choice I've ever made the 30 seconds in and I experienced firsthand what stage four and 4-seamer feels like the thing was I just said g'day to my neighbor who was about to walk his dog and I was only about 50 meters ahead of him on the path so I couldn't stop or I'd look weak and so I pushed myself all the way around the block and yeah in the words of all the girls I've ever slept with worst three and a half minutes of my life anyway we reach another choke point and apparently there's a mega hoard about to collapse on our position as I'm setting up the defences motto says he's being jumped and needs assistance god knows what he's even doing down here but it looks like Robbo has already saved him which sucks as I was looking forward to being his hero next thing I know some big raging mad lad is angry and starts choking me which is located pretty hot but also oxygen is crucial life's funny isn't it I came down here to save motto yet he ended up saving me and that sounded more poetic in my head I find the elusive gold ak-47 in this shipping container which is great as now everyone who spectate Smee will know I'm a sports ready what isn't great is that this mega hoard is at our doorstep the key to surviving something like this is to do a lot of damage early to thin out the numbers then the priority is stopping the cheeky rascals from building their little zombie towers I also say a quick prayer for our safety and to any of you non-believers who think God isn't real explain how my girlfriend got pregnant when we've never had sex before I just love destroying people with facts and logic almost as much as I love destroying these zombies unfortunately they make it up and it starts to get a little touch-and-go or as my uncle would say touch and keep your mouth shut boy I don't even think robos heavily underrated tasteful bowl haircut can get us out of this Jam no look we do eventually get out of the jam and make it to the elevator I was just a building suspense for your viewing pleasure all feeling pretty good we continued forward but absolutely nothing could prepare us for what happened next it will shock you and is very emotional I swear my suspense building is on par with the year six English class curriculum anyway as we're approaching the missile launcher Maddy disconnects because Australian internet is a joke we have slower internet speeds than Pakistan no shade at Pakistan at all but they're literally at war right now and still managed to hook it up so yes can I get an F in the chat I guess these guys are going to wait safely in here will we get the missile launcher up and running seems a little bit lazy but hey a missile launcher sure does sound like a good clean Christian fun here's the base for we're in a time-sensitive situation as we need to block the zombies path into the village by exploding the tunnels and mountains otherwise they'll just keep coming the missiles are scattered around and you have to load the bigmama manually so it's going to take some unbelievable coordination notto jumps onto the computer controls in the bunker and prepares to line up a shot Robo and I defend him already low on health and ammo so every shot with this thing really needs to count motto precedes to fire and he tries to account for bullet drop but you see the thing about missiles is that their mother in missiles I can just imagine an astronaut being like thank God we joined NASA and a safe up here on this satellite just kidding mate stealth Amato in his defense this thing is super difficult to aim and it doesn't help that there's constantly zombies trying to eat your face we do our absolute best but fail miserably and eventually the Horde grows too thick the bad kind of thick which surprisingly is actually a real thing as much as I hate to admit it we kind of suck without Maddie she's like the glue that keeps this group together and focused she's also like the glue that you want to sniff I mean what let's go round two all right so Maddie is going to defend me while the lads load the launcher it's basically the perfect plan with Robo outside killing the Horde motto getting the Rockets and telling me where to aim and Maddie keeping the undead malakas off my back it should be a GG wait literally all I'm doing here is basically pressing the right trigger to fire which is kind of depressing when you think about it anyway there's one tunnel left to destroy and the Horde is now so thick it belongs on some arrays Instagram I have one chance to fire here or we'll be overrun and so I press the right trigger like I've never pressed the right trigger before and thanks to me pressing this right trigger and I guess a little bit motto aiming we get the victory the next mission had us go into the sewers and motto doesn't do very well with horror games I wish I'd recorded his live reaction but if you can imagine a six-year-old girl screaming profanities that's basically an accurate portrayal for the multiplayer I picked angel Flores because I mean look at this absolute Vic unit of a man you just know he leaves those glasses on when he has post-marital physical relations slowly but surely my only adjective is becoming the word Vic I swear a bit yeah angel Flores absolutely popped off and the multiplayer was a pleasant surprise I think we ended up playing for like three hours it's always nice when a developer reaches out to me and I've been trying to bring a wider range of games to the channel so thanks again to focus Home Interactive the opportunity thanks to you legends for absolutely everything and to those of you who support the channel on patreon I hope you're all doing great until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
