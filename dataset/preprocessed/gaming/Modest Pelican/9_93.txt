[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with something a bit different my mate bet me a case of beer that I wouldn't have the balls to make a video dedicated to finding a roblox girlfriend yet here we are if you enjoyed this video please convince Elon Musk to send a pelican to Mars before a human as this really helps spread the good word of my channel alright so the first place we're going to look is pirate simulator I mean look at my guy here you can tell this man knows how to satisfy a woman's deepest and darkest desires this is my castle and I guess this player is my new best friend perhaps we can go and hold some adventures together to find a blocky babe as you can tell graphically this is one of the most impressive video games of 2020 and are you kidding me big man you're really going to plunder my castle well this leaves me no choice but to slash you up into tiny pieces so that even your family can't recognize the body worst wingman ever he tries to escape on his pirate ship and honestly I don't know why Assassin's Creed Black Flag gets called the best pirate game of all time this is next gen worthy unfortunately I don't think we're going to find what we're looking for here so yeah you guys have probably heard of FIFA but let me introduce you to it's way hotter younger cousin a super striker League but the S is a lightning bolt see no it's a virgin free zone if you look very carefully you can tell that this is a simulation and not an actual live game of real-life football this Sonic the Hedgehog looking Malaka proceeds to shoot 50 arrows down from the sky and I think I just have to accept that this game is too sophisticated for my tiny brain whatever I'm an Arsenal man now and I can't wait to check out its highly anticipated summer update you see I grew up in cod modern warfare 2 lobbies where I was abused so badly by people I didn't know that when my parents beat me they were genuinely concerned as to why I was smiling it was because it felt like a goddamn vacation compared to the verbal assault I was used to these kids are probably just trying to enjoy their blocky family-friendly FPS game but are instead experiencing the wrath of someone who doesn't go outside it gets slapped your little tater I'm in line to be the first phase member who plays roblox exclusively but there is just too much killing here to find any sort of erotic eel of a Crosby gets online and says he knows of a really exceptional roblox game damn now this is immersive we've got multiple Squidward's on a chair of the iconic Squidward house some very realistic spongebob squarepants 3d modeling if this isn't peak gaming I don't know what the gears I reckon Squidward would be an absolute animal in bed as well and Cosby then says there is surprisingly an even better gameplay experience to be had [Music] Wow this is definitely the most questionable content I've ever made okay it's time to play jailbreak a prison simulator that is allegedly so immersive 90% of players get crippling institutionalized PTSD after they log off and can I just say that whoever designed this exercise yard maybe the most careless person I've ever seen in my entire life why does this trampoline not have a safety net there's nothing cool about not taking safety seriously and Crosby is playing the jail guard what could possibly go wrong here somehow we convinced stealth osimo to play roblox with us which I genuinely didn't think was possible but hey in a way we are emulating the psychological Stanford Prison Experiment which is meant to demonstrate how someone with power will behave a barely one minute into this social experiment and Crosby starts aggressively tasering another inmate by the name of boss Cole were 10 I feel bad for him because Crosby's trigger finger is on a new level he doesn't send girls nudes he sends videos of his trigger finger and trust me they come running all of a sudden boss skull initiates a mass escape and we make a run for freedom and this is the start of our new life in the big wide world where it cycles from day to night uncomfortably quickly a Grand Theft Auto 6 may never be released but at what point do you just not need it anymore I signed up for a prison escape game and now I'm driving around a world that truly feels alive and believable I decide to try to rob a bank but a female police officer has climbed up a tower and is trying to shoot me this might sound pretty weird but I think I'm in love with her I found my roblox girlfriend I decide to take a leap of faith metaphorically and literally I feel as if I'm climbing up into heaven to meet my angel and this could be it for me lads and lasses this could be my happy ending oh god she's cute and then she proceeds to handcuff me look I'm open-minded if she wants to take control I'm totally down to dress up in a latex suit and default dance if that's what gets her going she then climbs up the ladder like she's setting up for a trickshot and puts a bullet in my head this teleports me back to my prison cell and honestly I'm so sorry I'm trying to provide light entertainment not the saddest moment in videogame history my hearts broken and there's only one thing that can pick up the mood Shrek simulator I guess this is some sort of horror game I can faintly hear a distorted version of the song all-star by Smash Mouth gradually getting louder and louder it's genuinely terrifying oh my god it's the big grain god himself and he's out for blood tonight I also don't know why Crosby's roblox name is Gregor bonks but it's best not to overthink it Shrek absolutely assaults Paul Greg bonks and then B lines straight for stillthis mo the most impressive thing about this minigame isn't the spectacularly horrifying atmosphere it's the fact that it successfully sold thousands of dollars worth of downloadable content shrek eventually gets me to and lets me know that playtime is oka amazing pun maybe we can find a girl in ice cream and quite a lot of pun humor going on here which makes me feel like a facebook mum but I honestly don't know what else I was expecting my avatar was also non-consensual e sex changed to a woman in a purple beanie which feels incredibly invasive anyway lads and lasses uninstall call of duty war zone because this is the only battle royale experience you're going to need going forward this gameplay combines survival fast food and insane lag issues like you've never seen before ice cream has a little something for everyone each round has a new killer as well there is seriously an uncomfortably large amount of Squidward references in roblox it begs the question though what's more intimidating than Squidward that's right - granny simulator the stealth osimo was chosen as the granny and the rest of us have to escape her house before she clubs us to death with her bread roller how is this game for kids I swear to god I'm going to have nightmares of grandmas mo chasing me around the house alright so I've got to try to escape maybe I can use this meat to distract her dog or to increase my protein intake so it can hit puberty faster and outmuscle Nana I decide to send it and go for a stealth attack which isn't actually a mechanic in this game and oh my god a granny sim oh do be looking kind of thick no joke what's under that gray maid dress because my guess would be and irresistibly thick juicy ass that's my boy though so yeah I think we've experienced everything this has to offer phantom forces let's go okay I'm ironically this minigame absolutely pops off after wading through hundreds of different Squidward on a chair adaptations we found go I'm not being ironic either the boys and I played this for like three hours graphically it looks like a dog's ass hole but it blows my mind how a roblox first-person shooter can have better gunplay than many triple-a competitors there was an intricate leveling system and loads of customization options you know I had to be overly sweaty again and go full try hard because that's what else the gamers do ruin the fun for everybody else I was up on rooftops spawn trapping and running flank routes so dirty that many of my opponents quit immediately after I wrecked them - I assume curl up in the fetal position under a hot shower I am a god I'll be at the average age of my opponents was probably like 12 but still eSports ready time to act out my true calling in life time to manage my very own theme park the girls love a man who appreciates a good rollercoaster so let's build I want this place to touch kids parts I mean hearts my first ride is going to be a teacup ride because who doesn't love sitting in a teacup and spinning slowly that's safe and fun my first customer is named Cash and this is a big moment for my theme park Korea look at him having so much safe fun this is as good as your life is going to get cash I put in little stalls so they can enjoy a snack after they've ridden the teacup ride a few hundred times this here though this is my most proud creation this truly impressive coaster is going to put me on the map and submit my name is the best theme park manager of all time oh my god they're all burning alive even cash right now especially cash work at a pizza place I like the name of this one because it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination you literally just work at a pizza place and it looks like I've landed a gig as a delivery driver now this is wholesome except all these different minigame forcefully promote in-game purchases at a level that would even impress a a the 300 roebucks to have a radio for my car tempting but no thank you I successfully deliver my first pizza and I'm feeling pretty damn good about it right up until my client says Wow that was fast Jesus mates you don't think I hear that enough in real life you know in some cultures they refer to it as hyper fertile so go jump off a cliff I returned to the store and find exactly what I've been looking for this whole time a roblox girlfriend she's got an impressive vertical jump and honestly I think I'm in love again I can't let another a babe get away so I decide to follow her home which isn't creepy because it's roblox a land of fun-filled moments so this must be her house lucky she's cute as I'm definitely not getting together with her for her big bank account this is literally a one-bedroom house you broke QT ah well I only need one room for what I'm about to do with her next premarital hand-holding we did it lads and lasses we found true love she then spawns a chest in her house and god damn it she wants me to buy roebucks coins because if I buy them here she gets a percentage is our love just a micro transaction to you my heart is broken once again and there's only one thing that can make me happy now [Music] definitely the weirdest video I've ever made I've got a GTA Sons of virgins episode up next otherwise I hope all you absolute legends are doing well thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
