[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoy this video please attend random funerals and then take the microphone kanye style and aggressively promote my content to the large gathering of people as this really helps spread the good word of my channel meet thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories i spawn at a desert lake for some reason i guess i forgot to change my spawn location to my house i'm then unable to climb these rocks like what is this call of duty war zone there's even a guy fishing out here which is wholesome but there's no time for recreational activities as we've got a big day today first we have to fix our cash flow problems as we've only got three hundred thousand dollars and then later we're interviewing a new potential recruit for the gang we'll have to put him through some vigorous tests to determine if he's loyal and trust me i know a thing or two about loyalty in fact i'm so loyal to my girlfriend that when i watch adult videos i make sure there are no women in them we organize to all meet at maddie's casino penthouse and on the way i pick up a hitchhiker questionable decision by him to hop in an unknown vehicle and basically just give the metaphorical middle finger to stranger danger i head upstairs to meet mato and maddie and they do be looking good in fact we're all looking pretty gangster right now puffing on these sicilian cigars well actually my hitchhiker acquaintance looks like he's about to go full blown joker mode at any second but i'm not a judgmental person we get pretty drunk and then do the sensible thing and stand on the ledge of the roof stealth omato proceeds to put one in my boy's head and this is why you don't hitchhike because if you hitchhike stealthomato will murder you i then steal a bus and drive around the server picking people up at every bus stop i wait for the explosion but to my pleasant surprise everyone just climbs aboard and sits down happily in this rare beautiful moment the online community is united right up until i drive the bus off the pier in an attempt to drown them all all of a sudden i spot a recognizable figure approaching and it can't be doctor disrespect shows up and all i know is that is definitely the real doc and not my mate crosby 7885 i wouldn't say he's brought peace with him but what are you going to do troubled teens are an angry breed and need to be put down alright what the [ __ ] is going on here we need to make money immediately well first mato wants to show me his jive and honestly yeah the man can jive it's extremely impressive he should be doing backup dancing for r kelly or something we can't just stand around all day touching ourselves tomatoes enticing moves though it's time to work our first job is to steal two vehicles the cops have confiscated now breaking into a locked down police station is no easy feat we'll have to really finesse this maddie then walks right through the unlocked front gates women always find a way to be more efficient and i mean that i think we can all agree that trusting a woman to lead is important and wow no you're not driving maddie come on there's a lion it's important to keep the cars in good condition and besides being shot by a helicopter 10 000 times on the way and also accidentally running over dr d it goes off without so much as a hitch well mato drove his car into the water so we only get 15 000 but at least we're moving in the right direction now i then do a quick assassination mission in my deluxo flying around up here makes me feel more powerful than when i was the acting floor supervisor at this turkish restaurant i worked at one of the employees asked if he could go home because he felt sick but i knew he just wanted to play cod so i said no he ended up throwing up in the middle of all the tables and burst into tears saying it was because he was having a ptsd flashback episode from when his dad left in a drunken rage and needed to go to hospital and then he just ran out the front doors of the restaurant and i thought to myself wow this guy really wants to play cod anyway another 21 thousand dollars in the bank let's go while flying around i spot a nice rooftop pool and decide to check it out it's a beautiful swimming facility no lie suddenly this guy is next to me making jerk off motions and you know what no why does every gta video end up with me in a compromising spa situation with other dudes i'm out my mates have however gone away to get dinner so i employ the jerk-off spa guy to help me out and he's nice enough to do so you see my labs are out of supplies so it's on us to go and steal some from another game i wouldn't mind starting my own gang in real life it seems profitable but i think the key problem is that i learned most of my conflict resolution skills from xbox live chat i'd be like yo pay the money you owe us or i'll get your account banned and then i'd 360 spit on them in real life then they'd probably just stab me in the neck with a butterfly knife or something my boy hippiedude70 was a real help albeit he didn't take any chances and literally destroyed any player that so much just glanced in his direction still i like his energy and besides the invasive physical harassment in the spa earlier he seems like an outstanding citizen mato is back from dinner and it's time to sell this product we have to sell it via seaplanes and i love mato he's my boy with many great qualities like for example he always uses mouthwash before we kiss i mean he always gives me petrol money but yeah flying isn't one of his good qualities and he's got 84 000 worth of g fuel on that seaplane if he crashes it's all gone so as you can imagine i'm feeling a little sketchy right now against all odds he pulls it off and we pocket 168 thousand dollars we then give the planes a traditional sick lad funeral steal a car from some cargo shorts wearing chad and then i kid you not the police come after us wow really go out there and catch the real criminals jesus all we did was distribute coke to our intricate aquatic dealer network crash a plane into a chemist and then steal a car just because we're handsome and girls always try to marry us so they can attend consensual post-marital water aerobic classes with us you think we belong behind bars no words i'm literally shaking anyway i win 50k on the spinning wheel which is nice and then trade in 45 000 worth of chips taking our current account balance to 582 000 nice our potential new member sends me a message saying he'll be online soon i also get an in-game message from maude and my heart rate picks up as maud is a little minx i mean her hair says karen but her arms say unforgettable hand job unfortunately it wasn't a booty call she wants us to kill someone and as we still need cash i accept the job we have to find this guy around the park somewhere but only i can see the photo so i have to describe what he looks like to the lads i tell them he looks like mato if he gains some weight and crosby locates the big guy immediately i literally have no remorse for this man either because he was standing here drinking soda pop instead of water soda can actually dehydrate you so i'm glad you're gone because if you were a father i cannot in all my good moral duty let you instill that blasphemy onto your children you know what one of the sickest features of gta 5 is the races so we decide to do a few races for fun but also to make some extra cash my friends are online bullies though and they keep bumping me off the track you see as a privileged millennial i can dish it out but the second i'm the target i'll cry about it and blame someone like i don't know obama i then give my neon a new paint job that i'm not sure about but it's important to try new things i can't decide if i love or hate the grain but whatever the important thing is my mate is now with us for his initiation ceremony maybe some of my og viewers will remember jezo from my battlefield 1 videos but nepotism isn't going to help him here he has to earn his spot in the gang like everyone else did first things first he needs a snappy suit so that he can pull a hoe or two and i mean that literally as there's nothing more gangster than organic vegetable farming which i want to rapidly branch into so the suit can't be overly tailored while he's doing that i try on a few different pairs of sunglasses for a potential change but let's be honest i'm already wearing the perfect pair i look amazing in filmmaking directors will add subtle visual aids so the viewer subconsciously knows what kind of person a character is for example making someone wear a red piece of clothing will instill fears of anger passion and rage jezo decides to utilize this strategy by wearing a paper bag over his head with an angry face drawn on it so that people know he's angry genius as we leave the clothing store we're gunned down by some dodgy malacca i get my deluxo out so that i can extract revenge and a jet tries to kill me so i end up in an aerial dogfight wow i can't believe i drove a bus around and didn't get exploded earlier that was a unicorn server anyway challenge one he must steal a hydro jet from the military base with no help from us this challenge will test his mind body and soul for his first attempt he steals a tank and opts for brute force which doesn't work out well as they have tanks of their own he manages to get in by parachuting down onto a hydra and almost escapes but like the kids in my basement not quite on his third attempt he just drives a jeep through the front gates and heroically flies away in the hydra we die though which is unethical of the soldiers as we were purely acting in an observational role the challenge won complete for his next task he must defeat doctor disrespect in hand-to-hand combat the stealth omato officiates the fight by detonating an explosive and they're off to the races i start to sense that jezo may be losing the fight just a little bit and look i'm trying to grow a gang here so i slightly intervene by shooting the dock with a shotgun twice in the back mato says the result stands and therefore challenge 2 is complete under suspicious circumstances amato then has the audacity to say my sunglasses look mid-range at best so we start to fight it out but crosby didn't take too kindly to the shotgun incident and crushes us both wow the final challenge is perhaps the most epic and i'm certain you've never seen anything like this before we are raising the bar of grand theft auto content worldwide jezo must slowly and carefully walk down mount chiliad at a leisurely pace look at him go this is outstanding stuff he's crushing this day hike making the mountain look like an escalator wouldn't be surprised if he picked up a katmandu sponsor after this video goes live what truly epic thrill-seeking hiking content a crosby then shoots jezo in the head and look thank god because that would have taken all day what a dumb idea welcome to the sons of virgins gezzo you basically almost earned it i've launched another channel called papa peli which will focus on organic live moments with the lads and i some of you already know about it and i was pretty overwhelmed with the amazing positive reaction so thank you all so much the first video is already up we played some warzone and the next one is going to be gta which i'll upload this week otherwise thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
