[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with the nine types of Call of Duty warzone players if you enjoy this content please become a therapist and tell all your clients that the only way they will defeat their inner demons is by subscribing to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel alright so your parachuting into this battle royale with a pistol and a dream so what can you expect from your opponent's well the first type of player you're going to come across is the neglectful father because this guy is always arriving late to the zone and sometimes he never even shows up at all running from the ever enclosing gas circle late is a risky strategy and you'll often find yourself getting caught up in gunfights with other neglectful fathers who are also running extremely late to avoid being this guy you'll want to be organized just like Gandhi once said don't get caught in the gas and instead get some ass of the Gulag Prince in war zone if you die you get a second chance at the main event if you win a 1v1 fight in the gulag and this guy always dies in the first 10 seconds of a match and thus finds himself slugging it out in this damp arena in fact I swear these dodgy malakas have spent more time in prison showers than El Chapo you can sense their frustration as they repetitively punch you in the head and it's like brah and the only conjugal visit you're getting today is a desert eagle to the face i'ma do you like Epstein the medic is the one who always manages to stay alive long enough to revive their teammates if you're playing with randoms it's safe to say that you'll never have a medic on your team in fact you'll probably end up with two actual newborn babies who've been handed controllers by their biracial parents but as they're infants they clearly lack the fine motor skills to even operate a controller or at least that would explain a lot about the random team mates I seem to get anyway having a good medic in your squad can be the difference between one night in the gulag and a victory that could for a brief second make you feel like you matter the speaking of victories number four the guy who always wins some people want to be lawyers some people want to marry their cousins without being prosecuted and some people just want to crush filthy casuals in call of duty and get those double use these players are simply winning specialists who probably take war zone more seriously than say personal hygiene but washing hands is for nerds am i right if you must wash your hands do it quickly as if you wash them for too long the germs go full circle and come back stronger than ever a plus you could be using these pressure seconds to clap some virtual cheeks anyway these guys seem to be particularly good at keeping their [ __ ] together in the small final zones where things get particularly hot it's always surprising how many squads are still alive in these tiny zones but keeping cool calm and collected is the key to success I for example have never not kept my cool like I never once jumped off the prison walls in the last circle with one guy left and then opens my parachute to lage so that I gently floated in front of him defenseless and he proceeded to kill me with ease and I got a depressing second place that never happened or another thing that never happened was when it was me versus one squad left and I tried to hide behind a thin tree but apparently I'm a thick snack so they managed to shoot me and I got second place again the thirsty boy is one thirsty boy somebody get this guy a glass of chilled water you see life is all about making difficult decisions for example will you send a dick pic to your boss's wife or will you send it to your boss directly and ask him to pass it on to her as a power-play warzone is no different as you'll be faced with many difficult decisions but none harder than do you thirst your enemies but basically when you down them do you take the time to finish them off or do you instead try to kill their teammates well we all know what the thirsty boy is going to do as he just loved sending gamers straight to the gulag honestly you can't blame him with players able to purchase self revives it's sometimes the smarter play but mostly it's hilarious as imagine how mad they'd be when you finish them off the hit man loves completing contracts whether that be an assassination locating various loot boxes scattered around the map or perhaps completing the most exciting contract of them all lying down very still while slowly capturing a flag but for real though completing these contracts can be hugely beneficial as you earn reward and by far the best of days in my opinion is saying we're the next circle is going to bathe this can allow you to find a good position early and then snipe people as they ignorant lis jug in later than you did because they don't have the skills to lie down and capture a flag themselves easy win easy life the sweat drop shotted right out of his mom during childbirth he's the kind of guy who wears a nice sports jersey when he faps and you know he's serious about gaming because his computer has all those over-the-top blue lights coming out which make you better you'll catch this guy using every trick in the book to gain an advantage hell even the pregame lobby isn't safe from his self-proclaimed talent he's the one trying to shoot enemies out of the air before anyone's even on the ground because he's just about ambitious in video games that is let's not confuse this with real-life ambition anyway nothing annoys the sweat more than seeing his teammates having fun like what did you buy this game to enjoy yourself do you think a gang gas can enjoyed himself when he tried to defeat the Jin dynasty one in 200 men direct descendants of Genghis Khan wow that's a lot of unprotected sex look okay maybe he enjoyed himself a little bit but the point is Call of Duty isn't about fun it's about proving that you're the best and even when you die you just called the other player trash and spammed them with vulgar hate messages thus proving you're the better gamer number 8 the steppe Road there's nothing a step bro enjoys more than taking advantage of someone who stopped and say a group of enemies hundreds of meters away are stuck in a gunfight with another squad well this is where the step bro pulls out his sniper rifle and starts taking them down because there's very little they can do per se he sees someone stuck on top of a rooftop well again it's all about seizing the opportunity you see sometimes a step bro has to take a step back so they can properly see the bigger picture there are always people getting stuck whether they're getting stuck doing something in real life and have gone afk so you can clean them up easily while they're defenseless and perhaps they're stuck behind a building so you use a precision airstrike to clean them up effortlessly from a distance maybe they're stuck in the passenger seat of a helicopter so you think you know what I'm going to snipe them out of there well there's nothing they can do to escape it's all about finding these enemies and then capitalizing on just how stuck they really are the high riser is the one who finds the tallest possible place whether it be a building mountaintop or airport control tower and looks down on others from their tactical throne to add insult to injury you plant a few claymores near the access points and voila you've got yourself a little fortress I'm probably not the most kosher strategy amongst the playerbase but boy oh boy is it funny I don't know why I derive so much pleasure from slaughtering players in annoying ways let's just hope I never get into a position of power a bit yeah we secured the airport control tower a few times and just sniped people it was like a mini game for us we were just hunting helpless gamers from a safe distance and if that isn't a fresh slice of family-friendly wholesomeness I really don't know what is anyway many of you have been asking what I think of warzone so we'll do a little review right now it'll be like I'm an IGN reviewer except I'll have actually played the game before I start talking about it and I won't have purple hair and daddy issues so yeah war zone in my opinion is excellent I'm having an unbelievably good time playing it obviously I don't have much experience reviewing games so questionable choice doing this review I guess but for a first person shooter about a Royale it's hard to imagine anything better I guess it kind of reminds me of firestorm and if you haven't heard of firestorm I don't blame you it was the battlefield 5 battle royale and was honestly really well done but they didn't make it free so it died after about two weeks just like my goldfish I don't know who at dice made the decision to not make it free but it was definitely the wrong one chief I also saw they reduced the minimum players needed to start a game of firestorm from 8 to 2 people so what are two people going to 1v1 in a to mild square area excellent idea one of the things I really like about warzone is the looting is streamlined there aren't 45 different types of optics to choose 16 Crypt types that ever so slightly changed the recoil pattern of your gun and bloody ten different pairs of panties your character can wear to limit chafe you simply find some weapons and then start saving cash which you can use to buy your custom loadout and use your favourite guns the whole cash system is good too because when you've saved up a bit you travel to these store things to buy like UAVs and airstrikes and there are often other squads here doing the same thing which brings players together it's like eHarmony but excessively violent I suppose as a well-respected and debatably overqualified video game reviewer I should mention some negatives to offer a balanced well-rounded opinion I think first and foremost there are far too many avatars that a white toxic men why did they even include white men in the game it's literally 2020 am i doing a good job guys am i woke yet when do I get paid the jokes aside I guess the lag spikes are pretty annoying but hardly game breaking or anything and I'm sure they'll get fixed soon it could also definitely be my Australian internet our country doesn't take download speeds very seriously I don't think our politicians are epic gamers the map itself I also really enjoy there's not much dead space where they've just put some trees and hills there's always something going on which makes the gunfights far more interesting I do think it would have been cool to see more large-scale unique points of interest such as the prison which I love that being said I really like the maps no real complaints also I don't think there's skill based matchmaking in this mode which is so good when I play game modes like team deathmatch or Search & Destroy I come up against the bloody Australian faze clan it's very intense gaming I need a cup of coffee right before every session so it's really nice to just play a bit more casually for a change a cross platform is hilarious to versing ps4 players and PC players we actually had our first win with a ps4 player in our squad so warzone is really tearing down the walls of hate there overall I'm going to give it eight point five out of ten water bottles the super fun and I definitely recommend downloading it as it's free and you've got nothing to lose except all your hard drive space have yourselves a great week you absolute legends thanks for watching and a massive shout out to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
