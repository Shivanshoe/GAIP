[Music] hi lads and lasses modis pelican here with gta online if you enjoyed this video please rewrite darwin's theory of evolution so that all organisms originate from pelicans as this would really help spread the good word of my channel meet thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories i spawn into los santos and today we're getting back to our roots back to what made us who we are a time with the bros tasteful painting jokes and we're also going to be doing a whole lot of meme tactics things like war trains wow so cool and this is more exciting than the ads on adult websites they always tell me that there are horny singles in my area but never what direction they're in but first though my sponsored ad segment because i get sponsorships now proving anything is possible hi my name's jeff and i'm here to tell you about my special youtuber morning routine i start off the day by waking up at 3 30 a.m and listening to an ebook with my rake on earbuds right now i'm listening to modest pelican and stealth omato erotica fan fiction i then go for an 11 mile jog while listening to christian rock bangers via my impressive 6 hour long battery life rake on earbuds i then visit my girlfriend as commitment and trust helps keep me grounded and focused of course the entire time i'm listening to cryptocurrency updates via my stylish bluetooth wireless rake on earbuds i then go and visit my other girlfriend because diversity and change helps keep me on my toes and ensures i'm ready for anything the day throws at me at this point i'm usually listening to some post-bop smooth fusion jazz on my rakon earbuds that come in a wide range of colors and patterns i then go for a second 16 mile jog and arrive home to consume my rich nourishing breakfast a glass of lemon water mixed with the tears of biracial athletes and of course pitbull's hit 2009 album regulation via my rake on earbuds that have a 45 day free return policy they're high quality affordable co-founded by ray j himself and even renowned philosopher snoop dogg wears them you know why i like jeff because he wears reikon events you click the link in the description or go to buy recon dot com forward slash modest pelican to get 20 off your next rake on purchase i recommend that you do that every morning but now it's time to open up our mines the first thing i do is customize my beetle and i honestly think it looks worse than before i go and pick up my boy stealth robo who proceeds to rudely ram my beetle with his four wheel drive as you know he likes to play as a thick female strawberry character which i feel really got this community through the loneliness of quarantine he's also incredibly proud of his four-wheel drive so i decided to hit him with a wholesome christian prank talk me through it so what's like what's it based off and [ __ ] so it's based off in my life if you're new here i commentate my videos in a post-production way i started doing this because when i was a student my laptop was too [ __ ] to record gameplay and my voice as you can see i sometimes include live moments from our sessions to help me and the boys seem more relatable and also prove that i'm not entirely dead inside the first thing on robbo and my to-do list is heading down to the movie theater because i've never actually done that before the film showing is some kind of soviet inspired story sure the russians are a bunch of cold miserable [ __ ] with no ethics i have no follow-up i rate the movie experience 1 out of 10 not enough subliminal communist messaging the second thing on our to-do list is visiting the mine shafts we drive out there and robbo elegantly exits the vehicle i explode the entrance to the mine shaft and we make our way inside oh [ __ ] dude i just see your booty bro this would be a great place to murder you and have no evidence did you look like the monster god damn it pretty cool as i've never seen it before but they were emptier than my balls after i take a sick day from work i get it because i fapped like seven times sophisticated peony jokes i feel like i'm 2018 pelican next up is something far cooler an item that is absolutely useless the anti-aircraft trailer that is frankly pretty bad at shooting down aircraft it comes with this truck but you don't actually have to use it we head down to los santos customs and robbo does up a much more suitable ute i think it says a lot about society that literally any woman would sleep with a guy who drives this robbo proceeds to reverse and completely miss the trailer but eventually he gets it proving he's more than just a dump truck we then roll out ready to hunt some dodgy malaccas people might say this is toxic but when compared to flying around on an oppressor or jet destroying everyone with heat-seeking missiles it's relatively serene the trick to justifying your actions is just to compare them to something far harsher when i go grocery shopping i usually eat a small bunch of grapes which is objectively shoplifting hiroshima suddenly a few grapes isn't so bad we also clear out grove street with one of the most refined drive-bys of 2021. imagine you're a gangster pushing dope and respecting women and your rivals rock up with an anti-aircraft cannon anyway this isn't actually our plan this was just a bit of fun before we enter stage two the stage two is picking the anti-aircraft cannon up with a cargo bob so that robbo will hang below madly spinning around in circles shooting on site this is overly elaborate but we're all about dreaming big we flew around for quite some time before finding a suitable target you've done so much damage to the chopper yeah it keeps spitting me into the chopper this is a good angle yeah oh you got it robo and i mess around with a few other concepts like for example this one where we try and land titans on top of buildings but we had to pull the pin for obvious reasons as we were coming up with another plane related idea that wouldn't get us cancelled some guy called hxrxra shot us down with an oppressor you know he gets a lot of ass because he uses x's in his name instead of vows making it impossible to pronounce i always take the high road when incidents such as this happen i get my deluxo and kill them until one of us gives up while waiting for my other mate gezzo to get online i execute another classic gta online christian prank i pick up one of my nicer cars and then drop it off to players who look like they need a ride this teaches newer players that not everyone is toxic i then proceed to explode the vehicle with a remote bomb this teaches new players not to trust a dodgy australian bird who's thirsty for content the legend jezzo arrives and now it's time to execute perhaps our greatest plan of all time we take our cargo bobs down to fort zancudo which translates in english to fort mosquito which is pretty weird when a mosquito sees a lady he tips his fedora and says hello malaria wow what a questionable joke don't forget to like and subscribe we then pick up some of the npc tanks which surprisingly doesn't get you in any trouble our plan is to fly them over the city and drop these tanks on players who have a wanted level it won't matter if they even have just a one star level because hypothetically the tanks will shoot them anyway as the law enforcement here is excessively violent immersive we find a mad lad causing a fuss on the highway and drop my stunning and brave npc tank down into the mix in one of gta's most gripping and even more immersive moments the tank abandons me almost immediately insert that abandonment joke that i've used like six times before but is still kind of funny because he actually left me we try again but this time with a new strategy why drop off the tanks why not just let them shoot enemy players as they magnificently hang below our choppers we locate a man called j suez who is in an active police chase oh my god light him up take away i'm about to i'm about to crash oh just now are you just shoving me why do i take light up tank dude my tank just shot something [ __ ] the wrong [ __ ] damn i'm good my take on him i'm still incredibly surprised that that actually worked artificial intelligence and man combined for brilliance also jay suez sent jazz a message apologizing for shooting us down when he realized what we were doing what a wholesome king our next plan involves the anti-aircraft gun which despite being one of the worst ways to spend 1.8 million dollars has been good for this video we figure if we can get the trailer onto the train we'd have an impressive war train more powerful than dom toretto with his entire family by his side i'm talking extended family cousins aunts that big-hearted uncle that always helps you get changed i try and jump the trailer multiple times because i figure it'll look cooler than using the cargo bob but eventually we can form which i feel says a lot about the current societal landscape what happened to freedom and choice why do our adult videos get put into categories what if i want to watch milf's place scrabble so i can fap while simultaneously growing my vocabulary and learn my way where's the category for that that's right there isn't one because humanity is trying to put us all in boxes at least running down the train looks kind of badass it kind of reminds me of the time me and the stealth boys ran a train on your mum this is my most immature video in years and despite sustaining multiple horrific injuries we eventually get the gun in place we then put 9 000 bounties on each other to attract players over and prepare for war the problem is no one comes to kill us i don't think these people realize the geneva convention doesn't apply to video games and time ticks on and i resort to doing something i'm not proud of i begin messaging every player in the city calling them unhydrated malaccas i'm well aware that this is one of the nastiest things you can say to someone but we're running out of options after 10 minutes not one response or attempt to kill us i implement stage two i begin sending messages taunting the other players using cringe tactics such as the capitalization of the term lol and an excessive amount of emojis still nothing we're basically just taking an extremely inefficient tour of the city right now i proceeded to enter baiting tactics stage 3 which is a stage i'm definitely not proud of but i'm getting desperate please try to get us it's for a video i have a million subscribers i'm officially a cringe youtuber as i attempt to use any clout i have to lure an opponent to the train then in a shocking turn of events lucidraven725 sends me a text message saying you're not real this guy really hitting me with the philosophical statements jesus we do multiple laps of the entire map as we're too stubborn to give up then like a stealth angel descending from the heavens a player rapidly approaches our position in a chopper oh it's a different guy it's a drago oh [ __ ] we spent almost two hours doing that to die instantly by a heat-seeking missile worth it maud the saucy minks flicks me a message saying that i've got another bounty target i actually do want to complete her bounty missions as the reward is pretty cool out of nowhere stealtho cabo arrives for a late but truly welcomed cameo he's got himself a stylish new outfit featuring a fedora sure fedoras are good for attracting women but not nearly as good as finding a girl who's into astrology and then texting her at exactly 2 22pm so she thinks it's a sign this legend called yeah boy 4009 rocks up to say hi and then cabo brutally murders him for no reason yeet boy will be missed dearly the first target i need to assassinate is way up north so we fly up there and i spot a crack den that i simply must purchase 165 thousand dollars well spent i'm sure that i'll make a lot of fantastic memories here with the boys such as this truly inspiring conversation we had regarding interior design especially coming back in anna and her sister trying to tell me i don't know about it though what yeah apparently actually i did hear about someone having a green splashback yeah i was like the [ __ ] cause they i thought they were joking when they were showing me these what's the splashback see the white tiles there bench like the white tiles below the cupboard that's like splashback all right what a strange conversation to be having in gta and cabo goes afk so he sees the opportunity i call lamar and order a mugger to come and take his cash you can actually watch the results unfold from the comfort of your crackdown's television we load into jezzo's stretch hummer and begin searching for the target i then look up and notice yeatboy has followed us all the way up here probably to get revenge the lads and i have never been so scared of a weaponless seaplane yet boy then crashes his aircraft and dies in what i can only assume is a show of dominance we find the target and i chase him down to the street but then jezzo cleans him up in his hummer one down two to go yeap boy pops up again with a mullet thicker than the extended version of the bible yet boy proceeds to shank stealth ocabo the lads log off out of respect to yeatboy but i'm committed to completing these bounty missions my next target is doing a little banking so i give her a yeep boy worthy shanking via a moped apparently you get more money if you deliver the bounty alive but the drop off point is really far away and thick man is a busy boy i make my way to the last target he too surrenders after being violently beaten he then hops on the back of my moped and tries to act like we're bros maybe he's heard about how i collaborated with the artificial intelligence earlier when we cargo bobbed those tanks and believes man and machine could be friends again amord lives really far away though so my hands are tied i head out to this island to find the chest and collect my reward a stone hatchet that rockstar put in gta online so they could promote red dead redemption 2. i get a notification saying if i get 25 kills with it i'll get the money so i begin slaughtering npcs if you string kills together you go into rampage mode and you go near immortal for a while i kill about 50 npcs but get no money so i move on to killing real players i instigate some sort of free-for-all axe fight but never get any cash i believe this is a metaphor for life where rockstar included an impossible challenge to help teach kids that they will always fail good parenting thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy
