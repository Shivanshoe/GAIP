[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoy this video please adopt several orphaned babies change their name to modest pelican and then manipulate them to take over several major nations as this really helps spread the good word of my channel meet thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories today we have quite a special video as i've been invited to compete in the grand theft auto meme olympics so before we get into heisting with the stealtho boys i need to go and win a gold medal i play on xbox and this will be taking place on the pc version of the game so i'll have to use thick man stunt double thick man from wish meet wish man a character i had to make in five minutes because i got the recording day confused i head down to the fancy clothing shop and put on my trademark in vogue speed dealer sunglasses and timeless red skinny tie this actually looks pretty authentic let's go and meet the other contestants i head towards the city and proceed to try and murder our first competitor to assert dominance he doesn't appreciate this and puts a bullet into my head lads and lasses meet tgg he'll be stiff competition as he's extremely talented however not that tough when he's afk think big work smart our second competitor comes from the netherlands and goes by the gamertag epic roblox master which i find highly amusing you just know he has loads of sex and his name is sunny evans sunny once took a holiday to the virgin islands and now they're just called the islands our third and final competitor is distinguished gta speedrunner dark viper au with a code that says i dabble in the pimp game and an intrinsic hunger for efficiency he's a true modern day powerhouse whoever wins three challengers first will be crowned champion i feel kind of bad as i'm posting this a couple of months before the real world summer olympics and those athletes train so hard and their achievements are going to feel relatively insignificant when they're completely overshadowed by what we're achieving here today also if this video hits 40 000 likes i'll do another gta online video next week as a lot of you have been asking for more sons of virgins content our first challenge is naturally jet ski jousting the first playoff round goes to sunny evans in a close fort battle with dark viper at least to leave a beautiful cobs now it's my turn to earn a spot in the final i'm gonna be real mad if you beat me in this dude yeah i won't lie i should win this statistically i should win this one my god who will take the sweet victory royale in one of my most proud gaming moments i managed to kill tgg with a keyboard and mouse using a mouse to aim really isn't my forte i once misclicked on p-hub and accidentally watched 45 minutes of my little pony tentacle hentai the final kicks off as sunny and i trade blows searching for that winning shot oh nice shot nice a great victory for sonny as he takes the lead i assume every dutch woman just ovulated the next challenge is one of courage strength and determination the first person who can parachute down find someone wearing a fedora and beat them to death with a baseball bat wins it's a beautiful challenge as it's deeply metaphorical we the guys with baseball bats resemble society and the person wearing a fedora resembles a person wearing a fedora two one good luck just kidding let's go i don't even have a parachute bro so you're doing better than me you don't have a parachute at all no oh i had a parachute and still died okay yeah the fedora yes i'm sorry lady let's go boys [ __ ] you guys the tjg emerges victorious and puts himself on the scoreboard like a boss well played and challenge 3 brings us to the summit of mount chiliad before we talk the rules we all beat up some hikers together even those engaged in fierce competition can bond over their hatred of people who wake up early and seize the day the first gamer to make it down the mountain on a bmx bike wins what kind of sorcery is this highlighting you don't watch my facts and glitches series i am oh wow i'm sorry i watch i've watched a lot of them with the boys i i just want to do this three two wow wow sunny saying wow instead of one completely catfished me but the lads decide it's a fair start i take an early lead mostly because of this misunderstanding this actually reminds me of when i was a teenager and i was pushing my sister around on a sketchy rope swing and she started to go way too high i thought she was yelling go jeff go when she was really yelling no jeff put me down you little [ __ ] she broke her wrist then i felt horrible she had to wear a cast to a year 12 formal and everyone called her stumpy how you doing man that was tough wasn't it that was tough sunny evans and dark viper battle it out as tgg and i take an honestly quite tranquil jog down the mountainside together eventually sunny comes out victorious putting himself just one challenge away from a win and desperately needing to get on the board i buckle in for the next event we'll be racing post-op vans across the entire map but you're allowed to shoot each other's vehicles okay this this is really not as like cool as i thought you see what we're doing here are you on the board yet are you [ __ ] wow you're the betrayal then wow not me i would never shoot another cheyenne in here and dark viper manages to take a prominent lead and with his skills of course he never gives it up some would say he won fair and square and is clearly a better player than me but i say it's just bad rng the challenge 5 is a game of hide and go seek and the perfect opportunity for me to finally get on the board the legend smitten turns off his map and goes into first person while we all hide somewhere in grove street now my strategy was to win but also block sunny evans from winning so i decide to shadow him he's found quite the spot and we are the last two left unfound the smitten quickly approaches and so i decide to attempt a pretty bold strategy there's no way he didn't see you just then dude no rex ellie wins [Laughter] finally on the board and it feels pretty great i think big work smart cryptocurrency and challenge six is a timeless classic i fight to the death on top of maizebank tower three well two oh one okay take into account sunny evans is on two points go it's animal cruelty am i the first to go my strategy was to keep a low profile and i ended up somehow going down first which is honestly just karma unfortunately dark viper's speed running strategies meant he defeated sunny and the games were still alive the challenge 7 is some family friendly skate shooting with no clay pigeon feature in gta smitten volunteers to beat the target by launching himself into the air on a motorbike somebody give this man a purple heart for his bravery you are so ugly mother's pelican hey this is the very this is this is thick man from where's your [ __ ] meet wish man oh that's a high one oh i really thought i had that oh sonny sonny congrats congrats thank you sonny evans the man the myth the legend emerges victorious and honestly he's really cracked well done mate his request is that we each pay him one sincere compliment you're the greatest dutch youtuber gta guy who happens to be here right now you have the ninth most fortnight earnings of anyone in the netherlands but i think you deserve the eighth most it's true sunny had the ninth highest fortnight earnings out of anyone in the netherlands but now he sits at 15th imagine not even being in the top ten what a peasant thank you gentlemen thank you was truly an honor and a pleasure a massive thanks to the lads that was so much fun what a bunch of legends now it's time to heist i head back to my xbox why does that make me sound like a 12 year old but yeah as i load in thick man is taking a phone call look how stylish he is if i could have used the real thick man in the meme olympics i probably could have won and just kidding the only point i got was from hide and go seek and i literally stole sonny's spot i was a glorified guest appearance at best i'm also still driving this minivan but i feel like my soccer mum days are over and it's time to upgrade the boys and i decide to all buy ocelot jugulars as they're heavily on sale at the moment but while we wait for them to be delivered i decide to repetitively murder stealth omanto he won't die though my boy is just built different there is no theory of evolution charles darwin was full of [ __ ] all creatures that are currently alive only exist because mato chooses not to make them extinct eventually our cars are delivered and i drop a cool half a mill doing it up the stealtho cabo the king arrives and now all the lads are together drifting their way to a better future it's kind of concerning how much time i spend committing vehicular manslaughter on this beach but before i had quit my day job my boss showed his wife one of my videos and i remember her absolute horror when i mowed people down with my supercar she looked up and said why would you do that jeff and so i took a sip of my chilled voss water looked her in the eyes like there were the windows to her soul and said like and subscribe and she did what a lovely woman after we spend way too long [ __ ] our pants over our new matching cars we decide to roll out we've barely gone a mile and english dave gives me a call he wants me to help find his chakra stone bracelet what kind of friend would i be if i said no we roll out and quite frankly these cars are the best purchase we've ever made this kind of reminds me of fast and the furious back when it was actually about street racing i can't wait for fast and the furious 10 to release later this year where the crew will travel to mars to defeat the avengers because family we arrive at the trailer park and get ready to kill some hippies thank god we had these cars otherwise i don't think we could have completed the mission hippie's biggest weakness has and always will be sick drifts this woman has a huge heart but is offering very little to the ongoing conflict this is why you only do drugs sometimes we retrieve the stones back and on the drive back even manage to capture some immaculate train footage i might write to the hub and see if they can start a new category for cinematic train shots as i feel we're really starting to push the envelope here i think this footage demonstrates that through perseverance friendship hard work and even more perseverance impossible truly is nothing jokes aside i'm unironically happy with this war ride train shot we deliver the hippie stones to english dave and get paid a cool 50k we then head over to my facility as it's time to heist first off is a cheeky heist prep where we have to steal a laptop i can't tell you how nice it is not to be driving that minivan everywhere as its top speed was lower than mato's girlfriend's standards we arrive at the house and commence the operation i lay down suppressing fire while mato picks the lockbox this kind of raw talent and operational chemistry is why we are currently the most sought after esports players on the oceanic circuit heist prep complete and next up we have to steal a futuristic tank from the us military i love the escalation of missions in gta games especially the single player i've been making a lot of content on san andreas and now gta 4 in the last year or so it's funny how the first few missions will tell you to get a haircut and maybe some takeaway food and then 45 minutes later you're stealing a jet pack from area 51 as panzer tanks swarm your position we destroy the army's equipment and locate the tank you've gotta love cabo's commitment to his work if the family can identify the body then what's the point i don't know much but i do know i want to buy myself a kanjali tank my grandpa who fought in world war ii once told me a joke about tanks he said how do you stop a russian tank you shoot the two soviets pushing it he then laughed to himself for about five minutes what a legend our next task is to retrieve a module from a fighter jet a cabo flies us close in his helicopter will i damage the jet to force it to make an emergency landing it's extremely fortunate that the pilot isn't aware of how fast jets can go he's also not very good at forced water landings as he dive bombs into the lake and proceeds to drown typically you either eject yourself or swim away afterwards but i guess this is what happens when you don't put 100 of the country's budget into military stop building schools and hospitals we need pilots who understand the core concept of jets we flee and it's honestly quite an epic escape a beaching boats as helicopters crash behind you will always be very cool prep complete i salute the lads for what they've achieved here today and then head over to the casino of course only entering after i beat the valet to death anyone who doesn't kill this guy is the real psychopath all in all a good day and next episode we will complete the heist and it will likely be quite magical thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy
