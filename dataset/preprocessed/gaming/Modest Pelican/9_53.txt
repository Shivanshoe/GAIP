[Music] hi lads and lasses modis pelican here with gta online if you enjoyed this video please make sure to start a war with a small african country and name it the war of www.youtube.com forward slash modest pelican as this really helps spread the good word of my channel meet thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so i spawn in my submarine because this is my home now i remember when i used to live on land like a peasant do you know who else lived the majority of their life on land the lower socioeconomic civilians during the middle ages also known as literal peasants the good news is i purchased the helicopter for the sub to maximize efficiency you see i wanted to make some cash to fund today's video so i did the perrico heist a few times on stream the three million dollars in the bank which is important as we've got some big plans today later on we're meeting up with another youtuber the act man and then buying our biggest and most impressive property yet first it's time to go and meet my boy stealth oh cabo on the beach hey well this is me and your girlfriend sometimes you guys ask what it's like behind the scenes and it's mostly just intellectual conversation where we push the constructs of society and try and get the tunnel like a boss ready for this so obviously i'm trying to become the most feared crime lord in los santos but i don't even have a supercar it's kind of pathetic that changes now and i proceeded to purchase the taipan for 1.98 million dollars which is being delivered to my property in the hills we arrive at the shitty land house that doesn't even submerge underwater or shoot torpedoes and cabo slides across the hood of his car it looks pretty cool i guess so i kill him because i want to be the cool relatable one in the group i then have a glass of fresh water but if you look closely it's actually edited have you ever watched the cartoons on tv in this game basically what's going on here is that this detective is reminiscing about the time he and his mexican friend burnt a man alive meanwhile his promiscuous receptionist is trying to get his attention with her dump truck a surprisingly compelling story arc but speaking of thickness look at my new car i didn't purchase this for its performance but rather it's impressive girth i modify it but i take way too long and stealtho cabo gets bored and goes afk i'm pretty impolite as i'm trying to exploit our friendship for content so i use this opportunity to perform a prank that you can enjoy with your whole family i didn't just buy this vehicle for a few cheap laughs though you see a man called sir donny commented on one of my videos saying you guys aren't a feared gang you're more like virgin guys who kill everyone and everything you see this comment really hurt me because he has both symbols in his name and an anime picture with a bowl cut so you know he's not playing it's time to prove to the likes of sir donnie why the sons of virgins are definitely and unironically the most feared gang in all of gta online and probably the real world too for example there's this mexican cartel known as the knights templar who forced their new members to eat a child's heart as part of their initiation it's pretty tough and messed up i guess but the boys and i make our new members pay their own xbox live gold subscriptions insane from now on this series is only going to focus on the most gruesome hectic gangster lifestyle you've ever seen but first though i want to go and enjoy a sunset with my bro because real bros appreciate the little things in life together and in the process make magical memories stealth oh cabo and i commenced the long drive to the summit of mount chiliad which is no joke but we get it done because we support each other emotionally we proceed to blow each other lots of little kisses it's a really cute and nourishing moment we then attempt to drift down the mountain and hit this jump which we do perfectly first time there's a jump oh no no oh jeez oh you hit it so well i missed it again okay now it's really time to be gangsters because i can't have a bowl-cut anime boy belittling the sons of virgin's identity it's time to focus on organized crime excessive gun violence and women to show how serious we are about this cabo and i agree that there will be no bro smooches for at least 45 minutes in fact we're going to go and visit some ladies of the night right now we drive over to sandy shores and locate a little snack but she doesn't seem up for it it might be because it's actually just some farmer enjoying a cigarette what a little tease i'd still hit the second attempt also goes pretty badly due to the fact i'm missing my passenger door gotta have a line i guess it's actually concerning how much of my channel's content is picking up hookers this is more than just casual intimacy though i'm testing stealthocabo's morals we get it done eventually and begin the elaborate exercise to see if the big man would have pre-marital relations oh wow wow we're exposed to sex why is my vehicle do that if he could try to help you i can't believe it either i've known this guy for years and he has the audacity to pull a stunt like that naturally i torch his car because it's no longer pure and to his credit he goes down with it which i think we can all respect edward j smith the captain of the titanic famously went down with his vessel but cabo's actions today quite frankly make edward look like a joke if cabo doesn't get his own three-hour movie about this i'm going to be visibly upset and likely cry myself to sleep of course i have to sell my own car for 1.27 million dollars now that i know it's dirty little secret it isn't hooker-proof unlike my bf club which has anti-hookah measures in place should i ever be tempted after all the upgrades i invested into the taipan that whole expedition set us back over a million dollars but it's a small price to pay for purity this car's also way more gangster so sir donnie you can choke on dee's nuts i might be getting a little personal here with donny but i do hope his family dies in a car accident i'm kidding i'm kidding just severe injuries while i wait for my boy the act man to get online which is an oxymoron i decide to play yet another prank on some of the los santos locals i notice two lads are going clothes shopping together and so i park out the front you see one of these guys names is code hazard yt so i guess he has a youtube channel too i proceeded to place bombs on their matching dirt bikes and then head inside this might look toxic but you've got to destroy the competition early i can't have every kid and his dog trying to get into content creation and so i proceed to do exactly what i have to do i feel like the ceo of robin hood welcome to capitalist i mean a communist free market of course i'm joking and we end up jet skiing around together and then chilling in the hot tub i get out though because i realise code hazard is probably a fortnight thing which means i'm chilling in a hot tub with miners this is great content anyway we've now clearly established how feared we are so i decide it's time i impart my knowledge meet the act man it's his first time playing gta online which is exciting my first inclination was to get an oppressor and just kill him over and over again with heat seeking missiles for an authentic experience but i decide to show kindness instead i'm going to teach actmen the ways of the streets i feel as if it's a rite of passage that the first thing he does is rob convenience stores this took multiple attempts but it was a good bonding experience all right it's up to you if you want to write money if you want to cap him or not i mean witnesses oh yeah okay [ __ ] my pistol has no ammo enter i don't think he knows that all right buddy i killed you once before don't make me kill you again why are they all at me well hello ethnic man all right wait no no wait where's my grenade launcher yeah that's right that's right buddy oh jesus what was that i don't know dude that was you wasn't it oh [ __ ] we got a chopper after us it's almost like they don't like domestic terrorism or something yeah if society wasn't scared of us before they definitely are now it's time to increase the stakes and sell some narcotics to emotionally charged teams first i drive over to my motorcycle clubhouse so that we can determine who the better human is of course i win which definitely has nothing to do with the fact my account is a way higher level than his with a better strength stat i'm like a russian olympian but instead of steroid abuse i just never go outside did you choose their outfits or something i didn't no this is this generic outfit oh my god it's perverse but it gets the job done in a sexy way inviting act man on to then just have him help sell my product somehow seems unethical but humble hustlers never sleep i also love how my organization takes the subtle approach by delivering our fresh organic produce via low-flying helicopters in broad daylight we finish up and pocket a cool 385 thousand dollars but at the workplace it's important to have fun to help build a sense of harmony amongst the team so we commence a helicopter death match oh [ __ ] yes damn it all right you won i wasn't down action knows the way to my heart posing people down until they die from excessive water intake it wouldn't be a proper introduction to gta if we didn't head down to the casino and engage in a little light-hearted gambling after losing a bunch of money we solved the problem with one easy trick that doctors don't want you to know a goodbye act man and for real it was great fun playing with you my dude given that we were surprisingly productive and earn some good cash i decided to invest into something i've been wanting to buy for a long time first though i purchased the luxurious and on sale lucerus for 390 000 to fill that supercar sized hole in my heart i decide to go down to the drains and get a nice rustic shot of it in the sunset it honestly looks a lot like the car i purchased earlier minus the hooker residue as i'm capturing some truly inspiring footage i notice an npc is sitting down here with impeccable posture and a pair of beats headphones on she's not homeless or anything she's just chosen to perch down here which just doesn't make a lot of sense i proceed to beat her to death as i don't like weird [ __ ] with the new car sorted it's time to make a big move it's time thick man had his own underground facility as it'll open a lot of doors for us i log on and purchase one located out near the wind farm sadly i don't have the extra cash to splash out on an orbital cannon but that will most definitely be a future upgrade i guess we're now surrounded by a whole lot of renewable energy i have no idea why but i've always really liked the wind farm area of this map it's pleasant to look at this is a huge addition to our enterprise as it'll offer us more jobs we can buy military aircraft and most importantly look how big this space is i estimate this area to be about 75 times as big as my basement if i can hypothetically fit seven small kids in my basement then this could easily hold upwards of 500. the possibilities are endless it's also got a whole lot of features that i'm really excited about we've got the perfectly recreated modest pelican logo we've got this guy who runs the weapons workshop and who i'm also pretty sure is that hooker from sandy shores way to move up in the world champ we've got a lot more of these logos which makes me happy i guess i've even got two receptionists which is living large there's one that i want to have wild post-marital sexual encounters with and then there's this blonde chick obviously i really broke the bank with this purchase so i couldn't upgrade the staff rekro i'm pretty sure they forced captured prisoners of war to sit on seats like this then there's this guy who's busy watching a modest pelican stream on twitch i bet he gets all the ladies that's for sure so yeah this is an exciting moment for the sons of virgins and i look forward to properly checking this place out with the boys soon if you enjoyed this video please press like it raises my serotonin levels thanks for watching you legends and until next time stay classy
