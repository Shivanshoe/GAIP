[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with GTA online if you enjoyed this video please become a wedding cake maker but instead of writing congratulations in icing simply write subscribe to modest Pelican or every guest at this wedding will be deported as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in Los Santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so I wake up on my expensive yacht I then head to the bathroom so I can have a quick shower on my yacht did I mention I own a yacht it cost millions so I bring it up frequently I also have a dollar sign tattoo on my chest so that the women I pretend to sleep with know I'm the kind of guy who plays minecraft on hardcore mode with the lights off well dimmed but still let's go meet the boys boys boys and also some of the non boys also known as girls they tell me they're slipping into something more comfortable which I can only assume is tracksuit pants or a dinner suit or something but just wow this is inappropriate content for my educational Christian music YouTube channel in fact they could take a leaf out of stealth au robos book evade put on shirts so that we can all maintain a shred of purity and then Robo shoots me with the shotgun for simple no one calls me a simp and so I gunned him down as he leaves the clothing store I then send a message to my mum saying that I hate her a break up with my girlfriend of five years and kick my female cat in the jaw to further prove your boy is no simp okay well maybe add simple a little bit for my mates Delvaux motto but simple amongst your bros is extremely progressive which is what we're all about here a robo wants to pick up his four-wheel drive so I fly us over to his mansion in war zones commercial pilots have to perform special combat landings where they descend in a rushed corkscrew fashion to avoid being shot down by our page I decide to try this out and it goes pretty well a motto then has to choose to either ride with me or with sexy Robbie and he sure does make his bed so I hope he's ready to sleep in it you think he knows someone and then they ditch you to simpler other male friend dubiously posing as a female in an online game all this simple is honestly getting quite confusing let's move forward unfortunately my car is quite a lot faster so I beat them to the casino and set up a little trap it's never not funny for me destroying Robbie's four-wheel drive because it's his pride and joy a plus he always forgets how to make insurance claims and ends up with nothing to drive with Maddie and Kayla looking ready for Sunday service we get ready to spin the big wheel the grand prize today is the deluxe oh and I've never actually won anything good from there so today could be my moment I spend expecting to get some RP or a t-shirt that says your YouTube channel is trash or something but no I get the car which I'm extremely pleased about motto spins and almost gets the car but instead it lands on our pay which is the equivalent of expecting a little baby boy or girl but instead having a miscarriage and Kayla's spin lands on clothing and I think I speak for my entire community when I say I sure hope it's a pair of pants all right so this is my deluxe oh and it might not look like much but I'm told it has a little trick up its sleeve I love that this car released years ago and I'm acting like I'm uncovering some new secret vehicle but yeah this little mama Zito flies it's cool how it comes looking like the car from Back to the Future as well I Drive near Robbie and he explodes me with a rocket launcher dude that's so lame who goes around destroying their friend's personal vehicles anyway it's a sick vehicle and would have cost me over 4 million dollars to buy so a huge win but it doesn't come with any upgrades to realize the true potential I need to add homing missiles and to add homing missiles I need to either have a special workshop which costs 1 million dollars or a vehicle workshop in a mobile operation center or Avenger that each cost a lot of cash look in summary I'm sort of regret buying the yacht I was bragging about earlier this guy from last video was actually nice enough to point out my poor financial decisions WTF this clown has a yacht and no companies is the reason of recession to add to our troubles rubber has decided he is going to aggressively hunt me down because I exploited his baby despite his hostility it's time to make some dough Amato has a nine thousand dollar bounty on him and very kindly says I can kill him and take it as I am mentally preparing to literally trade a human life for cash Kayla steals the kill this is why you can't trust the lemon a Valentine with lingerie and then when you relax they'll take your money and then shoot all of your Bros in the head I know I'm stereotyping here but facts all women will eventually shoot your friends and you in the head with a gun all females are literally mass murderers I may be speaking a little bit out of jealousy here as they both have fully upgraded deluxe OHS and I don't but but seriously I'd recommend wearing a Kevlar vest from the first date onwards fellas all right our next money-making scheme is some good old-fashioned assassinations right up thick man's le Marteau jumps in with me as he'll need to be my gunman because the whole know rockets dilemma we've got a flying car yet is still shooting a submachine gun out the window it's a truly strange operation I don't really know what comes over me but I then accidentally get out of the car mid chase falling three or four meters to the ground unless a man would have broken bones but I'm fine motto then glides off into the distance as if this was a metaphor for life of floating forwards with no control in no direction his eyes wide shut hard but flaccid eating but hungry yeah what anyway we passed the mission and pocket a cool $20,000 I think I speak for both of us when I say motto and my shoulders are sore from carrying the team if we hadn't put a few shots on that heavily armored SUV and then tactically pulled away I don't think any of the other four targets would have gone down the best thing about having the deluxe though is now when I go to my office and land on the helipad on the top of the building I know technically I'm not a helicopter but it's 20/20 read a book it's time for employee performance reviews and up first is the big man himself he makes me wait as he drinks a glass of whiskey mater's away which is disrespectful but also very alpha I let him know that I'm still harboring some negative feelings after he chose to commute with Robo and not me earlier however it was honorable offering to sacrifice himself so I could take the nine thousand dollar bounty unfortunately due to the recent epidemic and necessary staff cuts I'll be putting him on probation until further notice I guess I've just self declared myself as the boss but I do have the BBC a big black chair so I mean no one can argue with that logic motto then wants to set up a funny moment where he Falls past the window while I'm sitting here unfortunately he jumps past the wrong window and so it looks like I'm just sitting here enjoying the outlook quality content alright we need to bring in big money and fast a rock star have a promotion where if you complete ten daily challenges you get $1,000,000 you can only do three a day so damn them and their effective marketing techniques the first daily challenge is to mod my car so I paint it red I like the color red because it implies I'm a dangerous guy and girls love danger almost as much as they love murdering all of the homies the second challenge is to escape a three star wanted level again a pretty easy one except as well as having Robbie continually try to kill me motto is also pretty disgruntled after his performance review he keeps trying to burn me alive the third challenge is completing a casino heist and look it takes our group about 11 years to finish them so I think I'll hard pass on that one chief I feel like the crew needs a little smoke oh break so we decide to eat some peyote plants and turn into animals I turn into an eagle which is frankly insulting as the only option should be pelicans I then proceeded to fly into a wall and immediately died upon impact we ate some more plants and this time I become a wolf amato becomes a rabbit and he kind of thick though no joke I'm all some dodgy malakas for fun and then one of them starts kicking me and mato doesn't help so I have to take on a 2v1 as a bunny rabbit the only thing he can do is scratch his tiny ears aka nothing this is an accurate representation of us playing was owned together robo then announces he's coming over to hunt us all down I tried to flee but forget everything I know about road safety and get cleaned up anyway I don't think this is a very balanced hunt but at least robos having a good time I guess a girl on guy pretending to be girl action it simply doesn't get any hotter he then pulls out a shotgun which is kind of cheap and slays Maddy then he comes after me as he's still mad especially because we still haven't told him how to make an insurance claim and break times over we need cash we make a truce but then as he approaches my vehicle he pulls out a pump-action shotgun but like a moped angel razorclaw mm knocks Robo over giving me just enough time to take him out he's still after me you've got to admire the passion we make the stunning and brave switch to a public session so we can sell some cargo I've got to say even without the Rockets the deluxe oh sure does make traversing Los Santos easy motto says that he'll drive the van as he has experienced abducting I mean driving vans for whatever reason normal people drive bands for let's be honest though if you own a van you've probably abducted at least one person otherwise what's the point this server is starting to get a little cracked but no one is destroying us for some reason so we'll take that w and now we have to sell the stolen cargo and this time at least we have an armored truck Robo says he's coming in hot to destroy us all and so we prepare for his raid as we need to ensure the deliveries go smoothly he then rides in on a motorbike and shoots a quarter of a submachine-gun mag into three inches of steel armor plating and then crashes into some traffic this man is the Terminator I swear to God a delivery complete and $100,000 richer so finally we're making some actual cash all of a sudden some shots get fired a few players died and the server goes full-blown GTA online you can't stay alive for more than a few moments and the frames drop lower than robo standards I just start throwing explosives everywhere to help fuel the chaos because I guess that's just my nature we then decide we best escape by playing some of the random minigames rockstar has there's actually so many games the first up we try our hand at a little aerial combat even here Robo is out to get solely me I guess everyone has a trigger and his trigger is that four-wheel drive my god we then play some horror style game where we took turns hunting each other with shotguns as the player being hunted you could however beat the guy with the shotgun to death with a torch which really turned the tables all these minigames were fun and made us some cash but next episode we've really got to step up the money making as I want to buy a facility and most of all and get rockets for my deluxe oh I do modify it a little bit just for aesthetics and I do love how I can fly back to my yacht at the end of the day it feels dare I say wholesome and thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy you
