welcome to far cry 2. you start the game in a taxi as you make your way deep into the harsh african climate there's a civil war going on between the various political and rebel factions and we've been sent here to eliminate a notorious international arms dealer the only thing that would make this worse is if we were dying from malaria which we are don't worry this game makes having a life-threatening tropical disease fun for the whole family my boy really isn't doing too well and he proceeds to pass out in the taxi they probably should have sent someone with a stronger immune system i awake several hours later and there's some malacca waving a machete in my face which honestly isn't the nicest way to wake up he could have brought me a latte or something i then pass out for a second time right in front of the cool machete guy which is embarrassing as he's the arms dealer i'm here to kill wow i finally wake up for real and the soldiers everywhere balls deep in a civil war i immediately get distracted by a glowing ammunition box which i think says a lot about my attention span i run from the town in an unlikely escape as bullets fly in every direction i then proceed to pass out for a third time not ideal for a war zone i'm rescued by this militia leader and he's like i saved you so you work for me now he gives me loads of weapons and i gear up ready for my first mission my first mission is fixing his car this is a little anticlimactic as he just gave me an rpg which would imply a huge explosions not changing oil still i impressively fixed the entire car via tightening one bolt mission two is getting myself a place to live which sounds good i don't think this is where i want to raise my kids but having somewhere to lie down when the shaking chills hit would be welcomed it's also a lot easier to get into the property market here than it is in australia haters say war is bad but now we have a gorgeous little forest hut inside we've got the og casting couch a stretcher that screams lower back pain and this really harmonic industrial light that gives the entire cabin an unpleasant fluorescent white glow my new boss calls and tells me to go and clear out a lumber yard for him now stealth in this game is incredibly difficult to pull off some would say realistic as your enemies have basic situational awareness my attempted stealth operation goes pretty badly but we do get to see the healing animations i've been shot like 20 times but at least we got one bullet out baby steps i kill the last of the enemies and then free the prisoner his name is warren and he has a red bandanaron which reminds me a lot of this guy he's now apparently my best friend i proceeded to make peace with those who lost their lives on the battlefield and then test to see if red barrels explode when you shoot them they do which is great but so do yellow barrels and i'm not too sure how to feel about that i drive back to my new boss and he's like wow you're alive i honestly thought that was a suicide mission and glad to see he values the precious gift of human life look at the face his bodyguard gives me on the way out i've never felt so judged in my entire life i get paid in diamonds which is a huge relief as i imagine inflation is a real problem here i use my diamonds to buy a shotgun ironically i probably indirectly bought it from that arms dealer i'm meant to kill i guess you've got to support local businesses i figure we've achieved a lot today and so i head down to the bar to get a cold one the bar reminds me of 3am when all the girls have gone home and it's just three dudes depressingly standing around pretending this isn't the highlight of their week even warren's here and he's like i got your back bro thanks warren this other guy is called paul and he's apparently my second best buddy he also has my back but i'm not sure about paul he seems like a bit of a dick he's way too smiley plus who wears a sweater in africa anyway i need to get the malaria medication i head to the biggest town in the area and ask a local priest if he has any meds and he's like sure here you go sport he then asks if i know where the child soldiers hang out and i quickly leave now i need work so i head over to the ufl base which is one of the political factions of course by political faction i mean a group of morally bankrupt opportunists well actually that's pretty similar to australia but a job's a job they even pay me in advance which seems naive my objective is to go and kill a bunch of militia that have set up a base of operations in the desert warren says that he's got a genius plan so i drive to where he's hiding and then realize i was followed here speaking of poor situational awareness i've just shown the rebels warren's address sorry buddy i walk inside and the big girl's doing sit-ups shredding for the civil war i suppose but his plan sucks so i just go on without him warren's ideas were far too complicated plus now i have a shotgun i'm ready for the large open space combat that desert brings the place is crawling with tangos i engage and god this game slaps so hard it's different from the other far crys there's limited fast travel and the enemies and world are harsher a fair few years ago i got badly injured playing football and had to get a knee reconstruction and this was the game i played the entire time i just sat there in a cast making maps in the map editor it was somehow so good mission complete warren calls and he's all grumpy that i didn't go with his plan maybe he should cry me a river so he can hydrate all the people of africa i'm not too impressed with the shotgun so i figure it's time for an upgrade to get better weapons you have to complete missions for the local weapon dealers i feel like we're really starting to blur the lines of why we're even in africa in the first place i'm asked to destroy a convoy transporting a shipment of weaponry on my way there i stopped to clear an outpost but i misjudged the situation and while trying to flee i'm tragically gunned down as i bleed out a face appears and someone begins to save me as i fade in and out of consciousness i notice that it's paul from the bar this man who i didn't even like has come here and risked his life to save mine not all angels have wings some have shitty little grey sweaters i must admit i did not see this coming but the sad truth is i can't have people thinking i'm weak what if he runs his mouth and so i proceeded to quite brutally murder paul when you're a mercenary in a foreign country your reputation is everything and i can't risk earning slightly less diamonds due to village gossip i destroy the convoy from a sensibly safe distance with my rpg and now we can buy better guns like this sniper rifle and silence pistol we are ready i head back to the ceasefire zone and i decide this time to get a job from the other political faction playing both sides is an alpha move and i don't foresee anything going wrong should they find out plus these guys have a way better headquarters they have beds so that their staff can take naps these guys make google look like a slave labor camp my new mission is to assassinate the police chief warren calls to pitch me another one of his famous strategies i figure i better do it this time as my friendship group has already halved after paul's accident i meet him and the man is doing even more sit-ups he tells me his plan and then gets back down there to keep working out every day is core day i guess so the police chief usually cruises around in a convoy warren reckons if i steal the officer's diary where he's written down all of the bribes he's ever taken the police chief will panic and go back to the police station and be a sitting duck and glossing over the fact that he idiotically wrote down all of the bribes the plan seems way harder than just hitting the convoy still here i am trying to steal the diary like the good friend i am but plus i'm 100 sure warren would never turn against me for money i can't keep splashing around like a magic carp so it's time to make a move i pull out my silence pistol and pop gun boots in the head and to no one's surprise this completely blows my cover i whip out my sniper rifle and start popping heads here's a 2012 international superstar dubstep sniper montage for you to enjoy [Music] i approach this lad and gently ask him where the book is and he tells me and surely he heard the shooting and dubstep and yet chose to relax in here weird given he didn't lie to me and he's unarmed i can't just kill him and so i decide to give him a warrior's death a 360 no scope with embarrassingly low sensitivity i make my way to the police station but my character isn't exactly the fittest he's more of a pack a day smoker whose emphysema gets triggered every time he jogs 15 meters unfortunately the sniper purchase proved to be a good one as i can now pick off soldiers with ease i approach the chief but then get distracted by an explosion outside giving him a moment to draw his gun pretty unprofessional for a hit man but it all worked out in the end while still being shot at warren calls and asks if i can come and save him this guy calls more than my girlfriend and roman bellick put together he's in huge trouble it's almost as if exhausting yourself by doing a billion sit-ups doesn't help much in gunfights he's hurt bad and then a message pops up saying that i can kill him if i want to he's not a horse and it's not fun if the game encourages unnecessary murder so i save his life warren lives on but i guess it's rest day from sit ups what a lazy piece of [ __ ] i head to the gun shop and buy some ieds at this point i'm single handedly propping up the african underground economy but there's a reason i bought this you see the best way to hit convoys is to set a trap and that's exactly what i'm going to do i get the details from this trustworthy looking individual and roll out back when i figured out this method when i was younger i thought i was the next steve jobs i might not have taken school very seriously but should i ever find myself working as a mercenary in a failed state i'm chilling it's so satisfying watching it all play out and now i can buy even better guns more specifically a flamethrower remember how we have malaria well it still hasn't gone away so i head back to the main town you're not meant to shoot here so i just hold out an ied wherever i go so the soldiers know i get mad puss i talk to the priest again and he says if i take these travel documents to some refugees they'll probably give me some medication on the drive it rains and so i bless the reins down in africa wow i suck but now i do need to save these refugees and get them out of the country safely so what's the best way to save prisoners you're exactly right burn the entire compound to the ground i proceed to start a massive fire trapping my enemies like rats the fire in this game is absolutely insane but i have made one small miscalculation the wind is blowing towards me and i'm now trapped and will likely burn alive by some miracle i slip away and kill the remaining soldiers who are distracted by the burning tree i don't blame them it's impressive i head to where the refugees are locked down and they're not even being kept as prisoners they're just chilling in here they could have come and helped and like what was the long-term plan here what would they have done if i hadn't shown up i make the trade and look at how the malaria is affecting these guys i'm out there starting bushfires and fixing cars while they sit in a broom closet like harry potter don't let your malaria define you i do really want to use fire effectively in at least one encounter and so i get another mission this time the objective is to destroy a train cart that is transporting oil before approaching i test the wind conditions there may have been a better way to do this as i can only imagine africa didn't need another bushfire i sneak around the back of the rail yard and start lighting everything up now beauty is subjective but this planning and strategy is likely going to get me hired by the navy seals as the fire ravages the southern side of the yard i attack from the north in a move i'm going to call the pincer maneuver and crazy no one's ever thought of doing this before now wait until i show you guys the flank and the surround maneuvers it's going to revolutionize modern combat if you enjoyed this content i appreciate it when you leave a like what a sick game i think this is my favorite far cry although it's very close with far cry 3. i hope you guys are doing great i love you long time [Music]
