[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican herewith Red Dead online if you enjoy this video please become a hostage negotiator but rather than negotiating the hostages release use your megaphone to tell the large group of civilians who gathered around to subscribe to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel ah Red Dead Redemption online it's like GTA online but instead of being killed by everyone you come across you only get killed by about 25% of the people you come across wholesome anyway I just enjoyed a big glass of what I thought was flavored water but turned out to be concentrated scented bleach so let's get on with it before my stomach dissolves also how cute is my dog I have no follow-up for this I just really like my dog so yeah today Maddie and I want to max upgrade the moonshine business so we can make some real cash on our way there I accidentally trampled this guy called ghost 85-84 he's pretty chill about it and seems to be having a deathmatch with his other dodgy Malaka wow that's a bit sadistic there champ at yeah eventually blondie gets one up on him and then in an unexpected turn of events points the revolver at me and pulls the trigger I have a little roll where I do my best not to shoot first but if you kill me well have you ever seen one of reilly raids educational videos in this scenario I'm all eight of the black guys after I'm done killing this kid I'm going to find out where he lives and then go to his house and ask his mother out on a date we're going to have a really beautiful evening together at a tasteful restaurant and then after about six months I'll ask her to marry me now as his stepdad I'll bond with this kid until one day in an incredibly touching and emotional moment he refers to me as his father then I'm going to leave and never come back Lowell cop that you didn't think it would happen twice in your life did you you little scrub anyway as usual I've become distracted from the task at hand let's moon some shine so basically my manager Maggie has quite an aggressive business strategy where we just kill all of our competition any police officer who tries to interfere and often many helpless civilians we've organized a meeting with our two biggest competitors and to setting up a little trap where we plan to burn them alive really struggling to see how we're the good guys here but anyway yet we proceed to burn them all alive but also ourselves in the panic and confusion I quickly ask Maddie if she could please send me a photo of her feet and she respectfully declines Wow I sent her a photo of my fate every day for three months and she won't even send one in return this conclusively proves that the wage gap is a myth I take down old mate and then capture the other big bopper alive which might be the most humane thing we've ever done and can I get a holy heck yeah in the chat and to actually get the max upgrades I need to be level 10 though so we've got to do a few more missions this reminds me of my time in Nam of course I was in Vietnam in 2017 on vacation 42 years after the war had finished yeah so the two a group I was with really didn't like me because of you know the multiple public stabbings of both needing em oh we ride over two roads to stock up we come across another player who seems chill and friendly and it's these moments that remind you just how wholesome the community really is and just kidding I get shot by a guy called agent rockstar 25 he tries to hit and run but I think he underestimates just how far out of my way I'm willing to go to get revenge the big girl thinks he can kill me and then just go and do a mission like nothing happened not today puppy I used to work at this restaurant when I was studying and the manager hated me for no good reason he used to always make me clean the bathrooms repetitively and docked my pay and I never knew why one day he calls me and asks me to cover a shift but I'm like yo I'm pretty high I don't think I can work he says it's fine and to come in anyway so I do and then he fires me for coming to work hi absolutely jebaited it was a trick within two days I got a job at a new cafe ten metres away from the old place just across a paved walkway I was the barista and from the coffee machine I could see right into his entire restaurant it was a big venue with like 300 seats so I used to wait for him to be far away from the restaurants phone and then call but hang up before he could ever get there this dodgy melaka would be walking back and forth all day swearing his little head off he'd wait by the phone for ten minutes and then the second he walked away BAM I'd call again when I had my brakes I used to sit outside just munching my breakfast burrito smiling at him one day our eyes locked and he had this moment of realization that it had been me calling this entire time he rushed straight over to the cafe right past me and said to my new manager do you know I fired him for coming to work hi as she replied and said yeah who do you think he bought the weed from a jayjay too easy anyway as you can see Mady and I are busy doing moonshine missions this is one of the rare less violent scenarios where we are simply knocking them unconscious rather than you know burning anyone to death I perhaps get a little too enthusiastic and start beating up a civilian I don't know how but there is always excessive collateral damage Maddy proceeds to beat up a female civilian which is good because equality is important no demographic will go unbeaten I'm almost level 10 but there are no available missions so I decide to brew up a batch of shine to sell old mate is intoxicated on shift again I should really fire him in 30 minutes to produce and this time I'm going to flavor the moonshine so I don't lose money like last video progress this is the perfect time to fulfill my dream of stealing one of the motor boats from the docks the some people want to be the Prime Minister some people want to cure cancer I want to steal a boat in a video game and debatably that takes more courage than anything I also want to say thank you for the support on the channel it's always been really insane but recently it's gone to a whole new level we had 6,000 new subscribers in one day last week every now and then I step back and assess what I'm doing like right now narrating driving boats while sounding like the illegitimate love child of Australian Google Translate and David Attenborough it's the definition of questionable content seriously though thank you legends anyway Maddie has to go in a hurry but she's still in the game so I just decide that she's coming with me anyway this happy little adventure suddenly got kind of a seedy vibe as she's now just lying there tied up on my boat I'm not going to let a little unintentional BDSM ruin the fun though as I want to get this rig up a river I just made myself a cup of tea and I swear to god the steam from this boat looks better than the steam from my actual kettle in the kitchen Maddie then times out as it's been 15 minutes wow I'm going to be honest now that I'm driving this boat by myself up the river it seems kind of depressing also that posture can't be good for his back then my prayers are answered and old mate stealth Oh Robo tells me he wants to meet up he says he's just upstream it's taken me a good 30 minutes to get this boat here but then someone throws a Molotov at my baby as they're riding past it's really not looking good chief of being burnt alive is one of those things that is enjoyable to do to people but not great when it's being done to you then in one of the most inspirational gaming moments of 2020 despite being burnt and shot at the boat still works this is a great metaphor no matter how many times someone tries to burn you with a Molotov you will always be able to go upstream like a salmon I should copyright that it might be the most intelligent thing anyone's ever said anyway Robbo climbs aboard and he's a female in this game as well as in Grand Theft Auto I'm starting to think he's an online predator and then he gets shot in the head and moments later I beached the boat but the stream was getting shallow so it was bound to happen at some point wow what a fun wacky boat adventure let's go sell some moonshine we stopped by st. Denis for supplies and come across one of our mates which is a pretty big coincidence he then proceeds to gun Robbo down for no reason and up into the night we need new friends and robo needs to stop getting shot in the head he then drowns some guy who stole his horse we destroy another rivals moonshine still and then come across a player by the name of happy killer 4:52 he's actually a really supportive subscriber of ours and a real legend so naturally we attack him and try to destroy his wagons you see every country has its own traditions in Indonesia the people who live on the island of Bali spend New Year's Day in complete silence meditating in Australia we are polite to those we don't know and a simply horrible [ __ ] to those we love the most it's a pretty beautiful tradition alright at long last it's time to sell a little shine I'll be selling to Ginny Bates and unfortunately I've made a few enemies today so this could be dicey I don't know why I so aggressively whip these horses it's pretty unnecessary like women's rights wow I'm kidding and to my 7.5 percent female demographic I'll roast the men back so it's even men are bad at giving birth to babies ok I'm almost at Big Joe Ginny's house but a road block is in the way with many government agents standing guard the game suggests I pull up and let them check the cargo which was hugely questionable advice I don't know what I was expecting but there's clearly just a lot of moonshine back there I make it to Ginny's house and pocket a call $82.50 Lillian whiting once said to be rich in friends is to be poor in nothing but screw that we're rich in actual money you can't pay a homeless person ten friends for a cheeky wristy you know what I'm saying I kill a few more revenue agents and finally we are a ranked 10 moonshiner what a feeling I head back to my moonshine Shack to unlock the last upgrade but to my utter disappointment you have to buy the medium upgrade first it costs eight hundred and twenty-five dollars the lesson here is that being a moonshiner is the hardest job in the world I'd rather be the chief operational engineer at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant than a Red Dead online moon China in the words of Jane Austen ain't no such thing as tricks and hoes just unlock the last upgrade for your business next time Jeff I hope you legends are doing well thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel through patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
