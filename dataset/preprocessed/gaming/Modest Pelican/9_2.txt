i joined this modded city called nopixel where they've made it as close to real life as possible this is my character karthik manuel or thick man for sure he combines the heart of a lion with the appearance of an overly affectionate step dad i recently bought myself a new truck which i'm awfully pleased about would you guys like to go on a date with me i'm talking sorry that's uh that's my truck over there now would you like to go on a date with me um i i'm sorry i don't date gold diggers cause i am the baddest of them all i'm still poor however so i need to make money fast i load into my apartment bold and primed as i head outside i come across a woman called barbara i then proceed to do something that i'm not proud of i become the perfect gentleman what's your name ah cuff don't tell me i'm gonna call you baldi all right i can live with baldi uh you get that yo what you don't have to do that that's cool i was nice to someone and they gave me a thousand dollars i'm sure there's a lesson here but there's no time to learn it as i need to get a job i also keep fading in and out of consciousness which obviously isn't great it's likely because i'm living on the poverty line and nearing starvation as i can't get a job as a sponsor child i do the next best thing i unite with this hoodlum and begin my journey as a dodo delivery driver driving large commercial vehicles in my condition can only lead to good vibes drift king they call me it's not glamorous but it's honest work can we make a cool sixteen hundred dollars my partner even gave me a joint so i smoke it to try and fix my medical issues but if anything it just makes them worse it's time to stop the 420 and accept that jesus is plenty i head over to my favorite uw cafe and the police are here just keeping the streets safe i pay my taxes on my little dodo delivery income yet bodies still litter the pavement given i'm knocking on death's door i treat myself to a deluxe combo meal they even kindly throw in a medical pack so i don't drop dead in their venue i guess they draw the line at corpses inside the building i give myself first aid everything thick man does looks incredibly seedy i love it i finish off my kawahi curry and on the way out i give this cat a little pat this is a rule they enforce which i think we can all appreciate as i drive away from the morgue i see a gorgeous older woman looking like a snack in the burger shot car park last time i approached a girl i pocketed a thousand dollars so i decided to shoot my shot again would you like to go on a date with me i'm drunk oh this is inappropriate yeah what kind of creep ass is the girl on a date oh she's this this kind of crap she collapsed mid pickup attempt she keeled over and then my words literally killed her like the video if you would go on a date with karthik manuel i don't dwell on this low point for long and instead i network i meet this couple on a dirt bike who ask if i want to go fishing with them of course i agree as if i can catch a big fish then i can update my dating profile picture we have to take separate cars because we only have two seaters that's okay as i'm just hungry to catch myself a 600 pound indo-pacific blue marlin the sun's rising and in my opinion it's metaphorical this is a new start for karthik manuel to prove he's more than just a grandma killer the worst possible thing then happens you see my truck i nicknamed shaniqua doesn't exactly hug the road like the chief f1 ferrari engineer isn't calling me up and asking for downforce tips and tricks i completely lose control of the big girl and we just go flying off the side of a relatively massive cliff face my most expensive asset is now bathing in the ocean old karthik has seen better days but at least it's surely up from here you need to live hey bro hey thank you that'd be great man i'm just heading up to the shops really close [Laughter] the dodgy malacca locked the door and then snort laughed at me maybe one of the most alpha things i've witnessed in recent times i reached the shop and immediately attempt to buy a firearm i'm unable to do so because i don't have a gun licence which apparently i need to obtain from a judge it's officially easier to get guns in real life america than virtual america no but i understand why they have to be careful giving out weapons for example if i had a glock in my back pocket i would have double tapped that grandma for rejecting karthik's fine arts not really sure what to do in this situation i decided to just say g'day to two upstanding citizens what do you guys do with yourself accountants accountants i can tell [Laughter] tax accountants you're the vice president of the accountants uh sure we'll go with that this guy damien who honestly might be the best person i've met decides to give me a job he also gives me a lock pick so that i can steal a car because due to unavoidable circumstances mine is unavailable as you would have already guessed damian isn't in the finance industry rather he's the vice president of a motorcycle gang called the sinister souls he asked me to drive down to a tool shop so that i could purchase something truly horrific for the gang he asked me to buy a metal detector and a gardening trowel my new mission is to walk around the beach looking for scrap metal my character looks like he is 100 trying to take photos of sunbathers then out of nowhere i find a diamond in the rough i dig up a gold rolex which could just be my ticket into damian's good graces now all we can do is hope the man likes having his wrist ice cold i message asking where he is and while i wait i head over to my now regular spot to the uwu cafe aka corp city this adorable cat tea room makes 1942 stalingrad look like a gated community what's going on big nuts hey mate how are you of course you got some big nuts yeah i appreciate you noticing how can i not you don't squat 80 for eight to not wear short shorts oh look scott and i decide to consummate our bromance by heading over to the casino and trying our luck at 250 for a membership and then i lose all my money on the spinning wheel and god gambling can ruin your life quickly speaking of i'd like to thank today's video sponsor pelibet only really really smart people gamble scott loses money too and then just sort of stands there in shock for a long time so i have to sadly leave him as damien's ready to meet to compound our issue my stolen car got stolen while i was inside so i have to steal another one except my lock pick isn't good enough for luxury classed cars unless you were gassed up on adderall i couldn't find a vehicle anywhere but then i found something that was less than ideal this is not my first choice as it's definitely strange meeting the vice president of a gang in a commercial truck that says good aides on the side the first impressions are important and i can't help but feel like i'm fumbling the back and to make matters worse i misjudged the height of this sign those low clearance heights sure know how to kick a man when he's down i drive around looking for damian and then eventually he texts me saying yeah i think i saw you in the box truck trying to enter the plaza i was hoping you missed that i got i've got a gift for you man yeah what's that i'll just put in the glove box for you it's my grandfather's rolex [Music] you can keep this you don't want it uh i'm good he rejected my gift and then my microphone arm setup started collapsing in real life really advanced screwdrivers you know literally and figuratively everything is rapidly falling apart for your boy then in a moment of pure chad damien extends an olive branch okay so here's a question you wanna you wanna do like some uh damian you want me to kill someone i'll kill someone bro i got you okay no no no no no not kill someone he didn't want me to kill anyone but hot damn was i ready to damien decides to show me the ropes of being a criminal which is absolutely perfect when karthik was a little bold kid he didn't lie awake at night imagining his life as a dodo delivery driver he introduces me to this npc who tells me which houses i need to rob he then helps me find a suitable van for burglaries and sets me on my way to start hitting houses the key thing he's looking for is a strong rope that we can use to pull atm machines off the wall earlier today we were rolling off the side of a cliff and now we're completing an apprenticeship in organized crime i leave the nest and exactly 26 seconds later this happens [Music] is it karthik manuel catholic manuel yeah yes sir it's uh it's indian uh that's my mates vehicle what's your mate's name uh his name is barrett you got his phone number by chance i can call and just make sure you know that he knows that you busted out the window off his vehicle um he doesn't he doesn't believe in phones he's more of a he's like off technology it's actually quite beautiful the big dog let me off with a speeding ticket which i'll take as a win given the stolen van and my intentions with it the problem now is that i'm no longer broke i'm in debt i feel like the only person we can blame for this is scott curse you scott you handsome devil i arrive at the final property and it's an apartment complex with more doors than the monsters inc incorporated factory i look everywhere but i can't find the unit i meant to break into i thought cops or gangs would be the issue not logistically locating the residents but that's just the kind of curveball a life of crime throws at you eventually i find a house and break in i start rummaging through the cabinets and it's super nostalgic of grand theft auto san andreas in this very first house i find the exact piece of rope damien needs i also find a muffin and a joint and so i decide to treat myself one day i'll be doing this in a house that i actually own i wouldn't say i took to the burglary life like a pelican to water but i got it done and just casually stealing bronze marble sculptures it's all good i head down to the pawn shop excited to make bank and it's closed i probably should have checked that was open earlier this is alarming as i put all my eggs in the cat burglar basket and now i'm starting to starve to death again i head down to burger's shot to get a meal he's hot thank you it's really sweet of you no i'm sorry i wasn't talking about you sir who are you talking about oh you talk about that guy you think he's hotter than i am hey hey he's got a hair for one and one of those rolled jeans hey here's my number honey i'm not eating here i refuse to eat here i caused the scene so that i could desperately take the food and leave without paying but she was two steps ahead and never put my order on the tray she's good at her job and hurting my feelings there's no time to eat as damian has asked me to meet him at the beach so he can get down to business i initially misunderstood his meeting place and ended up having a gang point a sawn off shotgun at my face unfortunately they were really chill and let me go about my day i go and meet damien at the super secret meeting place and he's like bro can you metal detect this beach i wouldn't have guessed that metal detecting would play such a big part in today's video my first activity with the sinister souls is not what i expected but it's surprisingly wholesome we're all out looking for a safe cracker for this atm job damien then asks me to keep looking while they handle something else but i'm knocking on death's door all i've had to eat in three days is that tiny muffin in what i can only assume is the no pixel version of becoming a stripper i drive back to dodo prime deliveries and find a partner to do a shift with i think it hurts more because dodo is the lowest rank in my discord server and people frequently use it as a derogatory insult you're looking for a tour ah yeah yeah i'll join you the underpaid backbone of this economy as we're finishing up our shift damien cole saying they're ready to meet and tells me where to meet them yeah so next to the casino there is yes i just stopped to death at the steering wheel with my poor homie helplessly in the passenger seat [Laughter] see you later i just kidding hold on my colleague picked me up drove me to hospital and as soon as i get discharged i begin sprinting to the casino to meet damien i really don't want to tell him the reason i'm so late is because i died while delivering packages as my lockpicks are all broken i have to run there it's not ideal as i get close i notice on the job app that my delivery partner has completed the shift and i get paid just in case saving my life wasn't enough he got me that bread too what a king i meet damien give him the rope and then we hang out at the clubhouse for a moment and this man is really sticking his neck out for me which makes the next part even sadder you see i realized that if i just killed damian now i can take his stuff and run away a richer man no i'm kidding i love this guy i could never we do go and get some takeaway food while we wait for the rest of the sinister souls to show up to damian this was a delicious greasy meal but to me it was absolutely saving my life as apparently the hospitals don't feed their patients we proceed to have one of those really good chats that can only happen when you're sitting in a car like this for some reason it was now time to hit an atm and two more members of the sinister souls hop in with us tokyo and dakota and we all roll out to find a machine to hit it's safe to say that cruising in a stolen suv with an established motorcycle gang is way better than dodo delivery driving we get in position should i stay in here so that i'm like literally a passenger as well very bad time to tell you that i'm an undercover police officer oh damn well i guess i gotta put you out if the police come i'll just hope they like rolexes more than damien we pulled the atm off the wall and just like that i've officially completed the coolest thing i've done in nopixel the tokyo then holds the entire machine in his hands and hacks into it this is why you never skip leg day the atm machine only had a thousand dollars in it so we got unlucky but we've learned a lot today we experienced our first death we made new friends we became a victim of gambling thanks to evil scott and we had a few cheap laughs along the way and next time we're making some serious cash though as i want to buy a new house and most importantly i want to completely deck out my truck if you enjoyed this video hit like i love you and goodbye [Music] bye
