the master chief is one of gaming's most iconic heroes raised and trained from childhood to be a super soldier who can effortlessly flip tanks although sometimes he struggles to control recoil don't overthink it his combat record speaks for itself meaning his legacy could never be tarnished because he's just that halo infinite's campaign slaps this bearded malacca finds you drifting through space he's like thank god you're alive chief can you help me get home so i can see my family no you see the chief wants to go and kill thousands of aliens which is way cooler than cringe family i immediately board a covenant ship and begin murdering a lot of grunts as they realise they're doomed they begin pleading for their lives and killing a surrendering tiny alien in cold blood welcome to halo infinite war crimes i continue through the sea of enemies fighting my way forward it reminds me of halo 1's first mission and i'm a sucker for nostalgia i just want video game companies to change absolutely nothing while also being fresh and innovative it's not hard i press this button and destroy the ship fingers crossed there wasn't any human prisoners on board i guess okay let's skip forward to the juicy part also leave a like if you drink water we've decided to land on this new halo ring this alien force known as the banished want to destroy the human race using the ring's weapons i actually kind of respect that as it's an ambitious yet achievable goal murdering extraterrestrials however has never been this fun and it's all going super well until a grunt sticks me with a plasma grenade and that's how the master chief died imagine how many alien that grunt is going to get when word gets out about this i secure the base and take in the huge open world that nobody asked for but is actually cool the bearded malacca then has some kind of mental breakdown about missing his kid's childhood or some bs but we gloss over that because the chief wants to go on an adventure the game suggests i take down an outpost but instead i kill some small birds with embarrassing accuracy the human race really puts too much faith in me but as you know i have my own agenda death to all avian creatures that aren't pelicans i climb to the top of this mountain using my grappling hook which is surprisingly the best thing they've added from the summit i spot a camp and if there's one thing i hate it's campers get it i assault the campsite throwing my entire arsenal of grenades and then realised there are marines tied up as hostages this is alarming for two reasons firstly i just threw a bunch of explosives at friendlies and second this covenant species takes prisoners of war if you remember back to when i savagely executed that three-foot grunt we begin to realize that maybe we're kind of the bad guys thank christ the geneva convention doesn't apply out here i continue forward but then realize these marine prisoners are following me around do you know how stressful this is i always get overly attached to the marines and then they always die so now at some point i'm going to have to go through all six stages of grief when i'm meant to be enjoying myself despite this new emotional baggage i clear some outpost and now we can use it to drop off vehicles and weapons i ask sad beardboy to drop us off something spicy and he delivers a bloody mongoose i was kind of hoping for a warthog or scorpion tank i mean there's five of us and we're trying to save the world and the big girl thought a quad bike would turn the tide of war i honestly hope he never gets reunited with his family we pull up on some covenant factory and i guess jailbait over here isn't familiar with the element of surprise he just straight up fires plasma everywhere what a great plan and now the factory has gone into lockdown imagine a spartan saves you from being an alien captive not just any spartan but the master chief himself a legend an enigma and you're with him in the flesh and you decide hey i think i might have better military instinct than this green robot and you proceed to fire an alien weapon you can barely hold from like 50 yards away at a grunt without checking in first i wish i had that much confidence i destroy the factory which is great all the marines proceed to die horrible violent deaths one by one which is less great but i do find a tank so we can end on a high classic happy sandwich technique my next mission is to assassinate an elite general who's apparently a pretty big deal i somewhat hypocritically fire a bunch of rockets at him from a distance but it's okay when i do it because i'm the master chief [Music] the actual target's invisible so i tactically take the high ground and begin butchering his many guards it's all going swimmingly until i make a small situational awareness error and fall off the edge of the ring as you can imagine this is not the position you want to be in forgive this analogy but master chief kind of looks like a poo that won't flush absolutely not the image you want your enemies to see mid-assassination attempt i managed to get back to flat ground and kill the notorious elite using heavy grenade spam which is becoming a real crutch for me we've got bigger fish to fry however you see the covenant have a special facility where they torture their prisoners maybe they're not as ethical as we first thought as this facility would make stalin jealous this is like the hilton hotel of suffering if i was going to be tortured anywhere i'd honestly want it to be here because if my pain threshold is going to be tested it might as well be in an architecturally impressive building i hope whoever designed this structure won some kind of alien award there are more marine prisoners here but i decide not to save them as the second i do i swear they're going to die i imagine that's a real morale blow for the lads but i can't win this war and babysit a bunch of highly trained military personnel i reversed the facility's security lockdown using the advanced ai that lives in my head and talks to me constantly sounds a lot like schizophrenia but i'm 70 sure it's not this new ai isn't as thick as the old one called katana in halo 4 katana was straight up sexy i don't care what you say she had no business being that thick i take the gravity lift into the belly of the beast ready to shut this horror show down for good we immediately find spartan armor which means one of my comrades is likely being interrogated at this very moment far worse there's not a lot of natural light in here wouldn't have hurt to put a few windows in potentially north facing like i get it they're going for the whole scary vibe but at least have a break room with a view for the staff these aliens are pure evil i find the main boss here and he's like look at me i can do a little twelve my spartan brother is also here so obviously we'll need to save him we fight for a while but eventually i just grappling hook the big bopper and take him down i then proceed to violate his corpse for a while as revenge for all the nasty things this elite has done to my kind and probably not a great use of my time as my boy is barely clinging to life i go over and there's this emotional cut scene as other spartans are the closest thing the master chief has to family either way this guy better not have snitched or told the elite anything valuable or i'm gonna tell everyone he thinks the halo 3 assault rifle is a valid weapon choice as per usual every potential ally we could have had is dead again and i'm running solo then i hear a distress signal from a group of marines not too far from my position a chance at redemption a chance to finally successfully complete a rescue mission i locate the squad and fight waves of covenant by myself as the marines sit around comparing star signs or something equally unproductive we survive and it looks like my friends have been here for a while living in a cave they've got little beds set up and plenty of rations of pork ribs and cornbread spinach feta and quiche taco pizza and bread sticks these soldiers are stranded on some ancient forerunner ring planet being constantly harassed by vitamin d hating aliens and yet they're still somehow eating better than i am in real life at least i know my gunner is well nourished the man's been dirty bulking for months the boys and i do work together driving through an alien facility in our warthog making memories it's a brutal fight but we win and even more surprisingly some of the marines actually survive the battle it's a christmas miracle it's like a scene from a movie as we drive off from our huge win the sun rises and then i roll the warthog which is quite embarrassing as i'm meant to be a leader these spinach feta munching lads look up to me in fact it's so embarrassing they leave me no choice but to ensure no one ever finds out that i can't drive for these marines just won't give up neither will we i continue moving through the map slaughtering aliens you can use the grappling hook to latch onto vehicles and then jack them it's genuinely surprising how much a simple mechanic can so greatly improve the basic combat loop i'm no review channel but the core combat in this game both single player and multiplayer is really good now it's time to stop the tomfoolery and sort out the big halo issues there's an excavation mining site that we need to go and stop because i guess the master chief hates the natural resource industry he's probably the only person who hates minecraft youtubers because they love mining diamond and iron ore and not because they groom children gotta have a code the weird thing is the site is completely empty i'm ready to throw down but the covenant have all gone on smoko i guess i whip out katana from wish and she's like oh my god it's a trap and they fire a huge laser cannon right at us unfortunately master chief is able to lethargically jog to the side and foil their plan no wonder they're struggling to make progress here they just got an entire work site to leave for god knows how many days just so they could elaborately ambush me i'm no foreman but that does not sound cost-effective especially because i kill them all and now they have no stuff i go to turn off the drill but then a big brute is like nah and then kind of giggles or cute like he's actually a tough little malacca but he obviously hasn't heard about my grappling hook and i take the high ground he then proceeds to stick me with a plasma grenade and the human race is now doomed forever i do eventually kill him and i love that the boss fights are a bit of a challenge and unique do you remember in halo 5 how you just fought the same big ass water on eternal over and over again then for the final fight they were like hey we've got something exciting for you three warden eternals it was almost a self-aware meme i enter the mines and thank god they put waypoints for me as i would never know which way to go if they hadn't like here in this tunnel i was so close to making a wrong turn but fortunately there was an easy to follow indicator i find another dead spartan in the mine and it's kind of getting a bit awkward like i don't want to seem disrespectful or anything but get good kid we're meant to be badasses not corpses i gently touch their shoulder which is probably the most action master chief has ever had nice i keep fighting forward finding more dead spartans every step of the way we need to get revenge and so i decide to hunt down two high-ranking brutes to send a message they're hanging out in what's quickly becoming a pelican graveyard for anyone who doesn't know halo pelicans are the main transport ship the humans use despite not having any practical correlation to my game attack it still fills me with anger i adopt a stunning and dare i say brave tactic of hiding far away and continuously head-shotting tovorus with my br from safety now i don't often get into gaming lore on my channel but in this instance i will so the covenants speak an advanced dialect of sangheli and if you translate toveris into english we discover that the brute's name is actually little boy his buddy hyperus turned out to be more of a challenge but eventually i defeat him and his crew this is a huge victory and really sends a message to the banished forces they may have killed a hundred spartans already with seemingly relative ease but maybe they won't get me a beard boy is impressed with our efforts and he gets all emotional he looks into the chief's eyes and says brother may i please go home and see my family it's been years no i love this campaign it just goes to show that if you release a game that is finished and good people will be happy if you enjoyed this video leave a like thanks for watching i love you [Music]
