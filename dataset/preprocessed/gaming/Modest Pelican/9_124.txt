[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with real life if you enjoyed this content please adopt a baby teach it to walk and as soon as it can walk tattoo my channel logo on its forehead and then have it stroll around public places as this really helps spread the good word of my channel do you guys know the recent war movie 1917 well it was all filmed in one take or at least perceived that way so I thought it would be cool to film this entire vlog in a single take and say yeah firstly we are now at 500,000 subscribers which is just insane to me and from the bottom of my heart I just want to say thank you the thinking back to the beginning when I was just some novice making questionable gaming content all the way to now we're through hard work dedication and focused personal growth I'm still a novice making questionable gaming content but now with half a million subscribers [ __ ] that wasn't very modest but I just love you guys and I can't believe this has happened so I've got some very special things planned for today I guess it's been like three and a half years now since I started this channel and I thought it would be cool to take you through how it's gone down since day one it'll be like story time with modest Pelican but with the hint of narcissism as it's me talking all about me no look one of my og fans gave me the suggestion so I thought you know what I'll do it first though I need to clear up some rumors that are going around I don't usually like getting involved in YouTube drama but there's been some pretty controversial fake news happening and I think it's on me to step up and lay down the law all these fake people think they know how to make the perfect glass of water but today I'm going to show these dodgy malakas how to really do it via a low-budget cooking segment welcome to cooking on camera with Pelle where the only thing we don't cook on camera is men today we'll be cooking up a nice glass of water the traditional way the first up you're going to want to fill up a glass with water from the tap a best to make sure the tap is on cold and next you're going to want to filter the water if you don't have an actual water filter you can always repurpose a sieve which will completely remove any bacteria after this you'll want to boil the water just like you were boiling up a lobster but without the lobster you'll then want to blend the boiling water you'll want to be careful here as if any of the water splashes out he'll scorch your skin and might get a second-degree burn next you'll want to phrase the boiled blended water this will take about four to six hours so you can use this time to sit down somewhere quiet and read a historical fiction novel or think about how disappointed your family is in you once frozen you'll want to sit the glass of water out to defrost but it's crucial it is defrosted by a natural light for example the Sun or a supernova you'll then want to garnish your water with a lemon wedge one fresh strawberry and some cucumber then drink away I'm kidding today we are cooking unadulterated sinful liquid away and repeat steps one through six now you'll have a pure glass of fresh h2o so that you can stay happy and hydrated thanks for joining us today and remember cooking is easy when you know how the drinking water started as a meme became a dead meme and is now an important aspect of my channel the circle of life now though I want to take you back to the very beginning the year is 2016 and I hadn't been online gaming much due to crappy internet I was living in a share house near my University mostly just drinking heavily but it wasn't alcoholism because I was a student one day I managed to fix the internet and started playing the battlefield 1 beta which I absolutely loved with the game about to officially launch I decided to create a battlefield YouTube channel as well as something I always wanted to do as so my first ever video was uploaded to the channel and it was an incredibly below average montage I used to clap cheeks back on Halo 3 and Call of Duty but after a 3 year online gaming hiatus I sucked I also used a mainstream song and so the video got copy struct immediately my old gamertag wasn't even modest to Pelican it was just jeff GH the GH being my initials and so it read Jeff Jeff and then my surname I made the account when I was 10 years old and it would seem I didn't understand the basic naming conventions with 5 days after this groundbreaking montage I uploaded my second video and this one even had some commentary hi guys modest Pelican here I've got a video of me going on a 60 kill spree and the heavy tank this is a very different playstyle than I normally adopt especially this video was simply me abusing the overpowered heavy tank and going on a 61 kill streak quality content for several more videos I remained a dead serious tips and tricks channel it was honestly a great fit if you ignored the fact that I was completely bullshitting just about everything I said but then one video I decided to add a little spice at the end if you enjoyed the video please like comment subscribe and send ariana grande pictures if you did it this moment would surprisingly go on to influence my content more than just about anything looking back through the comments it's incredibly nostalgic as I see the names of so many og legends but the common theme was that they mostly enjoyed the outro two and a half minutes of pro epic game of tips yet most people subscribed because I suggested photographing their junk and sending the photo to grande it was at this moment I realized my niche sexual-harassment no I'm kidding but for real battlefield one was popping off back in the day and there were so many content creators all doing the exact same thing and to be honest most were doing the tips tricks and weapons guides way better than I could it took me quite a few videos to realize but eventually it became clear that being a sarcastic monotone to dodge amalaki was my angles so I went balls deep I made videos pretending that the new DLC was McDonald's buildings and that you could become a fry cook instead of a scout or support player I did my best to incorporate jokes wherever I could this means if you miss a shot you'll have to wait 2.3 seconds to reload or more technically as long as I lost in the bedroom my content was far from perfect but people appreciated that I was having a crack and this change helped me reach 1,000 subscribers I still remember being so happy and humbled that I had a community of that science honestly it's the exact same feeling I have right now it was at this point that everything really changed I uploaded a video 9 types of battlefield 1 players and surprisingly it went viral it amassed 750,000 views and gaming Facebook pages were sharing it everywhere it kicked off an entire era for this channel really helping me start to build a larger community most every day after work or university I'd play battlefield 1 with my friends so I'm still best mates with today the stealth Oh boys the same guys who I play with and are in all my videos now are the same guys I was playing with back then we all met online gaming and we started hanging out all the time in real life it's a legendary group except for stealth our motto no one really likes him so yeah every week I'd make a three or four-minute scuffed battlefield video using the footage captured and it was really just a hobby I was passionate about I never thought it would be a career I just loved making these short videos and interacting with you I did start to blend in other games like tugçe Rainbow six agency of thieves but battlefield 1 was undoubtedly the backbone of this channel it was a legendary era and when I look back on with fondness eventually though and after making over 100 videos on the game I felt it was time to move on it's still one of my favorite games of all time but I've made every video I could possibly think of of the assault support medic and scout class in a nutshell the things noobs do things try hards do does battlefield to make you better in bed most hated Maps camp is in a nutshell most memorable handguns meme tactics the bloody call me daddy challenge where I'd kill people and then message them saying I am your daddy I really had done every concept I could think of and so when Red Dead Redemption 2 launched I decided to aggressively branch out it was instantly so refreshing making videos on new games at the time I was really nervous that you would feel let down with this shift in content but the reaction was the total opposite not only was my existing community hyped to see the fresh videos the channel started to grow at a rate I never thought possible I gradually began to recognize the position I was lucky enough to be in I had you guys who were just getting around and supporting any video I made and for the first time in my life I realized it could maybe be my full-time job and finally I could stop selling weed to preschoolers and focus on videos it was a good time to realize this too because parents were starting to ask questions anyway I either had to take a huge financial risk and go full-time with YouTube with about a hundred thousand subscribers I'll focus on my career in finance just have YouTube as a hobby where I posted when I could for fun this was probably the biggest yelled a moment of my life but I decided to go for it I don't want to sound like a broken record but I just love making videos and I love this community so I sent it on top of this I had backing from those who support me through patreon and still do without this I could never have taken the risk I remember when I told my girlfriend I was going full-time YouTube and in the words of Jesus she was not a happy melaka anyway leaving my job gave me the time to make content and also lead a healthy lifestyle and because of this I guess the channel began to really grow in the last 12 months which is about as long as I've been doing this full-time now we've gained four hundred and forty thousand new subscribers which I can barely wrap my head around making suns of virgins videos read dead hit man literally any game to be honest is so rewarding I spend about an hour after every upload just reading and replying to comments and your support blows my mind so yeah thank you you absolute legends for watching videos and being a part of this I guess the moral is if any of you have a dream or just want to try something out I can honestly say don't bother it will fail and now kidding of course you should just go for it is there someone you romantically like but haven't approached send that risky nude are you wanting to bake a lasagna but too scared it will burn bake that lasagna are you wanting to become a doctor well pay the $200,000 study debt and spent eight years of your life getting that stethoscope are you a virgin well good make sure it stays that way until you're married have you always dreamt of eating Coco Pops of Emily Ratajkowski lower back dimples well then get your ass to the cereal aisle and make your dreams come true I really don't know how to wrap up a video like this so I guess I'll just let Jeff from 2016 take the wheel if you enjoyed the video please like comment subscribe and send ariana grande pictures if you did now look one of my AG fans [Music]
