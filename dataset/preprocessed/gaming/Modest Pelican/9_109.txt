[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with stranded in the day where you get stranded in the day if you know what I mean if you enjoyed this video please go and say a movie and then in the most tense moment lean forward and scream my channel name directly into the ear of the person in front of you as this really helps spread the good word of my channel okay first I have to pick a character I pick this guy because he is a human representation of clinical depression and given everyone is trapped at home at the moment I feel it'll be relatable for my audience it seems like I'm in a private jet using the best laptop from 1985 but there's an empty water glass so good work staying hydrated they're bigger unfortunately my plane begins crashing into the Pacific Ocean but at least the pilot is staying remarkably relaxed how good as Annie's but yeah as far as situations go this is not ideal I lose consciousness and wake up in this survival raft near an exotic island with one objective survive this short tutorial teaches me a few basics like how to build tools harvest plant fibers kill fierce oceanic Island beasts start a wholesome campfire and most importantly build a crib to bring virtual babes back - it doesn't look like there's many other humans around let alone babes so we might end up making sweet love to a sea cucumber but hey at least I can eat it after I'm finished I rest up and get ready for day two a night time is really dark but I decide I want to find a new Island to inhabit as staying on the tutorial island is like being 30 years old and still living in your parents basement I mean how selfish can you be if you're occupying that space where are they meant to store the children they abduct anyway I wrote to my new life and in the distance I can see what looks like a cargo ship so I start paddling it's actually pretty sensational seeing the Sun rise out here but unfortunately I forgot to consider heatstroke and starvation and ironically dehydration of which I'm suffering from all of them I decide to head to a closer Island to recharge and hopefully find myself spiritually this new island is very similar to the previous ones but it looks like someone else try to survive here and it looks like they died LOL get rekt scrub i make myself some fresh coconut drinks which are good for thirst and hold many antioxidants which reduce the risk of heart disease during later adulthood not that important given i'm rapidly dying of heat stroke but still a healthy outside starts from the inside i also managed to find a jerrycan of petrol in a crash to boat which should be good for sniffing i mean good for powering internal combustion engines i cook up some more crab meat and set up a camp but in turn i also begin to learn the concept of this game you say these small islands have barely any resources on them so there's this constant pressure to scavenge i however want to set up a sustainable base somewhere to try and stabilize my health i find some rations on board the raft which come in pretty clutch i proceeded to eat them all because i'm a little piggy delicious but not strategic it's now time for the voyage towards the big cargo ship to see what mysteries it may hold did that sound cool i'm trying to build up some mind-blowing immersion here and frankly i think i'm doing a 4 out of 10 job it's a thick boy there's no doubt about that and it should hopefully be filled with resources also the water itself is quite dangerous as there's sharks and sea snakes everywhere in fact these two sharks are literally inside each other let's be real for a second shark erotica is way hotter than a sea cucumber fetish I don't know if I could set up a base here as there's no trees or plants as I explore the ship further it actually becomes apparent that there's nothing of use here at all which is more unexpected than when one of the lads sent a dick pic to the group chat by accident but then said it wasn't an accident finally at the very top I find a plane that needs repairing and could be our way of escaping this predicament I also get tempted to send it and find myself facing the age-old dilemma but do I take the stairs down for survival or send it into shark-infested water for the lads and lasses obviously I couldn't jump just kidding I take risks and I'm a bad boy every time I have sex I don't use protection and then I get a tattoo of a naked girl on me straight afterwards I currently have no tattoos on my body but still my intentions are savage as I'm about to leave a storm rolls in and normally I assume a stranded lad such as myself would wait it out but that's a luxury I can't afford right now I try not to feel regretful about my past but I simply shouldn't have eaten all the rations I'm also literally and metaphorically thirsty right now a bit hey at least I don't have sunstroke soap ending drowning in this storm could be worse it then gets dark so yeah it got worse unfortunately the storm passes and I arrive at land and there's another shipwreck I better try and loot this thing for food or anything really as I'm on the ropes here I don't find food but I find engine parts and some leather so I guess I could like make a pair of trendy dress shoes and look good while I'm dying as I'm about to Beach the raft a tiger shark knocks me into the water so I panic and swim for land geezers but at least I'm not sick I guess just kidding a snake that I didn't see bites my face and I'm now poisoned alright so new year new me I've got a small camp set up and this island is far bigger so yeah it should be a good place to call home for a while I wonder how quickly I died if I was marooned on an island in real life I suppose it would depend on how many people were trapped with me if there were say three of us I'll act all friendly at first but then on the first night boom cannibalism you see I'm an okay guy in small doses but after a week of the other two hearing my questionable penis jokes I know they're going to eat me first I don't want to be to be one so I just get in early and killem eat them before cannibalism was even a topic of conversation in business this is called being an early adapter and separates industry leaders from those who become irrelevant or you know become food anyway my camp is coming along quite nicely and my vitals are starting to stabilize but then unfortunately the snake bites me yet again wow that's a huge mistake I can't believe I just forgot about that dodgy reptilian melaka I managed to construct a water still so I can now gather fresh h2o but unfortunately I'm still rapidly dying from a double dose of poison I need to find some medication ASAP so I enter the ocean to explore the shipwreck I find everything but medication from binoculars two lanterns but unfortunately the poison gets me and I die and I think also simultaneously drown a modest pelican survival game mastermind the shelter's you construct allow you to save your game but I accidentally tactically strategically saved the game at a point where I'm about eight minutes from dying of poison I discover you can craft an antidote using papai plants and there are none on this island so in one of the most stunning and brave gaming moments of 2020 I set off in my raft once again to a neighboring island by what I can only assume is divine intervention from God himself as a way of thanking me for educating the good people of YouTube via this Christian music channel I find the two Popeye plants needed and craft the much needed antidote my health is scary low but at least I can live out another day just kidding all this time finding the cure has made me severely dehydrated I attempt to drink several coconuts but keep getting diarrhea which makes me more dehydrated and eventually I die from this I go back to my checkpoint but I also sometimes die from crabs biting me I'm that weak it's not looking good chief I'm in an endless cycle of reloading my game and then dying just like Kim jong-un died yesterday so I'll have to restart and that reference isn't funny and I don't even know if he's actually even dead poor Kim Ebro all he wanted to be was a supreme dictator and have a few dozen new killer weapons but apparently that's not kosher all right whatever I accept my death and yes I may have lost everything but in death I've gained the most powerful weapon of all knowledge if anyone ever points an ak-47 at your face simply flex your knowledge for the wind start rattling off facts about the shaft tailed Finch and I'll be so overwhelmed they'll shoot themselves in the head instead okay round two and this time instead of seeing a big ship and just heading straight there I'll focus a bit more on survival I think the reason I've been so addicted to this is because there's always constant pressure you see actually setting up and becoming completely self-sufficient is hard you have to always move locations some smaller plants grow back but if you chop down the trees and collect the rocks the island becomes completely depleted it's almost as if these islands are a metaphor for what humans are doing in the real world a just kidding the planet can go itself modest Pelican gaming is sponsored by big business if Greta tunberg shouts me and the boys a round of beers though I'll change my tune you see the subliminal messaging in my videos can literally be bought by the highest bidder because that's what being an online influencer is all about I find tortures hammers and even a flare gun which I shoot up into the air in the hope that someone comes to save me but no one shows up it's my year 12 formal all over again I decide that the yellow raft is old news and proceeded to begin construction on a new raft that I eloquently named boaty mcboatface the plan for this boat is to be faster bigger and be able to carry supplies so I can rule the land and the seas I dream of to being a dictator just like the late kim jeong-hoon after many hours of scavenging and building I create a boat that isn't actually able to stand up so yeah pretty disappointing after many more hours I get it standing and I'm ready for its maiden voyage and a maiden voyage it is as I sail out into the sunset once again the rudder is on the wrong side but honestly if I have to gather another plant fibre I'll probably swim out into the ocean with the intention of being eaten by a shark or drowning just like the Asian tourists visiting Australia I reach another island and this will be where I set up the best base the Pacific Ocean has ever seen feeling optimistic and excited I proceed to get bitten by a snake and poisoned again because I couldn't see in the dark I genuinely want to KMS I eventually do bounce back and build myself a little beach shack of sorts not exactly the best base ever seen but it's well it's something so yeah if you ignore the fact that I'm currently starving to death I think I have a real handle on stranded day obviously it's not for everyone but I love survival games and wanted to bring you something a bit different the stranded deep really makes you feel like you're the one getting diarrhea and dying of poison anyway I hope you're all doing well you guys are genuinely such legends thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who have bought the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
