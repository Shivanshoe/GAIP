[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with fallout 4. if you enjoy this video please hack into people's wireless headphones and blast the audio from my videos until their ears bleed as this really helps spread the good word of my channel so welcome to boston in the year 2077. tensions are high because the united states and china are close to all-out nuclear conflict and it's yeah just like real life i guess this is my housekeeper robot and his name's codsworth i don't know why he has a circular saw on one of his arms that seems like an oddly specific power tool this is the laundry room but every time i try to interact with anything my character says she'll leave it for codsworth wow of course leave all the washing to the male robot who can't even touch himself because he's got a circular saw for a hand didn't know i was playing as a bigot honestly this is a broken family my husband doesn't even look me in the eyes when he speaks thank god the doorbell rings and it's a vault-tec salesman who confirms we've got a place in an underground vault should the worst happen all of a sudden i hear crying and jesus apparently i'm also a mother how old is too old to terminate a pregnancy let's find out i head to the master bedroom and grab a pillow off the bed no no i'm kidding i'm a great mum i even spin this rocket mobile for the little malacca suddenly a news report comes on and confirms that the nukes have been fired which you know isn't great the silver lining though we could accidentally leave the baby behind but know my husband is apparently trying to win father of the year alright we've gotta move quickly to ensure we don't miss our spot i tried to trip over this little nerdy kid in the red hat to slim down the herd but he's quick on his feet i instead put the burners on and absolutely destroy the competition on the outside track the difference between them and me is that i take cardio seriously and also that i won't be getting cancer from exposure to high levels of radiation thank god i made it just in time sucks about red hat kid and of course my adoring family oh wait they're here too which is just cream on the cake all of a sudden there's a blinding flash of light a huge explosion and the ground begins to shake i fully appreciate the seriousness of this situation but if any of my team members on clash of clans use this as an excuse to miss their attacks in today's battle i'm so kicking them out that was a close call mrs whitfield proceeds to ask if the others who didn't make it are okay yeah i'm sure they're fine mrs whitfield i'm sure that when the uranium atoms inside of the missile were bombarded with neutrons causing a chain reaction which released all of the energy at once triggering a gigantic explosion which you literally just saw with your own eyes like five seconds ago it didn't cause any harm at all i'm sure they're all fine and dandy mrs whitfield you [ __ ] genius alright so we obviously didn't get boston's best and brightest down here but i say it's time to move on we'll start a new life for ourselves in this bunker it'll be nice the doctors guide us to these cryo chambers like it's halo the weapon here isn't master chief though it's dad ass and yes i did use mods to make it look like she had an unhealthy obsession with squatting so apparently these pods decontaminate us but no the doctors bamboozled everyone and put us all into a deep frozen sleep science who knows how long i was out for but suddenly i find myself unfrozen it's kind of like the movie frozen except instead of an inspirational story about a disney princess coming of age and harnessing her powers my husband is murdered and my infant child is taken by a strange man at least i'm finally free and ready to fight the covenant i mean avenge my family it is sad i guess but also how good do i look in this vault suit i achieved this by combining two different thick mods seriously when i was testing them out i felt like a wine taster but instead of wine it was pixelated booty the best kind of booty okay i've gotta get out of this vault but unfortunately there are giant roaches absolutely everywhere on the positive side my girl here throws a mean right hook you think those bruises on my husband came from him falling down the stairs you see i can make those jokes because domestic abuse is funny when i reverse the genders i take a big old drink of water from this rusty sink because staying hydrated is paramount i then find some lucky deep syringes which should be fun and also a gun let's go now getting this door open will be a challenging task just kidding one button this is a big moment for us as we don't know how long we've been frozen down here for it could have been years tens of years hundreds of years tens of hundreds of years we just don't know oh my god it's brighter than my future as a christian social influencer this guy barack obama5 commented on one of my videos saying i don't think this guy is even religious that might be one of the most insulting things i've ever read in my life i literally threw up on my cats canceled culture is coming for me perhaps more than anyone else on the internet right now and it's scary well it's just been that one horrible comment so far but that's how it all starts anyway the world has clearly changed and i'd be lying if i said i wasn't excited to explore as you can tell i also activated a mod which means there is now significantly more regrowth my neighborhood has been completely destroyed and it's sad to see we had a lot of great memories on this street like when i introduced you to cheeky old codsworth or when we all fled in complete terror moments before war obliterated life as we know it speaking of the little son of a gun he survived and it's nice to see a familiar face while i stand all sassy and confident he proceeds to tell me that it's been 200 years since the great war he's also insanely violent and extremely good at killing the mutated creatures which makes me question why a robot with a [ __ ] flamethrower was helping raise a baby oh my god i'm a mother i completely forgot about that i best go rescue the little tater tot i might wear this dress as it's more conservative just kidding the skin tight suit stays on just like my suede sandals do when i pay an escort to hold me while i cry i'm not really sure if i'm heading in the right direction but is anyone impulsively i jump off this bridge and not only is the river knee-high which itself is a huge safety concern the water is also incredibly radioactive getting minor radiation poisoning isn't the red hot start i was hoping for but on the plus side i find a german shepherd i befriend the dog and he will now be my companion which is wholesome and welcomed not only do dogs improve your happiness they also help defend you from the wide range of mutated creatures that are plentiful around here i need a bigger gun and fast the local town seems to have been completely infested with all sorts of interesting creatures and in the distance i can hear what i think is a school as i get closer it turns out there is actually just a heated gunfight going on between a group of survivors trapped in the town hall and some raiders in hindsight i really jumped to conclusions here as i did just shoot one of them in the head they definitely didn't attack me first ah well what's done is done and are you really playing a fallout game if you don't go around and loot every single enemy you killed until you max out your carry weight and have to drop it all anyway it paid off though because i most definitely found my bigger and better gun i made the survivors and wow what is this a big penny contest this guy preston garvey flexes his huge version of my gun like we were two guys at a urinal i'm a grower not a shower metaphorically of course as i'm a woman anyway there's a power armor suit that he says i can use to clear out the remaining hostiles while he shoots from the safety of the town hall roof what a stunning and brave individual power armor really is amazing it's the equivalent of playing tennis with someone and you're doing all right you've got a strong serve but he's impossible to break and you're entering a tie breaker but then you put your racket away and pull out a remington 870 pump action shotgun and blow his head off for the easy ggg the only thing that could stop me now is i don't know an experimental radioactive fueled giant predator with razor sharp claws haha you see how i set that up now i'm fighting what i just described this is an extremely bad example of the technique writers used called foreshadowing where they set their viewers expectations i actually use foreshadowing in real life by telling girls that they shouldn't sleep with me so that when they don't sleep with me it isn't a shock for anyone anyway deathclaw 0 thick woman one i then proceeded to mow down all the survivors with my minigun no i'm kidding i don't do that we actually all slowly walk back to my home straight like really slowly not even a brisk power walk which seems careless because you know death claws are a thing and i'm almost out of mini gun ammo we eventually arrive and this group of survivors decide to set up base here and invite me to join i go and chat with preston and he tells me that another settlement needs our help i immediately get crippling ptsd and you know what no i'm not going to help your shitty settlement preston i'm going to go and build my dream home you see i actually studied architecture for one year before i switched to accounting and i think it really shows because look at this crib the door opens outwards so you get knocked out every time you enter we've got these couches designed specifically for heated pre-marital eye contact i'll admit the second story is where it starts to fall apart a bit but as long as it's not acid raining which it often is the breeze is welcomed that took me an uncomfortably long time to build and i really should be saving my child i decide to trek all the way to diamond city and this is not for the faint-hearted i come across many folks on my travel like trash can carla and did she pick that name anyway i sell her my wedding ring because girl's gone wild my husband's dead i then murder color and steal all her stuff because girl's gone wild i also come across another little showdown between some bandits and a local trader i try to handle the situation diplomatically for like 15 seconds but then yeah i just kill everyone because i figure i can take all of their belongings if they you know are not breathing it's not an easy journey as mines scatter the road but i did find the modest pelican goggles on trashcan carla's bloody corpse which is just fate finally i reach the gates and make it to the safety of diamond city it's a pretty impressive place they've got here and besides the occasional public execution it really has the family-friendly atmosphere that i've been searching for my whole life besides in the words of mother teresa who needs a son when you've got a bubble butt i've got something new in the works that i'm excited to announce to you all soon otherwise thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
