[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with hitman 3. if you enjoy this video please go to a bar and order random women cups of water instead of alcoholic drinks and then have the way to say it's from modest pelican as this really helps spread the good word of my channel today we'll be traveling to a wealthy estate in england to eliminate our target alexa carlisle i'll be wearing a pair of timeless speed dealer sunglasses and a wife beater so i can seamlessly blend in to my posh english surroundings he doesn't actually beat wives though don't worry just children to match my drip i'm bringing in a scuffed pistol with a paint can as a silencer a combat knife and some zannis we couldn't be more ready to megan markle these upper class malakas there's lots of security on site and i overhear a detective saying he's here to solve a murder mystery not ideal but potentially an opportunity to take over the investigation i crouch walk through a creek completely soaking my shoes and socks i should have worn crocs as great as agent 47 looks right now he's not actually allowed on the premises so i throw my knife into a bush and lure over a gardener i non-lethally pacified the big girl and have you ever noticed that hitman games are just glorified dress-up simulators i grab a pair of shears to help sell the disguise and 47 proceeds to hold them exactly like someone who's about to commit first-degree murder and not tend the garden the estate is quite impressive and also inspiring for the common man anyone can live like this so long as they work hard get a good education are born into a family with immense generational wealth and wake up early the disguise is working a treat and gives me access to the entire grounds just not inside the mansion now i've just got to locate alexa and come up with a plan there's also a secondary objective to retrieve a case file as the only thing more fun than a second target is recovering important paperwork it looks like the carlisles are planning some sort of family photo if i can become the photographer there could definitely be an opportunity here plus who wouldn't want to take photos of alexa she's a little batty they can't start the photo shoot though as they're missing a fusel i decide to do some actual gardening to maximize my immersion agent 47 proceeds to move one leaf at a time putting about as much effort into this as p hub puts into their plot lines i was watching one the other day where the stepmom was washing the clothes but she didn't even separate the whites from the darks and it really took me out of the moment anyway it's time to get serious and make some moves i find a rake on the lawn and place it facing upwards right where one of the guards is patrolling i am not mad that they put this feature into the game i am however mad about the distinct lack of booties i know i've beaten this drum a few times now but where is the thickness in this game do you know how many booties hitman 1 and 2 had back then it was so easy to create fun educational thumbnails that the whole family could enjoy together it's getting tough but i'll keep striving to deliver the dump truck thumbnails you all deserve like the video if you love booties i managed to climb a pipe and infiltrate the mansion through a bathroom window i want to explore but will have to be stealthy i throw my combat knife to distract the garden maid who are having a red hot steamy conversation about what i can only assume is the book of corinthians in particular parable 1 through 16 thou shall not tap that ass until thou betrowed in marriage i proceed to get caught almost immediately professional assassin by the way i'm escorted from the premises which sucks but the courtyard he takes me to has a surprise a few cell which should fix the camera for the family photo i also spot an area of the estate i haven't seen yet so i decided to check it out this place has a really warm welcoming ambience about it they seem to be planning a fake funeral for alexa carlyle which is just classic rich person behavior the funeral host doesn't want to show alexa the setup until the crows fly away i think a funeral host is officially called much like a wedding ceremony a celebrant as good of a job as this guy is doing at removing the crows i decide to take matters into my own hands i proceeded to shoot down several birds nests like a boss butchering baby birds would be so sad if they were pelicans at least the fake funeral can now go ahead i'm just paying it forward trying to get that positive karma i guess alexa arrives to inspect the setup and i'm going to straight up murder that booty my mum actually asked why i talk about virtual women's buttocks the whole time and it was pretty awkward i just said i'd do it for the vine and then we sat in silence for a couple of minutes eventually she left the meme started so long ago but now my family watch my content and i have to deal with the consequences of what i say i decide it's time to take over the murder investigation and so i choke out the detective and steal his clothes pretty risky in broad daylight but i'm getting an itchy trigger finger so i half hoped i'd have to eliminate a witness i now have complete access to the mansion and the place is nice but they need to get some leds up in here i feel like i'm at a sadie small town strip club or at least i assume those places would be poorly lit love you mum the carlisles are having a family meeting about the fake funeral and also the murder of alexa's eldest son zachary the butler shows me to the crime scene and the big girl's definitely dead i sit down and stare at his corpse for a while which is weird and then takes several photos applying a tasteful late sunset filter which really accentuates his gaping deranged mouth i'm also pretty sure he had a drinking problem what a lad the sum of the family thinks he took his own life and some think it was foul play which is why the detective was here in the first place it's time to solve a murder mystery lads and lasses pretty unprofessional temporarily abandoning our primary objective of being an assassin not to mention hypocritical but here we are it's time to question the whole family and figure out who's the troublemaker i start talking to gregory the eldest son and he hits me with something rather hurtful not very thorough are you this dodgy malacca has the audacity to call out my competence as a detective i decide to add him as an additional primary target as nobody belittles me while i'm at work i continue speaking with all the different kids and honestly if zachary did indeed kill himself i'm starting to see why we've got beta ron weasley this and what i can only assume is a neo-nazi they all tell me where they were last night and by sneaking into their bedrooms i'm able to surprisingly confirm that they're all telling the truth while searching one room i find some sort of secret passageway it's all very sass and then i spy through a peephole and see a man who looks just like me there's only room for one handsome caucasian bald man on this estate and so proceed to do what i have to do honestly i really just felt like killing someone as it had been so long i just hope they weren't too crucial to the whole murder mystery story i hide the bodies in the passageway and let's all just move on quickly you see there's one suspect that i haven't seen yet emma the wife of the guy who hurt my feelings earlier when he said i wasn't a thorough detective i find where they're staying and the real crime here is how they manage to score the biggest bedroom in the house this patio offers 270 degree views allowing them to maximize our fresco living it looks like they didn't finish breakfast either which means they must have low energy as it's arguably the most important meal of the day the word breakfast wasn't used until the 1400s and it literally means breaking the overnight fast okay that was an obvious one but i'm just trying to make sure i stay educational i gather some more evidence to help build a case against emma but i need to actually find and interrogate her look i'll waterboard the gal if that's what it takes to get a confession there's really only one area of the map i haven't explored yet and that is a greenhouse out the back there's one security guard standing watch so i slip a few zannies into his water which is ethically questionable as staying hydrated is the backbone of my career but it is what it is i somewhat hide his body but then notice someone's in the grain house it's emma and she's looking more suspicious than a clear browser history i confront her and the story she tells me is paper thin she clearly murdered zachary and is after the inheritance she's also standing right next to a poisonous flower on lab equipment simply looking at her tells the whole story so i rush back to report my findings the butler arranges a private meeting in alexa's office and this woman's security detail is way bigger than harry and megan's sons because she actually has one these royal family jokes aren't going to age very well kind of like prince philip this man is 23 years old i tell alexa that emma is the killer and she's happy with my work i get to pick my reward choosing either cash or the case file i need to retrieve and naturally i take that paper hustlers never sleep it's relatively simple to steal the case file anyway i activate a secret button and then to get the safe code i have to match the numbers to their corresponding picture it's kind of like blue's clues except with way more sex appeal because i'm wearing a fedora in case file retrieved let's go kill alexa in that cyber bully gregory i head down to the fountain where the photo shoot is happening and grab a screwdriver and a wrench whoever left these tools out is pretty irresponsible as rain is imminent and they'll rust i head back to the greenhouse and repair the chemistry set i'm then able to turn the plant into a glass bottle of lethal poison it even has a detailed label on it science i then poison the photographer's water a little extreme killing the big dog but that should be the only collateral damage in an otherwise watertight plan i then unscrew a valve allowing water to gush from the fountain all over the maid's shoes i can relate to her struggle more than she knows honestly impressed at how unbothered she is by this the photographer then dies sorry champ i dump his body into a crate and steal his clothes the key to being a good photographer is to dress like a 14 year old drama student smoke heavily and physically assault every female you work with i place the fuse cell and then take a test photo of the maid even though i'm about to elaborately murder arguably the hottest npc in gaming history this is a great shot my guy had talent the maid goes to fetch the family members while i expose a few of the wires in the puddle that has formed the family slowly assembles like they were the avengers but rather than saving the world they just buy cheeses other than cheddar and smell their own farts alexa gives another speech to the kids and i get a little jealous all i wanted in life was to be a trust fund baby and live in a sketchy medieval manner but no i had to be born into a loving middle class family alexa walks down and looks at the exposed wires in the puddle of water and actually says out loud hey maybe this isn't safe but then full sends it anyway which i quite frankly respect the family line up and i take my position kind of sadistic that i'm frying this woman alive in front of her children but in the words of david attenborough sometimes you've gotta fry a hoe in front of her children so you can get that glizzy dough as i'm leaving the crime scene i run into gregory i proceed to show him that i am in fact a thorough detective i get away with it too because everyone's panicked about the electrocution and i calmly sneak away but get this apparently i disconnected from the servers during my playthrough so i didn't get a mission rating i escape and then do exactly what i have to do restart the mission wearing a tactical red skivvy armed with a fully automatic weapon and kill every single person i do mean every single individual here maids gardeners guards the entire family i'd rather get a zero star rating than no raiding if you enjoyed this video hit like i love you guys thanks for watching until next time and as always stay classy
