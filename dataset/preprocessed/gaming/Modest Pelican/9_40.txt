[Music] hi lads and lasses mars pelican here with dayz if you enjoyed this video please become an uber driver but instead of driving people to their destinations lock them in your car and play them my videos on repeat until they subscribe to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel speaking of spreading the good word of my channel as we all know the current economic climate is looking pretty grim and bitcoin just crashed again and hot tub streamers are taking everyone's views i can't believe people sit around watching this filth for six hours at a time i always cap it at five because i have self-respect anyway this has led me to the realization that i need to get more subscribers then it came to me i must take people prisoner and dayz and force them at gunpoint to subscribe to my channel it's textbook extortion and the reason this will be so effective is that you really don't want to die in dayz unless of course you're repetitively killing yourself in the hope of spawning closer to your friends the game is brutal and being a fresh spawn is a truly testing experience and just keeping your vitals up so you don't keel over and collapse is a real struggle so as you can imagine once people get any kind of decent loot they desperately want to survive lads and last says it's time to grow this channel by preying on this desperation step one i need to find my mate stealthorubbo i'll edit out the journey but eventually i find him cutting up a body into tiny little pieces with a combat knife the seems excessively morbid but i take the dead man's loot and robbo even gives me a sewing kit so i can fix my clothing never did i think i'd speak about sewing and maiming a corpse in the same sentence we set off through the orchard ready to find some dodgy malaccas to take prisoner in most of the games we play robbo chooses a thick female character so it's pretty weird to see him as a serious military guy i think we all know there's a dump truck under those cargo pants though we decide to investigate some sheds and come across a pile of meat it's cow mate so it seems a player has been hunting himself some dinner i hope he's also hungry for some modest pelican content because when i find him i'm shoving a shotgun in his mouth and forcing him to turn notifications on we clear out most of the zombies in the area and then while looting a hospital i find a naughty nurse dress and this will be our prisoner's uniform i also find blood testing equipment so we can now harvest their blood god's plan we cook up some of the beef and i'm pretty sure my guy is going through puberty because he needs to eat constantly robbo proceeds to let off a pink smoke grenade to try and attract players which might get us killed but at least we'll die looking drippy while clearing out an abandoned military checkpoint we encounter our first player he doesn't have a microphone but seems to be quite responsive to our voices hello dude yeah mike you have a mic mate you look cold all right follow us man we're taking your prisoner we'll give you food and shelter if you subscribe to my youtube channel don't try and run my boy will just shoot you don't try and hide behind a tree mate do you understand oh you've got to run off [Laughter] we are playing on international servers so there's a fair chance he didn't speak english i guess the life lesson here is that it's okay to murder people if they're different from you we've been playing for hours and that's the first person we've come across so it's time to start being creative most of the towns and cities have pa systems and if we broadcast enticing messages to attract players we can run a catfish operation after a bit of looking i find the elusive truck battery which should be a suitable power source robbo makes me carry it because he says he's the better shot which is true but hurtful it's at this moment we spot another player or rather a potential new subscriber i get distracted taking down zombies and we briefly lose him but then he unexpectedly seeks us out what's up man what's up uh nothing much i am i am by myself all right man come into the shed real quick we're late we'll give you food we'll give you water we'll give you everything man but we have one conditioner you have to subscribe to my youtube channel man uh what's on youtube uh it's modest pelican madison uh modest madison anakin yeah exactly pelican modest pelican yeah exactly exactly if you leave a comment so i know that i know that you've subbed don't mind him pulling up videos of like apple pelicans and sages i just said they're like humble pelicans cool and it's pulling up videos of pelicans my friend's gonna feed you some are they tablets peanuts or something mate oh he's gonna feed you some peanuts so you don't pass out on us how you going with that man uh still looking i'm just so irrelevant do you have a picture of a pelican on it with a helmet yeah that's me that's me man now if you can leave a comment on any one of my videos master boss thank you for the sub thank you for the sub it quickly became apparent that most the boss was far too much of a genuinely sweet guy to harvest blood from but we now have earned one subscriber but fortunately the server was starting to fill up and our encounters with players were about to sharply rise i quickly drink some of god's nectar because water is the only truth in this world actually something quite amusing happened on twitter the other day some random man tweeted out stay hydrated and someone commented underneath it saying kill yourself for copying modest pelican this community didn't invent water intake but i like to think we made it mainstream we all drank water before it was cool we attached the car battery and put out an announcement to the world hello there this is modest pelican please come to berezina that's delta robbie on the remix please come berezino for free food and weapons master boss if you can still hear us i miss you i miss your body bro you know what i probably wouldn't believe it but basically everyone has trust issues in dayz and i honestly don't blame them for god's sake we shot a man for not being a native english speaker before but curiosity always kills the cat whether it was the noise we were making or total chance the streets begin to fill up the first guy we come across had no mic but understood us he however did not like the idea of subscribing to my channel so i fired my shotgun into his chest the second player was far more responsive especially as he had just witnessed the public execution how you going man come up into the woods a bit away from these zombies you're gonna kill we're going to give you food if you do a challenge for us man what's your name poppa first thing is you got to put on this nurse dresser you look cold you look great you look great hopper very very masculine very masculine i'm just going to take a little bit of your blood all right my friend's just gonna play some ropes around you after he's had a drink of water it's important to stay home no no no no no no seriously i promise you your life's gonna change for the better do not try any funny business this is a trust exercise right don't worry don't worry man just taking a little bit of your blood okay so you need to search out modest pelican on youtube and subscribe and leave a comment i have to in two seconds thanks hopper look youtube the youtube algorithm is really brutal all right hi from hopper all right hopefully i see a comment man there you go thank god please don't cut him loose yet why oh why oh all right my friend's just getting very sick on his head he's got a sack on your head off up you can put your clothes back on we're gonna get you some nice food and make sure to put those notifications on man i'll come back and murder you all right hopper i've just subscribed and i want a dress so i think thank you for subscribing i'm just going to inject you with some of this all right uh it's methamphetamine oh god i've hit myself all right i'm i'm ready to go sometimes to spread the good word of your channel you've got to be a little bit sadistic another successful interaction we're currently averaging one subscriber every three hours of gameplay which isn't terribly efficient the sun's also going down so we'll need shelter soon as night time is incredibly dark as we're finding a new place to stay we spot a zombie horde chasing a man into a train station you should always prey on the vulnerable and so we move in for the kill put your hands up man we will let you live but we need one for small favour from you all right i just need you to subscribe to our youtube channel bro and then we'll give you some food all right and then we're all good as you can imagine you know times are tough right now you've got to go out and really grow you grow your audience anyway by any means necessary it's pretty creative i'll give you credit for it it's actually how he's gotten 95 of his following in this we're using this method yeah like this man is the nicest bandit on daisy is that you is that you andrew oh yeah that's a nice username yeah as well bro jack's prostate just one last thing we just need you to put on this dress and do a little dance i just take your pants off as well man otherwise what's what's the point you know uh i'll sing but you have to uh shoot at my at your feet okay deal i like it bang bang my baby another successful mission rather than ending up with a bullet in his head he's now got plenty of food and some non-consensual memories that i imagine he'll cherish forever as we're leaving the building we spot a fresh spawn with a glow stick we should really be finding a spot to spend the night but at the same time i simply must keep spreading the good word stop running mate we're friendly no you're not you're liars oh it's you what's up man this guy hey what's up you look like did you die i'm not a guy oh you're a girl yeah i keep on oh sorry sorry hopper my apologies i thought you're a very thought young boy a boy sorry i thought you were a young boy with my face quite red hopper lets us know that in a nearby town there's a huge fight going down between several players it looks like we'll have to get a good night's sleep another time because it's time to head out into the darkness and take some prisoners it's too dark and dangerous to just walk in but hopper proves to be an incredibly brave lass she volunteers to pull out a glow stick and run right in to try and draw out some shots i didn't even have to gaslight this decision hopper really is a true legend and to our surprise she doesn't get sniped in the head so we push in and take the police station there is one bloke here but he isn't exactly a gillied up sniper he's agitated and holding a broom you good damn still out bro all right put the room down i walk inside the police station man what's your name man what's your name your mom's football that's it that's really my gamer tag yo gamertag is your mom's spooper i like that just need you to subscribe to my youtube channel man then we're chilling hey don't wriggle free bro oh [ __ ] do you mind hey i was gonna say do you mind if i wiggle free no not yet man comment on a video and tell me which one you comment on and then i get the proof yeah i just commented and said love the role play and daisy could do a video rating hey thanks man it's a great idea maybe i will do a daisy video before subscribers total this is going extremely well the police station has now filled up with players and the situation is starting to get a little bit out of hand robbo and i are actually both pretty surprised everyone's still alive we decide to turn this positive energy into potentially the most beautiful gaming moment you'll ever witness you guys are all going to sing a song for us you know country roads they're just hey there it is west virginia west virginia oh my god he got me too and just like that some malacca with a big boy gun came in and ruined any hope we had of getting that precious fifth subscriber i thought country rhodes was universally appreciated but he must not have been a big john denver fan this is not just about efficiently growing my channel anymore it's also about getting revenge he killed hopper he killed robbo he killed your mum's phooper for god's sake it's time for revenge as i approach kami's show though i can hear shots raining down from all angles it sounds like there's a sniper in the hill and a couple of shotguns popping off in the town the odds are against us i decide to send it i run in and some dude is shooting at hopper who i am incredibly surprised survived all that i decide to try and save her life so i run in and beat the guy to death it's all right i'm dying anyway i thought you as i land my final blow it becomes immediately apparent that the person with the shotgun was in fact hopper hopper if you're still subscribed which i hope you are because we made a deal i'm truly sorry about that genuine mistake the police station begins filling up with fresh spawns again and robbo advises that i kill anyone who doesn't have a microphone i take his advice because i can't afford to die and do another three kilometer run i need that fifth subscriber robo arrives and gears up and then our communication goes down not ideal he's outside looting the bodies and then two gunshots go off somebody just killed my baby boy unfortunately he doesn't know that i'm inside so i line up a shot and extract revenge i don't think it was the guy with the m4 who murdered everyone earlier but at least i got some sort of revenge i find another player and get straight to work to complete our objective is your profile picture a picture of a pelican with a helmet on yeah that's the one yes you're so wholesome oh my god a mission complete and just in time too i hope you're doing well i've got potentially the biggest sons of virgins episode coming up next week thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay it's classy
