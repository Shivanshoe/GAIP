[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoy this video please call random numbers and scream modest pelican and then hang up as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories now obviously we know my very original gta online character thick man that i created with no influence from anything else is no joke i mean for god's sake the man's tears are so powerful they can cure terminal illness although it's never happened as he never cries he's a real alpha chad and internalizes his emotions like a champ this being said i feel like my character needs one last item that will really complete his image what's the one thing that every man respects and no woman can resist the item that every gamer wishes they had the thing that families of seven or more often purchase to make commuting easier that's right we're talking about a family friendly minivan and don't believe me look what happens when i show my friend aches hey ex would you um would you be with this man uh like what do you mean be with him you mean like like hang out would you physically would you be physically intimate with my gta online character that's kind of like a really weird question he's a gta character why would i want to have sex with a gta character all right what about if you knew that he drove this i would let that man rail me whenever you want yeah i wanted to put it in my this isn't just any minivan either i spent over a million dollars customizing this malacca to have maximum performance upgrades a mexican vibing skull door speakers so i can play africa by toto or i mean any normal relatable songs that align with my demographic you see the real reason i purchased this fan is to impress the boys today i'll be joined by stealtho cabo stealthomato and zany who told me that if he's going to play gta online he expects me to pick him up in a cool car honestly pretty excited to see everybody's reaction what's up sammy this is not the best car driver this is the best car i just literally spent ages doing this up man are you serious i wanted a maserati but i guess this will have to do like a wheels piece of we'll hop in man we're obviously gonna take this i'ma walk real quick oh okay gangster look oh that actually is kind of gangster oh no not grenade related surely not i'm so nervous i've never been great at reading the room but i think it's safe to say the van is a massive success with the lads now it's time to continue with our heist the problem is zany is shooting absolutely everything that moves just like everyone when they first play grand theft auto yes this is his first time we promised to make it special the first time i fooled around with a girl i also promised to make it special and i guess you could say i thoroughly achieved that goal her older brother was in the next room aggressively calling people racial slurs while he played call of duty her door didn't have a lock and i lasted about 23 seconds a truly magical afternoon anyway for us to successfully complete the heist we all need to be on the same wavelength i decide our best bet is a cheeky team building exercise and nothing beats a long mountain hike except gaming inside for hours and debatably literally any other activity i'm more about the metaphorical side of this hike and i also don't want to get stuck on a mountaintop so i drive big red marmizato most of the way up you don't want to destroy it too much felix oh this car actually oh my god what the you sent the regards yeah this is my man boys it's the only way out of here as well we probably don't want to see you well oh look at it go i love physics that's copper well you guys [Laughter] to the surprise of everyone involved we bond together like brothers and of course i'm kidding it's my group of friends after all hey our team building oh yeah this is going badly either oh you know what three out of four is not bad let's just go let's just punch on without it you keep going i'll catch you wow thank you sorry seems like a tension you and me daddy will just be the team building part of this if you king hit me twice three times under the top head of cheese no nice it's always good to have jade do you have a parachute wait do we all have parachutes yeah you should you should have one man it will auto deploy once you hit the certain height zone oh auto deploy all right there's no manual deploy button no you're just gonna get a good run up and once you start falling at all yeah here we go then there's no auto deployment you sacrificed me for content i did the real test however is that we are now stuck in the middle of nowhere but fortunately my mechanic truly is an alpha charge with frankly no life man needs to get a hobby he should start a youtube channel because apparently you can just questionably narrate your gameplay and over time a wholesome community will form and flood your comment section with hydration jokes and communist propaganda i'm of course speaking about you guys because i love you intimately i'll probably just start taking std medication proactively because of all the sex i'll be having due to this van but even i'll admit it's quite slow stealth omato politely asks me if i can run over this dodgy malacca who's trying to flex his hiking skills on us and of course i'm happy to do so lads and lasses it's time to make bank we head over to my facility and there's something so sweet about this drive can't lie i guess i'm just a big fan of renewable energy sorry that was a terrible dad joke i'll go drown myself after i post this video i park the big girl inside and instantly feel quite bad you see i forgot about the hydration station wagon we purchased months ago we had a competition to name this and everything i guess it's like an unspoken rule of gta online where you save up and get all hyped about purchasing a vehicle and then instantly forget about it forever i proceeded to show zany around my facility oh you do have staff yeah man dude she's hot now she's cape's a tired i will kill her now i can't it feels crazy attempting the doomsday heist again i'm pretty sure i already mentioned it but a few of the sons of virgins episodes were removed because comedy is dying why can't we just mock everyone no matter how disadvantaged they are with absolutely no repercussions you know what we're the oppressed ones gamers unironically have it hardest in life we deserve medals or government pensions or something anyway it'll be good to have the complete doomsday heist back on the channel stealthocabo then has the audacity to suggest we don't take the minivan and so i take the high road and use a sticky bomb to demonstrate my feelings it's rare that a fuel guzzling people mover comes between a group of friends but morale is starting to dip oh we're going to the top of the map it's going to take us the whole night i'll wait stop this train coming up i wanna make it i can beat it close that was like the same for fast and furious but like way cooler after one of the longest drives of my life we finally arrive at the destination and i kid you not zany dies almost immediately closely followed by stealtho cabo imagine having the ability to edit your friends deaths out of a video but instead you overly focus on it i used to do this to stealthocabo back when i had like 50 subscribers and years later absolutely nothing has changed i mean what's the point of growing a platform if you don't then use it to publicly roast your closest friends i use a ramp car to satisfyingly clear the road so the lads can shoot down the helicopters it's at this moment i see an opportunity i see a chance to capture potentially the greatest train shot this channel has ever witnessed for anyone who's new here we love over-hyping cinematic train shots i honestly hope this becomes another pillar of the brand so far we've got staying hydrated educational christian music communism and i truly believe celebrating footage of trains is the natural next step what a what a train shot yeah there it is it's happening i'm gonna get right up alongside are you boys all right i'm just doing something we're getting content you guys will be fine that's it that's the shot holy shit's good like what if you could like jump in front of me during the cinematic camera yeah i was just really gonna help the boys thanks to a valiant effort from carbo and mato we complete the heist preparation like i said i'm not great at reading the room but if you watch the footage very carefully you can see that cabo has started dropping subtle hints that he's sick of driving around in a minivan this is not you that's not well oh it's will i kept the dream alive for as long as possible but it's now time to use the overpowered vehicles it also comes to our attention that zany is homeless imagine not having generational wealth but yeah he decides to buy himself a virtual home we immersively drive to his new residence and i've gotta say i don't know how on earth he afforded this place it's got a nice pool and we have one of our famous bro pool parties to wind down a little we then all proceed to pretend that most houses in the city don't have this exact same interior as to not ruin this monumental occasion should i hear a vulnerable motto do it no no cuddle up to the target agent 47 now with the home it's time to get this man armed as he's been using a handgun this entire time the lads proceed to online bully me for a while which i more than deserve i take the high road and get my van back and then explode their car so that they can start riding in style once again we arrive and park between the lions because immersion zen then buys a gun and the first thing he does is try to brutally murder me i bought myself a flashlight which i shine on him and we can now observe a new gta player in a foreign habitat he's managed to acquire himself an rpg and is behaving aggressively to everything in his vision to assert dominance and now confused and out of ammunition he stands still shocked a pair of more experienced players move in to acquaint themselves with the now heavily armed life form the herd grows toxic as it's been more than 10 seconds since someone lashed out and everybody begins beating each other to death forgetting friendly fire is off the herd slowly dies out one by one to the native police officers who have moved in and opened fired despite many ongoing conversations about friendly fire being disabled one of the alpha gamers attempts a brave suicide bombing on the herd eventually everybody perishes in fact most of the recording session we were under pursuit by police i think i had a wanted level more than half the time we were playing we head back to the facility and hook right back into the heist our next prep is to assassinate some guy and steal his briefcase because it has something important in it damn that is some deep storytelling right there but at least thick man knows his way around an assassination not because of any link to agent 47 i can't stress how much thick man is a completely unique character i invented there's no copyright issues here i really can't stop thinking about how much zany looks like a discord mod a real alpha one though as he's traded in his fedora for a full-blown tall lincoln top hat he's the head admin with full perms amongst a bunch of peasant-based moderators we follow the target but naturally get spotted almost immediately zan fires one rocket destroying the big girl's car and then mado finishes him off with a ray gun i kick his corpse several times as i'm all about picking fights you're sure you can win there's been a lot of youtube boxing events lately and i think it's time old modest pelican dusts off the gloves and gets in the ring i was thinking who can i fight that would be a true spectacle and a real event for the whole online community to enjoy then it came to me there's this happy little guy called ryan who has an extremely family-friendly channel called ryan's world where he plays with toys and i'm confident i could knock the lad out i've never lost a fight to an eight-year-old before and i feel it'd be good exposure for him as he only has 29 million subscribers balls in your court ryan highest prep complete the productivity is almost overwhelming in fact we start flying through the missions at a rate that would impress even the most sweaty of speedrunners we shoot helicopters out of the sky so we can secure cars with mounted machine guns on them which seems overly elaborate but i'm all about that life with everything almost set up it's time to celebrate the day with a little light gambling imagine a world in which zany wins the car first spin it would be a truly momentous occasion he proceeds to win a baseball cap that says like and subscribe on it thanks for watching you absolute legends it feels damn good to be making sons of virgins content again can't wait for the finale until next time and as always stay classy
