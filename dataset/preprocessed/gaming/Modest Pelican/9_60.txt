[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with cyberpunk 2077. if you enjoy this video please paint the words modest pelican gaming on a rock and throw it into your neighbor's window as this really helps spread the good word of my channel i can't tell you how happy i am to finally be making content on this incredibly hyped game my expectations are so high that if it doesn't offer the best authentic rpg experience ever cure world hunger and get me laid i'm going to be pretty disappointed alright first i've got to design my character and as the randomization option is the stuff of nightmares i do the only logical thing i try and make my character look like agent 47. i do an amazing job and you can barely tell which one's which we spawn in an office building bathroom as i throw up into a sink wow this is a shared space big dog and there's nothing cooler than respecting company property so keep it together i'm a high-flying corporate named v and i've got a meeting with the boss upstairs i had three different backstories i could have chosen and i landed on office worker super questionable decision but at least my parents can finally be proud of me i make my boss and i immediately jump onto his coffee table to assert dominance i even do a little tap dance to show him that i have both a slightly above average sized peony and immaculate active listening skills he tells me that i've got to eliminate someone within the company which seems sketchy but i do love unnecessary violence so i'm in i hop into this fancy flying taxi and get my first look at the awe-inspiring night city it's amazing that this is how the world would look if everyone just stayed sufficiently hydrated at all times i'm looking at you africa anyway we're heading to a gentleman's club so i can meet my boy jackie and ask him to back me up on this mission you might be wondering how i plan on keeping this channel pure in the eyes of god with lewd content absolutely everywhere well i turned on the family-friendly setting so for example this woman is wearing conservative elbow pads we now won't be tempted by the supple joint between her fore and upper arm at least this last gets it as she stands like a cross perfectly still she might not be making any friends but she'll be making her way straight to heaven's gates i go and meet jackie boy and he's a good lad it's great to see him we drink together and while asking him if he wants to do this job with me upper management shows up they proceed to fire me for conspiring to kill another employee wow i guess in the year 2077 political correctness has gone so far you can't even offer co-worker anymore i head back to my apartment and at least i have a great place to call home i jump in the shower and do that dramatically depressing thing where you plant your hands against the wall i also just took a shower fully clothed and i think we can all agree that v needs to get his head in the game like when i sleep i don't even use the pillows do you hate yourself fee or do you hate adequate neck support alright new morning new me let's seize the day i head over to my wardrobe and put on some fresh clothes i'll admit my outfit doesn't really scream cyberpunk but breathable shorts are heavily underrated also i like how my shirt says like the video and subscribe or stealthosimo will teabag your father while he naps believe it or not that's not edited jackie boy wants to mage so that we can start hustling the big boy is munching down on some noodles and as excited as i am to hook into the story i want to explore the city a little bit first it seems really cool but i feel as if v doesn't really know what to do with his hands i need a vehicle for proper exploration so it's time to commit my first crime i attempt to steal some sort of futuristic mini cooper and it runs me over all the vehicle safety features the year 2077 has to offer and women are still running over pedestrians after multiple roadside injuries i managed to jack a minivan and start exploring the map you see there's lots of reviews about this game being released at the moment but there's one surefire way of judging if a game deserves a solid 10 out of 10 perfect score i pull into an apartment complex and locate some of night city's youth playing with toys in the car park these kids actually got a handgun which kind of seems like lazy parenting but anyway i pull out my gun and attempt to fire i can confirm that cyberpunk 2077 does not let you eliminate children my immersion is absolutely shattered i enjoy an afternoon of stealing expensive cars and double checking that the family friendly setting is actually working which seems like a grey area i was more hoping that all the men would be forced to wear long classic roman garments and the women strict nun attire but i guess we'll have to settle for booty shorts i've had my fun and it's now time to rendezvous with jackie and start making some cash he's planned out today's activities for us which is pretty cute but first we're heading to a ripper dock who can replace our in-cell human body parts with cool robot ones on the walk i notice a man perving on a dancer so i jab him in the head he honestly takes the punch like a champ as everyone else flees the area in fear the dock hooks me up with a hand scanner which seems cool and jokes aside it's truly beautiful how they've gone about censoring the nudity when this setting is on they just give the exotic dancers tracksuit pants and sweaters it's inspiring jackie's lined up a meeting with a crime lord known as dex as he has a lucrative job opportunity for us he wants us to steal a spider bot from a gang of psychopaths and then use the bot to break into one of the most secure hotels in night city to steal a prototype biochip from a literal prince posing as an arms dealer sounds super simple what could go wrong i drive over to jackie and first we'll steal this spider bot off the gang for real i think v needs a fidget spinner or something as it's simply not socially acceptable to awkwardly hold your hands in the air like this i politely asked the guard to let us in and we make our way to the meeting the good news is these gentlemen we're doing business with seem emotionally and mentally stable i don't at all feel as if i'm about to be cut up into tiny pieces and then marinated in my own fluids right before splinter cells demonic alter ego enjoys me as a charred grilled v kebab he offers me a hit of something mysterious and obviously i don't want to disregard his hospitality so of course i indulge and jackie boy says no i swear you can't take this lad anywhere he's so embarrassing they do at least have the spider bot and maybe they'll keep their word just kidding big sexy comes in and i would describe his general persona as aggressive and hostile it looks like violence is the only way out of this situation and i proceed to do what i have to do i also wasn't exactly sure when to say this but thank you all so much for a million subscribers i'll do a proper video about it soon but i really am just some dodgy malacca having fun and the fact that we got here really blows my mind thank you i really mean it enough cringe emotion for now because alpha gamers don't simp for anyone even for their loyal supporters who got them where they are today with the spiderbot now in our possession we can commence phase two of the plan visiting the gentleman's club again i'll be honest with you i did try and change the settings so that i could have a quick peek at what the uncensored gameplay would look like for educational purposes unfortunately for my tempted christian eyes you have to start a new game for that so we stay pure i end up in this booth having a meeting with evelyn so she can give us the information she has on the hotel i don't ever want to tell someone how to do their job but maybe next time pick a meeting spot where there isn't a randy hologram seductively dancing around evelyn it makes it hard to follow the plotline that being said i did rock up to this meeting looking like a saints row 2 supporting character so glass houses she plugs me into this machine where i can see her memories using powerful thermal tech i find the location of the safe where the biochip is being kept perfect as i pull away from the club i accidentally run over about four people and it got me thinking could you run over kids to kill them i might have to do some myth busting another time you never want to heist on an empty stomach so i pull over and buy myself 12 extra extra large turkish burritos i really wonder why i'm including this anyway we organized to mate at a bar for the mission briefing and this venue is wild they have women dancing in water tanks which i imagine is incredibly fatiguing i guess if you were into fitness it'd be a sensational call workout and you could easily stay hydrated so maybe it's not the worst job ever the dex has a private booth and we go over the plan basically jackie and i will infiltrate the hotel while these guys stay in a safe location i feel as if we definitely drew the short straw there but if we can get the bio chip we can sell it and be filthy rich at least dex shouted our suba plus we've even got slenderman telling us about local traffic conditions and weather it's truly a pleasant commute and i give slenderman 3.5 stars i don't give five because he haunted me for years the hotel itself is also quite impressive and a welcome change from the crack den i call home and jackie and i make our way inside with the spider bot we have a reservation as the prince is expecting us he thinks he's buying the spider bot at a meeting with us later today it's the perfect plan i had this really kind english teacher back in high school he used to really bond with us and we considered him more of a friend than a teacher one day he told me that money doesn't buy happiness and i just remember thinking that he must be the dumbest human being in the world like take for example this luxury hotel room it's absolutely insane we've got a little zen garden and water commercials playing on the tv we've got a little bathtub it's small and i'll admit that it will be hard for jackie and i to wash each other in here later i mean just wash ourselves like normal people it's time to initiate the operation we send the spiderbot into the vents and this thing is a little unit it's got cloaking abilities and everything i can see why dex wanted us to murder so many people to get it it takes down all of the security systems meaning jackie and i can get into the prince's apartment and steal the bio chip we've gotta move fast because it's unclear when he'll return now things are about to get absolutely insane like keanu reeves levels of insane obviously i'm playing through the game but if you want to avoid spoilers this is your warning so as we're stealing the bio chip from the safe heaps of aircraft land on the helipad one floor above the apartment and jackie and i panic and have to hide unfortunately there's a pillar in the middle of the room that has a one-way mirror type wall so where you can see everything but be safely hidden implausible but perfect for the storyline the prince and his dad the emperor have a meeting the atmosphere is quite tense but hey every father and son relationship has its moments the prince then proceeds to straight up chokey's father to death which is just wow kinda hot we're about to be blamed for the murder so we try to escape on a thin narrow ledge in wet weather which makes me think we should sit down and talk about our decision-making process if we get out of this alive an angry pilot then rains bullets on us and we slip down the building and fall a jackie has to put the biochip into his head because it's unstable while the hotel gets swept by heavily armoured guards it's safe to say the situation has escalated well sneaking out i break some dude's neck and put on his suit as quite frankly i'm getting self-conscious that people think i'm underdressed we end up in the most intense shootout yet as every floor of the hotel brings with it another gaggle of enemies they've even brought a damn mech warrior which honestly seems cheap like i know they think we killed the emperor but a mech show some class dude the slender man comes in clutch with the escape saving our lives i get tempted to raise my driver rating to a four star but then think better of it the trick is to make them really want to please you unfortunately my homie jackie boy took one too many bullets and straight up dies this is quite a sad moment as he was there for me when i lost my job on the other hand he didn't take a hit of that gangster's cush all the way back when we stole the spider bot which was quite socially humiliating for me maybe this is karma he gives me the bio chip and i put it straight into my brain which seems safe and fun i then report to dex who's sketching out about how the entire operation went to hell i lied to him and say that i couldn't even steal the chip as things got too heated get for nest dex i then punch a mirror which is not a healthy way to handle emotion but understandable considering i never got to have that bath with jackie ah well there's nothing left to do but try and rebuild our life just kidding dex straight up pulls out a handgun and kills me wow quite brutal but i'm not actually dead i somehow cling on to life because that would be quite confrontational if the main character just straight up died dex dies though and i make friends with the emperor's security guard because he's been stitched up too and yeah that chip i put into my head was basically the soul of keanu reeves who now lives inside my head rent free he is currently doing everything he can to take over my body so that my soul eventually disintegrates away into nothing i feel like i need to drink some water this game is insane and this is where we're at trying to live life knowing that keanu is right here with us this game is so unique and really cool i'm enjoying it a lot that's the whole of act one let me know if you want to see a part two i hope you legends are doing well until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
