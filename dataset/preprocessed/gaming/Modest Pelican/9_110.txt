[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with hitman if you enjoy this video please start referring to 5j as modest Pelican J as this really helps spread the good word of my channel way to people going to start blaming me for things like getting sick now I saw a man blame 5g as the reason why he was sent to prison it was probably the 7 homicide charges chief but anyway it's been a while since I've posted a hitman video but I love this game because assassinations have always been frowned upon by society but this game proves to the world that they can be fun for the whole family today is a two-part mission and it gets really strange later on but first we travel to Italy to intercept a meeting between our two targets firstly Craig Black who looks like my annoying hipster neighbor who sold his car because he said bicycles are better and now always asks for lifts and brother Akram who's a high-ranking cult operative and has a nice tan it could also be his race I don't know I'm not an immigration officer we'll take in with us a silenced pistol ninja stars and a duck for emotional support we're also wearing sunglasses even though it's night time to show the residents of this village that we have a for a lack of better words a massive painting this guy's also wearing sunglasses at night so I tell him Congrats on the massive painting anyway Craig black is hosting a book launch at the local church he writes team fantasy romantic fiction novels and I guess I just hope he doesn't cramp too much when he gets his period he'll soon be meeting with brother Akram to receive a sample of deadly substance that is going to be used as a weapon which I'll also need to collect I don't have an invitation to the event hurtful so I do a little scouting for an alternative access point I then say this guy enjoying an evening fish and being the last real Christian prank channel on YouTube I proceed to prank the big girl the top 10 pranks gone wrong though as he apparently isn't the strongest swimmer I guess these nighttime sunglasses aren't just making the whamon wet god I look good there really are only two kinds of people that could pull this look of epic big day gamers and sex offenders and on both I need to get somewhere high so I storm into one of the local apartments the windows on the top floor are pretty hard to get a good view from so I ring the bell of one of the rooms a sweet young lady answers and it's honestly a little bit awkward is so in a semi panic i quickscope her with my fist for no reason honestly it's pretty horrible and of course I'm referring to her unmade bed making your bed in the morning and shoe as you start off your day the right way a kidding I don't think I've made the bed once in the last five or six years my girlfriend always makes it and I'll admit it looks pretty nice but she tucks the sheets into the mattress tightly and I feel trapped I guess this proves I've been through some pretty rough times I'm actually recently single though because my girl said she really liked my mum and that she was extremely fit healthy and kind I was like are you serious you're bi and my girlfriend was like what the hell I meant she's just a really nice person but I'd heard enough and just broke up with her straight away can't take that risk that's my mum Doug so yeah we found a tunnel under the church and it's genuinely a horror movie down here I then over here this guy talking on the phone and it turns out he's in a costume and is a mega fan of Craig Black he's here for a photo shoot with him and I know exactly what I have to do I proceeded to knock him unconscious but just kidding I was accidentally holding a ninja star and I unintentionally slit his throat well no point crying over spilt milk or you know whatever the life of an excited innocent man I don't know what this book is about but it definitely does not seem family-friendly anyway they won't start the fan photo shoot until the lighting gets fixed so it looks like it's up to little old me to save the day once again and then kill everyone I find a screwdriver to fix the light but then notice there's an option to poison the smoke machine with insecticide it's all coming together just like a gangbang I head out to the church grounds on a quest for insecticide but to my disappointment the one building our search doesn't have anything then the church bells ring and Mike tact that the agency tells me the meeting is about to commence wow I haven't been this unprepared since the night I lost my virginity but I told her that I had ample experience in the bedroom a best 14 and a half seconds of my life and I assumed her life the sinful premarital relations stories aside I tried to get some elevation so I can properly survey the landscape there's one guard here and I successfully knock him unconscious not even slitting his throat by accident progress I steal his suit and then spot brother Akram making his way towards the building I then proceeded to throw a ninja star at him but I guess agent 47 missed training the day they were taught how to throw ninja stars with the meeting about to start I realized me being up here is basically useless and I need to make a move right now I rushed to the meeting spot but every second guard knows I'm an impostor and I'm left with no solid plan a Craig Black has now presumably received the biological weapon and is leaving the area so my window to take him down is rapidly shrinking but to make matters worse I'm pretty hungry in real life right now and the only thing in the fridge is semi rancid hummus looks like I'm going to have to eat my other cat anyway with no choice but to shoot my shot I correctly throw a ninja star into his bodyguards head and then move in for the kill somehow not getting spotted by the nearby civilians this mission is not going smoothly like I literally just left two bodies in the street as that being said I'm not going to let a botched hit stop me from going to my first 10 fantasy romantic fiction book launch and Wow I don't know much about fantasy romantic book launches but if I hosted one and seven people showed up odd kms I probably could have just let him assassinate himself also remember the virginity story from earlier well this is where it happened and it wasn't actually a her and well this isn't family-friendly let's just go find brother Akram on my way out no less than two guards see through my disguise so I lightly jog away because agent 47 isn't into running at full pace I tried to hide in a dumpster but this goes very very badly and they proceeded to open Wow my spirits may have just broken but at least we have some good intel for round two at this point I'd usually recommend the giving up and instead finding happiness through narcotics but I promised I will finish this contract and as a youtuber I have an obligation to fulfill at least 60% of the promises I make I take out the mega fan but this time explore the sewers further and find just what I need insecticide but it's being guarded by two plumbers one's wearing red and one's wearing green and this is a Mario and Luigi Easter Egg I don't really want to kill two of gaming's most iconic characters so I throw a can of dr. pepper great copyright dodge into Mario's head but he unfortunately sees my face I then do what Bowser couldn't and throw a screwdriver into Mario's head ending his 39 year reign of fear I don't want Luigi to wake up to this mess so I do the ethical thing and give him the exact same treatment looking at the glass of fresh chilled h2o half-full Princess Peach is now single and I've always wanted to see what was under that pink dress wait why is she wearing sunglasses at night does she have a big D only one way to find out I guess anyway with the light fixed the crew kool Craig black to come down which he does he tells me about the book for a while and words can't describe how much I wish he'd stop talking I then get my photo and he poses like I used to with the lads when I was 13 years old well he's busy getting some solo shots done I pour the insecticide into the smoke machine and just like that I knock everyone in the vicinity unconscious it's an absolute mess in here some of the crew have even fallen out the door and security is about to investigate I managed to drag Craig away from the scene take his clothes and throw a screwdriver into his neck which is weirdly becoming my signature move I am now a fantasy romantic fiction novel writer can I get a heck yeah in the chat gamer I briefly stopped by the book launch so I can experience the life of the rich and famous but no one really cares I wasn't expecting a bj or anything like that but a butt slap wouldn't go as Drey I head down to the meeting spot and brother Akram arrives punctually which I appreciate he also seems to be a fan of the x-factor which is cool I guess not really my show of choice because you can't win unless you're a biracial orphan with a speech impediment anyway I've now got the sample but I need to wind things up here with brother Akram as everyone thinks I'm Craig I just follow him to his top-level apartment I then literally just ring the doorbell and he answers for an international criminal he should probably practice a little bit more caution I do however simply love what he's done with the place and those circles are perfect if that's freehand my boy has a real talent for sketching with the job complete I make a move to leave but then the agency says the illness has spread rapidly to other locations I could make many references to real worldly events here but last time I did that it didn't go too well for old pellicano I'm immediately sent to a medical facility in Japan to take down patient zero Owen cage before he can infect anyone and also Klaus who's trying to weaponize the nasty bug additionally I request the agency smuggle in an assault rifle for me and they tell me it's in the laundry room sexist alright so I know we're on the verge of total societal collapse but this is a stunning location for a medical facility you've got to enjoy the little things in life I'm told I need to act quickly before this thing spreads so there's no time to be humane well there probably was time but this is far more cinematic I grabbed a guards disguise and make my way down to the building and the disguise seems to be falling most people just like I managed to fool girls into thinking I'm an okay guy then they find out I sit around playing video games all day and slapping my mates asses after they find that out they really want me anyway long story short this pilot seems to have been infected and he coughs and infects may this is just like infected from Call of Duty accept less twelve-year-old saying that they plowed my mum after they throw a knife into my eyeball my contact says there's an experimental cure in the stem-cell storage facility so I head over to check it out all May than a late guard disguise first and it's becoming apparent that many staff members are now carrying the disease I proceeded to take the entirety of the only known cure all for myself the sames unbelievably selfish but hey you've got to learn to love yourself before you can love others and now with immunity I head into the operating theater and find Owen Cage my agency says it's spreading rapidly in fact I now have to eliminate 30 people everyone is catching and spreading this thing it's getting completely out of control there's so I forego any sort of procedure and just start taking down the infected when they're by themselves not even bothering to hide the bodies as they need to quickly stop this thing I've basically opened the king jong-un handbook here it sure is a grim time to work in a medical facility in the Hokkaido mountains honestly a stunning location but I'll stop at nothing to end this madness well I mean I do briefly stop to try and get a well-deserved pedicure but the dumbest Seuss won't go near my feet which is pretty hurtful anyway yeah the gloves are well and truly off now as full-on gunfights break out between the guards and me I take down so many people and then naturally check to see where the infected level is at despite all my hard work it's tripled so of course I go and grab my assault rifle from the laundry room and this mission literally turned into a kill everyone challenge I've never seen anything like this in the Hitman series before so a very unique but strange mission cool concept though I just don't know how I could meaningfully commentate an entire video where it's just a whole lot of glorious doom action says the dodgy melaka who just spent eight minutes setting up a romantic teen fantasy fiction novel photo shoot eventually I get down to the last infected and it's just some mad lads still working away trying to fix this snow groomer a bad luck chief if only there was some kind of cure for this but yeah I'm a greedy thick boy anyway yeah we contained the outbreak and it's a JJ mission complete so agent 47 is a hero in the end only a one-star mission rating though and you know given that about a hundred and fifty civilians died I'm not too mad about that thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
