[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with GTA online if you enjoy this video please become a criminal sketch artist and regardless of what the victim describes just draw my Pelican logo as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men are retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so remember last video when I said I had something special planned for the overpriced tugboat I purchased well it's time also congratulations to ex deed ready for winning the boat naming competition for his suggestion of BDSM the Big Daddies Somali means of transportation I like the acrostic poem nature of his entry plus it shows at this channel we are sophisticated and care about contemporary literature you might have also noticed I'm sitting on 3.7 million dollars and that's because Rockstar have given out a lot of free money lately so we'll spend that shortly but first it's time to have ourselves a wholesome little pirate war I have a mission briefing with the soldiers in the hot tub which just looks red-hot seven pasty white guys sitting around one girl of the gaming industry is no joke as it's now bigger than the movie and the music industry combined therefore it's only a matter of time before the likes of browsers start cashing in on a new gamer category for adult videos this one would be titled twitch thought invites stream moderators to hot tub but then she'd just sit there looking thick and the seven guys would just respectfully observe her and then proceed to give her their entire fortnightly wages anyway back to pirate war basically the rules are there are two tugs four people per team Meli weapons only and yeah just a fight to the death I pump up my team by telling them that if we lose I'll cry hysterically and then we get ready to engage it's moments like this that really define a person and with the fresh sea breeze on my face we charge into battle at an awkwardly slow pace we all board their ship and they board our ships oh what a sick engagement I then accidentally climb over the railing into the blissful blue water and I'm subsequently stabbed immediately in my jugular vein and died Wow not exactly what I was hoping for but we head in for round two I think this is genuinely as close as I'll ever become to being a Somali pirate and I must say it's quite a special moment in my life as I have a real soft spot for the sketchy lads I'm actually thinking of setting up a charity especially for the Somali pirates out there you see with the large cargo ships now often having private security guards the Pirates are simply no longer able to board and infiltrate them and it makes me sick these Pirates have families to feed and so if we don't band together and start giving them better weapons and maybe even like a couple of ah-1 Cobra attack helicopters I think in a couple of years the profession will no longer even exist so yeah back to our fight we had some pretty good battles it was a lot of fun one team tried to defend their luxury yacht and we had to board it there's a lot to be said for putting down the guns and instead using blades to slash each other to bits it just seems more personal I then start using my handheld laser gun and know everyone down with these I also ask the good people if they could ceasefire and pose for a thumbnail for the video which they very kindly do of course this was a rose as I proceeded to throw a sticky bomb completely bamboozling these legends in one of the cheapest plays of all time a night man multi kilvo I can't wait to put this clip in my five hundred thousand subscriber montage featuring heavy dubstep and a lot of over-the-top editing the seriously though thanks for 500k that's actually insane I'll do a special video very soon anyway with the pirate war finished it's time to get back to official Suns of virgins business I then get even more money gifted to me by Rockstar and I've decided to spend it all this video we actually somehow have four point eight million dollars which is the richest I've ever been on this game and I didn't really earn any of it I feel like a trust fund baby and it's actually really nice not going to lie I wish one of my uncle's or auntie's in real life was a billionaire but no luck stupid middle-class family I feel more victimized than those poor Somali pirates who dared to dream so yeah there's some huge developments do you remember Maddy that I met playing Daisy you know we were exploring together but then she died of starvation so I ate her corpse for sustenance well we're friends now she's basically one of the boys now but with a vagina so I guess like a girl anyway today is her trial to join the sons of virgins where she'll attempt to complete a series of exciting and dangerous challenges that we loosely make up as we go the first thing that he does is steal my red Subaru Outback women in a nutshell am i right fellas haha they'll take your possessions and all your money gold-digging haha ball-and-chain go back to the kitchen classic banter very funny content like and subscribe anyway I take her VW Golf and for a compact car it sure does have a lot of speed emic talk talk I head over to meets del Toro beau who has literally paid hundreds of thousands of dollars so that he can drive the exact same normal car he drives in real life some people design their dream supercar but not Robbie he's all about that immersion well that being said his avatar is actually a woman but now that we have a real woman he sort of just seems sexually confused I head up to my casino penthouse so that we can hold the job interview but then remember my penthouse is [ __ ] so we head to Maddie's penthouse instead I walk in and I'm immediately greeted by a Greek goddess twerking statue I don't often appreciate art but this particular piece resonates with me in a special way she also has a lamp that has a small stripper dancing on it all the water you can drink which is a huge play as staying hydrated is paramount and even a movie theater this robot movie really is getting quite raunchy I can't show the exact part because it's well porn but the little wife pleasure bot gave synchronized hand jobs to two other robots I was so disgusted that I could only watch it another six times I also man spread because this is a society we sit down interview style but Maddy doesn't have to worry about impressing Robbie on me she needs to worry about Crosby who arrives shortly afterwards kidding he's quite a laid-back guy I was just trying to make it seem more dramatic let's just say if she can pass the challenges the first stop is hand-to-hand combat where she must have faith one of us in a rooftop brawl the question is who will she find it makes a lot of sense that she fights Robo as seeing two girls virtually brawl in a video game will probably be the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me I count down and they're off and it starts off incredibly one-sided as Matty continually beats Robbie with absolutely no response it's actually one of the most brutal things I've ever witnessed and potentially the fastest to knock out in a GTA 1v1 history so well time for the next challenge I guess I go to parachute off the building because it would be cinematic and then Crosby machetes me for no reason so as dick man used to be an assassin it makes sense that Matty must assassinate someone and naturally I pick Crosby because that machete thing wasn't an isolated incident we have quite an abusive relationship he told me that if I ever rat on him he'll take full custody of the kids we don't have so yeah I send a message to Matty saying her next task is to assassinate Crosby 7 8 8 5 is she ops for using a DeLorean which is an interesting play firstly doing several flips - I guess flex on me that I drive around on the ground like a bloody uber driver Crosby is inside los santos customs designing his dream vehicle and as he exits she explodes him with two missiles completing the second challenge alright it's time to up the stakes a little bit here you see the problem is Matty used to be a competitive Call of Duty player so she'll probably beat me in any shootout so I opted for something outside the box our little games annex field depressed trophy housewives play called tennis Australians actually have a rich history with the sport and you might be familiar with our number one sporting hero Nick kurios watching him play tennis is like combining Wimbledon with the toxicity of a 2007 Call of Duty Lobby anyway if my misogynistic uncle has taught me one thing it's that men are better than women at everything no I'm kidding just sports and humor wow I'm really pushing it today but I figured now Maddie's here it's all kosher right anyway if anyone thinks I'm serious they can just smoke some crack Andrey watch the video all right so tennis I start strong but Maddie's superior hand-eye coordination comes out on top and she starts to smash me I start to go try hard and she's just laughing and winning with ease so yeah we play her first two three and she convincingly beats me it's like Maddie's gaming career and I guess her entire life has been building to this initiation because let's be real joining the sons of virgins makes being knighted by the Queen look like a medieval fetish Kurt suitor even made an entire TV series loosely based off us called Sons of Anarchy even using our logo and everything so we are clearly quite an influential group well we've been busy enjoying the most popular racquet sport many of my legendary viewers have joined the lobby and are hanging out with Robbie and Crosby it makes her next task quite simple assassinates said legendary viewers I go and meet them and we all sort of just stand around chillin on our phones just like people do in real life so even more immersion I'm so immersed right now in this sewer I then drop a frag grenade for the Bance and split this kills one person and also destroys someone's personal vehicle so I lose 20k a Crosby then starts beating me which I frankly probably deserved this time I then majestically leap to safety as Maddie uses a rocket launcher to kill everyone completing yet another challenge not bad at all but it's time for the final hurdle that will decide if she joins the gang or not this is a challenge that truly separates the weak from the strong hand-to-hand combat with a freight train as a test Robbie tries to fight a train and predictably it doesn't go that well at all I'm not even sure if this challenge is entirely possible or so I thought in one of the most bizarre GTA online incidents I've ever seen Maddy squared up with the train and I don't know the game glitched out or what but I couldn't believe my eyes kidding she died immediately it's a freight train so yeah bad luck you're not in the gang better luck next time Robbie then starts trying to shoot me and so of course I returned fire and managed to gun him down because that's just how it goes this video is about to take an unexpected twist as we load up minecraft for a second remember if she doesn't play the craft she doesn't get the shaft I load into Maddy's world and this place is absolutely poppin off I think it's finally time I make the natural progression to becoming one of those super family-friendly channels that reviews people's minecraft servers as you can see we have Frye from Futurama of the boys boys boys from Dragon Ball Z Kenny from South Park and finally over here we have wow this is suddenly not family-friendly really though what I'm here to show you is this absolute masterpiece from right to left it's Robbie me and then Crosby all chilling with the Pelican logo and everything at night the award for being the number one educational Christian music trophy lights up and it's beautiful so yeah obviously I'm kidding Maddy is officially a son of a virgin and it's a great day for everyone now though there's the matter of spending the 4.8 million dollars I somehow have a mast but you see I'm not really sure how to spend at all so I asked you legends via my Twitter poll how you think I should and well the results are as shown 2150 votes and the mega yacht won by a significant margin I know yachts are basically just a huge flex but hey the good people of this immersive community have spoken and they're currently on sale there are three tiers of yachts so I purchased the middle one to save a bit of money but also as it reflects my content mid tier I also buy a Mustang or at least the closest GTA equivalent I can find as it's my favorite car in real life I then pour heaps of money into it like a bus to make sure it looks poppin and overall I'm really happy with the results it slides around heaps so it's fun to drive I guess the only real problem is that it's kind of hard to operate the gear stick with a huge erection next up I obviously have to go and check out my yacht and she's a real beauty I can't wait to visit this a total of three times and then realize it's in an inconvenient location what a great use of 4.2 million dollars I decided to name the big girl Moby thick so congratulations to Xeon ray for this suggestion just like XD dready who named the tugboat you win nothing tangible but hey still pretty okay I have my own yacht now and so we'll definitely be seeing what we can do with that next video so I can validate the purchase otherwise I hope you legends are having a good weekend thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
