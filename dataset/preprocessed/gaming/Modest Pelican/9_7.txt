a grand theft auto has a lot of exotic fast cars but do you know what's arguably better a bus i purchased one for 500 000 and decided to improve the public transportation network the problem is it's hard to get people to actually hop into my bus as my character looks like a chernobyl survivor who went suit shopping despite the difficulties i kept driving my bus routes and managed to pick up several lucky passengers the second issue is once people see a few lads riding in a bus together they destroy us with lock-on missiles i was targeted so many times i honestly think bus drivers should be considered a vulnerable minority one cold night i was putting in a big shift behind the wheel and a guy called eatswa hops in the big man gave me directions and all of a sudden i've achieved my dream of becoming an actual functioning bus service as i drop little eatswa off at the mechanic i start to believe that maybe there's hope in this moment of solace i am blown up yet again by a guy called twitch no kills no kills more like no women ever loving you because you're dead inside but jokes aside i did murder him for revenge several times i just kept murdering this guy so that he'd learn not to disrupt the city's meticulously planned bustline commuting roads i tried to make him quit but he took the beating like a 60s housewife i slapped him so many times the man's kill-death ratio must be lower than his self-esteem no remorse for bus killers then like an angel descending from the heavens a player called duffy hops into my bus duffy and i make memories together as we drive around the city we commit vehicular manslaughter on those who don't join us the sun begins to set as we drive down the pier i proceed to drive off the end so that my bus dives into the water by some miracle duffy survives the crash and so i swim over to him and punch him repeatedly until he drowns in the ocean i've uploaded 52 episodes of the gta online sons of virgin series to youtube when i started i had no idea how deep it would go but thanks to your support here we are i sometimes get overwhelmed looking at the numbers as i'm just some guy who talks often in poor taste it is however time to end season 1. this series has been calling out for a soft reboot and i've got some ideas that i want to try out for season 2. so pour yourself a glass of water sit back and enjoy this intro for the last time meet thick man a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories i hop into my lamborghini which is just the poor man's commercial bus and drive over to pick up stealth omado we are going to finish helping dr dre recovery stolen music today so it's exciting i drive to my office head upstairs and then mado has the audacity to man spread on my armchair there's only two kinds of people who man spread in this world neo-nazis and men who don't want to crush their balls i think we both know which category marto comes under we've got a lead on the music and so we fly out to meet our contacts they ask us to get into their suv which seems odd as we have a helicopter we happily do it anyway because these guys are associated with the families gang anyone who's even slightly related to cj and grove street families is alright by me we roll up and our goal is to steal these drug dealers van it's honestly pretty nostalgic rolling with the lads in green and then to my shock and horror one of the homies dies this brings back so many painful memories the san andreas dead homies halo dead marines battlefield dead franchise needing to escape i hop into the van with moto it seems to be filled with barrels that have what i can only assume is acetone in them either these drug dealers needed to get a lot of nail polish off their hands quickly or they were going to make ecstasy then delivered and mission complete mato and i realized that if we're going to be rolling with these lads we need to get some fresh trims and also represent some gang colors mato decides to go for a classic sophisticated cut the blonde medium afro perm type king i consider changing up thick man's style but i feel anything other than a bold top would be insincere to my character the character i made up and didn't copy off another franchise next stop is the clothing store now trying to make our characters look like they belong in a gang was not easy it took a long time but after a lot of blood sweat and fashion chat we did it yes how's your bottom your top half gravestream that's a nice it's just a nice shirt suddenly i don't see where this in real life it's actually quite quiet the sons of virgins plus grove street plus ratio plus you fell off i'm not even joking i'd be more scared of our characters than regular gangsters if i saw them in real life mato looks like he would eat children not for sustenance just to treat himself it's time for our next mission i fly the conveniently green chopper over to meet the lads and then crash right in front of them they don't say anything about the embarrassing mishap which is unbelievably polite the first thing they teach you in the hood is social etiquette they then ask us to help kidnap a guy we follow the gps to the destination and then i realize we're heading to grove street mato pulls up all cinematically except just kidding he pile drives the suv straight in there rolling it and crashing several members of each side alpha as heck we've got the ballers and the families fighting it out together anyone who plays san andreas is extremely happy right now i guarantee it i know i like to banter rockstar a lot but this mission is absolutely fire i pull out a laser gun and start welcoming these gangsters to the future if i was some guy who sold pee on the corner and was just roped into a gang fight and then a bald malacca and a christmas sweater started firing a laser i'm out i'm pretending to be dead or straight up running away as soon as a laser appears that's where i would call it we bail from the cops and then our boy sees some blood on the ground and then he remembers that he's sherlock holmes and determines that the guy we need must have run to this specific shed it's a pretty grim sight a man on his knees begging for his life i help our boy out with the interrogation by flipping him the double bird which is sure to hit him emotionally pretty hard he spills the beans and tells us where we can find another gang called the los santos vargas or the yellow boys that sounds racist but it isn't they just love yellow i mean who doesn't it's a versatile color my lambo is yellow and it hugs the ground making it the perfect car to annoy mado oh my god it looks so comical we arrive at the hangout and the purple ballers we just fought are even helping us now not many people know how forgiving american gangsters are it warms your heart sure we killed a few dozen of their men but then we explained it was to recover stolen music worldstar hip-hop keeping the peace our backup then just teleports away which is unfortunate on the positive side mato and i were having a great time blind firing our uzis pretending we were in the game it's easy to be a hoodlum you just have to shoot your guns without looking down the sight be really forgiving and put your arm on the window like this even if you're being shut out we track down the car that's got dre's stolen music and the glove box i guess marto then insists we eliminate the remaining vagus boys while doing mad skids which i think we can all respect while we're in the zone we even cap a few bus drivers to reduce the competition thick man is the only bus driver on these streets we deliver the stolen music and get paid nine thousand dollars we however don't get the big paycheck until we kill the guy who stole it which we will do mato goes afk to speak to his girlfriend which is pretty cringe and then i notice a payphone is ringing pretty cool they've brought this back as this is how you used to get all your missions in the first few gta games it's franklin on the phone and while he talks a long-ass cut-scene plays showcasing all the different angles of thick man but franklin gives us an assassination job and tells us that he had to use the pay phone as the government is listening i mean i do literally share an office with this guy so maybe he could just whisper in my ear it'd be more efficient and safer we drive down to the target's location and a girl just hops into my car this is what it must feel like to be the owner of a lamborghini i guess but i'm not about to have pre-marital relations and so i cap her for jesus my christmas sweater glows in the dark making it wildly and practical but undoubtedly drippy mato and i take up a position on the roof and cap all the targets making 15 000 and a whole heap of memories i'll cherish forever we head back to the office and there's a cut scene with dr dre and he still really wants to kill the guy who stole his music ignoring the criminal justice system and bringing back the death penalty for stealing i like where his head's at meanwhile this is the best cut scene ever because lamar is trying to pitch his new weed strain to dre it's beautiful it's also time to hunt hey bro inside we get a call that dre is being jumped at his recording studio and so we head over to help out we arrive and all the security have been taken out this is the true hip-hop life imagine if i became a rapper what would i even rap about i started youtube the hood of the internet for a snack i'll nibble on some bruschette i ask permission when i take out your daughter but i'll dump the big girl if she doesn't drink water i have no musical talent whatsoever we kill all the hitmen and dre says thanks worst part of this is my christmas sweater is now covered in blood we party for a long time seamlessly blending into our surroundings it's now time to kill dre's arch nemesis who's called johnny guns which might be the coolest name i've heard in a while honestly i'm kind of on his side i realize i need some better weapons as i haven't properly upgraded them in like 25 videos mato and i purchase ourselves some heavy rifles and they actually go pretty hard but franklin then calls me on his mobile and tells us where to find and how to kill johnny guns i guess he only follows payphone protocol when it's a side mission because even the government wants to see dre survive we roll out to find mr guns and eventually locate him in an old rail yard as soon as he sees us he bails which is understandable as we're grove street personified right now we then teleport into a train cart and slap all of his soldiers with our heavy assault rifles look away if you're not good with sad things but my lamborghini was destroyed in the action we chase after johnny guns and mato even manages to clip another bus driver because he's an inspirational guy johnny's car is outside an airport hangar and we proceed to trash it which ends up looking way less cool than i'd hoped we fight hundreds of his men in the hangar they are in cars and i tried to steal one but the big girl locked the door which is amazingly organized of him of bullets flying in every direction as your comrades are getting moaned down by heavy assault rifles but security first we find johnny and fill him with bullets which he takes like an absolute champion dre said not to kill him and i think it's nice that a rapper of his stature is practicing a little charity if those with power don't turn the other cheek every now and again then what hope does the common man have of earning forgiveness i'm kidding he brutally beats johnny guns to death with his golf club he then climbs into our car declares himself in charge of the music puts on his own song and orders us to drive him to a country club this is where i could have unironically used a bus the funny thing is this was meant to be a banging drive to one of his new songs but the sound glitched out so we all just sat there in silence it was awkward he gives us an approving nod and we give one back the language of alphas i've also never really noticed how hairy mato's chest is but hot damn he keeps it tight mission complete and one million dollars in the bank making a satisfying end to the dre saga i'm excited to have a bit of fun with this series for season 2 and once again thank you for the support if you enjoyed this content i appreciate a like otherwise i love you and see you soon bye
