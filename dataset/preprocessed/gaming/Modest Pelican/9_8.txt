welcome to grand theft auto 5 expanded and enhanced which we're sure will revolutionize the way you game players have been asking for an extension to the map so we thought we'd do one better than that and completely overhaul the menu system we know that players don't really want exciting gameplay improvements they want better menus look how good these menus are that's money well spent it doesn't stop there though we've got other amazing changes you just might not notice them we improved the graphics at least i think we did it's hard to tell i'm sure the frame rate is a little bit better maybe who knows but did i mention the new menu system is slick and efficient wow don't worry you'll be able to transfer your old gen character to the expanded and enhanced version of the game well i mean maybe we might corrupt your character during the transfer so that you lose years of hard work lol you see we've realized that we don't actually have to make new grand theft auto games anymore we can just keep releasing gta 5. this was the fourth time and all we really did was uncap the frame rate we got our intern kevin to do it he's a great guy who's good with computers thanks kev grand theft auto expanded and enhanced buy this for no reason so that we have even more time to make gta 6.
