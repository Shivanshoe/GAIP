[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with JTA online if you enjoyed this video please write to the appropriate American government Department and ask them to change the Statue of Liberty to a giant well-endowed Pelican as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times if these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories all right we are making moves today because we're going to finalize the setup of our multinational family-friendly narcotics operation you see I'm running low on cash and I've got to generate more revenue so I'm excited to premiere our summer marketing campaign called crack for the elderly it's a no-brainer as they're not only wealthy they also have a lot of free time to smoke a little crack first I had over to meet the lads at the casino this is basically the designated meeting spot now because you get to spin the wheel and I'm lucky enough to win $50,000 this brings our total account balance to $50,000 I'm so poor I can't even afford to pay respects by pressing out at least stealth Oh Cabo is here to lighten the mood he's still pretending to be a 60s gangster sort of like how I pretend that I'm not an ironic Lee pushing a communists agenda we beat each other a little bit but then realized together we are a far stronger force stealth Amato arrives in his combi van with a surfboard on the roof but the only thing he's surfing is an impressively vast range of softcore Christian anime we can't just stand around pranking each other though because grandma needs a fat line of freedom the so before we head to our new operation I need to sell some coke that's been cooked up at the lab I think it's pretty damn beautiful how many young kids play this game because it teaches them valuable life lessons like to never get high on your own supply and that to be a successful dealer you need to have great organizational skills and ensure you get a good night's the good thing about selling to the elderly is that they'll die soon anyway and of course a hundred and twenty six thousand dollars in the bank this is good money but we simply made a lot more the lads asked if I want to see their new cars and this quickly becomes quite a hurtful exercise as they exclude me from their retro comet gang they call me names like red boy and small peepee red boy and annoying youtuber red boy really emotionally scarring stuff we decide to have a quick race before we head up north but then this raccoon mask wearing Malacca walks right up next to my car and gives me the rude finger I proceeded to shoot him in the head with my micro uzi I don't know what it is about this raccoon but on second thoughts I like his energy so I decide to invite him into the gang for a while he seems kind of unstable like maybe he should talk to someone but hey it's funny because he's a raccoon so as you know last episode I purchased a weed farm and it's time to get it up and running very exciting times now selling coke well that's a victimless crime especially to old people selling weed however is the devil's work as it not only makes your penis smaller as we've previously established it can literally just kill you instantly I mean I've assassinated people for money I've killed literally thousands of innocent civilians I've sold anything you could imagine but I never predicted that I'd become a legitimate 4/20 ganja salesman it's not very Christian but I want the money so I can buy several cars and houses that I don't really need so I'm at peace with it however the biggest problem with my weed farm is that there isn't any weed it's just an empty warehouse motto pretends to be a weed plant to try and make me feel better but it's just not the same I mean I appreciate his thoughtfulness but this mother can't even photosynthesize we need actual weed and fast I need to go and get the equipment and apparently the van is up at the old sawmill retrieving this van goes relatively smoothly this guy and his scramjet did sketch us out for a moment but I guess he was just bird-watching but besides performing dozens of pit maneuvers on the van he never shoots his missiles so I'll take the W and now the weed farm has fans and soon it will have plants we just have to wait a bit let's go farmers are so funny the way they nap on dirt roads like this but then I see an opportunity to complete my life's ambition of being a sick lad I steal this man suit and pick up the boys this may be the sickest stunt you'll ever see on YouTube this is what we do here we revolutionize the gaming world well like Elon Musk but rather than launching some lame rockets to space we launch epic boats into virtual lakes of opportunity motto asks if I can give him a ride to the mask shop and so I say I'll give him a lift in my deluxe oh now as you guys know I was the first ever prank channel on YouTube in fact it's widely known that I pioneered the entire prank genre we decide to prank these guys by attaching a sticky bomb to their car but we get the timing all wrong and motto just explodes one of them while they're looking directly at him and get pranked big girls I give that prank a 9 out of 10 I love how the owner of this mask shop is just sipping his soy latte not even slightly fazed by the total chaos happening in front of his very eyes you've got to respect the mask selling hustle it turns out motto wants to become the raccoon guy he wants to steal his entire look and I must say he's done well this is blatant identity fraud but it's hot as hell because they're Acuna I've in see him throw a sticky bomb on my car but I pretend like I don't notice motto asks if we can fly out to my yacht but I finesse him and bayo just in time said if he explodes himself and not made irate his prank 3.5 out of 10 all right the wait has surely been delivered now so it's time to go and check it out and carbo insists that the fastest way to get there is his scramjet he's about as good at flying this thing as I am at obeying the tenth commandment thou shall not drink thou churches holy water to hydrate ourselves Crosby has now logged on which is welcomed but it's bad news for a [ __ ] boy as there's only room for four I thank him for his services today and then naturally I have to kill him but the problem is which one is the real stealth Oh motto it's virtually impossible to tell luckily this isn't my first reckon killing and I simply read their gamer tags and put down misters I fart good night sweet prince wow this is kind of sad but look at all this weed this is how World War two ended the Allies simply sent a bunch of weed to the Germans and they smoked it and Dole died we are not the makers of history we are made by history we've even got stuff now like this guy who sprays the weed with Ajax spray and white and this is crucial for growth we all stand around him and there's sort of a sexual vibe in the air which is warmly welcomed I'm not so sure about this guy though he seems to be pretending to smoke a joint and I'm just not on board with that all right so it will take a bit longer for the plants to fully grow so I decide to enjoy a nice flight in my deluxe so then BAM this server has hit level 10 toxicity you can't do anything without an unloved child shooting a heat-seeking missile at you so we decide to engage in a wholesome activity a pool party with the boys boys boys I get into my swimming attire but obviously the pants shoes and business socks stay on God's watching also my house has this dumb design where there's no path to the backyard so you have to walk through the plans it's basically deforestation and Wow stealth Oh motto just has to ruin my pool party we do eventually kick things off and I think this may be the straightest pool party bash that's ever been had just a bunch of bros giggling and splashing around in the Sun I purchased this house because it was the most expensive on the market but this patio is lackluster I must say so we decide to find a better spot to swim there's nothing classier than swimming at a country club so we head down there and this is what the boys and I need it has even drug dealers need to relax and get some vitamin Day every now and again we even raise some golf carts around well Crosby is clearly in a commercial sedan because there was only three golf carts but if you could use your imagination that would be very appreciated it begs the question though what's the only thing more gangster than for shirtless pasty white guys driving around an electric powered caddies that's right mopeds the stealth Oh Cabo introduces us to the glorious way of the moped this is also great as it fits our budget like seriously we as a group a dirt-poor right now that being said these mopeds do have their uses mark this date in your calendar as the glorious moped booty carnage of 2020 and this may be the most glorious thing I've ever been a part of in my entire life you've also got to appreciate how fast the commands arm is at slashing his machete the athleticism of the man is or inspiring and quite frankly this may be the pinnacle of my channel but then we dare to dream the double moped slash and dash the little engine of this sucker can barely move us forward but if this isn't motivating you to achieve your life goals I frankly don't know what will when America put a man on the moon an entire nation applauded but when the boys and I rode mopeds on the beach the entire world looked at each other and realized that we're all the same on the inside and world peace was achieved oK we've become incredibly distracted so we decide to do some repo jobs to make a little pocket money and needless to say repo just isn't our Forte motto somehow broke not only his helicopter but also the spare whatever the weight is probably grown now but before we leave the city I have a problem that needs fixing so this is my garage most of the cars are just the free ones you can get but I won this at the casino ages ago and I want to fix it up I really want a yellow street car and so I do my absolute best to customize the rapid GT pouring about $80,000 into it and it looks like a piece of crap I don't know what it is about this car but I hate it I suppose this is what parents feel like when they give birth to a ginger we trashed the car because it's disgusting but neither of us actually exploded because we don't want to pay the insurance premium if you could just imagine a cool explosion that'd be great a bowling on a budget I instead decide to customize the og elegir and it winds up looking pretty nice finally we can go and 420 blaze our way to a better future or more likely an early grave finally the plants are fully grown and now this place is looking ready to go also for clarification when I was at school our health teacher told us that weed would kill us and my mates and I have been naming that ever since no joke he also an ironically pronounced it marijuana and so now we all do that as well for a laugh I'm going to need you to use your imaginations again here and pretend these regular cigarettes are joints more importantly it's now complete we are now true blue American weed farmers only sixteen thousand five hundred dollars worth of product so far which literally gives me clinical depression but hey at least we're not selling this stuff directly to children although that could actually be quite lucrative anyway thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
