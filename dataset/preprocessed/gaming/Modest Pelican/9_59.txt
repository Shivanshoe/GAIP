[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoyed this video please date a single mother and try to bond with her son wait until that heartfelt moment when he finally calls you dad and then leave him with a note that says if he doesn't subscribe to modest pelican gaming you'll never come back and it will all be his fault as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so as there's a massive new update this week with a whole new island heist and submarine your boy needs a lot of cash i also love how a new offshore location is suddenly discovered and our first response is to invade and rob the residents of all their possessions well if nothing else it's historically accurate i also want to buy a terabyte because i have a special project planned so we need to start grinding my mate stealtho cabo will be joining us and i proceed to give him a good morning smooch with my hatchback but fortunately i built up a full warehouse of cargo on stream so we should be ready to make a sale right away i'm as surprised as you are that i'm actually getting organized before an update for once i swear thick man walks with the confidence of a man who sends unsolicited penny picks without even a sepia filter or tactical crop what a man i log on and sure enough we're ready to go the sale will be happening in international waters which is a smart move as laws don't apply out there or at least that's what my uncle told me when we used to go on all those summer sailing trips specifically 12 miles off the coastline they've provided us a boat and this is nice the two bros heading out to sea together on a dangerous mission i proceed to accidentally press x and swan dive off the upper deck with some absolutely exquisite form we meet the buyers and make the sale pocketing a cool 735 000 a great start next up is arms dealing this time they provided us with beastly monster trucks so that we can make nature submit to us and ignore the incel roads given how manly this moment is i feel as if i can open up about something i've been wanting to talk about for a while i can't be the only guy who uses his girlfriend's body washes that claps hard i was using some exfoliating tangerine cleanser last night like a king for years i just used a bar of hand soap but now i'm washing my face with some facial fuel energizing anti-oil cream i don't even know if my face was oily in the first place but i'll tell you one thing it definitely isn't oily right now anyway an easy 142 500 in the bank as we're in the middle of nowhere the game gives us dirt bikes to ride home on cabo and i attempt to create a cinematic shot and he proceeds to ride his bike directly into the lake this turned out to be a huge win though as he then had to firmly hold my waist while whispering flirty comments into my ear it wasn't weird it was just vehicle safety the next up is selling a little bit of that pure white charlie it goes absolutely flawlessly and we took it really seriously 168 thousand dollars in the bank all the jobs plus the grinding i did on stream leaves us with 2.24 million dollars do we buy a b11 strike force that's on sale do we buy an oppressor that's also on sale do we buy or like the video and subscribe poster these are getting lazy but yes and we also buy the terabyte because it has a function that is going to be very useful to me i try to get a cool shot of me walking up to the truck and carbo runs over me like a jerk and ruins it your guess is as good as mine as to what i did to deserve that yeah so not only is this truck solar powered so it can pretend to be a plant it can also scare other players for example using carbo as a test subject we can observe that he's rank 104 his favorite vehicle is the scramjet but most importantly he's had zero private dancers and purchased zero premarital acts of service my boy is christian and pure like a good gamer should be it is now our duty to scan each and every player in gta online to ensure everyone is as pure as cabo we tail a man in a wide suv and i give him a red hot probe to discover that he has received one private dance i feel like throwing up all over my computer what kind of sick dodgy malacca would scar his eyes with that filth i purchased this truck thinking that i would merely be double checking that people weren't corrupted but this is just disturbing of course i'm forced to eliminate twisty for his crimes against my strict ethical code he takes it really badly and retaliates and it's like bro i'm not the one who went out and got a virtual lap dance you did this to yourself we get the rig back up and running and find our next candidate he's got a futuristic bike and seems like the kind of upstanding citizen jesus himself would share a king's single bed with to my horror i discovered that he's also had one private dance but also paid to lose his virginity five times you're a sick puppy xd thomas 6962 and you will be cleansed for your sins i do appreciate the xd in the name though i'm not going to lie well at least we've purified the most promiscuous player in the server i'm sure everyone else will have abstained but no i wasn't ready for this i scan a player by the name of salty tryhard 433 who has had 38 private dancers and 38 physical encounters this man has spent most of his gaming time visiting women of the night someone call a local priest so we can get an exorcism happening as soon as possible for real at what point is it simply more efficient to just go to the hub and cabo and i both put a lot of bullets into this randy lad as he needs cleansing on an entirely new level i'll be praying for salty tryhard's family now i'm not saying that we deserve an award for our servers here today or that rockstar should call my personal phone and say thanks for helping to keep their servers family friendly all i'm asking is that as a small way of showing their appreciation they make carbo and i the two main protagonists for gta 6 that's literally all i'm asking we keep going about our business doing what we can it turns out people really don't appreciate atoning for their actions though and all of a sudden several disgruntled perverts have formed an air squadron and are continually strafing my truck through no fault of our own the server begins its inevitable freefall into absolute chaos our work here is done and so to celebrate we drink together until we pass out i then head down to the vanilla unicorn and get a well-earned private dance with my girl sapphire i'm kidding i would never be a hypocrite i'm an internet personality who can be trusted everyone knows youtubers always tell the truth so i log off and get on the next day and i kid you not i get twitch prime promotion benefits of 3.325 million dollars i noticed my prime account wasn't linked to my xbox anymore and so i fixed it and i guess this was all just built up this happened at the perfect time because if i had received this money many months ago i think we all know i would have spent it on useless items we now have over 5 million dollars which should hopefully be enough to buy this submarine in a few days time besides exposing people for their truly awful war crimes the terror bite does have some actual uses my boy jezo logs on and we decide to give her a run he's made his character look like ghost from call of duty it's funny because i don't remember ghost being a greedy randy little i'm kidding that was really uncalled for jez is a close friend of mine and a truly great friend in small doses i log on and we're going to stop a bank robbery not to save the day or anything we're actually going to rob the bank that is already being robbed it's smart because the police will already be there and so will a bunch of highly armed burglars i actually fail to see the tactical benefit on this one and then i proceed to get the terabyte stuck this is quite anti-climactic because i was hoping to take this new truck to the job but i guess we'll just take jezo's cheap walmart ass looking helicopter like chumps again uncalled for i'm sorry your helicopter is cool that was mostly jealousy speaking i can't imagine the life of a los santos police officer is a serene existence imagine sitting in the station and the beat cop reports in that two men in a military gunship just obliterated the entire lspd eastside response unit in under 10 seconds then the police chief is like yo big dog can you and your partner grab a pump action shoddy and a squad car and go and deal with that aerial threat not ideal the thieves have a juggernaut but using all of my video game skills i easily take the big girl down geez i'm better at this game than i am at dream daddy a dad dating simulator rated 9 out of 10 stars on steam with a surprisingly captivating plotline or at least i assume i would be good at that game i obviously haven't played it and completed 100 of the side quests that would be weird there's a woman still alive and it's near impossible to tell if she's hostile or not the game won't let me just straight up shoot her but fortunately i see things differently einstein's iq is supposedly around 160. mine is 10 000 so it's no surprise i managed to eliminate the threat we escape in the chopper and earn a cool 31 500 honestly i was hoping for more so i let out my frustration on the guy who he did business with to rub salt into the wound this random guy is running around in the rain without a shirt on trying to look cool i proceeded to use the juggernaut's minigun to take down the threat this has no relation to the fact that my ex-girlfriend is dating a surfer guy who looks a lot like this npc i am definitely not projecting my emotions right now i'm just making great epic youtube content jezo then launches an assault on me which is confronting it's partially my fault as i told him that me spinning my peni in a circular motion was a more impressive helicopter than his ever would be i can't recall the terabyte as it's still on the map so we have a four-star high-speed chase back into the country only for me to die meters away from our destination on top of that i forgot the big unit is still stuck so yeah exceptional youtube content right here not only was this truck released in 2018 i've barely been able to drive it we do a couple more missions like recovering a high-value briefcase which was wholesome we decided to only use the upper atomizers which was one of the better weapons i've acquired despite our brief moment of teamwork jezo immediately reverses it into a swimming pool so that it was stuck again at least this time in water jezzo's clearly been investing his money wisely honestly he's lucky the terabyte is stuck right now because if i scanned him i'd hate to see what he's been up to did you know you can get the escorts to like you faster if you flirt with them through your microphone while they give you a lap dance i've always hoped to hear someone chatting up a virtual stripper that would be so hot i mean funny comedic content for my videos overall a successful day we cleanse the server and have 5 million dollars ready for the update i'm pretty excited as this is definitely the biggest update the game's ever seen and i'll be hooking into it as soon as possible thanks for watching you legends until next time and as always stay oh classy [Music]
