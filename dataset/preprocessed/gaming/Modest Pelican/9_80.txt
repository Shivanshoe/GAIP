[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with gta online if you enjoy this video please ask your partner to call you subscribe to modest pelican gaming in the bedroom if they refuse simply sue them for negligence as this really helps spread the good word of my channel meet thickman a retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times these are the boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories alright there's a new update for the mega yachts and i just so happen to own a mega yacht i purchased it a while ago so i could fill a void i had deep inside of me and it worked thus proving that money does in fact buy happiness new updates are best enjoyed with some best friends forever so it's time to go and pick up the lads also what was i thinking when i painted this car green this ain't it chief i grab mato and don't worry if you're checking out robbo's avatar it's not weird we all do it anyone who thinks developing surprisingly serious lustful emotions for your bros female avatar is weird probably has real physical relations with actual women simps we grab the final lad cabo and robbo proceeds to shoot him in the head we all have that one friend who team kills like it was operation wykenga that's a pretty specific reference but basically in world war ii obama thought some warships were enemies and attacked them but they were from the same country boy i bet his face was red anyway there she blows the ss moby thick people think being a yacht owner is easy but it's not i have to act better than everyone else all the time because i am better than everyone else because i own a yacht it's exhausting trying to bring up that i own a yacht in every conversation walk a mile in my boat shoes big girl despite this the lads show a total lack of respect treating the deck like a boat car park a boat park i guess the joke's on them though because i have god mode controls where i can forcefully take off their clothes with one button consent is like kim kardashian's randy movie overrated we need to start these missions as apparently there's a spicy reward i head inside to talk to the captain he's a good man i like his hat and now it's time to begin i've always loved the cinematography of these walking out the door shots and yes robbo has a strawberry on his head again he also insists that he pilots the chopper and i'm obviously not going to argue with a thick strawberry so it is what it is i don't know why but this feels like a really wholesome moment we've gotta parachute down and take out some of the joyriders who have been causing a scene on their jet skis if there's one thing yacht owners hate it's a multicultural society i mean young adolescent males having fun but for real i genuinely don't understand how firing upon unarmed hooligans is socially acceptable but the important thing is we got them and carbo and i emerged from the water looking as moist and majestic as ever and now we have to destroy a rival yacht club's boats they have many guards but fortunately i'm a bit of a champ with the old ar and i make short work of the frankly pretty useless security personnel we then destroy all of the yachts and have to make a swift escape mato informs us that he's pinned down back at the docks and begs us to come and save him but it just feels like there's a lot going on right now so yeah rest in peace you gorgeous malacca thirty-two thousand dollars in the bank let's go we head back to moby thick and enjoy some time in the hot tub while robbo comes to terms with the fact that i've disabled friendly fire acaba accidentally left the organization so he can still murder him and decide to ask him various educational questions and if he gets them wrong he dies i will be uploading the live moments from this video to my second channel papa peli which i launched a couple of weeks ago yes i'm turning into one of those youtubers that shamelessly and frequently plugs their second channel cue that same shot again let's go okay we've gotta salvage some cargo from the bottom of the ocean which requires skill as diving is risky business but nothing we can't handle robbo proceeds to drown we gather all the cargo and then i tactically take out an enemy sniper who is perched up on the beach sorry hotshot but when you play with the big boys you always lose unless of course we drown ourselves as we head back to the yacht for some more well-earned straight boys time in the hot tub it becomes apparent that it's been overrun by hijackers who i can only assume are somali pirates as inspirational as somali pirates may be they've taken my captain and more importantly my bartender hostage how the heck am i going to enjoy monday morning mimosas with the boys if my bartender dies in a hostage crisis honestly kind of selfish on her part getting taken she should have hidden after trying to set up an epic rainbow six siege breach and clear moment for quite a while we eventually realize that they are in fact being held on the beach not on the bridge there's a small army defending them as well it's getting pretty hated now i'm not saying that you can put a monetary value on human life but at what point do you just take the l i don't think it would be that hard to find a new bartender and i've literally never even moved my yacht anyone could be the captain taking this into account i decide to take a gamble and just let bullets fly pretty risky but against all odds they actually survive so that's just great they both asked to take the afternoon off as personal leave and where do these [ __ ] think they work google get back to your workstations on my yacht because it's almost sunset and i'll be damned if the boys and i miss another glorious end to the day 42 thousand dollars in the bank this is genuinely pretty good money okay so apparently i misjudged the dynamic and we're actually errand boys for the captain now he wants us to go and help some of his rich yacht friends as their cars have been lit on fire of course we just call the fire department just kidding this is gta online we're going to steal the coast guard's planes which can dump water and put out the fires from above i decide to cover the boys in a buzzer attack chopper but i get a bit excited and let one fly straight at stealth omato which destroys the tulla the boys then demote me to taller pilot which is extremely belittling at least it's good to see that the coast guard is using the best aerial technology 1960 had to offer i'm pretty sure that's a browning machine gun mounted on the back so at least we can all sleep easy knowing our coastal borders are in safe hands on the positive side you can fill these bad boys up with water and then dump the water wherever you like this got me thinking and so i flew to the nearest pool i could find and proceeded to hydrate the good people of los santos from the air of course this water is chlorinated and i believe i just crushed that woman with my plane but my heart is in the right place nine thousand dollars in the bank you might be wondering why such a low amount well i got a bit jealous that the boys were flying together and so i did the mature thing and kamikazed them we celebrate with yet another hot tub session cabo had to go to dinner so we replaced him with a car terrible banter and it leaked oil into the water but quite frankly the best and only sex i've ever had the captain then asks us to go and get revenge on the people who kidnapped him he wants us to hit them where it hurts the most by destroying their air conditioning units this may honestly be the most underwhelming revenge game i've ever heard in my entire life it's like yo those guys forcefully took me against my will and put a gun to my head leaving me with unrepairable psychological wounds and for that they will pay the ultimate price of being slightly uncomfortable during summer 25 000 in the bank we're then thrown the biggest curve ball yet non-hot tub worthy weather where will we sit half naked together this is a real predicament and then bam we're attacked by the same dodgy malaccas whose air conditioning we just destroyed they've attacked us during a storm where's the class honestly though fair enough i don't like my captain he's a troublemaker and i think he's the problem this reminds me of when i had a friend at university who i played football with we were away for a tournament and i swear to god the amount of times he got himself in a sticky situation was insane at one point i was fast asleep and i heard this angry mob smashing on the door so being tired i let them in i'll admit poor decision making on my behalf but this entire team stormed in and my mate comes out of his room with one of their girlfriends and all she was wearing and cover your ears because this isn't holy but all she was wearing was a g-string he looks at this guy and is like bro nothing happened i guess some people are just gifted in the art of language because they left peacefully i'm kidding the boyfriend tried to kill him and we all had to pull him off it was pretty aggressive my girlfriend had to stand in front of him until they left while i cried in the corner i mean i also helped out i was really brave the point is my teammate was feeling sorry for himself and couldn't understand why this was happening the moral of the story is don't let an angry mob into your safely locked apartment and avoid pre-marital relations we defeat the attackers and pocket a cool 26 thousand dollars now as we are balls deep in my captain rather my captain's mess we will need to take down these kidnappers once and for all the plan is to use submarines to sneak up on their mega yacht and then take it down we're on the hardest difficulty and only have one life so executing this with precision will be key and god damn it who let mato fly the helicopter i guess because we all died at once it let us respawn which genuinely saves the friendship as i was about to unfriend him on xbox live we sail along in the submarine well obviously not sail so i guess drive whatever the right verb for submarine movement is is what we do there's some more world war ii inspired stuff you love to see it first things first i mess up his meticulously parked jet skis thus completing stage 1 of our attack the stage 2 is where we kill him and every single one of his associates quite an escalation in stages anyway this is where the boys are at their best tactically sweeping a watercraft i then accidentally dive off the side while trying to clamber which seems dumb at first but it draws my attention to the fact that their boss is no longer on the yacht an exciting water chase is the perfect finale to this little charade sorry champ but the only thing you'll be hijacking now is my balls on your forehead i don't really have anything for this but we nailed the big man 26 000 in the bank and it's now time to see what our reward is oh my god it's not what i expected but it's also extremely welcomed the girls love a man in uniform and if i don't say so myself i do be looking good in this outfit we have a couple too many drinks and stumbled downstairs where i take advantage of stealth omato i'm kidding we have a friendly nap and leave a safe 120 centimeter gap between us because god's always watching i know this yacht has like six bedrooms but still it's kind of cute right i also painted my yacht red which cost like two hundred thousand dollars but you can't put a price on beauty i also painted the neon too because i missed this car actually looking good the captain outfit actually does demand respect amongst players too which is a nice addition they shall call me captain daddy thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy
