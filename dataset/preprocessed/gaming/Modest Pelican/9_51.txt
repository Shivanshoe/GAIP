[Music] hi lads and lasses modest pelican here with the forest if you enjoyed this video please visit a graveyard and write cause of death didn't subscribe to modest pelican on people's tombstones as this really helps spread the good word of my channel i've always wanted to play this game and so i messaged my friend zany and asked if he was down and he said yes jeff he enjoys spelling my name incorrectly if this video gets 70 000 likes i'll make the forest part 2 and legally change my name to jeff with a j so we load in on a plane and my character is already raiding a survival guide that seems like a bad luck self-fulfilling prophecy but at least we've got a kid which is great not the parenting part i'm just happy that my avatar isn't a virgin like every survival game the plane crashes and we are knocked unconscious as i wake some man covered in blood is taking my child it's been like 40 seconds and so i haven't developed much of a relationship with the little malaka yet so honestly better him than me i awake for a second time and quite poetically the first thing i say is my kid's drawing i can't help but notice how out of proportion his stick figures are this kid can't draw for [ __ ] on the positive side i meet another passenger who of course is zany hey man you should you should see yourself man oh dude i got an axe or something oh dude me too kill it kill it all right bro i got one you got one i had i killed the bird nice bro two bros against all odds survived a plane crash together and now must outlast and conquer this god forsaken forest the game is also pretty adamant about us saving my son so i guess we'll chalk that in as a secondary objective if there's time i immediately slay some dinner for us and we also get our first glimpse of the ocean as we know in survival games it's crucial to be efficient on your first day because when nightfall comes it's never good i'm not a great judge of character but the man who stole my kid seemed like he had definitely eaten some of the other passengers we proceeded to drink our only two soda cans and then get a fire going to cook some meat oh your bird just landed on your hand what the feel it kill it kill it kill it [ __ ] i hit the fire bro oh god the meat oh the lips the meat's everywhere is it good what happened i don't know i think i'm just eating raw meat all right let's just move on let's move forward i feel like we need to we need to just that was a good learning experience what's this is that a head did you live yeah i'm alive i'm like i'm not bro i collected a human leg equip look what i'm holding as nightfall sweeps over it becomes immediately apparent that we have not had an efficient first day the fact our only light source is a bic lighter also makes things just that little bit more terrifying if you're wondering why zany's name is mullistan it's in relation to the german soccer player and absolutely not the high-ranking german official heinrich muller who operated during world war ii or so i assume unfortunately we find some hearts where we can safely spend the night and most importantly fresh water we both swear we can hear distant screams so rest in peace to my baby boy he'll have to show his disgusting drawings to jesus in heaven now morale is surprisingly high but little to our knowledge something was watching us from the darkness and voila no you brought light into our home i did see i told you man i'm a [ __ ] gamer yeah bruh there's people right here this is not sanitary man yeah did you hear that oh what the [ __ ] just take placo bro let go hit him ah all right so not a good idea staying by the cannibal area they came home pretty quickly didn't they we decide that spending any more time at the cannibal village probably isn't the smartest strategy most people's innate intuition would have told them that before they were savagely attacked but it's become clear that we need to build a base we construct a temporary tent for tonight which is quite small but it's fine because real bros snuggle it's a massive relief for the both of us to see that sweet sunlight as we head further in we find remains of where other passengers have tried to camp i arrive at the beach and it's a mess of rotting carcasses and suitcases from the plane i'm also somehow starving again already it's like my character is trying to bulk or something unfortunately sea turtles are everywhere and we proceed to massacre several of them it's kind of brutal but not nearly as brutal as when they lay their eggs on the beach turtle's failed evolution it's kind of embarrassing after hatching the little babies have to crawl all the way to the water while predators eat them like they were an assorted cheese platter once the babies get to the water they'll still probably get eaten but if they do somehow survive they begin what is known as the lost period where they disappear for 10 years 1 in 1 000 hatchlings survive until adulthood that's statistically a 0.001 chance the same chance a girl hits you back after you send them an unsolicited dick pic adult turtles are just successful dick pics and so i have no moral dilemma about harvesting their meat to cook up for dinner we decide to search the yacht and then build up a base on the cliff if the cannibals come again for us tonight we need to be better prepared i just got three snacks probably shouldn't have taken all of them that's right i'm literally starving to death well eat a snack or something we're just going to build a small cabin i like it it's safe it's a good view i mean it's a little misty around here i'll be honest with you bro but we're building a [ __ ] cabin dude dude that's two games today that i've played that doesn't it looks cool man the screams will never not be funny to me with the cabin built we at least now have a place to hide we proceed to build quite the camp and then have a genius idea if we can construct a staircase down to the water and build a raft then should things get out of hand we'll have an escape route we proceed to start grinding and i mean if a survival game doesn't have you hitting trees for hours at a time are you even immersed the construction mechanics in this game are surprisingly deep and so we decide we'll spend a few days here on the beach establishing a base of operations before we make a serious trek inland apparently i have to find my son but he does not understand that daddy needs to make a catapult that's not much danny but it's home coming they're coming they're coming they're here they're here oh god hat not the house defend the house said come here [ __ ] [ __ ] you yeah cop that the trick is just to become the cannibal you know brothers accountable just standing here oh bro there's a lot of them they're just watching me how many oh they're not just watching me bro [ __ ] catapult we can absolutely make a zip line from like here over there oh my god it would be insanely epic daddy they ate my leg yes son but look look wait i wonder it's caught a rabbit dude oh nice bro kill it yeah i think he's pressing just grab it oh i got it oh [ __ ] yeah i'll drop it oh no what the [ __ ] it was alive i i'm so i'm so sorry the base is pretty scuffed and we most definitely invested too much time and resources into the back stairs which were never actually finished it's okay though because it's time to build a boat to construct a raft we need four pieces of rope which is one of the rarer items to find in this game and is often in dangerous locations it'll be worth it though because we'll be much safer on the water i also learned that my son's name is timmy and i'm sure timmy wouldn't even want to be rescued if he didn't have a safe boat to draw his shitty drawings on plus the emotional scarring has surely already happened what's a few more days with the savages really going to change that kid's going to be a hot mess either way we continue further into the forest and stumble across a cave neither of us are happy about it but we know we have to go inside as the chance of rope being in the cave is reasonably high like we wait for daytime to go into a dark ass cave oh [ __ ] why what do you mean don't leave me in here oh oh where did you leave me what the [ __ ] is this i have to back out oh scared this is frightening man oh get out of here you dog glossing over the fact that zany left me for dead we forge forward and find another cave entrance it's just as creepy but then we find something interesting on the ground another one of timmy's drawings and again it's completely unbelievable this guy's spine is way too long and the blood is clearly just careless red scribble also why does the cannibal have hands and the dead passenger doesn't the inconsistencies are embarrassing oh my god oh god is that our son he's dropping cash yeah it was well worth exploring the cave as we found eight cans of soda but unfortunately still no rope we then stumble across some of the other passengers who aren't looking too hot it's obviously barbaric but these blood-craving psychopaths have far more raw artistic talent than my disappointment of a child we continue forward now a decent distance from our base we discover an enormous sinkhole of some kind and our character proceeds to write in his journal saying that we should explore it a bad idea and super lame keeping a journal i hope the cannibals bully him for that we realize that we'll need to make an outpost by these lakes as nightfall is close whoa you see those mountains in the distance danny you can actually explore them the mountain is not just a backdrop you can actually walk all the way to that knot sometimes the mate's like full and sometimes it's half i guess the size of meat we would have a rabbit someone did we continue destroying the forest's fragile ecosystem and build ourselves a suitable camp to spend the night we decide that today is the day we find rope even if we have to search the entire island a raft would be a game changer as we could navigate the rivers efficiently zan and i head out into the wilderness with our red axes and the tutorial guide still displaying on our hud we never completed it because seeing things through to the end is overrated we stumble upon another cave and then just climb straight down without a worry like most tourists who travel on aeroplanes we have both outstanding one-handed climbing technique and astonishing upper body strength at the bottom of the cave there isn't much but there's a rope we can both loot the rope meaning we have two of the four ropes needed rope collecting is epic gaming content rope we are geniuses oh new clothes whoa all right i have new clothes you got the you just got a suit on i have an interview with a cannibal chieftain oh yeah it's like this is human [ __ ] not cannibal [ __ ] yeah no there's a bible [Music] i am the survivalist here you really are surviving because i live in a third world country our outpost is proving to be quite a good investment but we need to look wider there's also a growing concern that the cannibals seem to be getting angrier and definitely more aggressive they used to sometimes just watch us from a distance but now they're all about violence they're also getting stronger as the days go on like these two big girls are slapping harder than the boys do at the pokies remember my video vlog i'm going to do another one with the boys soon anyway they're pretty interesting enemies as they seem to all behave differently zany charges at them literally every time though even when they're chilling but i love his energy we find a small village which has crocodiles that we kill for armor it's also got more bags from the plane that have rags and medication inside one of the strange cannibal hearts there's even red paint and so we paint ourselves red hopefully they now think we're one of them or something we're almost ready to give up on the rope but then zan spots some strange buildings in the distance we're hungry and nightfall is coming but we make the stunning and brave decision to check them out anyway there's like hanging ropes but we can't get them it's so ass no i got it i got it over here over here over here i won grab these ropes yeah yeah you can grab them you can grab them oh what no way that's soft we also need a lot of logs for the raft so we proceed to methodically chop down some trees now back to the hype as this is debatably one of gaming's greatest moments bro this is our moment this is happening we're about to [ __ ] go sailing it's just two more likes bro oh my god it's so beautiful you're looking for fish no i'm just gonna crouch like right at the edge of the raft let the rain hit my face yeah that's nice oh yes home sweet home it's like this [ __ ] is stuck completely unfinished dude we can hop to that stair from here though yeah yeah exactly yes oh my god it worked perfectly and then you just have to you just kind of have to just get a [ __ ] that is slipped off i'm not going to be winning father of the year anytime soon but i'll definitely be feeling that sweet sea breeze in my face this game is so fun thanks for watching you absolute legends until next time and as always stay classy
