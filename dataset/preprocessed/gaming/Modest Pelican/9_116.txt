[Music] hi lads and lasses modest Pelican here with GTA online if you enjoy this video please have a one-night stand and then wake up early and change all the pictures in their home to my channel logo as this really helps spread the good word of my channel mate thick men are retired assassin who is on a mission to become the most powerful crime lord in los santos whilst also ensuring he stays sufficiently hydrated at all times of these other boys boys boys and together they form a feared gang known as the sons of virgins these are their stories so I log in and get a million dollars gifted to me yet again Rockstar is officially my sugar daddy I think this million was for having my twitch Prime account linked or because one of the developers has a large big to water bird fetish either one anyway I'll never get sick of spawning on my yacht and oh how times have changed for old thick men remember the crack den and our old truck named Shaniqua feels like a lifetime ago and the thing is we've done a remarkably good job of buying useless flex items and a poor job of buying income producing useful assets all beer - the rooms on this yacht have seen a few sensual things if you know what I mean I've sad fact in all of them so today we are going to finish Trevor's heist and also check out the new f1 racers they added I head over to pick up motto but I heared the sound of an oppressors homing missiles locking onto me so I gracefully eject as it turns out Magoo see here is actually a pretty friendly guy and I guess just wanted to say g'day he's also got two y's at the end of his gamertag so you know he's indulged in a bit of premarital hand-holding the motto then proceeds to shoot him in the face with a shotgun for no reason I show motto my yacht as he hasn't seen it yet and he says and I quote I've taken dumps that float more majestically than your yacht well at least we get to have a pretty cute Titanic moment that I'll remember for the rest of my life okay enough of me trying to squeeze video content out of this incredibly overpriced ocean vessel it's time to hustle by hustle I mean it's time to do a Formula One race and I could just seamlessly Segway to the event but I'd rather show you what should be a normal two minute commute generally turns into but firstly I try to prove I'm above average size by flying under this bridge and it doesn't go very well then motto explodes the car I'm trying to get into like the dehydrated lad he is I then successfully managed to explode him with a vehicle bomb because he was having trouble with his game volume and couldn't hear the obvious beeping I then pop amato in the head with my silenced pistol he swears he will get revenge so I set up yet another bomb honestly I feel like this video is an application for a Middle Eastern radical group at this point I then pay $500 to go off the radar and sneak up on motto posing as a civilian he's now with poor innocent Crosby but collateral damage is always inevitable whoa haha we have fun seriously though our group has problems it's not like we all then got in a car and went straight to the f1 racing as planned a Crosby beat motto to death I Jack to this guys fancy scramjet and then used it to run over motto who saw this genius play coming and detonated us both I then stole a flying motorbike and while I was busy navigating proceeded to get blown up by a heat-seeking missile it's hard to be efficient on this game but we finally made it to the racing event as it turns out the guy hosting this race loves a bit of banter and so set the race up on the worst possible settings the 25 laps the first person only night time and it's raining it takes approximately two minutes to finish one of these laughs so we leave just like my girlfriend left me sorry I didn't realize your dad to count it as cheating anyway we find a normal race and I put $1,000 on Crosby to win because gambling is fun and safe I also have the worst possible start to a race where I'm physically ejected out of the course within the first few seconds what you're about to witness though is one of the best success stories of our generation in fact I've become so good at driving that I'd probably be the best GTA speed runner in the world don't believe me just ask two renowned speedrunner dark viper a you who isn't currently under duress of course pelican you are the best driver I've ever seen on behalf of the speedrunning community I thank you for not speedrunning as obviously you would beat us and take all the world records on your first try I also wanted me clear that I'm saying all of this of my own free will and not because pelican has me trapped in his basement haha Wow your words dark Viper your words but thank you you're far too kind anyway I actually managed to come in second place and Crosby comes in sixth place and so from this point onwards I will naturally never believe in him again after the race I find this NPC holding a bagel but he never eats the bagel he just holds it top ten things science can't explain right here and then motto explodes me because of course he would we decide to all meet at the casino as stealthy Robo has logged on and wants to show off his four-wheel drive again it's pretty cool he's taken the hood off to expose the engine which I can imagine is a nightmare for dust buildup heaps of players have also gathered around and so naturally I melt them all with my alien laser cannon because it's a balanced weapon everything in this game is perfectly balanced especially the orbital cannon we all have our wheel spin and fail to win anything well motto almost wins the car but fails miserably which I think we can all derive some enjoyment from the group of players that's following us around has reached quite a high level and so there's only one thing to do have a not very straight to game a rave session with the boys boys boys this sure is a lot of men in a very small space many of whom are wearing skimpy clothing and cowboy hats this is the definition of bros before hos almost taken too literally but it sure is wholesome and more importantly we are upholding strict Christian values then Crosby is just up here with this Sadie guy and I'm sure they're just praying for good weather or something we then pile into his gyms mowing truck and roll out ready to heist the gyms got everything now I swear the gyms fencing gyms Dog Wash the gyms people trafficking the gyms body disposal gyms abortions gyms castrations and my personal favorite Jim's wife where you just smash his wife and currently ten percent off - which is just smart marketing the so heist time we buy plenty of ammo and then I head over to my office building which I use for no other reason than to get free snacks off the receptionist every time I come here I'm reminded that I spent two hundred and fifty thousand dollars accidentally changing the name from an organization to our organization all right so we've done a lot of the preps for this heist - last video but now we've swapped Maddy Ferg motto as she's done most of the work yet he gets to reap the monetary rewards I'm just all about that immersion on this channel you know aligning the series with real life as much as possible so it's fitting that the woman of our group gets heavily underpaid also stealth Oh Robo has the word stank on his left cheek which is pretty hot all right so do you want to know how much of a novice Robo is at GTA online well even though we've tried to explain it to him he doesn't know how to call the insurance company when his vehicles are destroyed and currently they all are so the game delivered him a bike for this mission it's actually worked out really well for the boys boys boys as he looks benefit when he pedals I suppose those glutes didn't build themselves up and that's for sure half my grand theft auto content to these days is just a robos ass and I'm not sure if that's questionable or revolutionary we have to drive out to the lumberyard and steal some vans hijack a quad bike to make the drive more fun but as the boys are reckless and careless with their lives I decide to put on a baby blue helmet for both safety but also aesthetics as it really brings out my eyes also crosby manages to turn every game into farm simulator I swear I thought he just played that game ironically but it's past that point he is all about it now I read the other day that could be getting its own eSports League and I'd love to be the commentator for an event what's up guys it's your boy modest Pelican here coming at you live from sunshine farm we're going to jump on board with xx ultimate Donald's plowed your mum xx who's utilizing the Maisie Ferguson harvester and it looks like he's cleaning up here it should be a fruitful crop yield for the rookie who desperately needs it coming in to land finals anyway yeah Crosby and I have to steal these trucks well Marta when Drobo give us an escort in their poor man's warthog having these two on the same team proved to be an awful decision as if they weren't knocking one of us off a cliff they were literally killing each other I think it took us six attempts to complete this simple heist prep it was insane eventually they both just sat in the Utes cab and no one manned the gun for safety reasons this of course meant we had no cover for the mission and so we're left defending ourselves against the tactically questionable armored lime-green Range Rovers in fact we actually beat them back to the warehouse in the slow trucks by quite a margin the sick escort boys really crushed it today the post mission cinematic shots of what I get out of bed for not going to lie I try and run motto over on robos road bike and he explodes me which is probably what I deserved cyclists suck alright the final prep we have to go and kill a bunch of meth dealers out at some farm and steal their meth it's genius and maybe I should become a meth dealer I'm sure to be lucrative the modest Pelican meth it would however be hard to compete with Jim's meth he really dominates the market as he mows your lawn for free if you refer a friend anyway we storm the farmhouse and I really love what they've done with the place of the rustic aged look is captivating and the dried blood stains make it feel lived in I'm quite a hard to core to pull off very impressive we kill everyone hook up the tanker and deliver it to our lockup nearby I head into the remote convenience store and staunch the clerk's that if he gives me all the money after he gives me the money I shoot him because we leave no witnesses a Jay Jay heist complain that was rewarding haha just kidding is this prank YouTube channel because that prank sure was epic Wow we head to Cosby's apartment and start deciding on a split of revenue for the real hearts this doesn't equal 100% alright Ottavia school's only been shut down for like a week but Jesus Crosby has the last laugh as he gives himself a 40% cut oh wow what a power play we pick some questionable outfits and roll out we look like the minions to be honest no hate but I find it so weird the way people find a minion so hilarious I've seen grown-ass men and women crying with laughter watching some small yellow melaka be forgetful and then fall over jeez I feel like the Grinch actually I wonder if they have adult minion videos oh wow I just looked it up and they sure do you know how the main evil villain guy has a really long nose anyway it doesn't matter the important thing is there are sensual minion videos out there and also that I now have plans for tonight the so yeah we've got to defend this warehouse where we've been storing all the gear also trevor is here with us which is pretty cool once we hold them off we need to take the product to the sell point as there's a major buyer waiting and this time it's Robbie and me who have to escort the trucks and despite all of us explicitly opposing this he drives and funny enough it's a pretty wise decision as he really mastered the handling of this vehicle now I melt the choppers and yeah we are on the homestretch big money here we come I'm sure you saw this coming but no he flips the truck I do however somehow survive he dies shortly afterwards though you can't make this stuff up I obviously take the wheel for round two and then spot a guy on the side of the road so naturally go in for the splatter yes in 1930 round three what's the bike with the bike what's the bike so yeah morale is dangerously low but honestly how is this an off-road vehicle the smallest object sends it corkscrewing through the air seems like a major design fold we do eventually get the mission done not without a couple of close shaves though I'll never understand this NPC overtaking us you see a bald minion on the back of the Ute with an M mg and two black trucks on a sketchy dirt road and decide hey now's a great time to overtake don't become a statistic big go but we deliver the merchandise and what follows is a really cool cutscene and Trevor politely thanks us and then this happened hey my brother what got the drugs yeah if you came for what you ordered yeah good what are you selling me cocaine mr. Phillips why do you keep saying and how is it yep so the whole thing was a setup and the buyers were the cops we've all been there very relatable the important thing is I made two hundred and one thousand dollars which seems very low relative to the free million I got for doing absolutely nothing I decide to treat myself to a new car and I buy myself a sabre turbos a pretty average looking car right well I take it down to Benny's original Motor Works and have it changed into the custom version then it's no small expense I create a car similar to something South American gangsters might drive I guess I'm now officially in ms-13 Amato and I cruise around doing drive-bys exactly how I imagined ms-13 would a by flexing our hydraulics while we pop falls and listen to Ed Sheeran it's very immersive I do change the saber to something more clean and I really like it though this whole expedition cost me about 1 million dollars I need a financial adviser anyway I hope you legends are doing well to any of you working in retail or any essential services your absolute beasts and I hope you're okay oh thanks for watching and a massive shout out to those who support me on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
