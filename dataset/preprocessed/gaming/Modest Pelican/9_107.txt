[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with JTA are mine if you enjoyed this video please become a titty streamer and build up a mass following of simps and then instruct them all to subscribe to me as this really helps spread the good word of my channel ok so this isn't one of my normal sons of virgin's episodes because for those of you who aren't aware there's currently a war going on in servers around the world the war is between the green aliens and the purple aliens who for years lived at peace but have recently been butchering civilians and each other in the streets with clips of the conflict constantly going viral on social media it's sort of like The Hunger Games but funny out because even more children are dying as an average youtuber with an average sized Pini it's time I picked aside and do my part for Humanity it's a pretty big decision but come on green vs. purple this is clearly Grove Strait versus the bolas but as I'm Grove Street for life since I was 12 years old and accidentally said the N word because CJ was my role model it's an easy choice the 340 thousand dollars for a suit Jesus Christ I'm trying to meme here not single-handedly revived the GTA economy from this recession anyway mate alien 47 a relatively skinny white boy who put on a skin-tight green suit in an attempt to gain validation from his homies this is his gender fluid non-binary crew because they're progressive unless you're a non white male and together they form a feared group known as green gang these are their stories so I buy myself the suit and I don't want to flex but look at that ass boy immediately a purple alien gets out of an armored car and runs at me I'm low on health but high on bath salts so I figure I'll try to flee but these guys clearly take cardio seriously and I'm beaten to death in the local park Wow I mate up with some other green vajayjay quickscope is because strength in numbers I then spot the dodgy wannabe Barney who whacked me and move in for the kill here's a fun little life hack for you and the family whenever you need to kill someone bring your boys so that you can dishonorably beat as a group we also kill this guy and the wife-beater just because the objective is simple completely take over this entire server so that grain can finally have a private male only alien orgy I main pressure businesses into paying us protection money and selling crack to teams and insert other normal gang related organized crime things here we stopped off at the weapons store but as we're parking stealth osimo one of my actual mates pulls me out of the car I'm left fighting this guy with a minigun with my bare fists which goes surprisingly well just kidding it's a minigun this needs to be more orderly it's an absolute mess we organized to meet at my office building but on the way I paint my deluxe Oh green I also paint my laser cannon green everything green [ __ ] okay so the purple plague needs to be eradicated from the server it's almost as if I'm trying to emulate the beliefs of a certain fascist dictator with a mustache Colonel Sanders anyway I forgot to tell stealth amato we were doing this whole green alien thing today so he is just sitting on the couch in casual clothing looking like our pimp actually maybe that's a business opportunity a bit yeah this is one of the weirder moments I've had gaming and just sitting here watching educational anime with the boys we have quite a crew many of these people are just randoms we're not actually talking to on the mic but share our common beliefs what a beautiful moment for the green gang but the plan is simple we secure this server with brute force and that was already the plan so I'll just be honest the boys and I wanted to watch some risky anime the infidels either Flay or put up a pathetic fight as we quickly show that we are the superior race our force seems to only grow stronger as we operate as if we were one organism with one brain I just remembered this one time I said orgasm instead of organism in science class when I was a kid the teacher in an attempt to embarrass me said what's an orgasm then Jeff and I said it didn't surprise me that she didn't know because ain't nobody getting in her granny panties the entire class clapped and the principal even gave me a spell to Lord for being so stunning and brave just kidding I cried anyway I respect purple for sticking around despite being so outnumbered but it's just not looking good for them chief we simply have such a force we're even happy to borrow tactics from other cultures such as the often underrated suicide bombing I can confirm that when you engage in such tactics you do not get 70 virgins 70 wives and everlasting happiness in the afterlife you only get 65 wives and most aren't even virgins what a sneaky scam again I do respect purple they really tried but eventually they all leave the session we heard news than another much larger purple force was gathering in a different server but before phase 2 we must save her our victory the boys and I decide to have a little house party and I make a phone call to invite a very special guest over any of my longtime viewers know I used to virtually date this girl it was the most serious relationship I've ever had including my current IRL girlfriend of five years the one the only sapphire and look what she's wearing that's right to you purple chubs we're out here getting lap dances from your girl imagine getting bullied off a server and then one of your finest two lasses gives all the boys premarital lap dances on a damn Tuesday evening we all then take turns having naps while everyone watches because that's how you nap and also being well-rested is important imagine napping without having seven homies standing right next to you no thanks obviously we need to change servers and keep the fight going strong but it is just so nice to stop and smell the roses once in a while one of the lads organised a tour of the city and honestly I'm really glad he did we're all probably going to die soon and yeah just soaking it up I joined the new server and in the process lose a large majority of the gang a bit yeah we're here to defeat purple not thoroughly enjoy scenic bus tours so the person who told me purple was congregating on this server was Madi as in Madi my friend from the sons of virgins gang wow what an amazing plot twist this video has more layers and twists box babs and surprising turns than literally any other Christian porno seriously imagine finding out that this entire time you've been hanging out with one of your arch enemies the bloodshed continues and I realize we need to try and form some sort of peace treaty where both aliens can coexist in one city so they are free to peacefully suck each other's penises I mean fly UFOs and enslave humans and other normal alien activities of both gangs organized to meet at the pier and negotiations begin I propose that green gang has the entire city and surrounding countryside and purple can have sandy shores that place with the meth dub trailer park near the big lake this doesn't go down well but we all briefly Ally so that we can beat down this dodgy Malaka who crashed our team-building meeting what a simp I mean who besides emotionally secure people doesn't wear tight-fitting neon alien suits everywhere unfortunately the truce is short-lived as a full-on war breaks out yet again and this rivalry is as old as time itself well not really it's been 2 or so years since the alien costumes were released I think which is far less epic but still I mean it's something we start to get outnumbered by purple if I had to guess how outnumbered we were right now I'd say about 47 to 53 percent Wow would you look at that what a coincidence that's the exact same amount of people who watch my videos and haven't subscribed did you know that every time someone new subscribes I give the captured people in my basement one sip of water the so please help them stay hydrated or they'll literally die and it will be your fault and then you'll go to jail and you'll die because a big Mexican guy called Miguel will chop you up with a toothbrush Shiv and then eat you wow this could also easily be prevented anyway recognizing that we need to briefly retreat the lads and I pile into a chopper and make a swift escape you may have already noticed but one of our members is a bi-racial alien which makes his true loyalties quite confusing I don't know whether to make out with him or kill him so I do the mature thing and treat myself to a bottle of vintage Maui 2008 reowww because the fermented liquid surprisingly lowers your risk of diabetes by up to 13% we decide to sail for international waters so we can regroup the purple aren't giving us a moment to stabilize they keep trying to board the tug and eventually one of their Keller's helicopter pilots blows up and ruins what could have been a solid Pirates of the Caribbean moment enough is enough we need to settle who the alpha gang is once and for all I meet Maddie on the beach and I hate to say it but she do be looking kind of thick in that bodysuit not going to lie we're not here for that kind of smashing though we're here to have a civilized fight four versus four fists only to finally determine who the superior gang is the rain begins to pour down which will only help those who value hydration then at the worst possible time one of the purple infidels disconnects and their player becomes an NPC and begins walking away the only thing I hate more than a purple is a purple NPC so the boys and I make our move we then proceed to beat the other Purple's to death with our numbers advantage proving the grains of fast thinking and highly intellectual individuals able to seize opportunities as they come Maddie says that's BS and so we organize another actual fair fight this is the moment the world has been waiting for the Society has been hesitant to declare that World War 3 has ever actually started the Cold War and the war on terror were never officially given that title but I think we can all agree that this is officially World War 3 of course green come out on top and if you gloss over the fact that one of our guys was definitely using a golf club it was as fair as it gets I also apparently have an up an atomizer now because of that weird casino glitch and this is also quite useful for the fight albeit unsportsmanlike as the fight is over after something this internationally significant happens it's best to shake hands and be friends I hop on the back of a purple jet ski and we all make our way over to the yacht a classic purple flies a plane here which is quite disrespectful as this is my property but like Gandhi I the other cheek we all live happily ever after just kidding the war never ends you fools think you can unwind and relax in my jacuzzi I hope all you legends are doing really well thanks for watching and a huge thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
