[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with JTA five if you enjoyed this video please get kanye west to include my videos as part of his propaganda during his stunning and brave political push as this really helps spread the good word of my channel you guys all newest series on this was going to come eventually and last week when I was busy saving newborn babies from house fires and holding hands with scores of beautiful women sometimes at the same time I stopped and thought to myself it's now time the so we load in and kick things off as Franklin a lovable gangster who may or may not be CJ's son from GTA san andreas there's a lot of evidence proving that this can't be true but at the same time CJ is nowhere to be seen and seems to not even care about Franklin which is a pretty accurate portrayal of a father my boy Lamar and I have a job that where we have to repossess people's cars who can't afford the repayments it really fits Franklin's skill set as he has this special ability to slow down time and give the car he's driving near perfect handling if I had this special ability in real life I would have had far fewer traffic collisions and my neighbor wouldn't be an orphan apparently you're meant to look behind you while you reverse but I don't believe the high Lamar wants to race me back which is good clean fun and we deliver the cars back to the dealership in near-perfect condition the Simeon and dishonest Armenian car salesman is like Jana Jana Jana Jana Jana cheers big sauce see you next time so this is my aunt's house yes I'm 25 years old and still live with my aunt you might think that's pretty lame but while you're stressing about water bills I'm getting 10 hours of solid sleep in a racecar bed I might not get laid but I sure do get the wealth of benefits from a good night's rest Lamar and I have got another repo job and then I see it the car of my dreams it's small design allows for excellent fuel efficiency and if you do happen to get into a car accident well then well look you're probably going to die it's about as safe as riding a motorbike but with literally none of the seductive qualities benefactor Ponto the vehicle that tells anyone you say that you don't respect consent or yourself anyway we have to repossess this motorbike from a Vargas gang member sound safe and enjoyable I can't help but notice Lamarr is wearing some pretty inappropriate footwear for work like come on mate I respect socks and sandals as much as the next well hung playboy but we're trying to make cash not take the fashion world by storm this neighbourhood has a warm welcoming vibe about it but there's no sign of the bike well searching some Vargo's gang member approaches us and well Lamar Wow somebody needs to take a self-help course on peacefully resolving workplace conflict Jesus Lamar this is what we call escalating an issue now I've got blood all over my off-white undershirt and quite frankly it's on you to soak this and get all the stains out big man one of the Vargas lads takes off on the bike at least on the plus side we have the perfect vehicle for a high-speed pursuit you might have also noticed that Lamar is wearing grain which is the gang color of Grove Street families from GTA san andreas he and Franklin are part of the Chamberlain families a subset of the overall families gang the members of Grove Street moved on and now the physical Street the Grove Street is run by our arch rivals the ballers I make a mental note to deal with this later today we get the bike back and then Lamar decides he'll take it for himself I'm not sure if he's missing the core concept of our job description or what but whatever I noticed there are some family members hanging out right near my house one of them lets me know that I should leave before he beats my ass well I think he's under estimating how insecure I am because if there's one thing I won't take it's a bit of light-hearted banter between the boys at least they're polite and they don't just bash me altogether they actually come at me one by one which is appreciated a good old-fashioned etiquette like that is rare to find in this day and age unfortunately the police are called and things go from zero to a hundred awfully quickly my aunt was annoyed earlier because I kept stealing her underwear wait until she saves all the corpses all over the whole wait she's actually just sitting right here damn she's more tranquil than Gandhi huge props to you Big O all right I'm dead but that's all right I decide to earn some quick cash by being a taxi driver I pick up my first client and now that's the kind of man I hope my future daughter ends up marrying you can tell he's the kind of lad to pick up the putt after he's provided for his family financially I decide to play a little prank on him that I call attempting to drown Prince Charming at the local resident boat ramp it's kind of awkward because he never comes up for air so he's either found an oxygen tank and he's living his best life under the sea like sandy from Sponge Bob Squarepants or more likely he went into shock and drowned almost immediately I wonder what sandy is like in the sack anyway this clearly Christian girl with great morals needs my help and what kind of gangster would I be if I didn't help her out her deadbeat boyfriend is too cooked to show up to work so it's on me to do his job he's the tow truck driver and Wow if I had to encapsulate why this game is one of the most unanimously highly rated games of all time I think this mission sums it up perfectly this isn't a video game this is a damn artistic masterpiece with that done we can move on and honestly it feels good to help out one of my childhood friends Lamarr then says he has a job for us which I'm excited for also more importantly he's bringing his dog chop which let's be honest pet dogs and video games should surely be an industry standard by now so the job is a lazy mid-afternoon abduction I'm glad to see we broke the kidnapping stereotype and chose to drive an exciting white van don't be afraid of being different Lamarr be afraid of being the same as everyone else we decide to kidnap a ball again member for ransom he seems to be in the middle of Bible study with this respectable I guess none he Flay's on his motorbike while we chase him down in the van this is the perfect example of how you shouldn't carry out a kidnapping you see if the initial surprise attack doesn't go well then you're stuck driving a van which you know can get stuck if you're thinking what I'm thinking right now then you need to spend less time on google incognito and more time completing five-minute crafts eventually I do catch the big man well chop does and it's finally all going to plan right up until this guide recognizes both Lamar and myself because he's actually known us since we were kids rule one of kidnapping do not kidnap family friends who can easily recognize you we're forced to let him go but at least it gives me time to do something I should have already done take back Grove Street these bowlers have crossed the line they're even walking around outside my house well I mean maybe this dude just likes wearing purple but either way that's more than enough reason to beat him down I change into this white singlet for some Sun ondrea's nostalgia and then head for the Grove the place is absolutely crawling with bowlers there has to be about thirty or forty members here so I'm going to have to apply a generous amount of John wick to the situation I then proceeded to get run over by someone who is fleeing from the police sure this is a pretty cool random event to witness but I'm trying to create a sentimental Redemption arkeo where I shoot all these guys and you're sort of stealing the show I'm not going to let that ruin the moment though so I start letting bullets fly I'll tell you what would have been a legendary Easter Egg if you started shooting bowlers here and then it initiated a turf war just like san andreas if you won you could just take Grove Street back for the families I'd love that but instead I'm faced with an ethical decision of do I shoot this dog in the face I'll kill 40 gangsters but I'm not shooting a dog so I just proceeded to die a noble man's death it was a costly death too because now my car has been impounded rest in peace to my budget as now I will not only not be able to pick up girls my fuel consumption will surely heavily spike I need something to take my mind off this recent passing of myself so I take chop down to the local park and by local park I mean the golf course sorry big girl but you'll have to swing that pitching wedge elsewhere as I'm trying to bond with my pooch if I'm being honest I actually forgot how good the single-player of this game is obviously I've been doing the whole GTA online series which has been really fun but throwing a bowl with your dog need i say more I decide to start playing fetch my way by throwing the ball off the members of this fine establishment which I seem to consistently trash this is predictably quite confusing for little chap and he begins molding everyone obviously I get involved because I'm a sucker for unprovoked violence and yeah all in all the fresh air really did the job wow really I'm so surprised the gardener isn't a white guy named Logan and that's a real shock and I'm sure all the other gardeners in this game are white men I Jack one of the golfers cars and just in case this day couldn't get any better I find my baby oh how I've missed her I've had a lot of great memories in this little pocket rocket anyway you know how the nine till five is you've got to make that paper the Simeon asks me to repo a yellow SUV from a mansion near Vinewood Hills ah yes I know this house all too well this is Michael's place I jumped the fence and I've got to take out the gardener a dam that must be the only other ethnic gardener in this entire game I bet every other gardener besides the two I've just come across a white American men I slip into the house and this really went from car repo to home invasion awfully quickly my boy is playing the new Minecraft Update where Mojang Studios decided to swap out crafting fishing rods for shotgun disembowelment an interesting creative choice but I wish them the best Michael's wife is getting some tennis guidance from her coach and mate how about you back on up there I think you can demonstrate the optimum backhand with a safe 30 centimetres distance between yourselves disgusting alright well that was pretty easy and now it's time to deliver this and get paid unfortunately Michael was hiding in the back this whole time as apparently simian is dishonest and has been repossessing cars for no reason who would have guessed Michael tells me to shut up and drive so was he just hiding there the whole time what if I'd stopped for lunch would he have just hid under those blankets for another couple of hours what if I decided to come tomorrow that's an impressive commitment he instructs me to drive the car straight through the dealership as be angry at Simeon for ripping off his son the game seamlessly switches made to his perspective so I can hurt Simeon physically but also I'm sure emotionally the next episode will dive into the rich and glamorous life of Michael I hope you legends are doing well thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
