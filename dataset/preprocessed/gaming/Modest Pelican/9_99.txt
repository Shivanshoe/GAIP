[Music] hi lads and lasses mutters Pelican here with red dead online if you enjoyed this video please pretend like you're going to be intimate with someone but then instead of whispering naughty things in their ear simply whisper subscribe to modest to Pelican gaming as this really helps spread the good word of my channel alright welcome back to another fun-filled adventure where the only thing we don't explore each other's bodies the stealth amato joins and immediately calls me fat which is harsh but fair I don't take too kindly to body shaming though so I kill him because I'm a strong fat independent man who strongly believes in chivalry I'm the kind of guy who will hold the door open for a fine lass and then send her an unsolicited yet tasteful dick pic later that night because it's not creepy now that she knows I opened doors the speaking of fine lasses today we'll also be joined by our good friend Maddie on a serious note her boyfriend who's a real legend was recently in a car accident and actually went into intensive care so pretty scary star on the plus side it's now the perfect time to aggressively hit on her because he can't do much about it might even pop over to their house later and steal his stuff of course I'm kidding and we all wish Wade a speedy recovery anyway at this point half the town has gathered to look up Maddy's dress and I mean it's pretty hot but it's not family-friendly content this Randy melaka has also started a minor gang war we can't be getting distracted like this as we've got important things to do today so I come up with a solution a fair fist fight to the death and then we all have to behave ourselves also for the first time ever stealth Oh cabo is joining us on red dead so a warm welcome to him we decide whoever wins this fight will become the Alpha epic gamer which is probably the most esteemed title you could ever earn professor Paul Preston who was recognized for his diplomatic service and went on to be literally knighted by the Queen of England in 2018 was quoted saying this knighthood ain't a thing ho I just wanted to feat modest palek and become the alpha epic gamer inspiring stuff anyway being this thick gives me an advantage in hand-to-hand combat and I emerged victorious a motto then proceeds to stab me which is some innovative outside the box thinking GG well played we ride out and essentially we've been trying to establish our moonshine business and it's going reasonably well for the final business upgrade we'll need eight hundred and twenty-five dollars which is pretty expensive so it's time to start hustling but fortunately you were looking at the absolute best in the business let's go to a bounty gamers needs a sign or something we pick a bounty and I accidentally choose one we've already done I'll skip over it for your viewing pleasure as I'd hate this series where we spend every single episode building the same moonshine Shack business and crashing horses to get repetitive the important thing is we earn some cash money apparently there's more money to be made up north so we get ready to ride up there on our way we ride past a player called secluded snail 39 and that nickname is so cute and innocent that it makes me think he's almost definitely a sexual predator don't worry go wait my food I'm gonna die okay you know you weren't dying oh my God he's dead I knew that secluded snail 39 was dodgy I waved at him and everything yet he still snart's us all in the head unfortunately stealth amato gets revenge and then proceeds to aggressively teabag his corpse the but as we are intellectuals it got us thinking what if we got two of his corpses and conducted the elusive TT back I immediately go and kill the big shelled mollusk again and deliver the body to stealth Amato haters will say gamers don't do anything with their lives but look at this contemporary interpretive art it suddenly becomes apparent that we become extremely distracted from the task at hand yet again fortunately I've been growing as an individual and I've learned to let things go I decide not to get my revenge an excessive amount of times and I especially don't defile his corpse that's not family-friendly all right so onwards to Van Horn trading post we accept the bounty to track down and kill the Roldan step-siblings and this could potentially be quite a steamy mission for real though I never actually understood the stepsister fetish I also think society doesn't fully appreciate the brave souls out there who rate and comment on adult videos for us I saw a comment once and it said I couldn't suspend my disbelief because the male vocals were too loud and I thought well shiver me timbers mate that doesn't sound good at all so I clicked away just in time Thank You milf Slayer 404 anyway Marto and I get extremely distracted investigating beavers fascinating creatures but yeah meanwhile Maddie and stealth Oh Cabo let one of the bounties escape it looks like while we were busy expanding our minds they were doing a damn bad job get it because beavers build dams maybe I'll become a beaver channel just like National Geographic but just for beavers and with worse production quality that's an untouched niche twelve dollars in the bank which is good but quite frankly we need to accelerate the savings plan we can't just observe favors and hit industrial vapes all day we need a game changer it's time to start collecting that really sounds anticlimactic doesn't it but hey it pays so well you can't be mad we grabbed several trinkets and one of them is on a cliff and I suddenly have an urge to try to bungee jump I won't be the one jumping though as that's more risky than premarital hand-holding I'll be the belayer motto leaps trusting oliso him but the auto-lock doesn't go too well and he falls to his death it's then Matty's turn but I get the timing wrong and she too falls to her death surprisingly carbo is still down to try and it actually briefly works but he ends up swinging like a pendulum onto the side of the cliff and dies a pretty horrific death we'll call this exercise moderately successful motto and Maddie go off to buy a new horse but given the new scientific beaver direction I see this channel rapidly heading towards we push on with the experiment many carbo's were harmed during the making of this picture but eventually we realized the rope just snaps from his weight the best we can do is hang each other off a waterfall which is basically just a sub-genre of waterboarding I actually don't know why everyone always complains about waterboarding like in contrast imagine being stoned to death which literally has no benefits sure waterboarding is basically simulated drowning but at least you can hydrate I say we make waterboarding great again by bringing it back to schools nationwide as a harsh but fair disciplinary measure anyway we head back to Valentine to see this new horse and as we arrive this sexy girl rocks up and I decide to shoot my shot there's this pickup technique called negging where you emotionally manipulate the girl you're interested in by flirting in such a way that undermines her confidence I proceeded to tell her that she smells bad and she proceeds to shoot me in the head with a bolt-action rifle we'll call this moderately successful and it's time to see martos horse what it is a beautiful definitely residue we continue collecting like crazy and honestly it's all thanks to Maddie we would not be this organized without her sometimes I'm playing a video game and I have this rare moment of self-reflection where I question my actions even though it's all virtual I think to myself wow Jeff what are you doing with your life this is one of those moments as we head off motto crashes into me with his new horse and it dies again ah well no point letting it go to waste am i right and kidding this mate isn't from Matos horse that'd be sadistic we're eating the stable hand it's so damn wholesome traveling the country finding items well at least it was wholesome until player called God 6ix decided his going to try to assassinate US IX is nine in Roman numerals so his gamertag is God 69 which is just pika gamer we easily evade him and actually end up assassinating the big girl ourselves earning a call $11.87 in the process look you guys now I love having a laugh as much as the next coroner but real talk for a moment the 69 is a sexual position and unless you're married I insist you do not engage in such sinful behavior with only one trinket left to collect for a full collection we make our way to the desert town armadillo where the last one is located this town was wiped out by a plague which is sad but again silver lining motto and I find our future wives damn you came here for a gaming video briefly learned about beavers and now I imagine you're crying from overwhelming emotional joy mato decides to consummate his marriage right here but discovers his wife is actually a man I hate it so damn much when that happens I think we've all been there more times than we care to admit at long last I can sell all the items we've collected to Madame nazar and make absolute Bank in the process now it's time to head back to the moonshine Shack I decide to fast travel which means my wife won't be able to come with me which is actually ok as I always imagined settling down with a woman who wasn't decomposing like my moonshine manager Maggie now that's a real woman she's got it all a walking stick a top button done up a pulse most importantly though I buy the condenser upgrade and because we leveled up so much last time I can also buy the polished copper upgrade straight away lads and lasses we can now make top-quality moonshine I get a batch brewing for next episode and then head out to meet the crew the celebrations unfortunately I ride right off a cliff and my horse dies but a random player revives my steed for no reason for every secluded snail 39 there's a Merrick MP to restore your faith in gamers nothing like a rewarding fishing session but you see it's not as relaxing that normally would be because whenever someone catches a fish the others get jealous and killed them of course by the others I main motto in May anyway stealth o carbo's been uploading a lot on his own youtube channel recently his last upload was actually his perspective of today's fun-filled family adventure I highly rate his videos and a link his channel in the description otherwise I hope you absolute legends are doing well thanks for watching and a massive thanks to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
