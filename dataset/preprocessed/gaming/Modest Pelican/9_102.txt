[Music] hi lads and lasses mother's Pelican here with stranded date if you enjoyed this video please hijack people zoom calls and preach to them about the benefits of worshiping pelicans as this really helps spread the good word of my channel this is the story of how I ended up stranded in the middle of the ocean moments away from being the lead role in some tasteful Japanese tentacle hentai first though and to catch any of you legends up that missed part one my plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean I managed to escape in a little life raft I found a damaged cargo ship with a broken plane on it that I need to repair so I can escape I'm a registered sex offender which is unrelated but I feel important to disclose and I eventually made my way to a small exotic island and tried to survive I spent the first few hours of my time here dying from starvation poisoning dehydration sharks and so on it's hard not to die in this game but eventually I started to make a life for myself I ate a balanced diet of seagulls and well I guess just see girls but hey it's not like anything bad ever happened after someone ate a small winged creature I've spent most of my time building a tropical cabin it's kind of like playing Minecraft except less girls throw themselves at you after you showed them your builds a god damn minecraft players save some vagina for the rest of us so yeah it's been satisfying to slowly but surely learn how to survive the key problem is to survive you need to constantly harvest the precious resources and they never respawn and this is a major issue as I'm currently running dry I feel like a major oil company who can't find any more crude oil reserves and no one ever gives their thoughts and prayers to the oil companies everyone's too busy praying for little old Johnny who died in an orphanage fire trying to save the other children it's pathetic anyway as the mystic sea Legend and Google tell me to fix the plane and escape I need to slay three sea monsters now that seems a bit extreme last video I literally died from excessive diarrhea so I'm not quite sure if I'm ready to fight a sea monster that being said at my last Alcoholics Anonymous meeting they did say to engage in more outdoor activities I decide I'm going to save the game and then sail out to investigate the first sea monster which is basically a suicide mission it's always best to do sufficient research before you tackle a problem except if you're someone who regularly uses reddit and to add to our lack of resources I also lost my compass as you can imagine not having a compass makes navigating the ocean extremely difficult unfortunately before I burned all of the wood on my campfire I did build myself a raft so it's time to sail for a new island that will hopefully have what I need as I begin sailing away I accidentally pick up one of the crates that I've sort of glitched onto the raft for more carry space which leads to me falling off as my boat sails off into the distance by itself I momentarily consider drowning myself not in the game but in real life instead I load up a saved game file honestly if you couldn't save your game I'd be facedown in my bathtub right now which would be horrific but also kind of hot because martos treating himself to a bubble bath as we speak i successfully sailed to another island and of course take all the wood I can carry more importantly though I searched the shipwrecks for an elusive compass while investigating a fishing trawler a tiger shark wants to eat me which is low-key pretty flattering because by definition I'm now a little snack I'm glad too because I don't think my fragile ego could have taken being friend-zoned by a glorified fish I quickly discover that I'm a pretty average shot with the bow and arrow but fortunately quite a good platform jumper Thank You banjo kazooie I continue going from island to island searching for the damn compass I can't stress how much of a process this is constantly capturing enough fresh water to drink finding food to eat not getting heatstroke and so on after a few hours and I mean literally a few hours I finally find a compass and last I can investigate the first cheeky sea monster I arrived home and just in time to as I was close to death and dying is uncool all this island hopping has also had some other benefits like I've now stockpiled quite a lot of supplies which allows me to extend my shelter a bit at long last I have a room to bring girls back to well there's not actually any girls around it's a deserted island but you know a room where I can aggressively rub my nipples while simultaneously singing all i want for christmas is you' by mariah carey for the full high-definition video of that you can follow my only fans account for the competitive price of a hundred and forty dollars per month for any of you who think that sinful it's actually very stunning and brave selling nudes of yourself online there's nothing more empowering than having thousands of awkward strangers jerking off to lewd images anyway with the power of my compass i'm able to find true north like an alpha Chad and sail towards the monster well actually a compass doesn't find true north it finds magnetic north but this is a YouTube video which means delivering accurate information to your viewers is entirely optional I proceed to sail out really far and eventually come across some sort of yellow boy as I get closer I'm told lusca the great is nearby I've brought a bow and arrow with about seven arrows with me so I wouldn't say we're exactly ready for this but I'm feeling optimistic for some reason then in what might be one of the greatest gaming plays of 2020 I sailed directly at the boy and spectacularly flipped my raft over capsizing and yeah and tactically point my mast down at the ocean floor as an innovative and completely intentional way of anchoring my raft there's something really freaky about being in open water and video games you know something is going to try to eat you but you never know for sure when it's coming just in case things weren't looking grim enough it begins to rain this is great news for my water skills which will hopefully feel right up so I can stay hydrated if I can get home but short term this really isn't great the rain turns into a full-blown storm so I begin firing my flare gun into the air in the hope that someone will come and save me they might as well call this flare gun my dad's mobile number because no one's coming at least things can't get any worse as they jump into the water to see if I can dislodge the raft but it instantly gets much worse meet Alaska the Great and also I learned right now that my bow and arrow can't be fired underwater which I guess makes a lot of frustrating sense I actually pause the game for a moment so I can gather my thoughts because this is scary in fact this is scarier than the time I got swatted for trying to download cheat codes for Kitty powers Matchmaker 2014 dating simulator also I just googled can you fire a bow and arrow underwater and you can it's just obviously less effective but I mean fake news anyway old lusca the lanky mother is one agile squid and eventually eats me right up I proceeded to die from drowning and Wow bleeding too I reload my save and it sure is funny how the world works isn't it I used to enjoy calamari but in the end calamari enjoyed me we now know what we're up against and frankly how in all that is holy are we going to kill this big girl I ate a bunch more seagulls and then begin crafting Spears this was quite a lengthy process as I had to sail to other islands for the wood but eventually I had many Spears let's go Alaska the great but this time we have weapons and there isn't even a storm about to roll in a tactical masterpiece I begin the fight with him again but this time I discover an effective strategy if I hug the boy he can't get nearly as many hits on me and I'm able to throw Spears right into his eye it's a beautiful I'm not going to lie you could get lost staring into that thing he does sometimes Janka me away with his long crafty tentacles usually I'm able to swim back to the boy and if you ignore the fact that my raft drifted away like five minutes ago this is going great just kidding I've thrown all my spears into this behemoth and still kicking plus I have no way of getting home a death by drowning and bleeding oh how I've missed you old friend alright so the problem is twofold I need better weapons and I need a way of anchoring my raft in the deep water the second problem is actually pretty easy to solve I'll be at the solution is enormous ly time-consuming the original raft from the plane has a deep-sea anchor so it'll do the job my girlfriend actually walked in and was like how the hell is this game fun it looks like you're just slowly paddling a blow-up boat across the ocean she just doesn't understand what a real gameplay experience looks like real gamers paddles slowly I also kill a shark because she kept watching for a while and I wanted her to see that this game has some action-packed moments after 15 minutes of watching she told me she was leaving me for my best friend because I quote kept pulling my pants down whenever her family visited acting like her dad's never seen another man naked before anyway this food helped me feel myself and gave me time to craft a spear gun it's a lot of hard work preparing for the next fight but my motto is to work hard play hard and stay hard that's why I'm introducing Papa Pelley's new erectile disfunction tablets we want to make you hard 24 hours a day seven days a week even in public places no especially in public places so you can be just like me a borderline sex offender alright I've got my spear gun I've got my raft and I've got a positive outlook on life so I couldn't be more ready to slay old lusca I per say to begin paddling all the way out to his little boy I mean vulnerable boy I mean water ocean sea boy it's a long trek but I put on Dan X's song X gonna give it to you and it made the part really high I successfully anchor my raft and so now it's only a question of if I have enough Spears to actually kill the Beast so far this episode has been like 15 hours worth of gameplay so this really is my last chance to actually kill the dodgy malacca or i'll have to end the video on a really anticlimactic as I need to upload the speargun is definitely helping but luster is barely taking any damage per hit it's going to be close but I might have to build a bigger raft and get better weapons see lads and lasses I'm still ineffectively trying to build suspense into my videos I'll stop now though because in the new best gaming moment of 2020 I successfully slay lusca the great with only 4 spears to spare what a life-changing moment for everyone involved with modesty Pelican gaming as a reward I get to sluggishly road back to my base I also get a squid trophy which I can't figure out how to hang so I sort of just toss it around until it's in an aesthetically pleasing position the function y of this cabin is timeless more importantly than anything is that I learn how to craft to the aeroplanes propeller meaning I'm one step closer to escaping this God forsaken Island for now though it's back to Smashing Birds aka 18 seagulls but thanks for watching you absolute legends and a massive thank to those who support the channel on patreon until next time and as always stay classy [Music]
