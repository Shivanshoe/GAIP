i'm the intelligent businessman like you but the way i see it there's two great evils that bedevil american capitalism the type that you practice number one is outsourcing you paid a private company to do your dirty work for you and then you underpaid that company because you thought you were big enough and bad enough that you didn't have to play by the rules oh number two offshoring your profits offshoring oh it's horrible you wouldn't want to be sent offshore just to save a little money would you t no i i wouldn't oh no nowhere no see but we know your opinions on the matter devon keep your problems the [ __ ] out of america huh in this instance when he puts it like that it makes sense of course it does hey devin goodbye my old friend thanks for all the advice [Applause] so now what now we keep a low profile and get on with our lives as friends well do i have a choice no not really all right then as uh flawed awful totally uncomfortable and poorly matched friends absolutely oh that's
