called marnie now i am shupar queen of the winds doubting is the pathway to believing for non-objectionable persons the literature is very clear about that ah why is it whenever people talk about reincarnation they're always a king or a general or a famous person how come they're never a serve for a rock or a bug oh it is easy to be a doubtful antithesis but be a thesis so lag these are incredible truth i used to be lost now i'm the most powerful person in existence last night i went to 47 000 places at the same time okay this is [ __ ] objectionable person's fault any hurdle goodbye helping higher beings is the pathway to acquiring a higher existence i'm sure it is you're not but you are on the way some of our true thesis holders who also happen to be top of their field actors philosophers and humanitarians require cars oh can you find it in your heart to be of service the spirits shall email you their requirements the spirits have email don't be an antithesis zolag he flung gear for [Music] hmm [Applause] um well done zolag well done this is the work of a true thesis enjoy that ride the tenth paradigm so lag don't be an antithesis 46 places at once it's still stuck on the olympic freeway gift [Music] um baby it's still flashing blue imagine if the answer to everything was hidden in this bush or the answer to nothing because that is the answer to which there is no question ow just gave me a shock maybe kraft's trying to tell me something unlimit your limitations this technology is too powerful for human understanding i thought i had an absolute understanding now that i am a thesis but before you can understand your absolute understanding you must sign up for an advanced study program the literature is very clear on this hey look i found one oh wait no i'm reading it wrong does that light mean ancient alien ancestor or low battery jimmy be one with the device let craft guide you that's real science hello zondar kefla our gift bomb marnie wait i thought

keflam get flown this area is a confirmed hot spot for extraterrestrial activity bro the device should light up blue when it finds a signal [Music] hey cuckoo car did you give him some of the special vitamins why don't you channel that energy into something productive whoa wait a minute what the hell is this what's going on oh oh oh hey this it i don't know shakuku car is this it if there is doubt in your mind you're an antithesis and the metaverse will not reveal its secret guess we keep looking bro do not despair zandar you just need to try harder to rid your mind of ignorance that's all show some restraint activate your presence the meter only responds to your inner god which must be set free to soar through the paradigms let it reverberate through your major organs resonate with your whole where is your focus zandar i think i'm close calm yourself you must disconnect from your anatomy my number anyway so this is it right do you doubt the truth do you i doubt that you don't doubt
