help we could get there's some guys coming our way back he's trying to hold might give us a chance to hit the train come on the platform last call could be our only way out of here here we go right here get on [Music] okay we're going into the side door i hope you brought your a-game because you're not getting a warm up drive over there i'll be in touch okay softly softly approach we're the only crew i know who can speak so little and still make so much noise but here's hoping the key to this whole job is to forget we're attempting a career defining heist and stay calm are you calm good because i'm calm and what's not to be calm about if you screw up and they see you we're just gonna do this the old-fashioned way one dead guy at a time okay do you want the good news for the bad news well the good news is that they just had a record-breaking weekend so the vault is full to bursting and the bad news is that they've hired extra security to guard it high risk high gain just how we like it hey did you try out your stun gun yet that's it head through the door to the staff lobby [Music] metal detectors up ahead you'll need to find the fuse box on the side of the unit take it out with a stun gun and get through before it recovers that's it shorted quickly get through heads up cctv ahead the stun gun should disable the camera for a while work go old school and time your run all right the camera just went down it'll be back online soon and remember if you bring down too many at the same time they'll hit the alarm remember these people aren't idiots if you fry too many cameras at once security will know something's up without a sound quicker than hacking it hey before they go to the vault today's takings are stored near where you are it's up to you but it might be worth a detour it's a two-room system one of you needs to hold the access button in the security room the other runs through and grabs the cash okay here we are at last the lower level naturally is heavily guarded coming through [Music] you're so close see that security checkpoint the man trap is just beyond it [Music] well he's not ringing the alarm [Music] [Music] sweet dreams now get moving he'll wake up before too long [Music] [Music] security tends to notice see that that's your man trap so pay attention you'll have to swipe both vault key cards simultaneously at separate control panels that unlocks the system but even then we can't open both the inner and the outer doors simultaneously everyone needs to get inside so we can close the first door and then open the second we need one person with a vault key card at each terminal let's go [Music] get everyone inside the man trap now i can keep the first door open until you're set [Music] okay so far so bueno push on i know this is a special moment for you down there but trust me it's about to get a lot more special on the other side of that door break out the laser drill let's do this the lock mechanism should melt like butter you just need to target the weak points don't good that's the left side taken care of [Music] now your hacker can block the security sensors while you're in the vault but only for a while if the system goes quiet for too long it triggers the alarm as a fail safe and uh did i mention that if the alarm goes off in here they'll flood the place with nerve agent no okay well i'm mentioning it now there's a set of lock boxes in here drill them if you've got the time but i can't promise you there'll be anything good inside [Music] [ __ ] [Music] [Music] go [Music] 40 seconds [Music] 30 seconds before the fail-safe alarm so make the most of it [Music] 20 seconds perfect now get out before they smell a rant [Music] [Music] ready you really cleaned up down there you know they're not gonna know what hit them except for the insurance bill you know if we pull this off it'll be the crown jewel of my career and the hardest achievement on the console of life [Music] satisfaction right the camera just went down it'll be back online soon and remember if you break down too many at the same time they'll hit the alarm nice shot [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] listen up we have bad news and good news the bad news is they did a spot check on the vault so they know it's been robbed the good news is they have no idea who or how the cops are on their way but you can still make it out if you do exactly what i say if you're caught now the [ __ ] really hits the fan the side doors are back through the staff entrance you're almost there must be tiring running around with all that loot [Music] more camera and they'll know something's up i've missed this [Music] [Music] all right trucks aren't here yet let's sit tight and no need to panic we weren't panicking something wrong nothing's wrong
