going to pay the bills but it sounds like it means i've got a couple stations measuring air pollution the idea is to catch them what's the word contaminants before they reach toxic levels between you and me i think oscar wants this to fail because of my children hydrocarbons in the air is way too high and rising if it keeps getting worse people could die the particles are concentrating in trouble spots like mini clouds of smog i'll swing through them and get samples then trace them to the source nasty as they are i gotta swing right through those clouds for these clouds to be visible to the naked eye the level of toxins must be up there i'm getting some good stuff well good samples of bad stuff anyway got it oh that feels like i'm breathing from a tailpipe [Music] huh the toxins coming
