what is it we got something cooking you might be interested in am i gonna like the sound of this been cooking since horseshoe but you went kicked up all that commotion and valentine now we was preparing to rob the bank there until you got involved in all that nonsense and i don't know i just feel like it's unfinished business that wasn't my fault it was just one of them things how come every time i get in trouble i'm called a fool and an idiot but when you get in trouble oh it's just one of them things it's a good point often a very good point all right well what do you all want me to do hit the goddamn bank with us you really think it's worth going back there four of us can hit the bank easy but i ain't gonna lie to you there will be love we linger for serious no just local boys being rounded up and pressed into action if we go in quick and quiet we can hit it just fine if there's four of us i mean y'all think it's worth the risk it's a bank arthur so is the take good according to the fella i met yes it's the end of the stock sales plenty of money and plenty of people mailing about okay i suppose it's worth taking a look at least i'm gonna be performing i better go get changed out of these rags give me a minute gentlemen okay so bill this better be good it is good we put a lot of research into this one i hope so mr morgan has just that man the debtor thomas downs apparently he's dead dead well he didn't seem very well his wife i believe he has a wife and child she will assume the debt of course of course then you can head up there and collect be lent them a lot of money okay gentlemen let's go rob ourselves a bank what's the plan then oh we're gonna send karen on in ahead as a distraction then we're just gonna rush on in afterwards just a small bank in a little town nothing that big in way of security we just need to bring you along as a insurance policy yeah that sounds about right all right follow me so tell me again about this big can't go wrong plant of yours oh it can go wrong anything can once the shooting starts well that's reassuring like i said we'll see how it looks if we can get in all right we'll send miss jones ahead to the bank they won't recognize her i'll show you boys how it's done what are you thinking this time i don't know feller's always like the lost little girl but nobody plays a drunken harlequin like me peter should work once he's got him distracted we'll move in when i was scouting the place the other day there was only a couple of guards we deal with them and any customers who are feeling brave and you always fancy yourself as the volt man right arthur now i see why you brought me hey i'm more than willing nah best i do it oh and the nuts tell you i've also been cooking up some deals with them gray boys what no what kind of deals see you don't realize morgan i'm out there putting in the work same as you i've been drinking with them a couple times now it seems they're looking for some extra security yeah i'm sure they are there could be something in it for us well just be smart about it we got a lot of irons in that fire right now yes i know morgan glad you and lenny are alone for this karen someone's got to keep you boys out of trouble i ain't sure even lenny can be relied on to keep his head not after that night you two had him valentine yeah i've been trying to forget that what little i remember of it you've always been a bad drunk and before you say it i know it takes one to know one guess we'll never learn it bill ain't much better so should we stop for some whiskey how about we wait till after the bank all right bet you didn't think we'd end up over this way so what's going on with these two families the grays and whatever the other one's called s'more dutch and jose's thing an old feud they're trying to get in the middle of if it plays right they reckon we can get some gold out of it never can resist to scam those two dutch already managed to get us deputized but we got the biggest price on our hands west of chicago and now we're working for the law i'm sure he knows what he's doing so far there's been a lot of fancy talking from him and jose while i do all the dirty work just like the old days something like that can't believe you got me going back to valentine don't tell me it ain't hurt you leaving that bank behind not really work a town and not hit the bank that's downright pathetic i guess we went a bit beyond working it we shot the place to help you did morgan not me i played it cool up there a couple of punch-ups dealt with some old driscolls oh is that right like i said you mess up it's just one of them things i mess up i'm the prize idiot well bill i don't know what to tell you surprised you ain't already ripped me about that dynamite again one mistake and i'll never live it down what do you need pat on the back a middle just know i got the lead on this one we'll see about that once things get going so thinking this through we rob cornwall's train we shoot a heap of his men in valentine we rubbish stage coach this is just dawning on you now and now we're going back to the one place he knew where to find us
