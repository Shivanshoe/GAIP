what's up guys i'm random frank p and 2021 so far has been pretty stale for the mouse market you know not a lot of exciting new big releases and i've tried a few and it's just been pretty meh so far that was until steelseries just dropped their brand new prime wireless mouse i'm telling you guys right now a little bit of spoiler love this thing so in this review we'll cover it all go over the features pros cons all that stuff in case you're interested in picking up the brand new steelseries prime wireless so hit you with the goods first this does come in at 80 grams it hits 80 on my scale as well so you can still classify this as a lightweight mouse it still does have a few more grams on some other ones out there nowadays but it's not gonna feel like a toy in your hand i feel like 80 grams is a sweet spot for a lot of people and checking it out the right-handed ergo shape is something that i think steelseries has always mastered and this is no exception the grooves the contours everything about the shape feels like it was literally molded to fit my hand to a tee so depending on your size or your grip preference this may be a fit for you we'll cover that in a minute but real quick also inside the box you get a usbc super mesh cable for charging or if you want to use this wired then taking a peek inside the glory hole we get the wireless usbc dongle and the adapter the adapter is for if you don't have an available usb slot on your pc or laptop you can just use this and connect it to any free port you have worth noting i said it before in previous reviews but the dongle does not fit into the front i o on my case that lip kind of prevents it so i have to plug it into the back but you may not have this case so whatever but let's circle back to the shape for a minute because like i said for me this is up there it's one of the most comfortable it comes in at 125 millimeters long 59 millimeters wide at the front 68 millimeters wide at the back hips stands 42 and a half millimeters tall at its highest point and 23 millimeters at the front i'm a hybrid claw fingertip grip i guess you could say i feel like my grip kind of changes depending on what's going on in game if that makes sense but hot damn still serious these prime mice are clutch and i say these because the prime mice are actually from a lineup of three total mice all brand new just released with the prime prime plus and hear the prime wireless they're all identical in terms of shape the differences are the wire two are lighter and cheaper coming in at sixty dollars for the 69 gram prime the prime plus is eighty dollars for 71 grams then here the wireless is 80 grams at 130 they all have a different sensor as well and personally they should have just released one wired alternative instead of two but hey some other physical features here are the textured matte finish that is oh so subtle but does provide a nice grip in your hand instead the micro texture also allows for a quick and easy cleanup if you've got jizz juice on the mouse kidding obviously but if you have oils from your hands and fingerprints stuff like that if it has those noticeable smudges it does wipe off in a second and as a right handed mouse we have two left side buttons an illuminating scroll wheel and inside are the brand new optical switches they call prestige om a magnetic optical switch designed completely differently than a traditional mechanical switch i don't have any loose ones to show you so breaking out the x-ray lens will give you an idea of how it works with the tension spring mechanism inside it actuates the infrared light beam register with your pc that signal is immediately sent and also the construction allows for an industry-leading 100 million clicks here's how they sound and as you can see for the two paddles very very little shift or post travel when you actuate the switch since you have that lip there because the paddles are kind of recessed into the body that stops it they don't move left and right it feels very very solid so definitely a nice thick left and right click here nice and satisfying i'm not the biggest fan of the scroll wheel however and also as you heard when squeezing it and stuff no creaking nothing like that it's a very well made mouse on the bottom then we have a pretty you know a new upgrade for seal series with these 100 virgin ptfe feet i wish the air x3 had these but we have four total two up front around the sensor and a larger foot on the bottom your on and off switch a dpi shifter as well and then let's talk sensor for a minute and their wireless technology you know razer has hyper speed logitech has light speed corsair uses slipstream so steel series now with their technology it's called quantum 2.0 and this wireless tech gives their true move air optical sensor in this mouse a 100 to 18 000 cpi range it's a thousand hertz pulling 400 ips you can have five saved cpi levels on the mouse and it can be adjusted in increments of a hundred and we'll talk software in a minute but gaming with this yes i have to say hands down pun intended the least transition time ever i've had adjusting to a new mouse again i've made the viper ultimate since release and i'm used to that symmetrical shape but as i said everything here just feels right i was streaming with this last week and everyone was asking what mask i was using because everything just felt automatic snapping to enemies in battlefield 4 quick 180s to cover my backside i mean it when i say this this just feels so so good and i had zero issues during gaming you know it wasn't cutting out there was no delay no liftoff issues nothing battery on this also for a wireless mouse a very important factor it's stellar a hundred hours of use i would say with my time you know i'd rgb on when i was filming and gaming and stuff when i got it in i'd say probably estimated close to around 60 hours with the rgb uh but just a 15 minute charge gives you 40 hours of juice so that's insane you're really not going to have any down time with this so again they say a hundred depending on what rgb lights you have on the brightness the effects it's gonna vary but still 15 minute charge 40 hours charge it in between a match go get a drink go take a dump you'll have a full day's use two days and then real quick to touch on their gg software it's pretty simple laid out right in front of you with options to remap the five buttons on this mouse plus the scroll wheel this includes like creating macros you can reassign as well then for adjusting your cpi range i do wish we could adjust it more precisely i feel like only the 100 steps is kind of a bummer corsair lets you adjust it in increments of one i'm like a 750 kind of guy but on here 800 does feel kind of right for the battery modes there's like a sleeper timer an rgb dimmer in a mode to help you save battery which is called high efficiency that disables rgb and lowers your pulling rate to 125. so i you know avoid that but then for rgb under the illumination tab since we only have the one zone with the scroll wheel you can either like keep it a static color pick from the color shift palettes if you want a few different colors going on or just have it pulse in and out pretty simple i just keep it static now i do wish we would have a battery percentage like anywhere in the software it's currently non-existent and it only shows the like battery logo in terms of three bars on like the front dashboard so yeah that's a must steel series i'm the kind of guy who needs to know what percentage i'm at precisely the scroll wheel does pulse red when it's low but again is it at twenty percent percent 10 5 i don't know i need to know so as i've been alluding to the whole time this mouse is for me absolutely love it one of the best shapes i've tried i really don't have too many complaints with it you know it's got a great sensor 18 000 cpi if you need all that uh the new 100 virgin ptfe feet here so it's gonna feel nice and slick on your mouse pad it's really a good mouse with great battery and again great shape my one complaint like i said before very very you know minor i just don't i'm not the biggest fan of the scroll wheel it's not a satisfying uh click and when i'm you know doing like a quick fast scroll it just doesn't feel too satisfying to me that's a very very minor issue like this very well could be my main and i say that because again i've been using the viper ultimate since release and i'm very stuck in my ways like i've been using that for a while didn't really have plans of changing anytime soon um i used the corsair k95 platinum for like three years as well so once i'm in my ways of the product i'm like you know dedicated to it so will this be my new main uh i don't 100 know but i mean i don't have any plans of not using this soon so we'll have to see but the point is for 130 steelseries is doing a very very killer job here with this i would have liked to have seen you know maybe an extra pair of feet included inside the box maybe some sort of like textured skins you can apply to it a bunch of companies are doing that now and for 130 you know it wouldn't hurt to include that uh the g pro super lite you know a uh a very egg symmetrical shape but probably the main competitor to this uh they also include you know skins and stuff but man if you are an ergo user this or ergo handy you know what i'm saying uh this right now for me it's king killer stuff killer stuff seal series and guys that'll wrap it up for my review of the steel series prime wireless hope you all enjoyed like i said if you want to check out the other prime mics with the prime the prime plus the wired cheaper alternative that are also lighter of all them
