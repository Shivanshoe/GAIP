what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today's video is gonna be going over what I think is the most common overlooked aspect when it comes to improving your setup and it has to do with one question that I get in nearly every single video regardless of what the video is about now also for this we're gonna go vlog-style doesn't have to be a formal video we'll make it fun I know you guys like when I do vlogs and switch it up every now and then like a hybrid type video but yeah we're not gonna waste any time let's start it off today you know if i zoom in so you can't tell the junk in boxes in the background it also makes it seem like my studio is a lot cleaner than it is alright so there's a few different things we'll go over later including some other desktop mods if you remember in the last setup vlog I got a brand new wooden desktop we're gonna add the legs doesn't sag over time some lighting things like that we'll worry about later but like I said the most common and overlooked aspect to any setup and it all starts right here the desktop wallpaper now I know you might roll your eyes it might sound dumb but as the hosts of room tour project I go through thousands of submissions and almost always the desktop wallpaper could either make or break a setup so we're gonna talk about different techniques ways and tips that you can match your setup to the wallpaper including this one that I always get questions about different animated wallpapers because believe it or not there's more to it than just the face value of just a wallpaper alright so the first thing we're gonna talk about is fitting it to a theme and I'll be using wallpaper engine for this it's software you can buy I'm seeing for only four dollars I have showed off this probably three or four times on the channel before so I'm not gonna do an in-depth review or a video on this but what you want to do is fit it to a theme so for example what I like to do is when I go into my installed ones during the winter time I will find a winter themed wallpaper as you can see it's so nice and snowing and stuff like that some snowy foggy woods going on maybe it's summertime you know you want something nice I don't know energizing and finally think to have some motion is always good too you can see here though the water it looks like it's moving because it's animated there are just tons of different ones you can go to fit a certain theme but a certain aesthetic but like I said I just think having something like appropriate to the season is definitely cool now the one that I use that I get questions about all the time is night city cyberpunk 2077 true 4k this is the one that I have big data questions about all the time and as you can see it's sort of like this animated you know cyberpunk world and it looks pretty cool as a background because you can you notice the motion that's why I get a lot of questions and comments about it because you notice the subtle motion going on so this one what I do is I have it right now set to clone so you guys can just see the the fit image right here but to span it I go to stretch that's what stretches it across all three of my monitors and depending on your monitor setup or your orientation you always want to stretch it so it's not you know cloned cuz when it's cloned it looks dumb and you can also have different wallpapers for different monitors and stuff like I said you don't want all three the same on one and I'll show you a few examples of why everything just looks better spanned across all your displays parlous if you have two three four five whatever it just makes it more unified obviously finding a wallpaper for one monitor is pretty simple but say you have more than one like two or three mainly two let's keep it two for the examples it's gonna make more sense if you have two monitors side by side again never clone never use two of the same for each monitor what you want to do is either invert it or reverse it yeah what I mean by that is literally whether it's going into some photo editing program or some way that you could inverse an image so that it is flipped you want to have that so it's still gonna go along with the wallpaper that it's next to but really just be the inverted end of it so it still flows naturally thankfully for this one it's essentially a 4k video for the cyberpunk wallpaper so it looks great span across all three still and again it's in the background it's out of focus but you notice the subtle motion and there is literally thousands and thousands of wallpapers you can go into discover or workshop don't only why they have two different tabs here but there are I don't even know I wish it would tell you how much but there's over a thousand plus pages let's see can we go to the last page now but yeah Barrett anything you can think of from a game a movie a theme a color whatever they have all right here you could sort by your the most popular of the year week month the day most upload subscriptions so you can literally I'm telling you find anything you think of in a wallpaper which is really cool if you like DVA you can just hit subscribe it'll download okay so that's keeping a beat let's just forget that happened but yes you guys get the idea you want to find the wallpaper it's gonna fit you your setup your theme and the season if you will try to find them animated it'll make it look better so answering that first question this wallpaper I use is night city cyberpunk 2077 in 4k also for a tip I find that a lot of times you have plants on your desktop having a green wallpaper or something you know with vegetation whether it is plants or trees something like that in the wallpaper it makes it look really good and standout as well and going along with that say you're having trouble finding a theme or a certain wallpaper that will match yours I would say tend to keep it more on the minimal side nothing too too busy but also if you're matching it with colors reference a color wheel you want to either have a wallpaper it's new the same color as your theme or the direct opposite to complement it's that's just gonna make it pop and stand out more alright so the big takeaway I know I was rambling for a bit but never clone your wallpapers find one that's big enough so you could span it or reverse it and trust me as you saw with the examples I use that took a long time to Photoshop it will look much better in the end now as you can tell it is a new day I aim to film the entire vlog all in one day yesterday but I realized half of it there was no audio because my mic died so last night I had to record a lot of the audio or rerecord a lot of it anyways still a lot to do today but the first thing I want to do is add support to the desk so that doesn't sag over time cuz it's solid wood again the last vlog we got a completely new wooden desk top but I didn't get a leg I got something else for it okay so coming under the desk the support bracket I got is this massive l-shaped one it is made of steel very very solid I actually thought I bought it in black and I was gonna have to paint it white but I guess I forgot that I did order it in white so when I mount it here it will be mounted to the wall it won't stick out enough because you can see like really where it goes to they won't stick out so I won't accidentally kick it because that would hurt and it'll be a lot easier cuz I could just drill into the wall and again not to worry about an actual leg coming down in the middle of the desk [Music] [Music] next step is then gonna be mounting this cable raceway gutter whatever you want to call it underneath in the back over here on the right side so that way I could wrap the cables from my keyboard on my amp and DAC underneath because I'm definitely not gonna drill a hole in this beautiful wooden desktop like I did on the old IKEA one unfortunately while that made it you know easier I'm just not gonna do that to this desktop [Music] oh yeah much better a lot cleaner as well as taking me too long to think to spray-paint that outlet cover I know it's stuck out but yeah desk is fully supported now looking a lot better cable management under control and I didn't even bother doing it cuz I it was whatever well as you can see I added the white LED light strip behind the desk and I picked up two of these cuz first off it's very hard finding just a pure white LED light strip that is also USB so I just plug it into the back of my PC and then when I turn on my PC it illuminates instead of having to plug it into the wall and then manually turn it on when I want it to on and off so yeah this is three meters of 6000 Kelvin which just under ten feet so it's a really nice you know length to line the entire back side of my desk okay just for some extra glow and stuff in the background when you see the desk think it looks good okay and then since we're still you know on the topic of wallpaper for this vlog the next thing I'm gonna do is something I've never really done before and that's actually apply wallpaper to a wall so I'm in one of the spare bedrooms in my house that I'm gonna be converting to be another kind of secondary filming area a nice little clean and minimal setup over here again just to have another sort of office workspace and a different area to film so I'm gonna apply some wallpaper right here and it's different than just a regular wallpaper it's gonna kind of have a concrete look to it in texture what you think would definitely be different and just add a nice you know contrast to the room when it's complete I have a vision for it you'll see it probably July or something when it's all done and put together [Music] and this poof is serious all right so that she didn't take too long and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be the worst part was just when you get to the end it's hard to like fish the back of the paper down and smooth it against a wall when you're hitting up against the wall but yeah all together again it's not gonna be in focus because when I have the desk set up and stuff this is gonna be out of focus just adding some texture and stuff to the background and I will say the the print itself up close isn't that high quality but from afar it looks pretty fine you can't tell where each of the panel's line up because of the texture it's hidden pretty well and it does kind of have more of a bluish tint to it but again in this room I have no lights in here so with the natural light coming in from the window like this wall is gray but it looks a little bit on the warmer side so the white balance is all off until I get some lights in here but not too bad so yeah a video entirely vlogging about wallpapers digital and a tangible physical types so hope you enjoyed I will put some of the product stuff down below that I used if you want to check out this wallpaper I'll put that down below as well but yeah just like I said wall
