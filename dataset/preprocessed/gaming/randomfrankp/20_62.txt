what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out and reviewing the brand new glorious model d wireless yes just like when you're newly single no more strings attached to this d so today we're gonna check it all out for you guys pros cons talk about my experience my opinion all that good stuff in case you're trying to pick up the new model d wireless or if you're looking to upgrade from your current gaming mouse all right so checking it out just like we saw glorious do last year with the model o to model o wireless now we have the ergonomic shape with the model d wireless here on deck it does come in both a black and a white color option in both matte finishes no more glossy and it's advertised i have 69 grams like a 2 gram variance on my scale comes in right at 68 grams so just slightly lower than advertised and definitely still on that lightweight spectrum here and getting it unboxed yes it is pretty much identical in terms of you know shape and design to the original model d just now wireless obviously however visually there is one change you can note by the original model d we no longer have the honeycomb cutouts on the left and right clicks so it ditched that here i think it's also a much more cleaner look without those honeycombs in the paddles so a big fan of that and again still very very lightweight but yeah same shape and size you're familiar with now as for dimensions it comes in at 61 millimeters wide at the front 67 millimeters wide at its widest point in the back is 128 millimeters long just around 20 millimeters at the front and stands 42 millimeters high at its highest point so on the more medium to larger side for a mouse and if you're someone who's a big fan of like the model d minus with a model o minus and you're holding out for a potentially minus wireless version that could be a thing we'll eventually get a smaller one i assume just probably not anytime soon and just real quick before we move on inside the box we do have the usb receiver obviously for the wireless connection it does come with a usbc adapter if you want to use usbc cable and you know kind of extend that range if you want it closer to your pc that also means yes obviously the mouse is usbc an additional pair of their model d skates to kind of widen the foot underneath in your typical literature the startup guide and the odin sticker and a friendly little reminder to remove the film underneath now it's not a feature obviously you might be rolling your eyes at that but you would not believe how many times i've seen people whether on reddit or in room tour project submissions still have the film on their mice without knowing they should take it off the feet so uh yeah now you know take them off and i'm sure some of you are guilty out there of it too talking to you now one of the new things this mouse has over the previous glorious mice is brand new switches so they're using their own proprietary switches i believe in the past they were omron 20 mil these are their own 80 mil clicks they said these switches are made in collaboration with kale so i'm happy to see something new and not just you know a rehashed shell in all internals from the previous mice do a quick sound test you can hear how it all sounds so nice and crisp for sure and i had no issues in terms of like post travel on any of the buttons or the paddles everything here feeling good so then obviously with it being wireless they are using their same bamf sensor it's their proprietary sensor made in collaboration with pixar same one for the modelo wireless it's got 400 ips tracking speed a maximum of 19 000 dpi and 100 hertz pulling all configurable inside the software we'll touch on that in a little bit it has a very very low 2.08 milliseconds of latency and can reach up to 5 meters from the dongle so really zero complaints on my end obviously if there was an issue i would bring that up so with my time gaming and testing it i did a boneheaded move of mainly playing battlefield 2042 with those early access tests and betas and stuff i can't record any gameplay so that sucks gotta say though super pumped for that so i had to switch back to battlefield 5 for a bit and like i just alluded to with this sensor it feels buttery i usually gain between six to 800 dpi on my viper ultimate i was mainly at around 650 for here i had just around 700 i guess we could say i guess i mainly play at those lower dpis because i enjoy sniping in battlefield so i'm just more used to that setting but i can definitely confirm their claims if you know real low latency here i just had zero issues no hiccups no interruptions no spin outs no double clicks nothing at all plus with my razer strider mouse pad that i use it's a very nice sort of hybrid pad very similar to the heian you combine that hybrid surface with their ptfe feet here it's 100 pure feet so a nice smooth glide and i just feel like for me right around 700 dpi is a good sweet spot but again that's just me and i'll tell you a real nice lightweight ergonomic mouse like this uh feels great because i've been a pretty big fan of the steelseries prime wireless and that's just around 80 grams so a little over 10 grams shed here yeah you still have the honeycomb cut out on like the back side of the shell where your palm is but i mean let's be real that's covered most of the time i don't know it's just a real noticeable difference switching from my viper ultimate to the prime wireless now to the lightweight ergo shape of this and then real quick we'll talk about their software which is glorious core and to note this is actually different software from the wired version of their mice so you do have to download this instead it's very simple it does show you like sort of two battery level indicators on the left tab and on the bottom right here it's rated for up to 71 hours which is absolutely crazy i gain most of the time with the rgb at 50 and a static color so it doesn't drain as quick by the way you can also use the mouse while it's charging and speaking of which the first tab here is lighting and again obviously if you disable rgb or you make it a less you know dramatic crazy effect you're also going to save some battery as well so here if you can control which effect you want the color the brightness all that you then have their key bindings we can go in and reprogram any of the six actual buttons on the mouse itself to be whatever you want it's all there on the right side what you can then change the button too macros shortcut single key presses keyboard functions all that stuff then the last performance tabs where you can go in and change your dpi you can make up to six dpi sages saved to the mouse the dpi is also adjustable in increments of 10 and here you can also do things like adjust your liftoff distance the debounce time and your polling rate but yes very simple self-explanatory software one thing though is they're using the picture of the model d because you could still see the honeycomb sort of cutouts there so i assume they're going to update that now i'm sitting here and i seriously cannot think of a single con or a negative point about this mouse my entire experience has been a 10. so at the end of the day it comes down to you obviously with your hand size your preferred grip and your preferred shape and for me personally the model d wireless checks off a lot of those boxes pretty much all of them if you're looking for a new wireless ergo-shaped mouse and when i was trying to figure out how to formally articulate this review and you know end it it came down to one very obvious point the price real quick let's take a look at the other leaders in the wireless mouse market right now viper ultimate very very popular launched around 140 to 150. the uh logitech g pro x super light launched for 150 but they're symmetrical so how about the leader right now in the ergo market right one of my favorites a mouse that i've been meaning for like two three months now the steel series prime wireless that launched for 130 i believe so the model d wireless where does this come in at well it's 80 yes 80 bucks nearly half the price of the other leaders in the wireless mouse market right now uh giving you almost half off the competition and it more than holds its own against all those and it's just crazy to see how glorious is making such great affordable options out there and really not cutting corners anywhere so at the end of the day like i said depending on your hand size your grip all that stuff what you're looking for in a mouse the model d wireless gets that dub i said before i had no issues with connectivity gaming was great you have great battery life updated switches for 80 bucks what more could you want the model d wireless there's your answer now to wrap up this review hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below if you like
