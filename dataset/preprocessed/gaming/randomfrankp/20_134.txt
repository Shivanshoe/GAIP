what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out my top five favorite gaming mouse pads from this last year so as we roll into 2021 i'll be showing you my top five favorites that came out since the start of 2020. we're also getting a few runner-ups so stay tuned to the end for that and what we're gonna do is talk about the top five in order of my favorite and give a quick rundown of each and you know what i think about them and then at the end we're gonna do a side by side by side by side comparison of the more detailed stuff you can get a better idea of how they stack up next to each other if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but first up a message from our sponsor and you're gonna like this one so [Music] here that keyboard's been a pretty hot commodity in the community so definitely check it out while you can now starting us off at number five we're gonna have a very unique cordera mouse pad from end game gear this the mpc 890. this version i have here is one of three it's their medium sized one and it's 890 by 450 millimeters now obviously this like navy blue and yellow look really isn't to be for everyone when it comes to aesthetics so that might be a turn off but why i wanted to include it is because cordera is a very very interesting surface overall it's a really unique material it's actually used for things like military wear luggage backpacks the very strong fabric and even like motorcycle pants and jackets use this material for that abrasion resistance so it's going to be a tough surface but still give you a pretty slick glide so it's just really interesting which is why i wanted to include it as you see up close it kind of resembles this like beaded surface but it's not it's just the stitching to this fabric now for durability this is gonna last you a while and the surface won't break down over time however if you bend it like you see up at top it will have a permanent crease in it and this is alongside as you can see another mouse pad will talk about in a minute so just do your best not to fold this to avoid that creasing but then another plus side to this fabric and its durability is the complete water resistance if you knock over a water bottle on your desktop the water will collect and it won't soak in as for the outside stitching it is a black outline with the yellow stitching in the middle so it is going to stand out visually like i said and it is slightly raised um when you're putting your mouse over it there is a noticeable edge when you're getting towards the end of your mouse pad you will feel it hit the bottom of your mouse feet with that being said for the stitching it's not 100 perfect you can kind of see where they sort of started and finish the stitching not a big deal overall but like i said you will feel this on your mouse feet at the edge underneath the bottom surface is rubber and it does stick to your desktop pretty well i will say because the overall fabric here is heavier it barely budges but if you do give it a big push then yes obviously will move but no issues during gaming and regular use now what i'll do for each mouse pad is show you a scale in terms of roughness from one to five one being a very soft material five being a rougher material and also show you a graph of the overall speed and glide to it so with that being said i will rate the mpc 890 a four out of 5 in terms of roughness meaning you will feel a little bit on your wrist but you're also going to feel that tougher weave on your mouse but then in return i'm also going to rate this a 4 out of 5 in terms of the glide speed because just due to that cordera surface and the particular weave it has it's very tight a bit harder so all together it's a pretty fast mouse pad now for this next segment as we start to build the format of this entire video you'll see how it goes along for each one we're going to do a sound test of each mouse pads you can hear how that particular fabric and surface sounds with your mouse but i'm going to be using my razer viper ultimate which has the hyper glide equivalent 100 virgin ptfe feet so you could hear how it sounds when you're using it so as you heard it's a bit of a louder surface kind of sounds like you're djing a little bit so yeah coming at number five the endgame gear mpc 890 with their cordera surface now for number four from x-ray pad we have the aqua control plus i'm sure you're familiar with x-ray pad they make a ton of different mouse pads out there you probably see it on youtube but why this one's so unique is because the surface is actually uncoated so there's no graphic or anything on it in the material itself it's gonna be more raw and feel a bit different so yes you can buy the aquacontrol plus with a graphic and stuff on it but it's gonna feel different and also you can buy them uncoated either black or white this one is 900 by 300 millimeters and it also stands three millimeters tall and honestly during use i can really compare this to the mpc-890 the one you just saw with the cordera surface they're similar but also very different so that was more of a speed pad here with the name you know aqua control plus this is more of a control pad but what's funny is to the touch and on your mouse they feel very very similar i would also rate this a four out of five in terms of roughness again on your mouse and also on your wrist so you're gonna feel it because again the coating here it's uncoated so you're gonna have that more natural kind of grit to it on your wrist but with that you're gonna be sacrificing some speed so i would rate this a two out of five on the speed rating and i just found with this everything was very precise and very controlled in terms of stitching all white to match the actual mouse pad the edge is slightly erased but there is no interference at all with your mouse then again underneath it is a rubber padding not the grippiest out there not going to budge when you're using it just very very similar with the mpc 890 and again the sound test now this mouse pad has been great for durability it looks pretty much brand new still and since it's white it's not going to show any wear from your mouse or your wrist over time most dark mouse pads start to sort of turn lighter just naturally from your skin cells and dust as nasty as that sounds but this still appears like new so the aqua control plus is very very interesting you get more control versus speed and it's just funny how similar in just design and feel the mpc 890 is with the aqua control plus but they're two different mouse pads so if you want that speed you go end game gear if you want this control with this particular surface you go the aqua control plus uncoated but again they have so many different ones out there this one i thought was one of the more unique ones and just the one that gave me a very different sort of feel which i'm not really used to so that's why i wanted to include it and definitely worth being mentioned at number four now coming in at number three we have the fnatic dash i've showed this off in the channel before and it's probably been my most used mouse pad of 2020 but yes it is coming out number three so there are two other ones that i like better but also like i said in the intro stay tuned because we're going to have a side-by-side comparison for all them so at 950 by 500 millimeters this is definitely a bit of a larger one it's slightly bigger than your traditional extended mouse pad they do also make a smaller size as well now the surface here is a hybrid surface it's a very low friction f15 material what does that mean who knows but i can definitely vouch for the speed you can see for the material it's that equal x and y stitching here so the glide whether you're going vertical or horizontal it's gonna feel smooth and equal all across and i like how they kept it minimal with just the holographic logo on the bottom right side it's not big it's not in your face obnoxious just nice and tucked away in the corner now with my time using it i give this a two out of five in terms of roughness so it is on the softer side in terms of touch and on your mouse and i'd give it a four out of five on the glide scale because yes this does have a really nice smooth glide to it overall so you complement each other with the softer material with a better speed and glide to it i wouldn't say it's going to like improve your flicks or anything like that but it really does complement a nice set of ptfe feet the stitching on the side is very tight it's also a lot slimmer than some of the wider stitching i've seen and it does not interfere or anything with your mouse and then again flipping it over it's the same exact rubber that we've seen on the last two mouse pads that same exact base it's really not gonna budge unless you're trying to move it so all in all i'm definitely a big fan of the fnatic dash it's just a really soft surface great for speed but also because it is a softer mouse pad overall you get a good amount of stopping power like it gives you the ability to you know dig your mouse in if you want to stop real quick because of the surface three millimeters uh it just has a has nice give overall i guess i could say so definitely my most used mouse pad of the year and obviously one of my favorites as it comes in number three on this list but that's not without its durability issues because this is also a victim of that permanent creasing like you saw so just for testing i left all the extended mouse pads folded over a chair overnight and the dash and the end game gear pad were the only two that had that mark left in it now this is going to be compared to it's a very similar surface to the glorious fire pad which just came out a month or two ago but this is the og version this came out a few months before glorious did and it's also a lot bigger than the size that glorious offers but speaking of glorious coming in at number two we have the polarizing glorious ice pad this one of their artisan series mouse pads and i love this thing now i say polarizing because not everybody likes this some people love it some people hate it i am on team love this is a super unique mouse pad this does unfortunately just come in this one size but it is four millimeters tall so it's the thicker one so far on this list what makes it so appealing and different is the glass infused surface up top it is super super smooth and also with its name being glorious ice it's cold to the touch so it's really interesting but the glass infusion here is butter it's butter guys so this artisan pad is most often compared to the actual artisan kai which is a very similar surface i have that i showed it off i believe the beginning of 2020 and it's a great mouse pad but my issue with that was after just a week whatever sort of coating they used for the glass surface it was very quickly starting to wear down and have noticeable like cracks in the actual mouse pad surface like you could see the wear and tear i've been using this for a little over a month and a half now and there is zero difference from day one to now so durability on here in terms of the actual coating and how it holds up is very very impressive and i just can't stress enough how smooth this is actually i can because i gave you guys the rating i'd say it's a zero out of five in terms of roughness meaning that yes it is like i said pretty much butter whether it is your wrist your mouse whatever mouse you're using whatever mouse feet you have it is gonna be ultra ultra slick for the glide speed i'd rate it a five out of five super super fast and i'll take it a step further if you're using ceramic feet you know there's electric ceramic feet out there that are round glorious has their g floats if using that with this it's a 10 out of 5 in terms of speed and i'm not kidding so as you heard with the zero additive fee as well as a ceramic feet not only does it feel very smooth but it's virtually silent so that's an added bonus if you want to game with this not disturb anybody because like you heard with the cordera mouse pad that's very loud this is the complete opposite super fast super smooth super super silent it is this is crazy it's a crazy mouse pad and like i said before you either love it or you hate it you're gonna have to adjust to this type of mouse pad surface but for me it's been nothing but good things all thumbs up in terms of stitching on the side very tight as well also very thin and discreet so it doesn't interfere with the mouse it's barely raised at all and the rubber bottom base does seem to have a bit of an extra grip to it has a bit more tactility to the touch so it's not gonna budge for being a smaller mouse pad now there is one thing i do want to point out and it's not a deal breaking issue but worth mentioning the surface will attract a ton of fingerprints and oils from your hands as you can see it's definitely a magnet for that the remedy though for it's pretty simple just use a microfiber cloth and rub it down and it'll be like new again i recommend doing this at least once a week to maintain that like new look so again i prefer this over the artist in shetikai just because this has been better in terms of durability and this was gonna be number one until in november i received a new mouse pad that really blew me away and that is the 2020 actual fx artisan mouse pad the hayate atsu this the newer 2020 version they recently released and this version is the extra soft variant so they do have different ones you can order this is just the config that i got and yes these are actually imported from japan it costs 8 200 yen and it took about two weeks so that's definitely a downer but what makes this number one is just overall the quality here when you get this in you can tell this feels absolute premium the surface itself does feel pretty smooth i'd give it like a three out of five in terms of roughness um maybe more so two out of five with your mouse a three on your wrist because it does feel smoother while you're gaming and what's interesting is it has this sort of chevron pattern to it you can see in certain lighting even though the x and y axis does feel pretty smooth altogether again for that horizontal and vertical uh glide on your mouse but this chevron pattern is pretty interesting to see for the glide speed i'd rate it at right in the middle at 2.5 out of 5 and simply order the extra soft version it's just spongy i think it's the best word to describe it like you can see when i physically press down into it you see it rebound but it's slow because it is just so spongy soft and that's also going to give you more stopping power because again since it is so soft you can really just get a feel for it dig your mouse into it and get that control but like i said before with the overall premium durability on the sides the actual stitching is pretty much near flush with the actual mouse pad top coating and there is zero interference so in terms of that this is the best stitching i've seen and flipping it over it is definitely the grippiest undercoating i've seen you can just tell it's a different breed from the other mouse pads out there so number one is the 2020 refresh with the extra soft version of the hayate atsu and it's just a really premium feel overall while still being super smooth with that really just spongy soft material to it it's a really unique mouse pad that is tough for me to fully describe without you actually feeling it for yourself and honestly like it blew me away i was all ready to give the glorious ice the number one mousepad on this list until i got in the atsu and really just fell in love with it i wish it was i wish i made an extended version versus this smaller one which they do consider as the actual extra large variant so yes number one now like i said before two runner-ups we'll run through these real quick there's still the actual comparison stuff i want to get to this is a super long video and the first runner-up is gonna be the sky pad which is an old glass mouse pad you can pick this up in a few different colors as well and no just because it's glass does not mean it's gonna cut you or anything it's nothing like that and i've said before i'm just not myself a hard mouse pad surface kind of guy i can never really fully adjust to them so that's why i didn't make my top five necessarily but again if you are someone out there who does prefer a hard pad surface then there's nothing going to be more hard than actual glass it's a frosted glass so if you have lights at your desk it's not going to be like reflecting off that and blinding you or anything and for durability it's glass but it's not fragile depending on what kind of floor you have if you drop it it'll be just fine so if you're in a heat of rage unless you like just go bury balance on this thing it won't shatter [Applause] [Laughter] now yes naturally because it's glass it is going to be louder both on 100 virgin ptfe feet as well as just for comparison i showed you how loud it was with the ceramic feet with the g floats so it's going to be loud but again it's glass that's the sacrifice you want super speed here you want the fastest of the fast out there uh this sky pad i think is definitely one of the best which is why it's a runner-up it's not for me but it could be for you if you prefer this type how about another runner-up from odin we have the infiniti and i'm putting this as a runner up because it is very similar to the fnatic dash i just felt from my testing it wasn't as quick there was less speed on the infinity versus the dash that's kind of odd because to the touch they feel pretty much identical they sound pretty much identical but when i took a look up close with the macro lens you could see while very very similar looking the braid and the stitching to the fanatic dash was a bit tighter as a result it gave the mouse a more equal glide all across versus on the actual infinity it would start to sort of tail spin out after just maybe like 12 to 16 inches of a glide so again two very very similar pads in terms of the construction and the feel and weave to it but just the dash in the end gave better results i felt and was a bit faster now the infiniti does have the edge over the dash in terms of durability so i did do that same fold and crease testing on the infinity and it did not crease like the dash did so i'm giving you two options if you prefer speed you go dash if you prefer that long term durability you go to the infinity so yeah the two runner ups plus my top five now to bring it all together obviously you saw the order which just went in but as always like we do with these top five videos keep in mind this is my personal list of the ones that i've tested throughout the year these are the ones that i think that are worth mentioning the most and also a mousepad is not going to make you a better gamer but what it will do is complement your playstyle for better or for worse that's why i'm showing you different options different ones out there that could complement you and your mouse your mouse feet so to recap real quick for durability the minerva pad is going to be probably one of the best in terms of that long term like this will probably last you probably close to five years because if it's a really tough fabric whereas the dash has shown more use in a shorter time period whether you're looking for speed or control again depending on your play style your mouse your dpi all that stuff's gonna play a factor into this but the ice pad is by far the slickest fastest pad on here well again just factoring in the top five not including the sky pad but yeah the ice pad is something real special the dash is also pretty quick and for a tougher surface kind of resembling a harder pad that's where the cordero comes in from end game gear however if you're all about control the artisan pad gives you a really nice blend of the two it's soft but it's just so spongy so it gives you that flexibility to really dig in and get control and stopping power again i'd say also a nice blend on the dash pad and of course with it being in the name the control pad a tougher grittier surface with more control not so much speed there so this has been a long video if you're still watching at this point thank you drop a comment down below uh say something stupid like i don't know p is stored in the balls you know how it is that's how i know you're still watching uh but thank you guys for watching this video the top five mouse pads of 2020 as we roll into 2021 showing you some of the best that came out in the last year again obviously in my opinion and giving you a lot of variety of different surfaces out there so lots of flexibility complementing your play style if you want to check them out i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below if you like this video give it a thumbs up show your support
