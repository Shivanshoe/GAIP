what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out the brand new controversial 550 airpods max headphones as well as comparing these to three other headphone options out there that i think are a better deal now this won't be a dedicated review but more so a detailed kind of overview of my experience my thoughts and opinions with the airpods max versus the three other options which are gonna be the 339 dollar bose headphone 700 we also have the 275 dollar sony 1000 xm4 or the cheaper option the xm3 the xm4 is just the newer version and then the 400 drop panda so all three wireless headphones that i think are just a better option for the money in the end but we'll still go through it all again talk about my experience my opinions and just what i think about the new airpods max versus these three other options so first up just taking a look at them like most of apple products they do have that clean design they have a pretty premium look i'd say they definitely stand out the construction here for the ear cups is this anodized aluminum and they're a matte finish and just for my handling they seem to do a pretty good job of avoiding picking up on your fingerprints as well you do have these nice and smooth telescoping arms to adjust the size of the headband if you have a larger or a wider head um i don't mind it too much it's not as satisfying as other you know clicky headband adjustments out there and up top for the headband it's this really interesting mesh material and honestly i kind of like it uh just due to the way it's constructed obviously if you just lay it on your head it will kind of then just sit naturally and do the materials it'll kind of just even out the balance a bit uh but really just in terms of visuals you know talking just purely aesthetics i really don't mind it at all they're definitely a nice pair of headphones so for color options we have it here in the space gray it's also available in silver a sky blue a light green a pink color and clear because clearly these headphones are too expensive i'm just kidding clear isn't real please clap also real quick on the side we do have this digital crown for taking calls adjusting volume and playback controls it's pretty much just like a bigger crown like they have on the apple watch and then next to that is the button for toggling noise cancellation just talking it on and off we'll talk about this more in detail in a minute but first i really just like the fact that they're on top of the ear cup versus like every other pair of headphones in the world either have it on the back side or underneath it's just more natural that way versus having it up top and also with the design of the aluminum ear cups they clash against each other and hard when you're not using them it's like hitting rocks together so to combat that apple gives you their hearse the headphones purse or the horse that you're going to want to end up in once you realize this is the case they give you for a 550 pair of headphones it doesn't make any sense they looked at this case and thought yep that's uh that's it like that's the final case i mean hell we didn't really go over it yet but for the other headphones like the bose yep they include a carrying case sony you know it and even the drop panda headphones yes all three have actual carrying cases what are you doing apple like seriously what kind of case is this if i ever see anybody like walking down the street just carrying their headphones like this with this case it's gonna straight up just just ball tap them just a quick i'm out of there they're never gonna see it come on either because they have those apple blinders on you know uh so what is the benefit of this um kind of battery life you could say not really though so when you set down your airpods max and just leave them be for five minutes they go into a low power mode then after 72 hours of stationary it goes into the ultra low power mode to preserve battery but if they are in the actual smart case when you're not using them they go into that low power mode immediately then after 18 hours in the smart case the airpods max go into the ultra low power mode so what the hell does that mean right pretty much you put them in the case then they go to low power mode but what really gets confusing is apple doesn't even explain the difference between what they deem low power and ultra low power drainage so there's no real way for even us to even like test that out because no one has to tell you if it's in low power or ultra low power so it definitely gets confusing and also with their own verbage they always say stationary when it's stationary then it goes into low power versus ultra low power but what if it's not stationary what if i bring these around with me what if i move them in that 72 hour time period what if i put them in my bag not in the case is it still going to be draining more battery because it's not stationary so it's not going into ultra low power mode who knows um also guess what there's no power button you heard that right so they didn't include a power button and they also didn't include a cable for wired listening and you can't plug the lightning cable into the usb c port on your computer and get any sound out of these if you want that you have to drop an additional 35 dollars and the icing on the cake here is there's no passive mode so if these die you can't just plug them in and use them and still get audio no they have to have power to use them um and speaking of you know battery life and stuff it's really not too bad it's rated at around 20 hours and if you plug them in for five minutes of charge you get an hour and a half of battery so that's not bad for a quick charge but again you still do need to have them actually plugged in to get battery to use them in the first place and the 20 hours i would say is pretty on par for me they're overall a quieter pair at a hundred percent so i was constantly having them at full blast uh so it did drain a bit quicker than other reviewers i've been seeing out there rated at like 25 or 26 hours uh yeah i found for me 20 hours was pretty accurate but let's talk about sound quality because let's face it that's the most important aspect of buying headphones especially 550 headphones so honestly they sound way better than i thought they would and i'm impressed my initial kind of impressions before even receiving these was that i thought since apple owns you know beats by dre the whole production line it would have that muddy kind of bloated base and it would just be beats with a facelift but no it's not the base here is definitely present but it's not overbearing and i'd say they're well controlled in the low end on the other side of the spectrum with the higher end frequencies in treble it's not as bright as i'm used to with my sennheiser hd 800s so i would like a bit more sort of sparkle there but i think in return it makes up for that with the mids and the sub bass there is just so much presence detail and clarity here in the mids that it really complements i'd say instrumentals and makes vocals to sound very true to life and natural so the sound quality here uh just a lot better than i was expecting honestly i can't lie i will say one aspect that kind of lacks in is also soundstage they're not a wide sounding pair of headphones but again i'm used to sennheiser hd800s so different story there and i know 95 of you out there are gamers so that's why i don't get too technical when it comes to the technical terms of audio i think like a week ago i used the word sibilance in a mic test video and you would have thought judging by the comments that i was speaking latin or something so i understand i understand but also keep in mind that everybody's sort of you know perception of audio is gonna differ from person to person what i look for what i prefer in music what genre music i'm listening to is all gonna factor in you know how i perceive audio and how it sounds to me so what one person might think you know sounds good might not be to someone else every individual is different in how they perceive audio and what they prefer so keep that in mind but before we move on i'm sure you've heard about their spatial audio which i feel like is more so just like a marketing thing because it's only for certain like certified movies and tv shows and what it does it kind of you know emulates surround sound i'd say so you have the phone in front of you you're watching a movie and it maps where you are with a gyroscope and in correlation to where you're looking so i'm looking over here i'm going to hear it more in this ear cup are you going to use that and utilize it really not too much but the bigger factor here is apple's active noise canceling which is really really good i would say it's in that top tier of some of the best i've heard and what it does is for example if i'm sitting at my desk you know i have my pc to the right of me there's like six fans in there the hvac is in the room over and it just completely eliminates that hum from the heater and the sound of my fans going their noise canceling like i said is just one of the best out there and you've also heard about their transparency mode which sort of mixes in the overall ambience around you and what's going on into your headphones so it mixes in your surrounding audio into your music it does a pretty good job there as well great for example if you want to you know keep an ear out for the doorbell if you want to hear a dog barking but one weird thing i noticed that it does is when i had that on as i was walking around the house it sort of like amplified the air around me into my headphones so you know like for example when you're outside you're recording something on your phone and just the sound of the wind hitting the microphone how it kind of like blows it out and has that wind sound uh it did that into the headphones but just with the air as i was walking uh so not movement friendly which brings me into the next portion uh these are not gonna be friendly to anybody who is active or moving around so with the overall build of materials these come in at 385 grams which isn't light by any means these were constantly sliding off my head and just shifting off my ears during use unless i was sitting perfectly still so you cannot use these for jogging or working out because they will literally just fall off your head with any sort of movement the clamping pressure here really isn't that strong either so if you are laying down or you know working out they're just not going to stay in place so again if you're standing still sitting at your desk getting work done then yeah they're going to be fine but that use case is extremely limiting so for 550 apple isn't trying to compete with bose or sony in the market they're competing directly with themselves by driving away any new potential customer at this price point and you could be one of those out there who's saying oh there must not be that expensive if they're already out of stock and not ship until march for all you know apple could have made 500 of each color so they go off the shelves quick you see out of stock and what that does is it drives hype it drives demand when something's out of stock that's what they're doing for 400 yes i'd recommend them hands down for 550 no way too expensive case dismissed bringing the dancing lobsters in my dancing lobsters i mean the three other headphones we have yet to get to so let's do that now so we'll do a rundown of each of these three just to give you an idea i think the best mix of design comfort good sound quality and active noise cancelling is the bose 700 the best overall value are the sony's great sound quality they're bass heavy and a similar sort of noise canceling effect like we have on the airpods max and it's the best overall sound quality i say drop panda there's no anc here they sound absolutely incredible you can't even tell that they're wireless so let's talk about them first up the drop pandas these headphones are collaboration with drop in thx and i am extremely impressed with the sound quality here just the final execution for the price of 339 they are the pricier option out of these other two recommendations but they're still 150 less than the airpods max and to control your volume and playback control all that's done with a joystick implemented on the right side and i will say it works great it's just really user friendly and it is one of the better implementations of an all-in-one button i've seen but these do something pretty rare so first like i said these don't have that active noise cancellation like the other three feature but the amplifiers used inside here in their thx driver technology the noise floor is practically non-existent meaning that using these wired versus wireless there is not going to be a noticeable sound difference at all you're not going to hear any sort of hissing or that slight sort of airy sound you hear with wireless headphones when your music is paused you're not playing anything the best noise floor i've ever heard by far while still keeping that really good sound quality these are bass heavy but in a good way the overall sound signature i'd say is warm which i always prefer there's ample clarity in the mids with vibrance and great detail and the treble does give you a bit of sparkle without being you know too over the top or harsh i would say though they lack sort of detail in that treble but man just the sound here for being wireless is so good the next recommendation is the bose headphones 700 and i think in terms of actual like visuals and stuff these are probably what most people envisioned when you think of apple headphones you know this sort of design is very apple like they're clean looking they're minimal and kind of futuristic plus they're light weights that's a plus for people who do jog or work out they're gonna be great for that and the noise cancellation inside is pretty good i'd say just for comparison's sake i'd rate the apple airpods max at like an 8.5 these i'd give a seven but what i really like is their app i know it sounds dumb uh but the app for you know controlling your music your anc levels uh creating eqs it's just really convenient in terms of sound quality i'd categorize these as v-shaped which means heavy in the bass and the high ends the mid-range does kind of suffer a bit overall but if you're looking at the bose 700 as a total package for like i said before 340 dollars i think they're the most well-rounded for the price here for the active user you know you go to the gym you walk around the city you're on the go you're looking for you know that noise cancellation while still providing pretty good sound for just 200 less than apple highly suggest these then we'll talk the sony's which i dubbed the best overall value here so these the 1000 xm3 like i said before the 1000xm4s they're 275. these were 155 used like new uh they're just a year difference between the two models not too much has changed which is why i saved money and went the xm3 route and for the price whether you go xm4 or xm3 there is no way they can disappoint anybody and i'm sure you've seen a lot of reviews of people comparing and also recommending these uh versus the airpods max because sony is the king at active noise cancellation it's the real deal i said before comparison's sake i'd give the airpods max like an 8.5 with anc here i'm giving sony a nine design wise kind of dated yes for looks uh but they're still on the lighter side and headband hinge it folds in for better portability the ear cups have touch controls for changing tracks and adjusting volume you just swipe on the side and while maybe you don't want to be physically touching your headphones 24 7 it is still more convenient than reaching to the top of your ear cups to press a button there is also a sony app for eq and adjusting some settings but it's not 100 necessary and it's not really that user friendly so you don't need it they do also have a transparency mode but i'd say it's a overall but the sound quality they're definitely v-shaped here a bit too bassy but that's kind of sony's thing but i think just for the price they do sound great in the end and while i do have some complaints with the lack of sort of mid presence again for the price it's impossible for these to disappoint anybody it is a killer value so again a quick recap airpods max they sound very very good apple users you're gonna love them either way they're just too expensive for my recommendation the bose headphone 700 probably the best well-rounded in all the categories overall i'd say then we have the drop panda well they don't have active noise cancellation they are the best sounding wireless headphones i've ever heard and then the best value just for the price the overall sound quality and anc sony xm3 xm4 either way so like i said i pretty much summed it up the airpods max they sound really really good they impressed me they also disappoint me and for the price of 550 i personally can't recommend them my voice is going all right so that'll wrap it up guys hope you enjoyed and hope you appreciate the other comparison
