forgot that like the day was the day to do it you know i usually record on saturday i thought last saturday was a friday so i was a whole day off i missed last episode my bad and also episode 252 and 253 were great episodes we had a nice clean and minimal one and a really crazy setup edition and both were terrible in terms of views so uh revisit those if you haven't really great setup so today go through some good ones for you guys hope you dig it i have all the gear and hardware you see listed for you in the description down below but we'll kick it off now 2 54. this episode's sponsored by corsair iq the software that brings your entire setup together creating a really immersive rgb ecosystem with all your gear and peripherals take control by customizing the lighting effects and creating your own personal profiles for any application you could sync your whole setup to one color different effects or get the whole crazy rgb spectrum going on plus with iq you can do things like monitor system performance create fan curves all right here inside the software if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below starting us off today we have little fear with a really nice and clean setup did i trick you into watching clean and minimal i don't know but this one surely fits and i'm really digging the way it looks lots of really nice stuff going on here in terms of aesthetics now checking it out here's a 27-inch alienware monitor it is 240 hertz so gonna be great here for gaming that seems to be mounted to its own monitor arm there onto the desk and in front of it you can see has a nice desktop riser which is using four speakers and this one is from grove made also peep the nana leaf aurora light panels behind it just to give some more you know glow and colors to the desktop if you want to switch it from white to like a colorful blast now down to his peripherals he's a kbd fans tofu it's a 60 with lubed turquoise switches inside got a nice coil cable on there to match the rest of the peripherals and some black on white keycaps and then as for his mouse it logitech g703 light speed by the way i've been waiting for like a newer super light edition of this because this mouse was severely underrated love the shape would love to see a 2021 or 2022 refresh now over on that desktop riser for his speakers these are always pretty cool to see the edifier luna eclipse and then sitting on top of that is the sennheiser gsp 670 wireless gaming headset and now we'll check out the pc not really too sure where it's at i didn't really see it in the the first few shots but either way inside we have an intel i9 9900k cpu with a cooler master master liquid ml 390 l aio 32 gigs of course revenge rgb pro ram on an asus z390e motherboard with a galax rtx 2070 super gpu no info on the case or again where it even is in the room but keeping the setup nice and clean so it's clearly not anywhere near the actual desktop itself maybe on the floor out of sight but again putting this all together really digging the vibes the overall aesthetic you have going on here it's really minimal now we've got yokim and this one is really nice and cozy again the nice warm lighting rich wooden desktop here loving the vibrant colors it has and going with a massive ultra wide here since there's only one monitor seems to be almost the entire span of the desk so checking it out it is a samsung 49-inch it's their cr490rg 90 model and i really like the simple choice of going with like the countryside landscape here for the ultra wide monitor again just in terms of tones and colors fits in beautifully checking out the peripherals he's a glorious gmmk pro keyboard inside he has lubed gather on red switches some duroc stabilizers a mel geek custom cable and varmilo keycaps with logitech g403 prodigy wireless mouse and for audio we have the revel concerta 2 m16 speakers powered by the lakshy a30 amplifier and also for headphones behind kind of tucked away over to the left side as a sennheiser rs 185 also peep the herman miller embody chair now mounted underneath the desk but still off the floor is a nice place for his pc with the cooler master nr 200p case inside that intel i7 10 700k cpu with an octa nhu 12a cooler inside got 32 gigs of core surveillance lpx ram an msi meg z490i unifi itx motherboard with an msi rtx 3070 supreme gpu always love a small form factor build like this and also check out how nice this living room is damn big old window big old tv like that's a 75-inch 4k from samsung got a bunch of really nice audio gear here uh xtz cinema m8 tower speakers and a center speaker and just a bunch of really nice audio stuff i don't know so just really digging the warm vibes here really no rgb going on a little bit in the pc case that's just from the gpu but the setup itself super cozy super warm next justin's hitting us with a really unique pretty much all diy sort of portal theme setup here and he made this from one inch pvc board and aluminum tubing to bring this very like aperture studios sort of things the aperture studios aperture what aperture science aperture laboratories i don't know why i said aperture studios but it's the same thing you know what i mean it's portal just very very creative love diy stuff like this for his main display he's a samsung 32-inch ultra wide and pretty much everything here for the desk setup is going to be black and white to again fit that theme and i'm just giving you a look at the at the wide shot of the setup because it just looks so cool really lovely attention to detail here even with like the vinyls and the stickers and stuff over on the sort of like makeshift window on the right side for the peripherals the corsair k70 rgb mark ii se keyboard with the corsair m65 rgb elite mouse on their mm-800 rgb polaris mouse pad and then for that custom wall mounted pc even got like the logo there and stuff he made for himself just looks so good his ryzen 9 3900 xt gpu cooled by the corsair hydro h100i rgb platinum a se o 64 gigs of course for dominator platinum rgb ram on an asrock b550 steel legend mobo with an rtx 2070 from gigabyte and with it being wall mounted like this with the peripherals and with it being wall mounted like this with the hardware spread out here on this mount a really clean job like cable management is on point you can peek behind that that's where all the managing and stuff is going on and the main mounting of the hardware you can get a sneak peek behind really good and creative so justin mega mega props for going out and creating a really unique custom setup from head to toe it's funny how visually it's so different from the rest of the room like the couch and stuff on the left side so sitting down here you're definitely in gamer mode now we've got s3lq with a beautifully clean setup love the green wallpaper and stuff and he's actually the creator of some of my favorite keycap sets out there if you're familiar with aurora polaris he made gmk evil dolce even just ran shashin i believe it's pronounced recently so here we get a sneak peek at where those sets are created for the dual monitor setup his primary is a 34 inch survive svi ve is a 100 hertz panel with the vertical monitor on the left side being an hp 24 inch at 144 hertz ford's peripherals of course the keyboard's custom with a classy tkl built with lubed alpacas on a palm plate with gmk botanical keycaps definitely one of my favorite sets out there and matches his setup perfectly and also for his mouse he's a custom painted logitech g pro wireless also really digging how clean that lamp is adds nice contrast with a pop of white and then also for the rest of his peripherals with audio he has the sennheiser hd588x headphones powered by the steinberg ur-12 audio interface checking out his pc inside the phanteks p400s case is an intel i9 9900k cpu with an nzxt kraken x73 aio 16 gigs of course of engines lpx ram then an msi rtx 2080 ventus gpu um again we didn't get too much of a wide shot of the rumor of the setup really but no idea where that piece is located so a really beautiful monochromatic setup here with a nice splash and touch of green with the wallpaper in the matching botanical keycap set beautiful beautiful stuff s3lq and i'm looking forward to some aurora polaris coming out soon hopefully good stuff and then last but not least we have alex with a really interesting sort of dual setup here even though he just has the one monitor but you can see the massive tv two laptops and just a beautiful construction here also sort of monochromatic lots of black and white with the hardware and peripherals but man let's dive into it because he's got a 27-inch alienware monitor 240 hertz as the primary display mounted on its own arm off to the left side in white so it gives it that nice seamless floating appearance also one thing he did that i absolutely love is he span the wallpaper across not only his tv but his monitor and then the separate laptop on the right side so spanning it all across the room gotta love that unity checking out the all white peripherals here his keyboard is the razer huntsman mini that's razer 60 going along with his new razer orochi v2 mouse on an odin gaming zero gravity extended mouse pad now as i said before he has two different laptops in this room powering his main setup is this alienware laptop it's the m15r4 has an intel i7 10870h cpu got a 5 gigahertz max turbo frequency 16 gigs of ram and an rtx 3070 inside so that's the main workhorse for this station and then also mounted above the setup is his macbook pro and this is actually what's powering that tv off to the left side of the room as you saw and also a nice shot underneath the desk you can get a look at the cable management and how well kept everything is might even be like a charging station for the airpods and stuff got some secondary peripherals but just very tidy very organized so alex absolutely loving what you did here with this room it hits on both like the clean and minimal vibes and also the gamer aesthetics so a great mix of both again loving the monochromatic feels and stuff just really really nice all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 254 of room tour project hope you all enjoyed don't forget all the gear and hardware you saw in
