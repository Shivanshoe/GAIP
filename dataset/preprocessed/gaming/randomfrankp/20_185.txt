what's up guys i'm random frank p and welcome to a brand new series on the channel called end game we focus on different accessories and mods you can do to your main gaming setup peripherals like your mouse and keyboard to kind of make them you know better to achieve that end game status see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out this is kind of inspired for my mouse mods video i did last october so it's going to be along those lines but now i'm making it into a more dedicated series so starting off which is actually kind of a continuation from that there's a company called lizard skins who used to make or they still do but they make bat grips okay so like a skin for your bat they recently released a brand new lineup for gaming peripherals so now lizard skins are selling grips for your mouse and controller and as you can see we pretty much have every color offering here from black black camo gray camo red camo red orange yellow green teal and blue noelle shelby trinary cassandra nikki so the point here is admittedly pretty straightforward the skins are going to give you extra grip and cushioning really on your mouse whether on the sides the left and right clicks it's up to you the lizard skin sheets are about 4 by 6 inches and are 0.5 millimeters thick they also include an alcohol pad for rubbing it down plus a tracing sticker if you want to mainly try to trace and cut the outlines of your mouse yourself now this is something that's going to require a lot of patience and time to do if you want to turn out right it's pretty much like cutting and applying your very own custom dbrand skin so just take your time the blue skin on my model d did turn out pretty poor i'd say for my first cut but i was more so focusing on filming and honestly who cares if it doesn't come out right you know who's going to be seeing this besides you in your house but then off cam i cut some skins from my razor viper ultimate with the black camo applied that to the left and right clicks that came out much much better then i did the same and i cut some teal side grips for my custom ultra light 2 mouse and that matches the theme perfectly so now you just have this extra layer of switching up your mouse aesthetic from different colors and camo combos and in this age of lightweight mice don't worry that grips don't add much weight at all an entire sheet is 8 grams but realistically if you're cutting it for just the grips or the left and right clicks it'd only add an additional 2 grams to my mouse and one helpful tip to anybody who doesn't want to cut and trace their own skins and i hope they expand on this is when you're picking a color at checkout you'll notice there's an additional installation guide and template link under the thickness and then from there they actually have eight full templates of mice currently on the market you can actually print a one-to-one ratio trace the outline and cut the skins perfectly so i really dig this idea it'll make it much much easier than trying to eyeball it yourself like i did and they're only 14 so again not too bad just for that extra layer of grip but next up underneath my model 0 is something pretty special and a brand new release from glorious as well this is going to be their polished ceramic feet known as g floats currently they say it's only available for the model o and model o minus but i mean realistically what's stopping you from using this on whatever mice you have but yeah i'll be using this on my current modded model o installation is very simple once you remove your current g-skate uh each sort of foot already has a slight lip around it so it just falls right into place you hold it for a few seconds and then it's gonna feel like you got a brand new mouse you'll be good to go and even you won't be seeing it because it's the bottom of your mouse they look really nice the dark ceramic is a nice visual touch they do say to get the most out of it adjust your liftoff distance and their software to three millimeters but obviously what matters here is the feel the response what's going to make ceramic feet worth the upgrade well first off the glide you get now is just incredibly smooth really on any surface since they're flat your glides going to be consistent when it comes to muscle memory and that's what you want that's what's going to be important and that's what gives them the edge over round ceramic feet currently out there from a company called lexip but yeah whether it's a cloth pad a hybrid pad a hard textured mouse pad you're still gonna have that consistency another big reason why people like ceramic feet is the fact that they don't wear down over time like ptfe feet do so you're never gonna have to actually replace these unless you physically do something to break them but obviously with this type of material you don't want to use it on a piece of wood right you're going to want a mouse pad to complement it so going along with that we can now perfectly transition into the third act of this video and that's going to be two separate mouse pads that i picked up that are going to be a great complement to either ptfe feet or ceramic we have the brand new razer akari and the fnatic dash so let's start with the new razer akari first because i just showed you the ceramic feet if you're someone who wants the fastest possible combo out there then holy hell look no further because this is crazy so the ikari here is this beaded hard texture surface if you look close then yeah you can see those individual beads pretty much embedded into it with the resin so it's still going to give you that hard feeling surface to the touch and in theory this is pretty similar to the popular artisan shetinka mousepad that i showed off but it's much thinner with less padding as it comes in at two millimeters tall and this size is their large size it's the only one currently available at 420 by 320 millimeters so using this and checking it out with ceramic feet definitely a slick fast response that you're gonna have which will be good if you wanna play at like 200 dpi but in reality this combo does make it pretty tough when it comes to control and stopping power you know this is pretty much going to be optimized for ptfe feet like they have on their viper ultimate that's pretty much what they advertise it alongside and with ptfe and not even ceramic it is still super fast literally whatever you're using this with it's gonna make it feel like it's on ice it is definitely a unique texture that i'm sure a lot of people are gonna love but like i said before i'm more of a hybrid texture kind of guy myself so this isn't for me but like i said if you want the fastest of the fast learning the akari is gonna be a trip let me tell you let's do a glide test and a sound test you could hear how it sounds and performs with ptfe and ceramic unrelated but i had to do it and then for the fnatic dash this is my new go-to if you will as it is a hybrid polyester blend with a uniform horizontal and vertical glide in the surface and it provides i'd say the best of both worlds for a fast low friction glide which is going to give you control and stopping power it's also liquid resistant so if you knock over your water bottle on your desk the liquid won't soak into the pad and it'll give you a pretty quick and easy cleanup the stitching on the side is super tight and minimal you won't even feel it on your wrist and the bottom is all rubber so it's not going to budge on your desktop and on the bottom right side with a pretty small holographic logo which all in all it's still going to tick that visually minimalist box this size here is the extra large desk size at 950 millimeters by 500 millimeters but it also comes in a smaller 487 by 372 millimeter version which is still considered large i'm definitely more of a full desk pad guy for my mouse and keyboard so this is what i've been using recently and i am loving it before as you may know i made the madcatz glide 38 for well over a year now at this point but i think this hybrid polyester surface gives me a bit more control versus that while still feeling buttery smooth with ptfe feet on my viper ultimate which i mean but the same can be said for the ceramic feet again this is going to feel much much better on this versus the aquarium i think that's just too slick of a combo and combining the ceramic with the dash is still going to give you a little bit more extra cushioning and stopping power but it is still going to be pretty hard to kind of perfect when it comes to stopping on a dime and flicks with the head shots i think this combo is going to be best for those through motion shots when you're getting into the flow of the game now i will 100 say with confidence that if you take the time to perfect and really just train the muscle memory to use ceramic feet with the fnatic dash i think the payoff in the end will be huge it's a deadly combo the razer acari is 60 bucks which is pretty hefty for a mouse pad at this size and the extra large desk version of the fnatic dash is 55. we'll do the glide test and the sound test you all right guys so that'll wrap it up for episode one of endgame showing off three different sort of categories of mods and accessories that you can do to your mouse starting with the lizard skins ceramic feet and the two complementary mouse pads so think of episode one as sort of like a pilot if you will i want to hear your thoughts let me know down below what you think about it if you have any suggestions for mods accessories hacks and i do have some things in mind for episode two already which would more so be focusing on keyboards but i want to hear your thoughts drop it all down below and like i said if you want to check any stuff i showed off i'll also have that for you in the description hope you enjoyed i'm random frank p have a good day
