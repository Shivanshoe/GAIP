what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out a brand new gaming headset from corsair the hs60 haptic a headset that lets you feel your audio so when there's explosions gunshots not only are you gonna hear it you're gonna feel it i for one love headsets like this there's not too many out with actual haptic feedback so it's definitely pumped to check it out so in case you're interested we'll go through it all give you my thoughts and opinions in this review so first up like i said with this haptic feedback we saw it back with the sony pulse elite edition headset that had haptic feedback in the ear cups razer has their nori ultimate headset so now it's corsair's turn to give your ears a little bit of a tingle and given its name the hs60 haptic it's actually pretty much identical to the original hs60 and that hs lineup for the 50 60 and 70. so what we have here is a rebranded hs60 but now with haptic feedback the technology is called taction is actually built into the driver so it's not like you know software or anything it's actual hardware inside the headset but build wise and construction wise it is the same as the hs60. it's got the same 50 millimeter neodymium driver same frequency response impedance just now haptic feedback and also taking a look at them the other obvious change is gonna be the white arctic camo they decided to go with i don't know why corsair did that i much prefer the old color scheme where either black or white and then depending on whether you went xbox one ps4 pc a bit different like color accents on that um i personally don't like it and i wish if anything maybe just go like the dbrand route where they also have camo but it's that like that stealth kind of embossed look to it this isn't doing it visually for me however they did black out the corsair sail logos on each of the ear cups now so it looks more stealth in that regard versus the like silver logo in the past and despite the grill in the ear cups looking open back this is not this is a closed pair that grill look is just for aesthetics now comfort wise it does expand to fit relatively large heads i'd say you know it's pretty flexible nice and ample padding on the top of the headband with their nice memory foam ear pads as well super comfy no tension points or anything and as you can see uh pretty discreet all around too it's not like a bulky obnoxious looking headset you know minus the the white camo however i know request to bring back the uh glasses test as well and yeah same thing uh there is a bit of you know contact here at the top of the ear cups since they're you know pretty large 50 millimeter drivers these over the ear cups and the actual pads are on the larger side uh so it makes contact with them but it's not pushing them into my head or anything the ear cups do rotate around 30 degrees i'd say on the yoke to kind of like fit better when you're adjusting it on your head the yoke and the actual headband slider is aluminum as well so it's going to feel you know nice and sturdy very solid overall definitely a durable headset then before we move on there's only three buttons really on the bottom of the headset on the left side you have your volume rocker with a mic mute button underneath then on the right side is where you have the control to control the haptic feedback the microphone here is removable if you want to just ditch it and you know wear it out maybe but the cable that's built in is not it ends in usb so you plug it right into any usb slot on your pc but going back to the microphone it is that flexible gooseneck design and inside the box it does come with a uh you know one of those little foam plosive guards and in my opinion it sounds really really good all right so this is the mic test for the hs60 haptic what you're hearing is all raw unedited audio as you can see plugged right into the front of my pc with the usb and i think all things considered this sounds really really good definitely impressive for you know a gaming headset and it doesn't have that like tinny kind of nasally sound that a lot of headsets do i think it's very clear and full for the most part as well so just very very impressed i would definitely put this like up there when it comes to gaming headset quality so great stuff with hs60 microphone and again this is all raw unedited audio for you all right so getting now into the sound quality i've said this in my hs60 review and even put out the hs60 pro for the price when this first retailed those headsets sound fantastic and they were both under 100 i believe the hs60 was either 60 or 70 as well now they've dropped to 50. so it's the same exact drivers like i said it's the same headset just down with the addition of the haptic feedback and it still sounds really really good you can check out my dedicated videos on those older versions but just the short little tldr great soundstage even though they are closed like i said it does a pretty good job of opening that up definitely great as well for positional audio and pinpointing where those footsteps are coming from in game uh the one aspect that i always like to see most just traditional gaming headsets improve on is bass so that's where the hs60 haptic really turned it around because now you're gonna feel that bass so let's talk about the haptics because this is one of the things that truly always you know got me excited when it comes to different headsets out there so i said in the beginning way back in 2012 when we saw the sony pulse elite edition headset that was one of my favorite headsets of all time because you just have this new dimension and it triggers another sense you know you have your audio and now you're feeling the response to that so when you're gaming whether it's you know in a game like battlefield which has just fantastic audio uh by the way the better the audio is like engineered in the game obviously the better this is gonna work but just hearing you know gunshots and explosions around me planes flying over bombs going off everywhere every shot you take you feel it every grenade in the distance you're gonna feel it a little bit it is such a unique experience that really has to be experienced it's very hard to describe to you guys and it might sound like a gimmick you might think nah i don't need it but until you actually try it and you feel that just extra response to your gaming it just gets you more and more immersed and for prolonged use it doesn't really get annoying either so it's done right which is important so like i said the control for the haptic feedback is on the bottom of the right ear cup so you know quick and easy to adjust and you can turn it up all the way or down all the way if you just want you know like a pair of regular headphones like a headset but i will say the volume according to your actual like in-game audio and your pc audio does reflect to the actual levels of your haptic feedback so if you're playing at a very low audio level you're not going to have a lot of haptic feedback so do keep that in mind uh the higher you know pc volume you're at the more feedback you're going to be getting i will say music's a bit of a different story um although it still does work if you're a big base head you like a lot of like hip-hop or old-school stuff like that where there's gonna be a good amount of bass then you'll still feel it yeah and it's gonna seem pretty cool but it's obviously gonna be a different sort of level of haptic feedback compared to you know watching movies or gaming with it then real quickly talking iq for their software there's actually not too much which is always a good thing i'd say uh you don't actually control any of the haptic feedback in iq which i thought was surprising i thought there would be some sort of level of customization but that's just on the other rocker on the bottom of the right ear cup but you do have you know some built-in eqs you can go through or create your own sort of eq i think the bass boost one sounds the best overall um that's just for like all across the board then also it's going to increase the bass which is also going to increase the haptic feedback so i would go bass boost then on the right side of the software you have your mic level adjustments as well as side tone for hearing your actual voice when you're talking or whatever streaming to your friends so i am really impressed with the hs60 haptic overall and what they're doing here because again they took a staple from the very popular and very you know successful hs60 and hs60 pro revamped it improved it with haptic feedback and now all together we have a great headset again construction and durability very very good sound quality very good as well only getting better with haptic feedback now great microphone quality as well so all great stuff the only real cons i would point out is again just not a fan of the arctic camo design i'm sure they're going to come out with different versions later on down the line once they see how many people are just not a fan of that um and also again i really wish this was removable i wouldn't say it's a deal breaker at all but i just wish this was removable in case anything ever happened to this it would have been nice to be able to you know pop it out in the future maybe replace it but now that's really not going to be the case this comes in at 130 which for a wired gaming headset is kind of steep even considering the hs60 and h60 pro headset right now i believe got dropped to 50 bucks so you're spending a 70 premium for the haptic feedback here which i think is just a bit out of what i'd like again i'm on your guy's side i think 100 for this would have been perfect maybe keep an eye out around the holidays if it drops around 100 i would definitely definitely recommend but i think for a haptic feedback headset like this it's done well it's done right and there's not a lot like this out there so i for one am loving it and guys i'll wrap it up if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below hope you enjoyed i'm random frank p have a good day
