what's up job turkey today we're back with episode 244 of room tour project this series will show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if you see anything you like we'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check out any gear or hardware you want to pick up but we'll kick it off now 244. this episode's sponsored by elgato and their rgb light strips if you want to deck out your room or gaming setup with some bright vibrant rgb the elgato strips make it really easy these shine bright up to 2000 lumens at the 16 million color combos plus it has dedicated white leds and the strip is completely flicker free but what i really dig is you can control them from your phone your pc with your control center even control and tie it to your stream deck so you can change up all the rgb on the fly when you're gaming streaming anything if you want to check them out i'll have them listed for you in the description down below first up we have thiago and by the way i'm recovering from strep throat so if i sound a little bit off that's why i'm about 95 there so we're just gonna roll with it but thiago is killing us with this super nice minimal setup here that's going with a lot of the green vibes the plants the wallpaper the natural tones with the wooden shelf i am loving it so for a single display is a 34 inch ultra wide from alienware and by the way that shelf there is from grovemade for some peripherals with the logitech z533 speakers in white then checking out the rest of his gear with the nice overhead shot his keyboard is logitech mx master keys with logitech mx master three mouse on an orbit key leather desk pad i showed this off in my minimal setup upstairs if you guys check that out then also for audio hanging off the side of his desk is the microsoft surface headphones in the matte black and then in addition he has an ipad pro a great secondary work companion for productivity and stuff so i like how he has that here with the rest of his airpods pro the iphone and stuff keeping it all in the ecosystem but he went the itx pc route which i love with the novello stack case you can see they're kind of peeking off to the left side of the desk inside's an amd ryzen 5 3600 cpu with a corsair h150i aio with 16 gigs of corsair vengeance ram on an asus rog strix b550i gaming motherboard and a geforce gtx 1660 oc graphics card and then since those photos were submitted he actually moved his desk up in front of a window for that nice ambient natural lighting and i think it also looks great the plants will flourish and the setup is just a stunner so thiago really really good job here this is a beautiful setup next we have reuben james with the quadruple display set up here with a rather unorthodox triple monitor setup on the desk with the two horizontal and one vertical off to the right side and then the overhead tv so tons and tons of pixel real estate here and as you can see this setup is not only for pc gaming but he has the ps5 there off to the left side so checking out that gear and hardware all three displays are a dell 27-inch ultra sharp so he's gonna have that continuity in terms of bezels and stuff and the overhead is a 43-inch vizio e-series 4k tv with the vizio sound bar there mounted right underneath check out the peripherals we have the kbd tofu 60 inside he has gatteron inc v2s and the keycap set is epbt gray japanese gonna fit in visually with the rest of his setup because he also has the eraser viper ultimate in mercury and the random frank p naval keys topographic desk pad and then hiding behind the pc or the astro a40 tr headset for his audio but now speaking of which that's the leon lee 011 dynamic mini case inside is an intel i7 8700k cpu with an nzxt kraken x63 aio 16 gigs of corser vengeance rgb pro ram and an evga rtx 2070 super gpu all together reuben james is rocking a lovely setup and a lovely room got the display case off to the left side for some figures love the prince up on the wall the dragon ball z skateboard for some decoration nice little plant in the corner all that natural ambient lighting again can't stress enough how much you know a window does for a setup in terms of bringing that actual life into it and here it's looking killer speaking of killer we have bernal with a really nice warm and cozy setup and uh maybe like a nasa theme as well you can see the lego spaceship mounted above the monitors on the shelving unit also a spaceship over there i'm sure someone in the comments is gonna correct me actually that shuttle is the the boeing z499 from the 1980s you should know about it because okay the point is bernal's got a really nice setup that we need to look at stop worrying about space shuttles for those okay those three displays are this is actually interesting because they're all different uh we have an lg 27 engine msi optics 27 inch and a gigabyte 27 inch all three of them though are 144 hertz so in terms of gaming they're going to be great obviously but interestingly enough since they're all three different models the bezels actually look pretty consistent across all three and a great job with mounting here um you can't see like any cables and stuff hanging down so it looks super good thanks email how many times does that happen to me during this series okay checking out the peripherals going to logitech g915 lightspeed tkl keyboard loving this with the logitech g604 light speed mouse and for audio it's got logitech g560 lightsync speakers and then his headset is the seal series arctis pro wireless you can see the game deck there mounted underneath the desk headset stand by the way is from grovemade and they also made the phone charger he has on his desk that uh felt desk pad as well as some of the coasters you might see lying around his desk but now we're going to check out the pc inside the nzxt h510 case it's an amd ryzen 7 3700x cpu with an msi b550i pro vhd wi-fi motherboard we have 16 gigs of core serve engines rgb pro ram and the msi radeon rx 580 armor oc gpu like in the blues and orange for the colors going on as well as some plants inside the pc as well and those aren't the only plants he's got because take a look at the other side of the room nice cozy looking bed and plants everywhere all about that green all about that cozy life tell me you wouldn't sit down there right now and just take a nap man that's nice so my man bernal i'm loving what you did with this a very just welcoming inviting warm cozy setup it's refreshing to see from warm and cozy to sleek and futuristic we have johan now getting those like space vibes right away big old tv nice vibrant wallpaper there huge ultra wide monitor for the desk setup got those geometric panels behind it the nano leaf roar light panels this is something gotta say as well very clean and organized so big big props for that because you also got a big monitor with the samsung g9 odyssey it's the 49 inch model mounted beautifully as well killer got an rgb light strip behind the desk and seemingly behind the monitor itself so it's gonna reflect the light onto those geometric panels and kind of refract it in a different way so that just looks really cool now checking out the peripherals on the desk of a ducky one two mini rgb keyboard with the glorious model o wireless mouse great example by the way i've taken a pre-built ducky build adding some keycap a nice coil cable and taking the visuals to a next level then next to that crazy looking pc those speakers are the argon audio forte a4 in white so a killer desk setup but yes that case is a thermaltake distrocase 350p inside all custom loop like that is a killer looking build i said killer 40 times but this is look at that inside that amd 5950x with the asus crosshair dark hero 64 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb ram and asus strix rtx 3090 oc gpu and the fans the fittings radiator water block all from ek that is just a gorgeous gorgeous build then as you saw before next to the setup the great entertainment center big old tv i don't believe there's any information i'm checking the specs right now on the model of that tv but looks really nice and uh just man like if i could give it a rating this would easily be a 10 out of 10. cable management flawless hardware choices flawless everything about this is executed perfectly and then last but not least hitting us with some more geometric panels holy clean and white we have burke with uh just look at this i feel like i'm gonna get poked in the eye or something i realize this won't be everyone's cup of tea because it's a bit busy you know but at least the theme is consistent even sort of spreading those geometric shapes and stuff into the wallpaper so all coercive cohesive that's the word i wanted for those two monitors the ultra wide is from xiaomi it's the me curved 34 inch with the vertical one being a phillips 21.5 inch display for his peripherals the keyboard is the moto speed ck 108 with the logitech g502 light speed wireless mouse and he also said he made the custom mouse pad there again to help it fit him with the theme also on his desktop for speakers logitech z533 over to the pc this is the cooler master td 500 mesh case in white this looks really nice i didn't know this was a thing but now i kind of want one inside the ryzen 2700x cpu with a cooler master ml 360r aio with 32 gigs of g-skill trident z neo rgb ram on an asus tough b450 pro motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 3080 vision so keeping that insides white and black as well my personal favorite theme when it comes to a pc as well so it's a really nice looking build and another shot next to the setup again everything in this room black and white check out the painting like you can see to the left side how it paints geometrically black the sharp edges to the white geometric setup here man this is very very unique got to give you props man a one of a
