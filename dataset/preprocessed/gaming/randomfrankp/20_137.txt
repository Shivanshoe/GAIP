this video is sponsored by murkari oh man oh yeah looking real nice what what's up guys i'm random frank p and today's a day i've definitely been waiting for for quite some time you know every few months we switch up the main pc it's just you know it's just what happens on a tech channel new hardware comes out we upgrade but i am super pumped to finally get my hands on an all white super nice looking rtx 3080 this from gigabyte from their vision lineup so loving the white and the silver or the aluminum accents all around just one of the nicest graphics cards out there so definitely pumped to get this and add this into the build and we also have their w480 gigabyte vision motherboard which also has the nice white accents all around so it's going to fit in just perfectly and obviously we're gonna have a new chipset with this motherboard so i'll be replacing my i9 9900 ks with the new i9 10 900k so some brand new hardware as we head into 2021 to not only give our pc a nice facelift visually you know but also a pretty nice performance boost as well and to add to that i'm also going to be doing some minor mods to our evolved x case just again make it fit in with the new theme a little bit more and also i know you guys like when i do this but yes we will toss it make it kind of a mix of a vlog style because i know every now and then it's nice to switch up the content make it a lot less serious and more kickback and chill so we'll throw in some vlog stuff what is this guy doing i need a haircut all right whatever so one of the things we're going to start off with is actually just modding our pc case because it would make more sense to then add the hardware after the mods are done and this is my fintech evolv x i've had this for probably a little over a year and a half now and it is just one of my favorite cases and if you think about it over the last like two years there really hasn't been a lot of brand new like big milestone releases from big companies so i'm still rocking the evolvex like it think it looks good and um one of the things i want to change about it is it has this really nice sort of like silver aluminum panel up top and up front so i figured to match the new hardware why not just also make it white i'm probably going to butcher it but as long as it looks good on camera doesn't matter [Music] all right well that was pretty easy and uh by the way these magnetic screw trays are an absolute lifesaver get the spray painting [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right so i did opt to go with a semi gloss for the white because i figured on the sort of silver aluminum panel already it would still kind of give it that metallic sheen i hope uh nothing to lose really right just a pc panel [Applause] all right so to my surprise i don't know if you'll be able to pick it up that well on camera i'll show you better downstairs but this turned out pretty much exactly how i wanted it to uh like i said it still has that bit of metallic look to it but now it's white so hopefully this will fit in perfectly with the new pc and uh hey fantastic you should totally make some you know white pc cases like this because this looks very nice while i was in the garage i heard fedex drop off two important packages all right so while we wait for those panels to dry i got something very exciting for you guys that um i'm definitely pumped to show off and reveal and as i said in the beginning this video is sponsored by murkari and mercari is a top digital marketplace for you to buy and sell things of pretty much any kind which is definitely great right now for the holidays especially if you want to buy some things for cheaper or sell some things for some extra cash like for example just going through you can see a ps5 copy of spider-man miles morales sold for 39 versus what 50 on amazon prime same goes for another ps5 copy of call of duty black ops cold war sold for 52 bucks versus 70 on amazon prime so what's in here let's find out real quick oh yes all right so yes i am teaming up with murkari and we're gonna be giving away and giving a chance for you guys to win a brand new playstation 5 for just five dollars okay so thankfully they sent me one one for you guys they are both the disc version and this is what we're gonna do download the mercari app it's for both ios and android and we're gonna list one of these for two thousand dollars but here's the catch obviously we're not gonna be selling them for two thousand dollars that is so nobody goes on and buys it we're giving this a chance for you guys to kind of get first dibs at this so we're gonna list it for two thousand dollars on my mercari seller page and then after 72 hours we're gonna drop the price to just five dollars right as that price

great opportunity to collaborate mercari to give you guys an opportunity to pick up a ps5 for just five dollars this really is just a great opportunity so really pumped to uh bring this to you guys right in time for the holidays so i hope you dig this all right so as we break down the old build again just swapping it out and a huge shout out to gigabyte for supplying not only the vision gpu with rtx 3080 and their vision motherboard they also sent out the cpu as well so they are the man for hooking us up here with completely new hardware definitely a nice upgrade also what i didn't show is over the past few weeks i swapped out the fans inside uh with some be quiet white fans that way with the rgb fan frames it'll still look really nice and vibrant but they're gonna run nice cool and quiet and also on black friday i picked up a two terabyte adata xpg nvme drive so uh it's definitely going to give me a lot more space with some blazing speeds but man i'm definitely pumped to get this build underway some real solid upgrades here [Music] and by the way no i'm going to see comments about it so i'll just address it now i'm going to use the cooler master master gel maker this is their own sort of performance level of a higher end cpu thermal paste and with this applicator you're supposed to pretty much give it an entire like two or three swipes along the whole surface area at the top of the cpu so it's nice and even and you want to coat the entire top so it might look like much uh but it's the recommended amount okay so we're pretty much done now since i was just swapping out pretty much the motherboard cpu and graphics card i figured it would be a pretty quick swap um so i was just kind of like working my way around everything which kind of made it longer in the end because i was like being extra careful and just i should have just redid the whole build but either way we're now at the spot where i'm trying to decide whether i vertically mount the gpu or mount it normally um i know obviously one of the big question marks with these vertical mounted gpus is temperatures and how it performs over time i know with my strix 2080 uh this was vertical the whole time even the strix before that was vertical so i never really had issues with that but again this is a much more powerful graphics card so i think to kind of just start it off i'll probably mount it vertically so we could see the nice white and silver instead of gigabyte and their weird decision to go this like purple shrimp up top uh really don't know why they went purple there i feel like if anything uh hey gigabyte you should maybe it'd be really cool if you could include like some sort of vinyl strip of different colors like a white or a silver or anything else just to put over that if we want to customize it because it'd be weird to have you know uh all white and black and then this real metallic purple strip sticking out right here uh so i'm probably gonna vertically mount it for now then over the weeks just kind of judge how we do in terms of thermals i'll do some testing along the way [Music] all right so it's the next morning now i had to call it a night last night so it was just getting way too late it was nearly 2 a.m by the time i was done and with all this holiday content i've been making over the past few weeks i was just exhausted and it would make more sense to show you the new pc when it's you know natural ambient daylight instead of it being all dark uh but also i was just gonna you know pick up where i left off and uh just put in my new components and call it a day pretty much then twitter police kind of got on me recommended i do a complete reinstall of windows 10 so it's like a fresh build no driver issues and that makes sense so uh last night i had to go through manually copy all my files and stuff that i'm going to need for the new pc that took around an hour and then around two hours again of going through reinstalling windows 10 for a complete fresh build and then copying everything back onto the pc and downloading some of the stuff that i'm going to need just to finish off this weekend's videos and but like i said by the time i was done it was 2 a.m uh so we'll pick it up today gonna just finish waking up finish my coffee and then i'll go downstairs and show you the goods and i'm talking about the pc okay it's tomorrow we back at it and like i said before didn't really have much time to get things properly and fully reinstalled because that would just take hours and hours to only have one game installed which is the game i primarily play as you guys know battlefield v so i'll be running that in a little bit but for now we should uh install the panels back on and i'm telling you guys this came out just way better than i thought it would uh looks really good so let's get that installed so you could uh get a good look at what we're working with [Music] and the whole thing about this process is i guarantee you in the background of videos and stuff when i'm normally sitting over there in front of the main camera you're probably not even gonna be able to tell that i did anything to this it's not gonna look white uh it might but it looks a lot better in person i can already tell on camera it probably just looks like it usually does that silver uh panel but that's okay as far as the internals and stuff it came out really nice and clean um what i did the other day was i updated and added some of those white aio sort of covers for the actual tubing so i have some nice white tubing on there and i just think you know with all the white accents now especially with the motherboard looking super clean and the all white gpu it just looks really really nice and you know i don't even mind that purple strip so much anymore considering it's you know facing upward you really can't even see it uh but also just a shout out gengar i have him on there and it kind of fits in a little bit so i'm not really uh i'm not minding it at all and of course when i want i could always just you know switch up the rgb lighting inside because with the phanteks actual case and their digital uh lighting system pretty much that also ties to the integrated rgb lights inside the pc plus their phanteks uh digital halos like luxe fan frames that i have on my pc fans on the inside so it all can tie together really nicely it syncs and i can change it all up literally with just the uh the button on my pc case so super simple and i even went in and redid some of my cable management on the back side so now it looks very clean probably the cleanest has ever been on that back side you know you can't really see it feels good knowing it's nice and tidy like i said over the next week or so we'll continue to monitor the actual um temperatures because i can just tell it is like super close you probably can't see but to the actual uh tempered glass panel now because these rtx cards are bigger they're thicker so it's a lot closer so i'll like i said i'll continue to monitor it and um see what the temps are looking like and we have the finishing touch to apply i almost forgot about that all right so that'll pretty much do it for this portion of the pc vlog and i will say uh just over the last hour or so i did some additional testing with battlefield it's the only game i currently have installed and temperatures really weren't too bad they were hovering just around 60 degrees celsius for the gpu but i did notice after about an hour of gaming um it did start to creep up to closer to 70 degrees celsius but again battlefield's a pretty intensive game so um i guess after an hour that would start to make sense that it wouldn't actually start to heat up and thankfully on the nzx the aio you can see the temperatures there real time so that's definitely pretty cool uh but i'll drop all the hardware and gear that i used in the pc down below so you can check it out and like i said over the next few weeks as i reinstall more games as i do more rendering and just more work on the pc in general to get it back to what i had pretty much all my old files games and software i'll do more testing and we'll see where those temperatures are and if i have to make it horizontal again then it doesn't really matter we'll do it either way got a really nice performance bump and i'm definitely excited to have the new hardware as you roll in the 2021. and guys i'll wrap it up hope you enjoyed if you did give this video a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp
