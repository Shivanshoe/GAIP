[Music] so uh this was all gathering up in the corner let it go for too long so i think it's time we just start to unbox a lot of this random tech what's up guys i'm random frank p and that intro was the intro too many boxes taking up too much space let's open them let's see what's inside no order nothing whatsoever the thing is there's so many that i forgot which is which and what i even ordered so like i always say this will be as fun as for you as it is for me sort of different camera angles today got you got you maybe we can have uh some nice camera angles going on let me just lower let me lower this a little bit so you guys can see all right maybe that'll be better so like i said i really just don't know because oh look at that good tape good tape um i have a feeling that a lot of this is going to be keyboard stuff because that's what i like doing these random boxes when i get a bunch of keyboard stuffing because i know it pisses off people this however not anything keyboard related and i guess i can give a little back stories for each little thing we get so this is a custom ghost xbox the original uh it's not actually called the ghost i believe it was just like to call the crystal edition but like they kind of call it ghost edition so the original xbox from what year 2001 i want to say maybe yeah but this what's special about this is i got it from ebay for i want to say just around 250 and it is a two terabyte modded xbox so this has every single game from the original xbox library onto it plus different like emulators coin ops home brew pretty much this thing is loaded with everything n64 ps1 so that was the main reason for buying this is because i wanted to check out a modded original xbox play all the games i didn't get to play when i was a kid that i still think about i think are cool that uh probably still hold up today because there's a lot of trashy games out there but yeah definitely pumped about this it also has blue leds in the front so these all glow the controller ports uh the little crystal xbox logo glows as well so this will definitely be cool i'm pumped for this um i bought this just for myself but it could be cool if you guys want to see a video on it let me know okay i know it's not the most exciting thing because we're on the new xbox series x already so this is over 20 years old at this point but again if you want to see something about it let me know come back for a cool like modded video next up i'll just start to get out some of the things right in front of me got fragile written all over the box fragile handle with care fragile on all four sides handle with care handle with care so i guess i mean i shouldn't just throw it across my room right now right or should i all right lots of tape used on this a very well packaged box here let's see what are we getting into for box number two gonna make a mess on my floor ah another another little ebay find smells interesting smells interesting i posted about this on twitter a few weeks ago and ironically didn't mean to obviously plan it in this order but another retro sort of console slash man this smells i can't put my finger on what this smells like smells like like like the ocean is that is that a thing this comes from japan i got this in ebay for someone off japan look at that we got some hit japan retro socks even what a what a bargain so let me get this out of the way i'll explain more obviously this can go in the box as well but this is you're either going to laugh you're going to cry you're going to either unsub or you're going to sub one of the four so check out this uh terrible feeling rubber dome hello kitty keyboard yeah so you know kind of thinking back now i was gonna make a video on this but now it's like am i going to so this is a hello kitty dreamcast keyboard and what i have with the whole that whole thing that i got was from japan and it's a full hello kitty edition dreamcast and it's seemingly like brand new so got the matching controller what in the world is all over this box did i get coffee on this or something is that mud from shipping i don't know um but yeah so i like i said when i saw this i thought it was cool and i guess i bought it with intents to make a video but that was a few weeks ago and now that i have it in i'm like do i am i really gonna make a video on a hello kitty dreamcast and keyboard wow how do i open this fantastic job gotta give it to this ebay person with this super good bubble wrap job but the box itself really well packaged i mean i think it looks cool i i like the the light blue sort of color to it um yeah i'm not a big fan of hello kitty but again i like the color and this is all seemingly like brand new condition uh i never had a dreamcast going up growing up growing up growing up all the same but yeah this is what i was mainly pumped for so maybe i can buy like a a dream cast a usb converter and maybe like mod this use it tell me it does not feel good uh but it looks pretty cool right guys is this cool what am i doing why am i buying from the early 2000s and then getting it in and being like oh yeah i bought that this is pretty cool this is from the xbox i like that it's a nice deep blue all right so uh off to a great start huh i never know there's no there's never structure to these videos but again just a bunch of stuff so why not unbox it on camera versus alone in the studio this is either keycaps or switches i have a feeling it's switches um i bought a few different switches and keycap sets though so i'm not really sure and yes okay so this is from ringer keys ringer keys with the boba i'm pumped for these i'm definitely pumped this is the boba which one i get 68 gram these are the uh u4t a nice thaki tactile switch so they're i guess kind of similar first off from like construction and color to something like a glorious panda or the holy panda switch um but these have been all the craze recently and every sound test i heard of properly lubed boba switches are insane like here let me see if i could i don't know but but yeah i i'm not i'm usually like a team linear guy with everything i've heard from these tactile switches or different videos i've watched these uh might be the converter so pump to check these out got 150 here enough for two builds nice all right this i know is a keyboard thing z frontier uh if you're a man of taste you possibly know what this is as well all right so yes oh baby it's the grid you all know at the grid 600 it was my first custom keyboard build that i did on this channel um summer of 2019 and that's really what got me into custom keyboards the grid 600 i feel like is what also got my audience into the custom keyboard you know realm if you will because that video did very very well and that was out of stock for a while because you know how it is with group eyes and stuff limited keyboards but they just had a round two of the grid 600 so this the grid 650 and we have two modules uh so they pretty much you know there were some revisions and like actual changes made to the keyboard i don't have the exact changes you know uh in front of me right now so i'm not 100 sure what that all is i believe it was stuff with like the the mounting oh man this is nice i only want to open it right now i'll eventually do a build on this but i got it in let's see okay so this is like a really nice light silver i don't know if it's considered an e white or not but nice and silver not really sure what this module is uh because i have other ones here this i believe glows oh man this is nice so real quick this is my grid 600 from 2019 so it's the black variant with their green peaks module and again i did a full build on this i've changed the keycaps and switches since but this the original grid 600 this the round two it seems like the edges are a bit more rounded um like the dimensions yeah a little bit smaller a little bit smaller here let's see what kind of modules we got that's what i'm pumped for i know they had it in a few different colors they they offered in a few different variants um man this is all packaged so nice i wish i could just like repackage it all even the sticker on here the little grid a little grid sticker okay so yes different peak modules yet again i know i went for pretty much the same stuff just different colors you can kind of you know there you go is it in focus is it in focus yes so this is like a nice deeper red version so you i can replace it with the the blue one that'll go up here if i get some nice you know red keycaps or keycaps to go with that that'll be a nice little change up i didn't think this is going to come so soon i ordered keycaps specifically for uh this actual video but you know how keycaps are they don't ship for a long time so i hope i get to this video sometime soon uh if not at least you guys will know it's eventually gonna be on the horizon right and which one was this oh this was the actual okay so this was the matching oh no it's blue as well okay i i honestly don't even remember what i like requested from them that is a nice blue that is like a deep wow i don't know how they color this like metal so perfectly but man what build would you rather see uh this with the blue peaks i don't wanna you know blue or the red wow i was really thinking red but now that i see this blue that's nice that is really nice so like i said eventually on the horizon i will get to this build hopefully within the next 12 months man that's throwing me for a loop now i did not expect that blue to be so perfect all right this is a pretty big box it says all over it do not open with sharp instrument it's pretty light though do not open with sharp instrument straight from the underground that'll be fine i hope we'll get into it remember what i said in the beginning about retro wow this box is way too big for this so we had the original xbox we had the hello kitty dream cast now we have the gamecube controller keyboard what yeah so i didn't know this existed this is by far one of the craziest things i've seen for a gaming peripheral and boy do i love it uh gamecube is also another console i did not have growing up so maybe this is all just me reliving my childhood and trying to get things i didn't get when i was a kid um my best friend billy he had one though we played that a lot my plan for this crazy thing the asc iii keyboard controller ascii or asc2 keyboard controller i don't know this was made for fantasy star online look at this thing this is awesome i don't care who you are it has a keyboard built-in rubber dome again rubber dome but who cares i want to mod this and make it an actual keyboard controller like even more actual than it already is you know so i have some plans i ordered a what did i order what was that the plank keyboard and i'm gonna somehow mod this and build a keyboard into this and also have it be a controller i don't know again another ebay buy another thing that i saw in a video you know the little light bulb went off in my head i thought it'd be cool for a video um i'm more pumped about this on and the dreamcast though so this has more promise uh i ordered some resin custom um like buttons and stuff i don't remember what keycaps that i'm gonna use with this but yeah you'll eventually see this in a video and it's gonna be an actual usable controller keyboard thing although it is pretty cool stock all right let's just start to get to this this from this this looks like drops packaging i know drop very well and this seems like something they would do and i've got a feeling uh yes okay so these are keycaps yeah which ones i see the name i can't remember 100 i feel like i just got the shipping confirmation for this recently uh this is not what i was expecting but i am equally excited for it i bought these a while ago so i have this one i want to do like a an eventual like apple keyboard video i know that kind of sounds stupid like what apple and keyboard uh hold on it'll make more sense in a second yes so these are more like not retro looking but more like mac looking keycaps alright so my plan for this is to make a apple mechanical keyboard because a while ago i bought a apple mechanical keyboard but it was the the one from like the 80s i have it right here this guy the uh the m0110 this is from i want i think 1984 i want to say or around that time but yes a nice retro apple mechanical keyboard but they've ma they've remade this case the keyboard community not apple um and i have it and i want to make an actual keyboard build out of it and those keycaps wherever i put them over there they are going to be what's going to eventually be going on the updated 2020 version of this 20 plus year old keyboard maybe even 30 plus year old i don't know no one's gonna watch this all right what's next grace studio sure some of you also recognize that name remember what i said in the beginning lots of keyboard stuff so if you're here and you're mad that it's just keyboard stuff don't say i didn't tell you because i gave you a warning there's always people complaining whenever i do some boxing videos like i came to you for an unboxing not an all keyboard video like well that's what i do all right so the think 6.5 man i ordered these june of 2020 july of 2020 i just got here recently and i'm storm trooper i forgot which two i bought stormtrooper and frosted pc so frosted polycarbonate um i'm not gonna open these right now i'm gonna be honest when i bought these last year um i bought them because i didn't have a lot of polycarbonate keyboards and i wanted these to be like my first but since then i've had like five uh so i'm probably just gonna try to resell one and keep the other uh if anybody out there has a scarlet jelly epoc and you want to swap sees let's do it because i want that that's my new thing i want scarlet jelly epoc you got an extra keyboard you got one of those and you want to trade it for a 6.5 v2 either the stormtrooper or the frosted polycarbonate let me know i must have spilled coffee at one point because there's coffee all over that box there's coffee on this box i don't recall i feel like i would have seen a coffee splatter explosion somewhere so okay i know what this is you can't see this right now oh you can't see this right now so the thing about this i'm not going to give too much away this is a pretty cool product from a pretty big company that really has no right making no i'm not going to say that but it's it's a weird product for this company to make and from what i've seen about this it looks really cool but it is way too expensive and you need an additional very expensive product for this to even work this is going to take a long time to review it's going to take blood sweat and tears this video is going to get absolutely no views because it's too expensive and no one's gonna be trying to buy this thing who knows where the embargo is but when you see it you'll know when you know you know down to the final two okay this is from artifox don't know what this is so uh which one should i do first you said artifacts didn't you all right artifacts artifacts artifacts artifacts they have a few things from artifacts um one being that shelf that you see or you don't see it right now but you know the the setup behind the camera the shelf is from artifox and the monitor riser is some artifacts they make very high quality um i guess you can call it like decor you know stuff for your setup my my white uh walnut and bone desk upstairs in the minimal office that's from artafox this i don't know what it is they said they want to send me some stuff out i said sure and here we got a pretty pretty big box the artifacts what's in here this is hook okay like a frosted acrylic looking wall hook that's pretty enemies that's pretty nice maybe uh for like headphones possibly i don't know i assume that will go with some of the other things that are in here might make more sense if i can get it out let's just dump it dump it upside down it's still stuck it's still stuck wow hey there we go all right let's see don't know so uh so how's the weather yeah yeah crazy crazy weather we're having a artifox mini shelf okay you can mount it huh so i'm probably gonna be putting this stuff in again my upstairs minimal office to go along with the white desk in there i got some like you know some plans to redo a lot of it up there oh so this is like a a much smaller version of that very cool very nice very nice so then that the wall uh the wall shelf the nice little hook what is this then oh i don't wonder if this material is actually polycarbonate or not this is it's like a book stand man this material is super smooth though really nice so they're obviously all about the aesthetic right is there anything underneath here oh a magazine holder yeah magazine holder book holder i wish we could have taken these apart this would be a great vinyl holder as well um i wonder if that'll fit i'll give that a try as well man nice stuff from the artifacts again you will see this in my upstairs studio or it's not really studio but the upstairs off of space i did a tour of that video i did a tour of that room in january and like it got like no views after day one so if you want to go check that out and see what i've got upstairs feel free this will be added and then last but not least we are down to the end already don't know i'm trying to think of what else i could be missing what else they've ordered over the past week or so and i do not know kingston fury oh i think this is all right so you guys know hyperx well you don't know them anymore because they're no longer hyperx they are now kingston so all your hyperx headsets and hyperx ram it's now just kingston which is an interesting rebrand because i feel like hyperx is a very well known company as it is already uh so why go kingston why go the capital of jamaica that sounds right maybe it's wrong i don't know so is this just like a an announcement got a nice little hat kingston fury okay how's that looking kings and furious like i'm repping uh some boxing gear for tyson fury and tommy fury they gonna fight jake paul what is this a kingston fury shirt okay this is like a swag bag type thing a beanie it's like 95 degrees out won't be wearing that a nice little sweatshirt another got kingston fury all over it they want you guys to know they are kingston fury not hyperx fury bunch of stickers achievement unlocked and is that it that is it so yeah again i guess this is just their way of announcing the rebrand um i personally don't understand it a hundred percent because again hyperx is just a very well-known company um already very well established in the gaming and pc community but um rip hyperx and hello kingston fury so how is this video um i feel like i there is less than i thought i'm trying to figure out i know i ordered a bunch of stuff that i thought came in but a lot of this stuff wasn't what i thought does that make sense is that possible lots of ebay stuff lots of old stuff so what i want you to do is let me know down below do you want to see a modded original xbox video um i'm definitely going to mod that gamecube controller keyboard hybrid masterpiece and what the hell am i gonna do with that hello kitty dreamcast bundle i bought it for a reason pretty good deal i think i got it for 250ish on ebay and those special edition collector uh dreamcast things go for a pretty good amount i've seen them for like 650 and up so when i saw that deal that's probably why i hopped on it they have a pink hello kitty version as well again like keyboard and stuff but i like the the lighter blue versus pink obviously um nothing wrong with like in pink if you like pink i'm not out here trying to get cancelled for not liking pink it's 20 21 maybe i will get canceled for not liking pink this video is an unboxing video if you're still watching at this point 20 some odd minutes in 30 minutes in uh thank you thank you for helping me out because audience retention goes a long way audience retention and hour one view counts that's all youtube cares about that's why the algorithm is a pos because it changes and it values weird things at different times and it's always changing so i'm rambling again if you're watching i want you to comment down below right now everything i just asked you about the what i should do with those three um but i also to let me know you're still watching comments i'm not good off top in my head wow that was like 30 seconds just let me know you're watching just let me know you're watching all right i'm random frank p if you enjoyed this you're insane have a good day
