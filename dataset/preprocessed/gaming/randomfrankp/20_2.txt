what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we'll be showing off my gaming setup and studio tour for 2022 [Music] all right so we are back with the yearly tradition of showing off my gaming setup and my youtube studio tour which is how the channel started by the way doing these setups and typically i have these videos out the first week of the year however as you can tell it's uh it's a bit later now right it's summertime but that means we'll be showcasing all the changes and upgrades i made from the last 18 plus months or so there's a lot to go over for you guys sit tight i'll drop everything you see in the description down below if i miss something let me know i'll try my best to have all the gear and hardware listed for you guys in the description but yeah a bunch to show off for you guys today literally behind the camera my actual gaming setup behind me the entertainment setup over here as well so tons and tons to show off so you guys see what i'm working with we'll do a mix of the nice fancy b-roll as well as like a vlog style to make it more personal for you guys today hope you're pumped let's start it off alright guys so kicking this one off like i said gonna be a bit of a longer one there's a lot to go over so sit tight going to break it up though into a few different parts so first we're going to talk about the main filming setup where you see me do all of my a-roll filming b-roll and stuff the way i had this set up for when i do those different overhead top shots so a lot to cover here we're going to cover all that including the camera gear filming gear you'll see then second we'll talk about the more minimal setup that's behind the camera this just you know a more minimal gaming setup but you know also acting as a set for when i'm doing like reviews and stuff just a nice secondary space for getting some filming done because that's the main thing with the youtube studio not only is everything acting as a functional space but it's also a spot for filming so it's broken up into different sets as well for when i'm filming reviews third then we'll talk about the entertainment setup which not only again which is a functional entertainment setup but also acts as a filming set and then we'll cover some of the more in between stuff you see around the room then we'll wrap it up here with the main gaming setup this is where i am 99 of the time for pc gaming all of my editing this is the main setup that powers the channel so like i said a bunch to go over as you can see man hope you're ready so just starting this one off like i said here with the main desk this is from ergun office and it's the sway desk i recently got this in as an upgrade it's 72 inches by 30 inches so definitely a long and wide desk has this really nice walnut finish and the main thing is with this and it helps a lot again with filming is since it is height adjustable it's super quiet and nice and fast as well which is great and the main reason why i wanted a sit sand desk over here because again for filming instead of constantly adjusting the camera and the tripod all the time say i want to get you know different shots and different angles different verticality i could just move the desk with the product instead of the camera and the tripod to get that different elevation of different angles which is why i also wanted a nice wide desk as well it's going to give me a lot of flexibility also has a drawer and stuff which is great for you know storing things accessories and everything but in terms of just functionality this desk is great i have a link for you in the description down below as well as everything we talked about today i think you can save like 75 bucks with the link so yeah check it all out down below and as you notice this is a nice walnut finish but this isn't usually the desktop you see i have a bunch of different you know overhead shot like overlays that i'll put on the desktop itself from different actual wooden desktop surfaces somewhat to d brand like vinyl surfaces that i have just to get some variety you know for that fancy overhead b-roll shot just to make it look more interesting and more entertaining to you guys now another thing i did want to point out and it's actually not a part of the desk but it's this spotify car thing and it's pretty much its own dedicated like spotify media player so it is a fully functional little device i can control all of my music and everything from here from playlist you know volume on the fly it's touch screen as well and this obviously isn't a part of the urban office desk i just have it here conveniently right next to the touchscreen slider and since this is where i'm filming most of the time i have it here because i have it then through bluetooth hookup to the speakers behind me at my main setup so when i am filming i can blast music around the studio and it's all just you know my spotify song so all controllable right here i don't have to constantly be on my phone or go over to my setup and adjust anything for spotify or music definitely a pretty cool little device um i haven't done a full review on it but i have this in a video uh but yeah it's the cool little gadget that i have here to keep me motivated and going when i'm filming and stuff right moving up next we're going to talk about the video gear because right as the overhead i have this massive mini max it's called it is essentially a giant heavy duty boom arm unless we do a lot of things like you know mounting overhead cameras and a lot of gear and stuff up here i can rig up so i do have the blackmagic pocket cinema uh 6k camera i do use this a lot when i'm getting those like wide overhead shots like unboxings and stuff and i also have a wireless hdmi transmitter so i can see what i'm actually filming and then connected to that i also have two microphones you're probably wondering why do i have two here so my main mic is the sennheiser mkh416 i believe it's called which is my main microphone that i use for pretty much everything which i have then fed into the new uh zoom f3 field recorder this thing is insanely powerful for audio it is crazy it's super compact but it's an external audio recorder and for my entire time you know doing youtube until i got this in march i've always just had my microphone uh being fed into my blackmagic camera and i'd always just use the onboard preamps in the camera and you know for the past like it worked fine for the last six seven plus years it sounded okay but now with the zoom f3 it's got like 32-bit float it just gives you so much more flexibility when it comes to my audio and making it sound so so much better so the reason why i have a second microphone up here is because in case i ever forget to actually hit record on the actual f3 i would then have like a fail safe pretty much because this mic i believe it was like a 30 uh some bearing or cheap xlr mic so i have that here being fed into the camera which is then acting like a scratch track but again if i do ever forget to actually hit record on the f3 then that would save me from you know having an entire video that i filmed without any audio so this is a 30 fail save pretty much definitely worth it but yeah that's the main audio upgrade that i've made over here for the last year i still have the aputure uh 120d mark ii lights acting as like the main light fill which i have mounted on a c-stand with an overhead a falconized light panel which helps me just fill the desk for what i'm doing overhead shots and then behind me is a hair light from elgato it's the elgato key light so different you know lighting components and stuff not all of them are even the same brand kind of scattered uh but yeah gotta do what you gotta do to get the the lighting nice and bright now for my main camera this is the blackmagic ursa mini 4.6 k this is the camera that gets about 95 of the footage that you've seen on the channel i've had this for a while now and before that dating back to 2015 i had the original ursa mini this is the upgraded 4.6 k this is what you see pretty much for everything on the channel and when i am doing my talking headshots so i can actually see myself i have a lily put monitor mounted up top so i can see you know what i'm actually filming if i'm in focus but yeah that is the main gear for all my youtube stuff a-roll b-roll and like i said if i did miss anything uh let me know but like i'll put some of the more like detailed boring stuff like the tripod head there's legs all that in the description as well because i can't you know cover every single thing but yeah just check the description for you guys i'll try my best to have it all down there for you now moving on over to the secondary setup this is definitely what changed probably the most over the last year this whole space was a lot more crowded so i kind of cleaned it up a bit took some things out to make it a more minimal setup so you could say i moved that big shelf that i had over here away and it's just more of a chill spot i'd say and some of the changes that i made for the actual hardware is a full uh govi glide sort of light ring sort of thing you know kind of going around the setup makes it look cool gives it a nice little like accented piece to make the setup pop and for the actual gear and hardware my monitor is the corsair xenion it is the uh it's a 32 inch 165 hertz monitor definitely looks great for console gaming pc gaming this is one of the newer upgrades i've made since this is a spot where i tend to film a lot of my monitor reviews since i had the space here so the monitor pretty much changes constantly here this is what i have now in rotation kind of going right along now since we're talking corsair with the new pc this is the corsair one i 300 as my main pc for this setup super small and compact but also crazy powerful as well it's got an i9 1200k cpu with an rtx 3080 ti inside so i recently got these both in to add to the more minimal setup and uh just with everything i think it looks pretty nice and you can see for some of the peripherals also some new additions including the brand new steelseries arctis nova pro headset i just released on the channel these are my wireless headset that i use but also for audio uh in addition to that i have the vana 2 transparent one encore speakers these i've had for a while over here um they're absolutely fantastic so i have both of them on stand so they're mounted on each side at your level and it pretty much gives me three different choices when it comes to audio at the setup because i can use the crazy good speakers i could use the wireless headset or i could use one of my favorite cans of all time the sennheiser hd 800s which i have here as well so just a bunch of flexibility when it comes to you know actually sitting down testing products and filming over here at this secondary setup and powering these sennheisers is from jds labs their own l amp and l dac now for my main peripherals over here i have the logitech and shroud g303 been rocking this since release over at this setup i know it's kind of dark right now i'll try to fix that in post uh the mouse pad is our novel keys random frank p topographic desk pad and the gmk pro from glorious again all sort of fittings like a nice midnight green sort of theme over here just to keep it nice and minimal oh yeah before i forget no i'm gonna see questions about it the actual monitor riser here and desktop shelf is from artifox this is just gives you some nice extra storage and stuff as you can see and elevates the monitor nicely and so is that shelf that i have over here on the wall also from artifox so that's why i wanted to get a more you know clean and minimal approach and stuff on this side of the room i think it gives me the space you know to get that extra spot for filming which is the entire reason you know this part of the studio exists and you've also seen this portion over here in some videos this is usually where i do like a lot of my pc builds so this is a large wide desk uh so i'll have like the hardware and stuff on there and do the actual filming of the pc builds on this uh sort of just spot with the fake brick behind it and i have these paper rolls pretty much again just for you know getting overhead shots if i want to add some color but yeah i did a vlog on this making that faux brick wall a while ago three years ago at this point so yeah this is the whole functional more minimal secondary filming side of the studio that's definitely a lot more clean than it was in years past now before we go over here since we're just on this side of the room real quick there's a lot of little things as you can see including the ridiculous like keyboard building station and section that i have so i got like key switches you know mounted up on the wall um on the ikea scottish pegboard i have other switches cables just you know things that i'm going to need little accessory for when it comes to when i'm doing all those custom keyboard builds we try to make it nice and you know aesthetically pleasing even though it's kind of getting overcrowded now and again a lot of the stuff that i'm talking about i've done videos on or showed off in some capacity but as a keyboard station this is the prep deck and it's pretty much made to be like a kitchen organizer for when you're cooking uh but i repurposed it for you know keyboard parts so different springs switch films actual switches lube different keyboard stuff you know clippers brushes all that stuff got some foam down here so a nice little organization piece for keyboard building and this entire uh cabinet unit i don't remember the name it is from ikea though and down here is where i have stored all like my keycap sets that i currently either have on a build or i'm saving for upcoming builds and stuff so i have them down here in this shelving unit also as you can see a bunch of like accessories uh soldering tools desoldering keyboard boxes all that and this little like sort of mini sticker bomb section like companies that i've gotten stuff from companies that you buy stuff from they give you a little sticker so i have them all here uh but yeah this is the uh keyboard building section right i guess you can call it that i don't know again i remember the actual name of this unit here but it was from ikea and it just works for uh storing everything uh pretty nicely then on this shelf i have some boards that are in the queue to get built because you guys know how it is for keycap sets they're years away they're delayed that whole story so these are keyboards that i have that i'm gonna be building soon whenever keycaps come in and then yes this is like a little wardrobe holder that i have for hanging different mouse pads and stuff on so again for when i'm like filming overhead stuff or just matching them with different keyboard builds have them all here you've seen this before this is nothing new on this side but this idea was from omnitype i believe shout out to them just holds all my mouse pads more mask pads on the bottom that i can't mount yeah that's that all right so lastly on the side of the room before we move on we could talk about uh you've probably seen this crazy looking uh big logo thing as one of the newer editions i think it's dope these are from nanoleaf and you're familiar with nanoleaf these are called the nanoleaf lines and it's the same company that obviously makes the aurora light panels that i have mounted above you're familiar with these um this is supposed to be you can kind of see it's my logo but like in a 3d type of way and it was coming out great i think it looks pretty cool but since we're in the basement and we have the hvac unit over in that room and it's like running all up in the ceiling here on this side it's a bit smaller in terms of ceiling height so what happened was i had to kind of cut off the bottom of the p or elsa would have looked really cool when it was all built up if it would have been done properly i think the whole 3d look like the geometric 3d design to the rfp logo looks pretty cool again if you haven't ever actually seen it you got the r the f in negative space and then the p or the rfp logo it's the way i designed it so if i would have had like two feet more i could have fully extended the bottom of the p down would have looked really dope but that's okay i think this looks pretty cool it helps fill just the otherwise you know blank wall and get some extra lightning and stuff for when i'm filming over the setup and adds a nice extra dimension right but these lights the nanoleaf lines are crazy bright there's a bunch of different effects you can configure them however you want make all these different designs i love these picked these up recently definitely think it completes this wall as well as this just portion of the the room so now moving on to the entertainment setup that i think this portion has probably changed the most over the last year and a half all together like in my studio the most upgrades have come over here this was like all bare like there was nothing over here so to make it more lively you know i built it up put some shelves and stuff just to complete the entertainment setup space and if you remember i had this all like boxed off like the the sofa was over on this side i had this little small table behind it and it was really just boxed in and i didn't like it so i upgraded a lot of stuff and made it more open including the lg c1 77 inch tv it is a beautiful 77 inch oled i did an entire review on this last year i have everything hooked up to in the entertainment center with you know like the xbox one series x the ps5 including an original xbox which i'll show you coming up in a minute but yeah just loving how the new space came out i think it's transformed a lot and uh like i said just some of the better upgrades i've made to the studio is over in this spot including this chair it's called the womb okay it is super super comfortable it's like when i sit down the day kick back get some console gaming done uh it's just a dream to sit in so comfortable super ergonomic it's got a little footrest as well so like i said really wanted to make this more minimal more open more inviting and stuff have like remotes over here controllers and then on this wall i took down those old prints that i had because it's not really like my style anymore but i picked up this um from poland this is a sound diffuser and again i think it just fits in with the overall theme the way i have it all designed my aesthetic i don't know how fully functional this is gonna be you know but i think on the wall it looks fantastic beautifully handmade i'll put the etsy shop down below but yeah got this hung up picked it up recently i think it looks great we'll cover more of the setup in a minute but first up one of the new additions is also a little mini fridge that i have filled with 3d energy drinks shout out to them they're not a sponsor i wish they were but i am hooked definitely one of the best tasting and i would say healthiest energy drinks out there and uh yeah love these my go-to is the lemon again not a sponsor totally wish they were though uh but hey if anyone's watching this from 3d love your stuff so yeah all right back to the actual tv and a lot of stuff going on so behind the tv i have an rgb light strip which is just set to like white right now and then on each side as you can see from govi i have these light bars called the lira or the lyra you know the routine with you know rgb light bars obviously it can be full rgb much different effects right now having sort of like a tealish color to kind of fit in with the whole setup but you can make them white like i have here but the reason why i have it all static right now is because behind the tv one of the things i also picked up to complement the gaming stuff over here is an rgb bias like hdmi box from light me i believe they're called so what this does is whatever hdmi source you have hooked up to it it will portray that lighting sort of extend it behind the tv onto the wall and look really cool i've showed a bunch of different versions of this stuff off in the past last year i had one from govi as well but i had a camera this is all hdmi reliant so whatever you have hooked up to the hdmi box it will show behind the tv give it a nice soft glow and just look really really cool uh this is also super bright like the rgb effect on here is insane but i think that's just too too much i keep it just to the the bias lighting pretty much and i think it looks awesome then for the entertainment center itself i don't remember the exact name i got off of wayfair a while back but definitely a nice uh you know little accent piece here as well like i said before the xbox one series x conveniently you know spaced over here in this little nook it's like the perfect fit that they have cut out for it got the ps5 right next to it the d brand uh dark plates you know all black consoles with like the wooden and gray entertainment center and i do have a samsung soundbar up top get some nice you know gaming audio going on nice and loud immersive sound bar underneath over there uh for that extra bass hits one of my more favorite upgrades and editions i made is this original xbox and as you can see it's probably not what you're used to seeing when it comes to an original xbox it's got these red lights in it and it's a japan exclusive it's the skeleton shell but with it being modded it's got a two terabyte hard drive inside built-in hdmi which is what lets me actually play this here on the tv so i can you know play on the 4k tv instead of just using the old like cables and stuff and i can literally play like every game every single xbox game is on here with the two terabytes not only just the original xbox titles but ps1 n64 game boy it is a retro dream i've probably gamed more on this in the last like six months i'd say than i have on current gen consoles combined this has been an absolutely awesome pickup that i got from ebay i think it was like 5 or six hundred dollars so definitely expensive but i've definitely got that soft spot for like retro gaming and all the nostalgia and i also have a usb transmitter in the back it's little usb stick that lets me use an original xbox one controller with the modded xbox i don't have to use the old you know like the wired ones that were bigger and clunky i could use an xbox one controller wirelessly with here kick back in the womb chair and get some og gaming done playing some tony hawk underground some lone wolf some dave meers bmx all the good old original xbox titles that i uh just miss but uh some of them don't hold up but that's the fun of revisiting and playing a lot of them on here and then speaking of uh nostalgia and some stuff like i said over here i do have this shelving unit which used to be over on the minimal side of the setup but just some things on display make it more homey have it broken up some of my favorite things like some of my eagle stuff you know collectibles signed balls helmets super bowl collectibles things like that and then uh underneath there i have a lot of my sealed like pokemon collection from psa 10 sealed booster packs the original like tomy figures that i have still sealed to go along with the packs japan exclusive the game boy games just so you know a lot of like figures and stuff that i loved as a as a kid cool stuff like that including then underneath uh like that again n64 n64 games still in the box the other original xbox which is the uh again i think this is the skeleton of one was ghost or this is ghost skeleton i don't know the clear transparent shell here a ps1 but yeah i just wanted to you know build this section up so it wasn't so blank and just barren over here and kind of you know secluding the entertainment center so now it all feels complete but now for the main setup there is a lot to go over as you can imagine tons of gear and hardware so where do we even begin um i guess we'll start off with the actual desktop itself uh this is a 98 inch live acacia wooden countertop this is an upgrade from the old ikea desktop that i had you know for years which i now have on the other side of the studio again that was fine but the actual like composite material was pretty thin this though solid butcher block and it looks great as well love that natural finish to it and how it looks i have the desktop then on the ikea alex drawers on each side another routine with this and then i have them on these little furniture riser legs so it's you know get that extra elevation and stuff when you're sitting there but that's not new this has been my desk for two years now or so most of the newer stuff comes in terms of the peripherals we'll go over it all uh the bottom two monitors are two of the lg ultra gear 34 inch monitors they're a 165 hertz 3440 1440p really dig the lg ultra gear ultrawide monitor so i've been rocking these two on the bottom for a while with a 34 inch aoc monitor as the overhead monitor and i always see questions whenever i do these setup videos is people always ask why i have a bezel in the middle but as i say every year uh it's not that hard for you guys to digest the fact that i have a chair and a chair lets me sit in front of any monitor or wherever i want at the death setup so i always sit and i have the right monitor acting as my primary display this is where i do everything and then you know like where i'm sitting here on the left side i can have like when i'm editing and stuff like my uh files all the bins vector scopes that kind of stuff even on the top aoc monitor you know things like twitter spotify whatever just a bunch of screen real estate and again i don't just sit in front of the bezel i don't stare at that all day i could uh move around now i'm not too sure what the actual monitor mounts are called uh they're like 15 bucks from amazon same thing with the speaker mounts up top and like i also just said i get a lot of questions about these these are not made for me to be monitoring audio when i'm here at my setup people always say oh random frank p they're way too high it's wrong and i agree but like i showed you i have these here specifically for what i'm filming over in the studio hooked up to the spotify car thing and i can just have music playing around while i'm filming but these are also on some cheap uh monitor or uh actual speaker mounts and the speakers themselves are the cantu yu5 so everything mounted nicely give that nice seamless sort of floating appearance here uh but yeah behind the monitors is where all the crazy cable management's going on but you don't see all that hanging down and that's what matters most oh and the chair by the way before i forget is the herman miller embody i've had this since 2016. super comfortable definitely expensive but again for those long gaming or editing sessions yes an expensive ergonomic office chair is definitely worth it but now we can dive into my main peripherals that i'm using over here uh for my keyboard i have been using this for a bit it is a steel series apex pro tkl with their omnipoint switches and i do have these deep forest uh sort of like midnight green key caps from tai hao on there i get questions about them all the time i can't find them like anywhere either but that's what i have on here with a color matching like resin and wooden wrist rest again to match the whole aesthetic and then for my mouse this is one of the newer upgrades it is the new razer viper pro yeah i gave it some in my review but seeing the fact that i've used the viper ultimate since release in 2019 uh this new pro version is lighter technically faster on paper as well so this has been my upgrade here i also have like this iridescent emerald green spray paint on left and right clicks again just to make it all match definitely think it looks pretty cool um for my audio this is actually all pretty new um my main headphones of choice are now the bear dynamic dt900 pro x they're open back they sound fantastic they're super comfortable i love these they're just a dream pair of headphones and they are so much less expensive and way more affordable than the sennheiser hd100s hd800s that i showed you guys over on the minimal setup but yes love these for my microphone this is the beacon mic i pretty much use this um just for like streams and stuff i don't do any voiceover work on this mainly just for live streaming and that then gets fed into the beacon mix which is a physical mixer pretty much where i have you know i can go in when i'm streaming configure all the knobs to be certain things like discord spotify chat just all the levels on the fly and stuff makes streaming so much easier a killer tandem here this duo of the beacon mic and mixer they got some really great stuff and they kind of came out of nowhere recently uh so i've been loving them they even have this like super crazy powerful software we can configure stuff even more uh the mic is crazy adjustable in terms of like you know just pushing it to get the best out of it so it sounds the best possible and all the mixer controls in the software so they got some crazy crazy stuff from beacon shout out to them and then speaking of streaming two little hidden additions i have is this little uh magnetic mount where i put an elgato key light mini this just goes here to sort of like fill the shadows while i'm streaming just you know so i appear brighter and then over uh in the middle of my monitors i have mounted like a mini vlogging tripod that i can just pull out mount my sony zv1 which acts as my webcam then when i'm not streaming you know it folds back up all goes back into place and stays hidden so two little hidden sort of streaming additions i have here and the last two things to touch on my uh actual amp and dac for my better dynamic headphones is the grace design m9xx has the nice volume die at the top so i can just quickly and easily you know adjust volume and then my mouse pad is the razer strider it is a really nice hybrid surface so it's the best of like speed and control i have it extended here so nice and large just a fantastic mouse pad i've been using it for a year now and it still looks and feels brand new so definitely digging these some other little things over on the left side of my desk like i got this tommen's wooden desk lamp just to fit in aesthetically again it looks really nice i think and some other desktop accents like this topographic ps5 controller i had made from colorware along with a matching notepad and stuff just to have here you know like i said fits in with the whole desk sort of set up now as you can see one of the new changes i made um in addition to these light panels that i have on the ceiling which helps just sort of you know light the desktop when i'm doing overhead shots and stuff when i'm filming i have these two rgb light bars mounted on each side of my setup and the main purpose of this is again to sort of like fill that wall space to give it some extras just uh i don't know pop and glow for when i am filming because now it looks better in terms of symmetry so when you are seeing me when i'm doing like my talking a a-roll stuff when i'm filming uh when you see it you know behind me it just looks better so it's more symmetrical i think it looks cooler that way i don't know but yeah those are just the light bars that i have mounted up on the wall and i can control them wirelessly now over to the brand new pc this is completely new um i upgraded this in january of last year and before that i've had the phanteks pc since 2019. so the case here is the leon lee 011 dynamic mini it's the snow edition and as you saw in the intro it had a bit of a weird thing going on with the front panel kind of like an illusion right so behind the front glass panel i actually have mounted a 14 inch monitor it's a portable monitor that i have mounted right in here fits perfectly i don't have it on right now for what i'm doing the setup tour so i can show you guys you know the full pc this lets me do some cool visual tricks um what i did was actually film the internals of my pc from like a straight on shot you know looking at the inside and then when i was editing it i added an overlay and then i could export it then put that onto the monitor so it looks like you know the pc is being filled with like some cool ink display have some cool like water effects going on just you know gives me flexibility to add those cool visual effects even though it's not really real it's an illusion but i think it definitely looks pretty cool and again i did a whole video on this when i did that micro center vlog when i built this a few months ago so if you want you can check that out but just a pretty interesting look i feel but yeah the 011 dynamic mini case snow edition from leon lee to now complete the mr freeze build all white um internals and stuff so for my actual specs for going over it all i have an intel i9 11900k cpu on one of the gigabyte z590 vision motherboards uh one of the newer white all-white nzxt cracking aios with this you can like show me my temps and stuff real time you can put up gifs and have graphics going on here but the all white looks really nice on this cracking aio and again just fits in with the whole theme of the build i have 128 gigs of this t-force extreme ram super nice clean looking uh dims here for the sticks white braided cables and stuff as well and uh for our gpu it's a gigabyte rtx 3080 ti vision so again the whole vision white mr freeze uh theme build i called it and one of the like literal newest additions to this pc that i added like two days ago are these new leon lee infinity fans so as you saw when i was showing you the b-roll of like the whole uh sort of crazy overlay effect going on those are the older fans i had these now just sort of had this like infinity mirror effect going on on the center of the fan as well as like the outside so it looks pretty cool just extra rgb but i typically keep it like all white or like a white and like a ice blue type of thing again to fit into the mr freeze build i call it but uh yeah this upgrade here like i said the biggest upgrade pretty much for my main setup since this is what i've had now for the past few months but last time you saw my old phanteks built but yeah that's the main pc that runs everything for the channel uh one of my favorite builds so far and then lastly over here again just you know a nice little shelving unit that has a bunch of uh custom keyboard builds and stuff you've seen me do on the channel have them nicely on display i'm including like a lot of the more custom like literal custom ones with the novel keys and random frank p nk65 we did but i also have on here with our control t keys and random frank p deepsea topographic keycap set so looking really nice on here i think loving the way this came out again just a nice little like shelving unit to have these keyboards on display instead of having them just like in a box somewhere you know you build them up they're expensive you want to put them on display i can't use them all at once right so i wanted to have them nicely on a shelf with like matching cables and stuff just to make it all aesthetically nice as a nice display piece so that is uh pretty much the the gist of it that is the 2022 setup tour going over the uh l-shaped studio here from the main filming setup the main desk setup the minimal setup and our entertainment center there's some other things you know like this a little spot where i keep all of my lenses i have like a prop drawer and stuff or perhaps you'll see what i'm doing overhead shots not going to go over all all of that a little bit where i have some more product reviews and stuff coming up i have it over here for now just to keep it tidy and not all on the floor have a cover if you can't see a lot of stuff all under embargo uh but yeah guys i think that about does it think we covered it all man oh man so uh that was a lot huh but that'll do it
