what's up guys i'm random frank p back at episode 265 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup now if you haven't you know caught the drift by now these episodes are monthly sometimes bi-monthly guys i've been doing this series since 2015. i am getting super exhausted and bored of it which is why i want to still continue to do it but not weekly like we used to i see all the comments i see all the people hit me up on twitter yes i'm gonna continue to do it just not as frequently as we did in the past i'm sorry i'm just getting sort of tired and exhausted of setups all the time but regardless episode 265 for you if you see anything you like to have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check out the gear and hardware if you want it for your setup we'll kick it off now 265. in this episode sponsored by the corsair hs 65 surround sound gaming headset it sounds and looks great but also won't break the bank at under 80 available in black or white this lightweight 282 gram headset is going to immerse you right in the middle of your action with the custom tuned 50 millimeter drivers now featuring their sound id personalized audio you can go in and tweak it and fine tune it to your liking create custom eqs control side tone all that good stuff if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below starting us off today is astro nuggy and i've been following her for a while on instagram it's really cool she's been documenting the progress of her new setup so really cool to see it changing and evolving which is why in some of these pictures some of the decor and room aesthetic you know changes a bit but regardless let's check it all out she does have a slight stacked monitor set up here highlighted by the alienware 34-inch curved ultra wide monitor with a portable 15.6 inch monitor underneath and as much as i love me some cool rgb around the room i think it looks really nice in the daytime with the the white walls geometric sound panels and one thing i really liked that she did was she customized alex drawers by putting on this bamboo skin just so you know fit into that wood grain finish i think it's a really nice touch down for peripherals we have the dust silver keyboard with custom keycaps we also have the alienware aw 610m mouse digging the little macro pad as well with the elgato stream deck in the back and also for audio we have the donner dyna 3 speakers with logitech g733 headset again all the peripherals all the hardware around the room matching nicely now for the pc inside the metallic gear neo cube case is an intel i7 11700k cpu with the corsair h150i elite capelix aio 64 gigs of corset vengeance rgb pro ram on a gigabyte z4 90 vision g motherboard an evga gtx 1070 ti got some white braided cables rgb fans as well again to fit the room to fit the theme to fit the rgb which looks great nighttime daylight a really nice looking room astro nuggy i'll put her instagram down below definitely give her a follow some really great setup pics next up we got kai soup his name is kai and he is soup but his setup is not soup it's very nice so this is all ran off of a mac mini it's the m1 2020 version so not your typical gaming setup here but still looking really really nice and clean also worth noting he has a macbook pro but i know how you guys are whenever we show off apple products i'm here to say get over it it's a nice setup he has an innocon wr40 pro ultra wide monitor at 34 inches i personally haven't heard of that but he said he's from japan so i assume it's an overseas exclusive and down for the peripherals we have an hhkb professional hybrid type s keyboard really nice touch here with the logitech mx master 3 mouse a macro pad from cooler tron which we also showed off in a cool deck under 50 episode and also on the desk he has the echo show 5 in addition to a plethora of nice plants all across the room span nicely as well into the wallpaper always a nice touch there monitor light bar on the monitor as well all really nice and cozy that's this is definitely a cozy setup from kai soup now we're rocking with kuba and if this was edible i would eat the screen because this is a delicious looking setup you know i really find myself more and more gravitating towards these chill good vibe setups you know and this one's just checking it all off really liking it so his primary display is a 29 inch lg ultra wide with the bottom monitor being another portable 15.6 inch display and i really can't tell what the wall is behind but that's like concrete or something but i'm really digging the texture in the matte black finish for kuba's peripherals we have an sbc gk 530 tkl with the logitech g502 lightspeed mouse that's all on the novel keys godspeed desk mat so they got the light speed on the godspeed and also for audio even though it's not pictured he has logitech g pro x headset then forced pc inside the nzxt h510 case is an amd ryzen 7 3800 xt cpu with an nzxt kraken x53 aio 16 gigs of courser vengeance pro rgb ram on an msib 550 gaming plus motherboard with an asus gtx 1060 gpu and i'm really digging the use here of the ikea scotus pegboard we see these you know they're a lot more popular now a great way to organize the room keeps the desktop clutter down to a minimum as well but again just really digging whatever that wall is as stupid as that sounds the texture the matte black to it it absorbs the rgb it just ties the whole room together really liking this one kuba now we've got jack with the triple monitor gaming setup and as always a fan favorite the past year or so the tie fighter setup orientation with the horizontal primary monitor and the two verticals on each side digging the back panel as well the clock above it let's check it all out his primary display is an asus tough 27 inch it's 170 hertz so obviously that'll be his main with the two vertical ones being a skeptic 20 inch on each side then moving on down to the peripherals we have a custom tofu 65 all in aluminum here and for the specs if you guys care inside he has lubed and filmed tangerine switches nice brass plate and drops mt3 camilo keycap set so a nice white and blue also gray to go along with his white gpro wireless super light mouse also on a white extended mouse pad from glorious and then for audio chilling on the fifein k658 microphone are his bare dynamic dt 770 pro headphones and then over on the right side of the desk we have the pc this is a white fractal design meshfy c case with a ryzen 7 3700x cpu with a corsair h100i platinum aio 32 gigs of core serve engines rgb pro ram on an x570 asrock steel legend motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 3070 gaming oc as you can also see we have a fellow keyboard enthusiast uh my condolences i feel the pain of your wallet as we go down this rabbit hole together with a nice little collection there and definitely a nice room really really digging it i would suggest possibly i don't do suggestions often but again i think it might help here either a monitor light bar a nice tommen's desk lamp on the left side or some sort of floor lamp in the room just to make your setup pop with a little bit more lighting but regardless still really really nice and then last but definitely not least today we have alex with a bunch of cohesive rgb because he's sticking to a nice ice blue theme but alex said this room is not just gonna be from my desk setup it's gonna be for all my personal favorites the memorabilia the paraphernalia all the cool collectibles and prints this is crazy crazy cool a bunch of lights and signs and figures this is absolutely insane and this is definitely what makes a uh just nuts gaming room but we will focus on the setup real quick because he has a dell 27 inch it's the u2715h nicely mounted on a little monitor arm off to the right side but since it's white blends in nicely with the desk and with the wall and rgb behind it there you know glowing makes it all blend in really really well for the peripherals is a corsair k95 platinum rgb keyboard with a razer basilisk mercury mouse on the goliath's extended chroma mouse pad which is also the mercury edition as well you can see the back has got like the nintendo switch the elgato stream deck for audio he's rocking the mass drop and sennheiser hd 6xx headphones bunch of stuff just a bunch of stuff but let's check out that pc that thing is looking gorgeous it's the corsair 4000d airflow case with a ryzen 9 5900x cpu with the corsair h100i rgb platinum se aio 32 gigs of course revenge rgb pro ram yet again it's like every ram this episode on an asus rog strix b550a gaming motherboard and an evga gtx 1060 ssc gpu and again another look at the collectibles uh the glass cabinets here the helmets up top i love seeing stuff like this because you can see their personality you know and that's what really completes the room their hobbies all their favorite stuff and this is just an insanely crazy cool display of all of that so alex wow man this is definitely inspirational to a lot of people out there i can guarantee it all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 265 of roommates for project hope you enjoyed don't forget all the gear and hardware you saw
