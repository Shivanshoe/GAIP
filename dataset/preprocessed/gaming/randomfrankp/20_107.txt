do you wake up and choose violence have you ever gotten back with an ex you ever seen a grown man naked well today we're doing two of those things what's up what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be revisiting the logitech g502 i know that all the jokes start back up again but we're gonna be revisiting it in the sense that i'll be telling you about my last two weeks going back and using this as my full-time mouse now this doesn't mean that i'm doing that full switcharoo back to this i'm still going to main my viper ultimate because that's just you know probably my go-to it's been so since release and since the mouse market has gotten real stale over the past six months you know it's gotten kind of boring nothing really new i wanted to go back to the days when 120 something grams was rather the norm so before the viper ultimate came out i'm sure a lot of you know if you've been a fan for a while i was a g502 lover i stood by its side and it was my main mouse since release with the original g502 to the proteus spectrum the hero then the wireless light speed i reviewed them all i used every iteration and honestly i loved it and i kind of still do but like i said not gonna be maining it so i've used it for the past two weeks we're gonna kind of bring you back through and talk about my adjustment going back to a heavier mouse after using a lightweight mouse for so long now what i think about it and if it's even still worth it uh spoiler it is so it really all started when i first built my gmmk pro keyboard i built a really clean black and white version and for b-roll i wanted to find a black and white mouse to go with it and then i remembered a few years back i teamed up with colorware and they made me a custom random frank pg 502 with my logo on it with a nice black and white sort of paint job so i figured let me shoot some of this b-roll with this black and white mouse and just for aesthetics to visually match it i opted not to show that b-roll during my review because i kind of wanted to save that surprise and i knew the whole comment section would just be flooded with g502 comments and they would ignore the gmk pro so i didn't really you know use that for this video but once i was using that during gameplay i was like holy sh this like muscle memory is incredible i went right back to that you know the ergo style feels really nice in the hand it's a really unique you know design to the mouse obviously uh it's aggressive looking in the visual gamer sense but the actual just ergo design to it for me because i used it for so long it was just like flipping that switch right back on again i was immediately used to it like i've never you know switched off of it and then i thought to myself okay if i really want to stick to this video and actually use it for two weeks i'm not gonna use the wired version i'm gonna go back to the light speed which is a little bit lighter and obviously wireless so let's take a look at it shall we so the light speed does come in at 114 grams which i know sounds hilarious right now because we have mice that are around like 50 grams and 60 grams on average so this is nearly double the weight of the average gaming mouse out there currently you know in the mouse market and again i've been manning the viper ultimate since it released towards the end of 2019 and that's just 74 grams but comparatively it's 40 grams lighter than the g502 light speed yeah it's heavy yeah it's got optional weights blah blah blah but the truth is this mouse is one of the top selling gaming mouse of all time you can laugh at logitech all you want but they're laughing all the way to the bank trust me uses their 25k dpi hero sensor there's 11 programmable buttons you have some glossy strips going through it like who knows why it comes with five 3.6 gram weights if you want to add more to it like a psycho one thing i definitely do miss about this mouse is the hyper scroll like the scroll wheel on this is just insane i love how it can just go for like a minute straight super satisfying stops on the scroll wheel too you could feel everyone with a thick tactility and also i completely forgot this mouse had the sniper button which you can toggle to like downshift your dpi to like 100 or 200 i used to use that all the time for like sniping and stuff that's like kind of what got me into battlefield and playing it more full-time was because with that sniper button i could just quickly stop down get a headshot real quick um obviously with other mice not really having that ability i've gotten much better in skyping in general so i don't need to quickly shoot down a 200 dpi in fact like even doing that kind of threw me off a bit because i wasn't used to that just quick reduction now but it was just funny how i absolutely loved that feature on this mouse the scroll wheel is also a tilting scroll wheel so you had the left and right clicks which i completely forgot about now the mouse itself doesn't have any you know hyper glide feet it's their stock teflon feet so my unit they're probably worn out by now for how long i've used them they're definitely not smooth but you factor in inertia and if you give it a push it'll definitely go a bit so how'd i do right that's all you care about how did i perform with this mouse and it took me about two or three matches before i was fully back into the g502 form you know what i'm saying and i got accused of hacking in battlefield i got reported because i was doing so good i was taking that many names people literally thought i was hacking the game and that's when i started just laughing to myself hysterically like these uh these clowns like i'm hacking and i'm using a g502 right now what are they using it doesn't matter i was like memeing myself in that moment for how ridiculous it was just the fact that i was using this older heavier mouse now and i was getting accused of hacking like come on dude that just goes to show you like i was feeling it those two weeks with this mouse it was interesting but it was fun muscle memory is a wild thing and i acknowledge the trend of lightweight mouse and i also acknowledge it's probably better and it's more of a natural fit because even though in the grand scheme of things 114 grams isn't heavy you know you're not gonna be building muscle off of it it's wild to me that going back to that increased weight really didn't feel too too different once i got back into the swing of gaming for me it's all about the ergonomics and just the design of the mouse for using it for so long felt super comfortable so would i still recommend this mouse on 2021 probably not as your main mouse no but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it who cares about the weight uh the price for this i know the light speed's kind of gone down it's around 120 now which is still kind of expensive for a wireless mouse considering how many mice have come out since that are lighter and kind of better in the end so pretty pricey but the g502 hero which is the wired version of this mouse is only forty dollars that i highly recommend if you're a fan of the ergo shape if you don't like the lightweight mouse trend 40 bucks for a g502 with their hero sensor that's a no-brainer so what's the point of this video one muscle memory is a hell of a thing it doesn't matter what the current weight of your mouse is you use something long enough you're gonna get used to it you're gonna get better at it over time second i've put out a lot of keyboard content lately so i wanted to switch it up and do a mouse video because the mouse market right now very dull very still not a lot of exciting things in the whole lightweight trend we've seen it it's kind of tapered off not a lot of new releases right now third you ever seen a grown man naked so right guys that'll wrap it up for revisiting logitech g502 lightspeed hope you all enjoyed if you did give it a big thumbs up show your
