what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be reviewing the brand-new glorious pc gaming race model d the ergonomic version and the newest release to their Odin product lineup so we had the ambidextrous model ohh now the Model D well check it all out for you guys in case you're interested in picking it up in this review so quick disclaimer do not let your wife or your girlfriend use this mask which she'll never want your d again alright so I'll say about that so like we've seen in the past from glorious they're giving us four different versions for this mouse to pick from we get a matte black and white version and a glossy black and white version as well the difference is one gram of weight at 68 grams from matte 69 grams for glossy with the price model returning as well at $50 format and $60 for glossy then we get it out with on one box you'll pretty much notice that the design language hasn't changed that much either it does relatively look the same with the hexagon cutouts around with the honeycomb shell to you know cut down on that weight I'm still the RGB light strips on both sides RGB scroll wheel the main difference down with the D is the shape there's a joke in there somewhere so I know for me personally just in terms of my grip my hand size I've always preferred an ergonomic gaming mouse because it just feels more natural in the hand so if you're someone who prefers an ambidextrous design you're gonna be more you know partial to the model oh I want to hear your thoughts down below do you prefer Aragon ohmic or you ambi already it's the agronomic organ on ik economic organ I'm the caramel caramel get out of my face and whenever I get these new mice in I'm always kind of going back and forth on whether I do prefer the matte finish or the glossy finish because it is definitely you get more that natural friction on a glossy Mouse just to the material against your skin so I really really like that of course you're not gonna notice that one gram difference so if you want to spend the ten extra bucks to have a glossy Mouse you can I'm still going back and forth I I could never decide which I like better so as I mentioned that before marketed at 68 grams on my scale it comes in just around 69 and 70 again kind of factoring in the front end of the cable there but still very lightweight in terms of actual sighs it's 61 millimeters wide at the front 63 millimeters at its grip with then 67 millimeters at its hips for its widest point it's also 33 millimeters tall at the front 42 millimeters tall at its highest point and comes in at 128 millimeters long in terms of length returning it's a pmw 3360 center from picsArt i've had no issues with it whatsoever it's a trusted sensor by now goes up to 12,000 dpi and default on the actual mass itself we have four dpi settings there's a LED indicator there letting you know which dpi your apps returning is also the omron mechanical switches inside rater 420 million clicks and I'll give you a sound test now of all six buttons so you might have noticed that the forward and backward buttons on the left side are noticeably bigger than we saw on the model oh this is again to complement the ergo grips you're gonna have bigger buttons they're easier to press so what else is new you might be asking the G skates are still on the bottom of the mouse allowing you to have that really buttery smooth glide but they also included the second additional set of wider and bigger feet pretty much so you can kind of extend that area there's a smaller one for the top and a more wide one for the bottom pretty much giving you two larger feet so if you're a fan of you know just real quick and easy flicks and glides this is really gonna help out I for one love it it's a hundred percent version PTFE pretty much making this some of these smoothest feet you can buy or I guess have on a mouse and yet again we have their ascend cable which brings up you know one thing from the previous releases of the model oh I never had any issues but one of the more common complaints are people having issues with their cable and that was because of the way it was packaged so what did they do to fix that well we still have the same cable but now they fix their packaging so instead of it you know getting kinked up and kind of bent in the box during transit and stuff that will kind of loosen the connector inside now as you saw in the intro we have new packaging it's just next to it instead of routed underneath however they still do have online we can go in and buy additional ascended cables and get different colors and stuff if you want to match it to a certain color theme you have for your light ships on your mouse so that's definitely pretty cool the cable still ultra light ultra flexible gives you that you know sort of Wireless kind of feeling to the mouse cuz you really don't notice it although of course you can choose to you know use your own paracord and stuff but yeah more than happy with the stock cable here still a lot better than most sock gaming mice cables out there testing out the G skates on my cloth mouse pad very very nice a smooth glide and obviously of course the same thing with something like my glide 38 from Mad Catz or it's a hybrid rubberized texture with lightweight Mouse the cable and the G skates it is a deadly combo so now is the point where we can talk about you know my experience and the preference and again for me it's ergonomic all the way I love the design to this Mouse it feels really really nice in the hand for that more natural grip that's where the term economic comes from but for me I've been using the Razer Viper ultimate as my main mouse since it released and before that just the regular razor Viper so switching from using an Ambu mass for what three four months at that point to now an Ergo Mouse it took me maybe like I don't know an hour to get used to so as you'll see I was taking some names in battlefield not to toot my own horn but if you're a fan of channel you've been watching for a while you know I have a love-hate relationship with this game but the reason I play it is because of the feedback of certain guns so for example there's a lot of recoil certain guns have more than others depending on the weight of the gun the burst when you're sniping if factors in things like velocity distance bullet drop all that stuff so once my grip physically adjusted to the ergo design and then I mentally kind of adjust it how that would translate to in-game it was honestly it was just game over I had three straight games where I had a plus 30 KD and I know for battlefield that's not that rare honestly but the change to a lighter ergonomic Mouse was definitely noticeable it's not the mouse that makes you better it's how you adjust Kobe now like I mentioned before you do have these stock for dpi settings but you can also go in and choose to download these software although it's not necessary that's how you're gonna change up the dpi and the different presets on the mouse as well as all the RGB lighting it is very you know user-friendly software not too much bells and whistles going on the same layout same format as the previous software for the model oh and stuff so very straightforward you should have no problems adjusting your RGB your dpi pulling rate etc so all in all for the past two weeks I've been using it it's been a great experience I've had no issues with it whatsoever like I mentioned before the one main complaint people had with the original model was the cable disconnecting and how did they remedy that they changed the packaging so that's not an issue anymore I personally had no issues with the model oh you watch my review I loved it and it really shaped the way the gaming mouse industry has kind of you know evolved and move forward over the past few months so now that same Mouse at its core just a different shape instead of a B we're now Ergo and I am all for it especially for just fifty bucks if you want the matte black or white version or an additional $10 at sixty bucks if you want the glossy variant so all in all nothing but positive vibes for the Model D big thumbs up from my book highly highly recommend and guys I'll wrap it up for this video hope you all enjoyed if you want to check it out I'll put a link
