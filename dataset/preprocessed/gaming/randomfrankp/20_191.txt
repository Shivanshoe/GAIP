check it out as well as in-depth mic test and it also includes their wavelink software which will make your gaming and streaming a breeze if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below first up we have kenneth p and i am loving this shot you know it's golden hours you got the sunset just shining in but it still looks nice and like cool with the the white lighting and this is just a killer setup so checking it out for the single monitor he's rocking a 27 inch from msi it's 165 hertz if you hear growling in the background that's my dog angry that there's deer outside they're dear they're allowed to be outside no they're not okay anyways for the peripherals here he's now rocking a ducky one two mini with brown switches inside keeping the lighting nice and white as well with logitech g502 lightspeed wireless mouse definitely a pretty solid combo and for audio on each side of the display hit logitech z623 speakers with those headphones that are hanging down the marshall monitor wireless i love the matching here with like the gold and black accents on the lamp and it just fits in as a headphone hanger perfectly and then over to the pc inside the corsair carbide 275 r case we have a ryzen 5 3600 x cpu with the corsair hydro h150i pro aio 32 gigs of team force delta 2 ram on an msi z570 gaming pro carbon wi-fi motherboard with the gigabyte rtx 2070 super graphics card and this is a super clean build love the all white components here trying to match it to a white and black theme white braided cables white sleeving on the aio very nice stuff so kenneth starting us off right this is what clean and minimal should be just perfect in every regard a beautifully matching wallpaper big old window there natural ambient lighting i love you kenneth wait what now we've got lars and guess what more green more plants more matching wallpaper you know what it is 220 episodes you get me by now he says this is primarily used for music production so not going to be too heavy on gaming but he's got the hardware to do both so for the display it's a single 24 inch from aoc he said it's not really a good panel but it gets the job done i feel you there and then for peripherals going mainly wireless here with the razer atheris mouse and the logitech mx keys keyboard it's called the mx keys and then he also has the arturia keylab 49 essential midi keyboard they're all on a seemingly felt desk pad and then for audio those big old speakers does it tano reveal 802s then in the background chillin on the pegboard his headphones the audio technica ath m50x now powering everything here is gonna be his 2018 razer blade pro it says it's got 144 hertz display so again whether it's you know gaming on here or on his actual monitor it is a pretty powerful laptop it's got an i7 8750h 16 gigs of ram and a gtx 2060 graphics card so for gaming music production whatever use case is gonna be pretty capable this is another setup with tons of ambient lighting two windows right there the plants are gonna thrive but again it's about the aesthetic here it's well kept it's organized and guess what but i'm loving it mcdonald's you better sponsor the next episode next up we've got will and will you admit there might be too much plants here you play on the left and right side are real but i think the iv going up the wall is definitely fake but it still could look pretty cool and guess what it made it on this episode so i guess uh if it's the criteria and i like how it's under you know the stairs so possibly like a loft setup but it does look pretty good so he's got two setups or one setup but you know two monitors with the primary being an lg 38 inch ultra wide and the one on the right side vertically mounted is a prime cables 27 inch 4k gonna be good for browsing or putting up your spotify playlists and then downforce peripherals you got two custom keyboards here love seeing this got the kbd fans 8x mark ii and the kbd fan 67 v2 in both the logitech mx master 3 mouse and logitech g305 now for his pc build they have a nice itx case over on the left side of the desk which is still underneath the stairs so it's gotta be compact this is the nuvello stack case inside's got a ryzen 8700x cpu with the alphacool lt240aio 32 gigs of corsair vengeance lpx ram on an asus strix x570i motherboard an evga gtx 1080 ti founders edition they look so much cooler with the angular's shapes and now they're just flat and ugly but all in all will i'm digging it because the nice you know light wooden desk uh it's brighter so it makes everything else kind of pop and stand out got maybe like the clouds for the wallpapers adding in some of the blue to match your desk pad and you know the custom keyboards and stuff mix it all up plants come up the wall plants behind it i'm expecting spaghetti to pop out now is andrew and damn this is super clean seems straight out of like a magazine and of course got the jordans on display even in the wallpaper he means business so the display here is the asus rog strix it is a 31.5 inch curved gaming monitor 1440p 144 hertz and a pretty good job with it being on a monitor like mounting arm off to the left side but it's hidden and you can barely even tell it looks like it's actually mounted to the wall so great job with that and cable management this thing is spotless for the peripherals going wireless as well yet again with the harpoon rgb wireless mouse from corsair and a daria dk63 wireless mechanical keyboard and that tablet is actually what's powering the entire setup so it's a 2020 microsoft surface book 3 kind of docked up over there that powers it all so real quick before we talk about that more let's talk about the audio because you can see he's got the bang olufsen bo play h9i wireless headphones in orange and that speaker there looking pretty nice is the audio pro add-on t5 but yeah all powered by the surface book 3 it's a 13.3 inch display got a 10th gen i7 1065 g7 cpu 32 gigs of ram a gtx 1650 max q gpu and i'm loving the aesthetic here of course with the shelves and just the design all around to the room big sneaker head but it's just it fits in you know you don't usually see sneaker themes but this works out a hundred percent in some other info before we round this out the desk is the smart desk 2 from autonomous with the noble chairs epic in black and gold loving the plant i think it's like the snake plant the prince this is all banging then lastly we have code name oh 13j1 with a white and green setup so lots of green with rgb light got a zone thriving aquarium here a lizard tank and it's gonna fit in with the theme that's the good thing about plants you mix it into wallpaper get a little green rgb and it all flows so for the single display this is a 24 inch cb2 monitor from acer it's got that propped up on a monitor riser there give it more elevation and i think a fidget spinner is that what i see but down to the peripherals we have the and pro 2 wireless keyboard and actually has a custom coil cable on that to make it non wireless with the hyperx putting keycaps to make the rgb shine through and logitech g305 wireless mouse in white so got the white peripherals green rgb in the keyboard for already on the desktop those speakers are logitech z150 and the headset of choice here is the cooler master mh751 a very underrated gaming headset take my word for it and then as you saw towering in the background but still kind of slim and compact at the same time is the phantax evolve shift case this is a super unique tower i always love seeing them inside that intel i5 7500 with a corsair h60aio got 16 gigs of crucial ballistics ram on an asus strix b250i motherboard and then asus gtx 1060 graphics card then when the lights are off that green is super bright nice and neon even switches up the wallpaper a bit to add more green to it my voice is going this always happens now what's wrong with me i don't got the rona but regardless oh 13j1 i love this stuff desktop itself could be a little bit more tidy but i'm not going to complain my man i see the usb dock next to the headset so maybe if you can maybe like mount that behind it underneath the desk it might clean it up a little bit regardless it's still a nice setup all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 220 of room tour project the
