what's up guys i'm ron burgundy welcome back to episode 219 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup and i wanted to give a special shout out to dan andrews for the two year anniversary of his channel membership so youtube doesn't really talk about it like nearly enough but next the subscribe button there's a join button and you can get like you know a membership to a channel it's pretty much like you know a way to give back to your creators so two years dan andrews congrats man but on this episode of rtp this week we got some killer setups is there anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out well let's start it off okay so first up we have s3lq with a very let's call this like a moody setup it's got some darkness to it overall you know lots of contrast but a little bit of blues to kind of cool it down a bit so i don't know i think moody is a good word for it going with the dual monitor setup with the primary and a vertical off to the left side so for those two displays the primary is an acer 24 inch a 240 hertz panel with a samsung 27 inch 144 hertz as the curved vertical display and a good job spinning the wallpaper so it evenly matches on each so checking out the peripherals we have a gpro wireless mouse and for the keyboard we have a custom here it's an anode 60 got a dz60 pcb a brass plate inside gatter on black ink switches that are lubed lube durock stabilizers with pbt caribbean keycaps and a nice blue uh coiled cable there so definitely a nice looking build definitely like i said before fits in with the blues going on in the setup and for audio his headphones are the audio technica ath m40x off to the right side of the desk there and over to the pc you can kind of see it chilling on the right side it's a phanteks eclipse case we don't have too much info on the specs and not a lot of variety when it comes to the photo submission but we have an intel i9 9900k cpu you can see the aio is from corsair but it's their like og logo so it's definitely a dated model 16 gigs of courser vengeance ram and an msi rtx 2080 ventus v2 gpu so unfortunately just not a lot of other photos to show off here we're pretty much limited to this angle from the right side but it is a nice setup nonetheless if the rgb kind of lamp underneath keeping it nice and like a cool white so it glows and illuminates highlights the wallpaper even more brings out the leds and the pc matches the custom keyboard build so good job keeping everything steady next we have nathan j with the triple display setup going on with the two ultra wide monitors for the primary right in front of them and that massive overhead above this setup digging the layout lots of desk space which is always good then at night time the rgb glowing making everything nice and colorful so as for those two displays they are 34 inch curved ultrawides from viotek and the overhead is a 50 inch toshiba 4k tv not only is there a light strip behind the desk but behind the tv as well to give you some more depth and separation with the color and also you can't really see it here but the wallpaper with like that kind of what constellation if you will that's all animated so it moves looks pretty cool now for the gear and peripherals lots of stuff going on here on the desktop including the elgato stream deck you can see the hyperx quadcast mouse the tc helicon go xlr mini mixer all things gonna be great for streaming as well as the corsair k65 lux rgb keyboard with the corsair iron claw rgb wireless mouse shout out for that really nice mouse pad by the way wink wink nudge nudge and for audio in addition to his desktop speakers logitech z533 he has the astro a50 wireless and the courser hs70 se wireless sitting on the st 100 rgb headset stand so lots of audio options and now we can check out the pc this is the corsair crystal 570x rgb case inside the amd ryzen 5 3600 cpu with the corsair h100i pro rgb aio you got 32 gigs of corsair vengeance pro rgb ram on an asus rog strix b450f gaming motherboard and an msi rtx 2080 ti gaming x trio gpu vertically mounted there being shown off to the world with the tempered glass side panel on the case looking real nice then also you can see next to the setup even more rgb a nice display shelf also illuminating some trinkets gaming gadgets as you can see on there got the gravity gun destiny ghost love seeing stuff like this just gaming all across the board and even though there's no like real dedicated theme or direction i could say you're really wedding because it's just a lot of rgb everywhere it's okay because with the desk space being so large you have enough room for everything and it's all you know it comes together really nicely next we have kathy and you guys know i love this with the plants i'm digging the spanned wallpaper with the moon add some nice contrast lots of black and white as well so that fits in perfectly but yeah the dash of green with otherwise monochrome setup looks really nice and you guys know i like to be some stacked monitors so for the two displays the primary is a 27 inch dell ultra sharp 1440p 144 hertz gonna be great for gaming with the overhead being a dell 27 inch display and also the bezels on both of these monitors are extremely thin and minimal so they do line up really nicely now as for the peripherals you have the corsair gaming k70 rgb low profile keyboard and it doesn't appear to be on because the whole setup i guess is turned off with the rocket mint mouse on the corsair mm-800 rgb polaris mouse pad again it's all turned off with the corsair void pro wireless headset and the corsair st-100 headset stand and logitech z200 speakers and now we get to the point of the voiceover where i'm wondering like are people even listening at this point do you guys just like skip through just look at the photos and move on not even paying attention to what i'm saying either way we'll check out the pc now right the corsair carbide spec omega case again in black and white and the internals here look really nice that sound creepy intel i7 8700k cpu with the difficult captain 360x aio 16 gigs of team t-force nighthawk ram on the asrock z390 xtreme 4 motherboard and the msi gtx 1080 armor gpu custom white back plate the white just glows and looks so clean inside even with the rgb fans in that light ring around the aio what i'm also really digging is right next to that she pretty much has like blackout blinds over that big window there which she uses for a projector for playing some console gaming you know ps4 thrown up on there eliminates all the light and you could still game at a massive screen size so kathy you guys all know i'm 110 digging this set up from the top to the bottom love the black and white look love the ivy coming down the nice moon wallpaper this is what's up probably could have saved it for a clean and minimal edition you know but hey i'm not that patient speaking of patience how about that wait for cyberpunk huntsman how many years keep having to wait with delays either way 31 big ben hitting us with the cyberpunk setup blue and yellow always the underrated color theme three displays at the gaming setup a massive tv rgb custom you know geometric wall prints this is bonkers so for those three displays big ben has a 34 inch acer predator as the primary with 4k 27 inch lg monitors on the outside and by the way before i see comments telling me how i'm wrong 34 inch ultra wides have the same exact vertical height as a 27-inch non-ultra wide display okay so back to the goods again an rgb light strip behind the l-shaped desk ikea desktop ikea alex drawers let's dive into the peripherals for audio we have logitech g560 lightsync speakers on each side contributing even more rgb and then he switches brands because the rest of it is from corsair with the k68 rgb keyboard in blue the corsair knight sword mouse and the corsa mm-800 rgb polaris mouse pad as well as his audio the corsair void elite rgb headset the rgb headset stand makes an appearance for the what third time here and also check out those light sticks those are also apparently from corsair as well i think they're brand new i haven't heard of them but they look pretty cool they're called the lt100 light towers all right definitely fits in though definitely and if you guys are tired of me talking about corsair guess what it continues into the corsair crystal 570x rgb case yet again we have an intel i7 9600k cpu the corsair h100i rgb platinum aio with 32 gigs of core surveillance pro rgb ram and then an evga rtx 2080 graphics card but again the blue and yellow color theme all on the inside with the fans the light strip the ram aio all matching glowing very nicely out the crystal case looks phenomenal and didn't even get to talk about the 65-inch lg 4k oled tv there i know when cyberpunk comes out big ben's gonna be pumped and whether he's playing on the console on the tv or on the pc with the three monitors it's gonna look awesome because this setup is awesome in every regard good stuff man and then last but not least we have borangel with a more simple and scaled back setup but obviously a killer wall mounted pc haven't seen too much of these recently i felt like in every episode for like the first few months of 2020 every setup had a awesome looking wall-mounted pc but it returns here yet again for the single display here is samsung 32 inch ultra wide 144 hertz and then for the peripherals go in all white which looks pretty sleek got the e element z77 rgb keyboard with the corsair m65 rgb elite mouse and the corsair void rgb v1 headset he made sure to clarify that v1 means it was like the first version then he stabs corsair in the back and goes with the white razer headset stand but it has the rgb it has the usb pass through here and again it's gonna fit in more with the theme but let's talk about that awesome wall mounted pc here again i always love seeing these we have an amd ryzen 5 3600 cpu with the quister h100i rgb platinum aio 16 gigs of course of engines rgb pro ram and an asus x570 prime pro motherboard that's why it's white it looks good and the gigabyte rtx 2060 super gpu but man this is a very clean mounting job as well uh whatever sort of plate you use to you know house all the components looks super nice and yeah good job on cable management as well that often gets overlooked but great job with that and i'm digging the blue and white color theme very hard to do but you found the peripherals and it all works out nicely even got a matching white canteen in this episode room tour project is sponsored by the elgato wave 3 a gaming
