what's up guys i'm random frank p and last month we revisited the razer bombslung which was their first gaming mouse and that video did very well and a lot of you in the comments said check out logitech's first mouse for an episode 2 possibly so today we're going to revisit the 21 year old logitech wingman force feedback from 1999 this was their first release in the gaming mouse market i was able to find one brand new on ebay for just 45 dollars in perfect condition box and all so without knowing anything about this mouse prior to the video the thought of this force feedback in the mouse definitely intrigued me from the pictures and on the box itself it looked like a wireless mouse that must have had some sort of battery operated rumble pack inside which you know for 1999 would have been pretty cool but after getting it unboxed this was not what i was expecting the mouse is actually fixed to this plastic mouse pad surface and we have very little room for movement here it's actually tethered right in the middle and we only have this small box area to physically move and control the mouse so very very limiting in fact you only have around 35 millimeters of vertical and horizontal play which is only 1.3 inches imagine only being able to move your mouse one inch in any direction so i thought okay this is nothing like i imagined this is where it should get pretty interesting right so i connected over usb to my pc as you do heard the chime all was good there and it came with a power brick because this needs external power as well plugged that in but the mouse wasn't actually doing anything on my screen there was no led light activity on the top of the indicator is but it was actually connected and it was being recognized because in the actual usb device settings it's labeled there as eub3 so i figured okay maybe i just need to go download the drivers and the software for it to actually work which by the way they do not actively still support on their website which is why we were revisiting the razer mouse from 20 plus years ago i was so impressed because razer still today actively on their website has drivers for all their peripherals this did not but i did find it on some sketch website you know how it goes got it all downloaded booted up and no it was still not being recognized retry nothing did i stop there no so i ran a virtual machine and booted an older windows os when this was still supported installed ran oracle downloaded both windows 97 and windows xp but still no cigar again it was there actively recognized in the usb device settings but zero activity then i got sidetracked and sucked back into the sounds of nostalgia after a few minutes of pinball and troubleshooting and trying to get the actual software that i had on my pc ported over into the oracle vm i figured okay that's it it's a failed video nothing's going to work out here nothing we can do or is there then it occurred to me what about something like rewise that lets peripherals be completely reassigned for gameplay eub3 was again recognized right there so i figured okay let's assign it as a mouse as it is then remap the mouse movements to be a manual input in games acting like a left stick on a gaming controller so now moving up down left and right would be like using it as a giant joystick or the equivalent of wasp since we have three buttons on the mouse itself left middle and right uh they too had no function shocker so i was limited to just the vertical and horizontal movements of 1.3 inches but then i figured okay this is you know better than nothing let's play some cod with this and see how it all works out move my left hand up down left right and that's just how i have to get around in game but what i also didn't think about was all the additional limitations i would now have to just be using one hand for four wise inputs what do i mean well my ring finger can't you know reload my pinky can't toggle sprinting my thumb can't make me jump all those other inputs and functions in game i was now unable to use unless of course i took my hand off the wingman and pressed you know are to reload manually and yeah i also couldn't open doors that was fun so i definitely was feeling the consequences here it was super annoying when i wanted to run around and everyone around me is sprinting yet i'm just still there casually walking the whole time like it's a stroll in the park that means i also can't outrun bullets if someone sees me i can't outrun missile strikes or my own missile strikes this was the least fun i've ever had with my left hand giggity not being able to sprint was definitely a deal breaker but at least i still have my viper ultimate my other hand because all was good over there now at first it was definitely an odd adjustment because you're probably not used to physically moving your hand in the direction you want to go in game while still aiming with the other it's kind of like moving your leg clockwise and drawing a six with that same hand your brain won't let you now now all right so it wasn't that bad all right but it just took a minute to adjust to and it wasn't ideal by any means obviously definitely a bummer i wasn't able to fully use the wingman force to its you know recommended normal potential but i guess that's why there were so many brand new units on ebay 20 years later so it's still cool nonetheless to revisit what logitech was thinking 20 plus years ago when everyone else was putting out you know regular mice they figured hey what about haptic feedback for our first gaming mouse great idea wish it was still supported wish it actually worked i don't know if this was maybe a dud unit that i found on ebay but again it was brand new and it was still recognized but just the the haptics the actual function was not functionable in game or on my pc in general kind of a bummer but yeah again revisiting what logitech was doing in 1999 with the wingman force feedback their first ever gaming mouse if you guys like this video let me know give it a big thumbs up show your support and comment down below what's the next sort of revisiting you want to see like i said before
