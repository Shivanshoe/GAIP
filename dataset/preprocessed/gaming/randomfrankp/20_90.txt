what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 247 of room tour project the series will show off some of the best setups see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it all out gear hardware all that stuff we'll kick it off now 2 47. first today we have rj snaps and i actually found him on instagram hit him up i was like yo i need to show this off because it is really nice and here we are it's dark it's got that moodiness to it you know the wooden accents the plants it checks off all the boxes so rj's rocking two monitors here at the primary being a 34 inch samsung ultra wide then off to the right side in the vertical orientation is an lg 24 inch and it is a 144hz display in complementing his wooden desk he has his monitors propped up on a monitor stand from grovemade checking out some of the peripherals his keyboard is a kikron k2 with logitech mx master mouse he's also using a delta hub carpio wrist rest which we showed off on coolsec 150 a while back so always good to see them in the wild things like the wool desk mat and his leather and wooden wrist wrasse is also from grove made the delta hub one is the wrist stress for the mouse and in the background you can kind of see the speakers there's the logitech z623 now checking out the pc i'm not 100 sure if it's like a pre-made or knox i'm not too familiar with lenovo this is the lenovo legion case so again it very well may be a dedicated case could be a pre-built i don't know but he said it's not really used for gaming and stuff primarily for photo editing and photography and stuff like that so inside is an intel i7 10700 cpu with the cooler master hyper 212 evo cooler it's the blackout edition 32 gigs of corser vengeance rgb pro ram and nvidia gtx 1660 super for the gpu but in terms of just visuals and stuff it's definitely a nice looking build but also gotta say you got to take note to the fact that he has it over on the left side of his desk and it's over on its own shelf so the fact that it's separated but still on display and the cable management to route it to the desk very very good job pulled off nicely but again it's a nice and moody up all together love setups like this the nice shelves the stuff on display really good stuff rj and i'll drop his insta down below if you want to check it out now we've got thomas whenever i see the name thomas i think back to this one time i was out of some restaurant i don't know we were waiting you know in the lobby when there's a line and there's this lady yelling at her kid and she kept going thomas thomas thomas and now whenever i see the name thomas it gets stuck in my head and that was easily 10 years ago so this could be you if so look at you now but let's also look at the four monitors in all that screen real estate hot damn lots of pixels his primary is a 49 inch samsung g9 odyssey so 49 inches 240 hertz here the top overhead is a samsung 43-inch 4k tv and both of these side monitors are a 27-inch acer display now there's a lot of gear and peripherals going along with this setup so just some things real quick the elgato stream deck you can see the logitech g560 lightsync speakers uh for the main peripherals look at the razer huntsman elite keyboard the eraser basilisk ultimate wireless mouse is charging asus extended mouse pad and also for audio we got a nice stack here with the magni and moddy powering his headphones the bear dynamic 1990 pro and yes for all the 10 year olds out there the company's name is actually s-c-h-i-i-t now you may have been eyeing it but we gotta check out this pc this is the limited edition inwin d frame case and it just looks crazy i know it's everyone's cup of tea but i don't know it's it's doing something it's getting the juices flowing so inside there's an intel i9 9900k cpu on the asus maximus hero 11 motherboard got 64 gigs with g-scale trident z rgb ram and msi rtx 2080 ti trio but the great hard line job the color matching coolant to the frame itself this is just a thing of beauty and as i always say credit where credits do because with all those screens everything going on it shows the gear and hardware very good job of cable management got the ikea signal there to keep them up off the ground nice and tidy so while the monitors and all the screen real estate is absolutely crazy i'm still blown away by that custom pc and i know i'm not allowed to give advice on this series without another fan base their pants and crying however my bit of advice would be just to take those foam panels down behind the two monitors because that like off color blue and stuff it's just not doing much visually and literally in the sense that it's not gonna be absorbing anything up there yeah i would just take those down next we got tristan big racing fan you can't tell already check it out the steering wheel the pedals the the print off to the left side but more importantly a really nice triple monitor setup here that lines up perfectly and is pretty much made to be like a racing sim racing rig racing sim i don't know same thing right but speaking the same thing all three of those monitors are the same aoc 24 and a half inch model so they just line up perfectly that's the benefit of buying multiple the same one and they're all kept up nicely on one monitor arm so you can't really see it because it's hidden behind the center of the racing wheel there in the middle but yeah that's a good job of keeping them all propped up and he has a ton a ton of gear to power this racing rig stuff from thrustmaster we're talking pedals shifters different wheels all a bunch of different accessories tell you right now i don't know a thing about it i wish i did i want one of those crazy like five axis rigs where it's like puts you in the car but it's in your living room kind of thing i want it but i don't need it you know what i'm talking about so for his actual peripherals on the desktop we have an everglide sk87 keyboard and they actually custom lubed his cherry mx clear switches and you also filmed them as well and the mouse is the razer mambo tournament edition now you saw before with the wide shot he had those crazy speakers on each side of his desktop there were the bowers and wilkins 68 5s1 bookshelf speakers apparently and this pair of headphones here is the hi-fi man sundara very nice now taking a look at this dark looking pc got a got a squint to see it inside the intel i7 6700k cpu cooled by the be quiet dark rock pro 4 cooler got 16 gigs of core serve engines lpx ram on an asus z170 pro gaming motherboard and a gainward gtx 1070 instead of be quiet pure base 500 case you can see it nicely tucked there in the bottom right shelf of the desk but i've never heard of gainword it's a graphics card company i've been doing this show a while there's always new companies popping up but definitely a nice and clean setup here from tristan uh very organized and again going all out with the racing theme you gotta love when a setup dedicates itself entirely to a theme like that just makes it more cohesive and stuff in the end maybe look for a themed desktop wallpaper to span across all three as well now we've got andres and i'm loving the warm tones here a nice and cozy setup giving you the warm vibes and you can see underneath the wooden desktop in between the alex drawers it's actually the frame for the legs this is the smart desk 2 and it's a sit stand desk so he has it all laid out where he can elevate it use a standing desk and then bring it back down sit get some gaming done productivity all that stuff both the options and nothing's getting crushed in the process trust the process so for his display going the solo route with a dell u3417w so a really nice ultra sharp 34 inch ultra wide it's always funny cause i feel like when i was growing up dell was kind of like looked down upon because they were just like more like a cheaper brand but now they've really redeemed themselves and they make some killer monitors nowadays checking out some of the gear we have some audio engine a5 plus speakers in the black looks really nice here you can see hanging up on the microphone arm logitech g733 headset and for his main peripherals have a custom keyboard here from sm keyboards unfortunately no info provided on what switches he's using but that's okay he's also using that with a kikron wooden wrist rest and then his mouse is the razer viper ultimate with yet again the delta hub carpio wrist rest now this pc is damn nice this is the story of a girl it's the antec p120 crystal case i just literally almost fell on my chair so my audio levels were wonky that's why and i'm not going to redo that take but inside an intel 10 980 xe cpu with an nzxt z73 aio got 64 gigs of xpg ram on an asus rog strix x299e gaming 2 motherboard an evga rtx 3080 ftw3 my life is just reading letters and numbers like does anybody even understand what i just said it doesn't matter because this is a really nice looking build really clean as well and again even the internals of the pc are matching the rest of the setup still nice and warm so andres i had to redo this take like five times accidentally called you anders it's andres really really loving this really good job man and then lastly we got victor g party people know the name vic with a g if it's all the same to me i feel like i've made that joke on here before i don't worry about it he's hitting us with the ultra wide lens here for the two monitor setup and i do like how the setups like nicely tucked away in the little corner of the rooms you can see you kick back a little bit and it's a nice and little you know like a cozy sort of gaming nook so checking out his monitors his main display is a 27-inch acer predator it's 1440p 144 hertz g-sync all that good stuff and the secondary monitor is a 27-inch benq ford's peripherals with the steelseries apex pro with the glorious model o mouse and also not really picture it here but for his audio got the corsair virtuoso rgb gunmetal se headset on the corsair st 1000 rgb headset stand then over to the pcs the phantax eclipse p500a rgb case in white and inside the intel i7 8700k cpu lots of intel this episode is usually the complete opposite with the asus rng ryu 240 millimeter aio it's got 32 gigs of g skill trident z neo series ram is it the neo ram specifically for amd ryzen does it matter is there not a compatibility issue i don't know but he's got it that's on the asus rg strix z390f gaming motherboard and an asustrix he wrote 1090. he wrote 1090 ti i assume he means 1080 ti is he trying to like pull a quick one on me like i wouldn't notice doesn't exist there's no 1090 ti so victor with amd ram and an intel cpu in a made-up graphics card but either way it's a nice looking cat all right it's like 2am i'm going to bed all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 247 of room tour
