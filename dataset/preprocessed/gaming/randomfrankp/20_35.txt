[Music] all right what's up guys i'm random frank p and in today's video we're gonna be taking a look at the key cult i purchased from wish yeah the contents of this box are up in the air let's just put it that way so a few weeks ago i was gonna do like a random just like keyboard video from wish and i saw a listing for key cult number one and i was like oh this is gonna be fantastic because these are like easily a few thousand dollars aftermarket typically between 2200 to 2500 this was just under 90 bucks yeah it was even on sale an extra nine cents off whoopty do wish so this is gonna be as mysterious for you as it is for me without wasting any more time let's dive right into this cutting through the paper i hope you're ready because i'm not all right uh first up definitely just sort of a a giveaway let's just put it that way with all the uh possibly japanese or chinese newspaper here in the front uh from what i know about key cults they're in the us so all this probably not a good sign all right oh oh whoa whoa whoa hold on hold on this is heavy this is a heavy box like i need to weigh this real quick all right this is like solid for sure this is an eight pound box i don't know if you could even there up up it's going down a little bit seven seven pounds 15 ounces so this is either a very solid and well made or it's like a cement block both options are on the table all right we got the sides all taped up which way is up because they have multiple things of tape on here guess right here we'll cut on the bottom oh my god i'm so ready to be disappointed i'm so ready what how much tape did they i guess i needed to secure this thing with the weight huh again from what i know about key cults this is not their standard packaging a uh nasty little cardboard box like this with multiple layers of tape okay the mystery still continues because now we have this oh this beat up box we have a keyboard cover a little carrying case for our mystery keyboard so probably not a cement block unless that's still in here maybe two bricks here we go here we go here we oh it's on the top it's on the top oh okay this is not what i was expecting it's definitely not a key cult i can tell just by the first look but oh my god this thing is super heavy what the hell is this random 87 dollar wish keyboard okay let me just put this over here it says abco core is that the name of the the case i don't know okay so again with the key cool number one and i believe the number two as well um with this uh 10 keyless layout you know the tkl uh the thing about this from what i've seen and i'm not 100 sure this is the case but all of the key cults that i've seen that are tkl are win keyless so they have that sort of like blocker here this is not that there's little led indicators over here as well which key cult uh does not have but the materials in this it's insane how solid this is uh looking like a knockoff what is that um gmk moto like a knockoff gmk moto set on here possibly so what's gonna give this away a hundred percent as if i don't already know that this is uh fake is the back side that very s just great looking key cult butt nice key called booty oh we got a label let's see what is it i should have looked that was the first thing i should have looked at ab abco core abco core ar 87. i got to look that up so i guess the name on here is also the name of this keyboard so not a key cults do they just think that like a very sturdy and solid all aluminum keyboard that weighs over seven pounds is just a key cult is that what they think oh my god this thing is a monster okay so i don't know what switches are in here because it didn't say on the listing they're light they're linear and they're kind of scratchy uh odds are it's either like otemu or like a cherry switch let's let's see we're gonna we're gonna dive into this today we're gonna take a look what we got in here um i hope it's hot swap again just the first thing about this is like obviously when i saw the listing you know i didn't assume it to be a real key cult but i also didn't think i was getting a fully completed keyboard like this i thought it was gonna be just like you know possibly uh a case you know like the the frame and the plate and all that stuff i didn't think it was gonna have switches and these knock off keycaps and yeah these are cherry silent reds which explain that slight scratch not satisfying in the slightest okay app core abco core ar 87 we got to look this up right now is this even a thing well it like weird i i see the google link for it that brings me to amazon and then it doesn't come up and i was just gonna check my invoice and stuff from wish but it just brings me to that straight listing and when i try to search for it again it's it's not there of course okay here we go we're on amazon now whatever it didn't work the first time bummer currently unavailable i would love to know the price of this we're going to look this up in a minute uh once i go on my pc because then i can see the price history wow this again i i don't know what to expect with this because i knew it wasn't a key cult but i didn't think it was going to be this monster of an aluminum keyboard all right we've got rgb strips on the side let's plug this in real quick as after i put these keycaps back on okay so it does include a standard you know sort of braided usbc cable i just threw it off the desk uh we do have a nice definitely embedded a good waze in there you can probably see where the uh port is all right let me go get that i just threw it all right we'll try that again and i see the side glow there's some side glow coming over here uh but no actual back lighting so again you can see it here glowing on the sides which would probably look pretty cool at night interesting interesting stuff again the the switches aren't too too bad but i really hope this is hot swap because that way i could take out these silent red switches from cherry and put in something much nicer that would complement this insanely thick boy body don't don't quote me on that don't clip it all right but let's open it up those those screws are deep deep in there let's um unplug this while we can real quick all right got one of these little extenders i don't even know if that's gonna fit down yeah because this base here it it won't go down because it stops it damn it how are we gonna open this this is gonna require some uh some thought hold on before i before we dive into that let me just do the the thing i should have done from the beginning and just try to pry one of these out that'll give us a pretty quick you know indicator for this whether this is hot swap or not and i do not think it is because this guy is not budging yeah unfortunately this does not seem to be hot swap damn it it's the entire length of our bite it doesn't fit either what the hell can i use [Music] doesn't have the right bit but all it has to do is turn the screw i think this isn't working either i think i'm just stripping the screw ah this is the closest thing we've had so far okay final attempt at this guy it's it's lengthy enough it's skinny enough just will it let me get in and turn the screw to one loosen it i can't tell i have no idea is this working [Music] oh my god i think it is two hours later i don't know if you saw that if i picked it up but the screw flew into my sleeve okay we finally did it so this is the top plate super aluminum um interesting interesting does this whoop stuff just fell out what were those some of the mounting posts literally how do i get underneath i'm gonna have to take the top yep okay okay this is quite the mystery i gotta gotta say i'm impressed kind of disappointed but impressed because the mystery behind this abco core keyboard has got me intrigued [Music] okay was that all of them yes all right so traymount what are these little things that fell out there there's some sort of standoff posts but i can't see where they came from interesting so we do have a piece of you know eva foam here very very thin looking like possibly um either one millimeter or a point five millimeter little strip here to act as that dampener inside and yes unfortunately we do have a fully soldered keyboard this might be worth in the future if you guys are interested enough to completely desolder and put some new switches in because just the it is insane to me how solid this is i've checked out a lot of keyboards this at seven over seven pounds like it's just crazy to me crazy so uh that's that you can see here on the side where the sort of acrylic strip is or whatever probably not acrylic but we have that there because underneath on the pcb there is one two three four five six seven eight eight rgb lights embedded on the side of the pcb which is what throws it then out on the sides of the board underneath man i wish stupid cherry switches all right i want to head back to the pc and do a little more digging about this because i need to know a price how much did we overpay for this even though it feels pretty damn solid i gotta know i gotta know all right so i found it on amazon here's the thing like i said before it's currently unavailable however when you look at the price history chart with this plug-in that i use called keepa this was apparently 175 i paid would i say 86 87 on wish i don't know who the joke's on here is the joke on me or is the joke on whoever sold this for almost half the price is that the joke on wish i paid pretty much 100 less than what it's been being sold for it's been out for 178 days and uh looks like it retailed in yeah it started back in october of 2019 for 260 dollars so this thing probably didn't sell too well but i'm just confused all right so it's funny to me that the value for this is over double of what i paid for it um again that's on amazon though and it's not currently available so who knows what the real value of this is but man i'm just very confused and very upset because i hate cherry switches we're gonna do a sound test it's not that i hate cherry switches but just they're they're molding over the years they've just become so scratchy and they're they were once the king and now they are the peasant you know what i mean sorry cherry silent red cherry switch sound test for you guys let's do it you all right so yeah as you heard it's just not satisfying it's it's weird how scratchy these have gotten over the years and i wish i could have picked i wish they had you know some sort of listing of other switches but i mean like they wouldn't i'm sure they're not selling two of these on a wish but i definitely would not have had the option or would not have picked this if it was an option man that's why i was kind of hoping it was just like the frame and stuff so i could build it instead we got cherry silent red switches and again what i assume is a knock off of moto gmk moto unless it's like trying to be something else i don't know it looks nice you know visually it's a nice looking keyboard pretty clean overall very solid and hefty and thick as we've noted multiple times but yeah like i said i don't know who the joke's on here is the joke on me or is the joke on the seller on wish because they sold this thing for way under the latest amazon price um yeah more or less story don't buy from wish i don't even know if i can return this i don't even know if i want to return this that's the thing this keyboard messed my day up because i knew it wasn't a key cult i was so interested to see i was hoping it was just some like piece of plastic crappy five dollar keyboard but instead it gave me something more something that now i'm intrigued by and i kind of want to mod a bit further even though it wasn't the easiest thing to take this apart and get it opened and it's not going to be easy to desolder and spend all the time into a you know invest all the time into a wish keyboard i wish it was better i wish it was a key cult boom that should be the title of this no i gotta i don't know i'll figure it out what a video if you're still here i'm sorry but this is just not what i expected it's not a key cult and it's not a crappy wish knockoff it's a knockoff but i don't know guys that'll wrap it up if you like this video if you thought it was funny if you do want to see me mod this let me know drop a comment and leave a big thumbs up does well i'll know you guys like this you want to see more on this abaco core uh appco ar 87 so yeah if you liked it you want to see more give this video
