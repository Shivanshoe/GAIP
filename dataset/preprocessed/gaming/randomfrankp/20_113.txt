what's up guys i'm random frank p and this video is gonna be crucial for more than half you out there why you ask well here on youtube back in november i ran a poll asking how many of you plug your headphones and your microphone into your front io and 50 said you do now before we get into the meat and potatoes of this video which is five gaming amp and dax that will just instantly improve your audio let's talk about why that front i o is bad for your headphone microphone jack and just real simple it could cause interference a higher noise floor that dual static sound that's constantly in the background that's because when you plug it into the front i o the cable connecting it to your motherboard is routed through your pc and as a result could be picking up high frequency radio interference caused by other components in your build worsening the quality and even the quality of the cables used for that front i o could be contributing factor so how do you avoid it by avoiding that all together and i should also note a lot of this interference is going to be a lot more noticeable if your headset plugs with the mic input into your front i o you can get much much better mic quality plugging into the back of your motherboard or the subject of today's videos and amp and dac and it's funny because in a lot of my headset reviews people will claim that i'm faking the mic test because if they buy it they'll say that my mic sounds a lot clearer versus when they buy it and i'd be willing to bet more than anything they're the ones plugging directly into the front i o all right amps and dax today we've got five different ones to go over the ones that i've used for a while like i said i started this video back in november either sennheiser gsx 1000 steel series game deck the [ __ ] full of three astro mix amp pro tr and the sound blaster x g6 now with the majority of my audience being gamers out there these are targeted and marketed as gaming amp and dax which is why i picked them yes there are thousands of other amp and dac's out there that aren't gaming necessarily but gaming epidex get you some extra features like eqs side tone for monitoring your mic and also maybe more importantly is more juice not only is it going to make your audio sound better but amp and dax have more power to them to fully drive those headphones to their utmost potential things like that or why i feel like gamers would find this stuff most appealing and each of these five are very different in their own way they all have their own feature sets different stuff like that uh but they're also some of the top five out there that are highly rated so when i was you know doing a quick search these were very very highly sought after and i figured you know i'd pick them up and do a little round up for you guys tell you about each of them and why you would want to benefit from this okay so for each of them i'm not going to go over every single detail because we'd be here for three hours but more so a general feature roundup and in no particular order we're just going to start off with the sennheiser gsx 1000 because technically it is the more advanced it has the most features to it and price wise i saw on amazon fluctuating between 150 and 200 so definitely the more pricey option here but again you get what you pay for plus some so in terms of physical features i like how it's nice and compact the sort of square design here not gonna take up too much space in your desktop and the entire face of it is an oled screen and a volume dial the ring is nice and smooth you can make your adjustments there right on the fly in terms of inputs and outputs it's all on the back side so when it's on your desktop you won't have any cables you know running across your actual desk it all gets routed out the back i think overall the gs x1000 does float that line of looking like a gaming amp and dac but also kind of keeping it you know on the more minimal side because in reality there's not too many buttons now since the screen itself is touchscreen that's where you can go in and control everything you can do things like change between different eqs like the music mode story mode or in esports gaming mode you have reverb control for you know open world games or more controlled confined spaces different side tone level adjustments different surround sound positioning even a button to direct the audio from your headphones to your speakers if you have them plugged into this as well so a lot of adjustment here it will take some time to really dial it in and see what fits your preferred sound signature in sound settings the best but when you do find those sound settings that you like you'll see on each corner of the top of the amp and dac are these little red lines those are actual touch sensitive buttons which you can save to be four different presets or profiles so you can have four different profiles all saved right to those little touch sensitive buttons additionally on the right side there is a button for adjusting your microphone which is always nice to have that additional volume control now for each one i'll kind of explain its sound signature but i want you to keep in mind that everyone's going to sound different to every person so for the control i'm going to be using my drop in sennheiser pc3x headset and the sound signature of these is also going to reflect differently on each amp and dac and also my interpretation of audio so that's completely subjective so keep that in mind your headset your headphones whatever you're using may sound a bit different because all the sound signatures and interpretation is going to be different so right away for me gaming on the gsx 1000 everything just sound very accurate rich and i guess they gave a slightly warm boost all across the board um now like i said there's a bunch of different sound settings and eq's you can go in to toggle and mix up depending on what game you're playing for me i really found the story setting on the stereo audio sound best because it combines the bass from the music setting and the enhanced treble from the gaming setting so story sounds really really good but yes definitely a warmer richer tone to this so for the surround sound setting like i said i mainly keep this on stock stereo audio but sennheiser does surround sound right they appropriately open the sound stage it doesn't worsen the quality at all so well at the end of the day it is still emulated they're definitely one of the leaders in the field they do it right it sounds good but i still think the story mode on stereo sounds best getting this fully set up is kind of tricky i definitely recommend reading the manual that comes with it because even if you are using headphones with this you want this to be in your sound settings to be set as default as the speaker output took me a while to figure that out i thought i had to return this now let's talk the steelseries game deck this little guy just like the gsx 1000 is the only two here to actually have a screen so you can visually see your settings you can control your sound settings your actual chat settings you can see the sample rate in real time also the left and right channel real time for your audio so you can see that going that's like a nice little visualizer before as small as this is it's got a lot built in there are some settings inside you can go through and toggle between you have things like adjusting the level of side tone the amount of gain this has even your mic settings you can all adjust that in here and also some settings to kind of like tie into other steel series headsets and stuff like illumination but if you're not using obviously one of their arctis headsets you won't have to worry about that but what's also great about this is just that again on the fly adjustment go in change the sound settings in terms of eqs we have a few built in on here but you can also make your own custom one to really fine tune that eq adjustment to your music movies gaming anything so we'll say stock out of the box the sound signature for this is very balanced and neutral it doesn't do anything really to elevate your headphones however with the built-in eqs and just you know adjusting it on the fly that's where you can go in and kind of change it up i like smiley and bass boost the best for gaming uh so i like how you do have that on the fly eq adjustment but just very neutral out of the box they do have a smaller button which toggles their surround sound because on the back side you do have an optical port if you want to really get the most out of your surround sound in this case though it's not the best i would definitely recommend sticking to the stereo sound setting i have a feeling it's because you know unless you're not using an arctis headset it's not going to sound that great the surround sound is probably more tuned to those drivers in their arctis headset so i would keep it off stick stereo so in terms of price their game deck is often sold and bundled with some of their wireless headsets but you can buy it separately which i did for 130. next is the ship full of three yes you can laugh at the name all you want but [ __ ] knows their [ __ ] they are great when it comes to audio gear and for only 99 bucks this one on here is the more budget-friendly option it's the cheapest one on this list and man it packs a punch and keeps it all simple as you can see you just have the simple volume dial on the top of it if your mic and headphones split jack in the front but man for it being such a tiny compact device this thing sounds really really good i'm very impressed with the sound quality and this is still marketed as a gaming amp and dac but unlike some of the other ones that we're talking about today this does not have those extra features like side tone there's no side tone to this there's no surround sound there's no different eqs there's no software so it does keep it very simple in that regard so honestly not 100 sure why it is marketed as a gaming amp and dac but hey it's highly rated i'm a huge fan of it so it's gonna make the list so the full of three for sound signature is going to give you an elevation all across the board it's definitely gonna boost your audio levels so these are gonna be a lot louder so you can you know adjust that on the fly thankfully but yes elevated louder much more lively and rich the sound stage widened as well uh they got some magic going on in the full of three but uh the number one term i think with this would be lively another cool thing you can do is with the output on the back side there's an additional micro usb slot and you can use that to plug in like a power bank for example and power this without hooking it up to your pc you can use that with like your phone or something so for just a hundred dollars [ __ ] is definitely the [ __ ] you will not regret this at all now we have the astro mix amp pro tr and i actually checked this out two years ago when i checked out their newer a40 headset this came bundled along with it but just like steelseries they do sell this separately and you can pick up the mixxam pro by itself for 130. not only is it an amp and dac but it's a pretty versatile mixer as well from the left side you have that massive volume knob for controlling your your gain pretty much for your headphones but then on the right side you can toggle between your game and your voice chat that's going to be helpful not only to you but also if you're a streamer because one of the things with this is on the back side in addition to all the other ports you have this little stream jack this lets you use a 3.5 millimeter jack to plug from this to your pc and then to directly have a separate stream channel so if you're streaming in like obs or something those audio levels that you have set on the device is directly what the viewers will hear so that's definitely pretty cool this one also has a switch to toggle between the ps4 and your pc so you can use this on console you also have four built-in eqs with this you can toggle between i kept it at stock for most of my testing with this and there is software you can go in and customize those and save them onto here but it's not needed only if you want to customize the eqs then on the front you have your combo 3 pull jack so note if your headset of splits out into a separate headphone jack in a microphone jack you're gonna have to get a connector to plug it into here if that's the case though most headphones do come with one so the big thing for me with the astro mix amp tr pro is uh warmth astro is definitely known for having a more warmer sound signature and that was just immediate right out of the gate everything gets a warmer boost to it um so if you have you know a very sparkly lively pair of headphones or a headset this will add that warmth to it a bit of a bass boost as well this was all on the stock eq settings i didn't go into the software and adjust anything or alter anything and save it to here and again with the built-in eqs on here you can toggle between them but this was just for the stock settings now the mix amp pro does also have a button to toggle their dolby surround sound setting and this you're going to want to use the optical cable to get the most out of that but honestly it just does not sound that good to me i'm not a fan of it this could also be a situation just like i said before with the steelseries one where it's more so tuned and made for their own astro headphones and stuff so it could sound better with that but i just have never really liked it i would definitely recommend sticking to the stereo sound setting on here but yes in terms of just you know the physical buttons and dials and stuff uh very very helpful for gamers and streamers then lastly we have the creative sound blaster x g6 and this very simple to get up and running again like the others no software is required so it's plug and play uh but if you do want to go in and customize eqs you do have that option but it is not required in terms of physical buttons there's only four so it's pretty simple you have the volume knob right on that front side there which is in between the headphone jack and the microphone jack but then on the right side you have three separate buttons one is for toggling their scout mode which is an eq you have the sbx which is their own creative surround sound setting and then a game dial from low to highs if you want to kind of boost it a little bit and get more volume out of these you want to put the gain to high you also have additional ports in the back for your optical line in and line out but really for it being so slim and compact one thing i like about this with the particular shape and size is the fact you can just kind of mount this underneath your desk you can keep it out of the way but still have it there at an arm's reach and still adjust the volume with the dial so the g6 sound signature definitely favors lower end frequencies this gives you a pretty big bass boost which depending on what game you're playing could be good it could be you know bad but to kind of you know counteract that they have the scout mode on the side which definitely gives you then a treble increase for hearing like footsteps and stuff like that and then the spx which is their surround sound also sounds pretty good it is one of the better sounding emulated surround sounds um out there on the market uh but yeah bass heavy for the g6 this one a bit too pricey i think for what it is uh it comes in at 140. all right now we're gonna head back to the pc and do a microphone test so you could hear how each of amp and dax do and perform in terms of their microphone quality and like the sound signature of each they're each can have different mic qualities as well so you can hear how they each sound okay so now for the mic test portion this is going to be the control i'm going to use this headset for all the amp and dax this is the drop in sennheiser pc3a which is one of my favorite headsets out there uh sounds great and as you can hear from the microphone very good as well which is very hard to come by when it comes to you know a gaming headset now take note this is not plugged in to my front i o obviously this is plugged into the back of my motherboard you can hear how this sounds just baseline the mic itself with none of the you know the work behind the scenes from the amp and back so again to say general mic test you could hear how this sounds without the amp and deck okay first up is going to be the sennheiser gsx 1000 and as you could hear right now versus the stock microphone this is notably not as good what they're doing is there's a lot of compression going on it does a pretty good job overall eliminating a lot of that background noise and stuff which is why the overall voice quality gets compressed but strangely enough they cap the microphone to 16 bit 16 000 hertz in your sound setting so it's not going to be as good as a stock mic so it's as great as it is as an amp and dac for all the eq features and stuff the one area um it's a bit of a miss at is with compressing and suppressing the overall quality of the mic next up with the sound blaster x g6 and unlike the previous gsx 1000 we just demoed this lets you go up to 32 bit 48 000 hertz for the microphone quality so you can hear it's probably um a lot better than that just sounded uh still a fair bit of compression going on that's going to be a common theme with these amp and dax a lot of compression in an attempt to eliminate any background noise so you're not picking that up during your streaming or your tournaments or whatever that they think you're going to be going to using these things but yes overall really not too bad though next we have the [ __ ] full of three and this is a naturally louder amplifier in here for the microphone and i have it in my pc sound settings down to 30 volume and just checking my settings right now we're nearly peaking so it does amplify your voice a bit and there still is a good amount of compression going on but from what i've heard and everything so far it does i think one of the better jobs at maintaining that fullness in your voice without really compressing the overall quality so i think just for what the [ __ ] full of three is doing here uh definitely one of the better ones in terms of you know your mic quality not getting too distorted next we have these astro mix amp pro tr and as you can see we have the combo jack into the front because this does not have a separate headphone jack and a microphone jack input uh just the three pole in the front here and um overall really not too too bad one thing i can notice though is a significant roll-off so as some of my words start to you know taper off and get below a certain decibel again with compression it starts to cut that out more aggressively um now granted i'm not using their own astro headphones where this would probably benefit from you know in terms of having that same technology and made for this particular amp and dac but really it's not too too bad and then lastly we have the steel series game deck now this is sold separately as its own unit but i i'm using this from a combo that i have that is sold with their headset so you may have to pick up this little converter cable i have here which uses a proprietary like headphone cable that they use to this combo jack for the headphone and microphone input so keep that in mind that 100 sure you may have to pick this up separately and this one by far has the most aggressive compression going on and in the actual sound settings on the amp and dac itself i have the mic level set to six which is where it's probably going to be safest because at seven it was peaking with anything i said so here uh still a bit loud but it's not peaking and blowing out the audio but definitely the most aggressive in terms of compression and um really capping the overall quality i'd say there was a quick sort of future roundup before we end this um again i didn't go over every single thing about each one because this video will be very very long but what's great is they're all plug and play none of them need software it's not required but with the mixam pro tr and the g6 you can download software to customize the eqs for the sample rate the g6 definitely has the biggest advantage here boasting a 32-bit 384 kilohertz rating which just demolishes the sample rate of something like the mixim pro tr then strictly back like i said before with the follow three we don't have surround sound we don't have side tone we don't have eqs so with this you will miss out on those gaming features so while the real advantage of using a separate amp and dac is to get that extra boost out of your audio after the impedance comes in so depending on your headphones that you're using you really shouldn't have any issues pushing those drivers the mix am pro again is pretty limited there all right at the end of the day like i said in the beginning i picked the top five more common gaming amp and dax out there that were very highly rated now each one of these obviously has their own super feature set different sound signature and stuff like that but my quick rundown of each is going to be this best bang for the buck no doubt the full of three for 99 why you don't necessarily have those gaming features like side tone eq stuff like that and some of the other ones do have for the price the sound quality at this is just outstanding now on the other spectrum if you want to pay significantly more double at close to 200 the gsx 1000 that has all the bells and whistles all the eqs tons of customization surround sound that's actually usable and that's where this is going to come into play but again it's very very pricey but i think you're getting a lot more than what you're paying for in the end considering how flexible this is and then for that middle ground there um each of these three now are going to be separate for this streamer who games and streams constantly the mix amp pro is clutch for the two different volume knobs adjustment on the ply for game chat your your audio the different outputs and stuff for console the separate stream output for controlling those adjustments on the fly daisy chaining all this stuff is crazy for the mix hand pro definitely then you have the game deck which i think is also very good in its own regard a lot more compact which i like on the fly adjustments with eqs and customizing all that stuff but you will pick up the separate adapter i'm pretty sure it doesn't come with this unless you buy it separately not 100 sure but for the price also very good then lastly the blaster x g6 which is a really good portable amp and dac as you can see nice and tiny compact you can mount it on your desk like i did and have that flexibility here not too complex in terms of the actual physical features and adjustments but it's just right it was my first gaming amp and dac believe it was the g5 back in 2015 i got it so that's why i did include this one as it is but yes for those starting out you know for the price also not too bad and uh that should be a pretty good wrap up for you guys so again do not ever use your front i o for audio you'll be completely missing out on the overall potential quality of that headset or a microphone or whatever you're using in the end so if you want to check them out i'll have all five listed for you in the description down below as well as a link to one of my favorite headsets out there crazy good quality for the price the drop in sennheiser pc38x it'll all be listed for you in the description down below guys i'll wrap it up for five gaming amp and dax that will instantly improve your gaming audio hope
