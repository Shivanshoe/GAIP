what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with another episode of cool tech under $50 for May the series where you show off some of the best tech you can find under that price point to give you some cool gadget ideas if you're on a budget she's anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out now first up is a pretty cool find this is called the tiny scope this is a macro microscopic lens and it's pretty much like an attachable utility lens it's not permanent or anything but it'll give you a really unique way to get some cool photos and especially during this time if you have some young ones around the house during the quarantine this would be a cool way for them to kind of pass the time keep them occupied so the microscopic lens just attaches to your phone lens and once it's all lined up to not have that ability to get some crazy macro shots just to show you some quick things that I grabbed around the house this first one with these green pores is of a basil leaf next we have a sheet of aluminum some printer paper and then this peacock looking stuff is actually just blue construction paper fungi looking thing is actually faux leather got RGB pixels on my monitor what you see behind me then in the app using their digital magnification this is just the the wing of a B and then zooming in more you can see I still little I don't know like sensory hairs maybe on the wing it's just crazy how close in detail you can now get with this and then this next one it looks all scratchy and stuff but it's actually what's known as velour so these very soft ear pads you put on headphones looks all scratchy up close I think it's a pretty cool pick up like I said it's giving you now the option to get some pretty unique photos this comes in at just under $40 next we have the fantex evolved sound mini and yes these are looking just like their fan taxi volved x case that i have they're essentially a replica with the name being sound many there are many speakers that look just like one of the nicest cases out there so if you're a fan sex owner and you have this case these are probably gonna fit in with your setup pretty good and you can connect these to whatever source he wants they include both a three and a half inch jack for your phone or your pc or whatever plus a USB cable if you want to just plug them into your source that way now what I really like about them is actually built in they have the same exact digital RGB lighting that you have built into the case so again you can get the whole you know the aesthetic of your setup to be flowing in unison they come in this black color you have that mesh grille in the front and on the side of one of them you have the controls for switching up the lighting the volume and stuff like that as well and they are tiny they're not gonna blow you away by any means as you can see by the size but for you know a cheap pair of desktop speakers that could fit in with your setup look really cool they're gonna be more than fine they're definitely passable and even if you just have like a laptop set up you don't want to take up too much room these will fit in perfectly on each side and you'll be good to go these come in at just $30 which is definitely a good price point and a really good idea from fan tax coming up next is another useful desktop gadget which is always useful and that is a headphone hanger with built-in Qi charging so you kid knock two birds out with one stone hang your headphones on there and use it as a phone dock to wirelessly charge your phone these epic gadgets always do really really well in the series so I love finding more than show off for you guys as you can see on the bottom of the bass it does have some RGB lighting there's a button on the back to control whether you want like a static color or the rainbow wave and stuff like that so you can slightly switch it up then on the back of the hanger up top you have an extra little space to wrap the cable if you want to kind of wrap it up and keep it organized so it's not getting tangled and stuff definitely a useful pick up now the overall construction of this won't blow you away it is primarily plastic but it gets the job done a two-in-one gadget like I said and this is just at $35 next up is something useful that if you're into keyboards and you're looking to possibly upgrade or build your own you might not know exists and that is this key switch tester from novel keys this 112 switches in total and what it lets you do is pick from 106 different switches on their website to see the different type of switches out there you might just be familiar with blues reds and browns but there are literally thousands of different switches available and through novel keys you can pick up the twelve switch tester and pick from 106 individual ones again why is this useful to really branch out test different switches if you're looking to you know buy a new keyboard or build your own like I said you don't want to spend a hundred bucks on switches you've never tried before this gives you that flexibility in that option to try numerous different ones to see which you like the which switch is best for you that's why I really like these you want to try some box Jade's Inc switches creamed switches novel Keys got you covered the switch tester itself is made of acrylic and it comes with those see-through novel keys key caps you could actually you know put them on and hear how it would sound with regular key caps on them as opposed to just testing the switch and it's just a great way to branch out try new switches for only $20 and then last month I know you guys really like that RGB phone fan this month we had the HyperX charge play clutch which is a grip for your phones when you're gaming also has a built-in Qi charger too not losing battery with a detachable battery pack this thing as the name says is clutch pun intended so it's pretty self-explanatory for what you could use this for if you're big into mobile gaming you're always playing you know games on your phone and you want just a better grip this has got you and with the built-in Qi charger it has 3000 milliamp hours built in so while your gaming it'll charge your phone or it'll keep it from the battery depleting but the fact the actual battery is removable is pretty cool because say you just don't want that extra weight on the back you just want to use the grip you can easily take it off when it expands odds are it'll fit your phone as you can see here it's fitting my iPhone 11 pro max so your phone should be covered the grip itself has this nice Merril texture to it and since the Qi charging is just right in the middle the second you put this on your phone it'll start charging for you so I'm a big fan of this and on their website it retails for 60 bucks but when I tried it out I like this so much I reached out to them and I got a way to save you guys some money if you use code frank at checkout it'll save you guys $10 off so it's 50 to fit this series you know I do what I got to do to save you guys some money but yeah better wrap it up
