what's up guys in episode 203 back with random Frank P of room tour project can't do it can't do it what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 203 of RT p the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some inspirations and ideas for your own setup yes that was intended to rhyme but this week the fan favorite clean and minimal edition see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll start it off now episode 203 first up we have Jerome and right off the bat I am loving the aesthetic here with the all wooden desk and the colors he has going on like the paint color it's dark but it's not you know too dark it kind of looks like a midnight paint kind of color where it's not like you know a dark grey sort of looks blue in the right lighting but here all together it looks really nice dig in that shelving unit he has on top of the IKEA desktop as well so this single monitor here is the Acer predator X 34 and move it on down to the peripherals the mouse is the Logitech G 902 fou H HBK it's the hot swap kit here with xylan 78 grams switches inside loving the blankie caps the accented Escape key and shout-out to the flip spacebar gang and then for audio didn't see much information on these speakers but the headphones they're on the Shelf of the Philips Fidelio x2 now over to the PC you guys know I love these small ITX cases here this is the low-key ghost s1 inside the AMD rise and 3700 X CPU with an actor with a hl9 X 65 cooler got 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix sport Ram on an msi be 450 i gaming + motherboard in the EVGA GTX 1080 graphics card and what I also like in the other side of the room in front of this nice window he has a secondary setup as you can see not gonna really focus on this just giving you an extra look that uh it's got the kind of dual setups going on here and they both look really nice so starting off the episode strong and I think the big takeaway for me at least is just the colors here for this setup it's not you know it's not gonna pop immediately but the dark wall just a really nice contrast to wooden desk highlighted by some of the copper or bronze tones in the setup as well you don't see it too often but I really dig it here next we have Anthony with the all white and wooden setup here mainly white peripherals and hardware then the wooden desk and the wooden board mounted above the setup where those Nana leaf Aurora light panels are and I've said it a lot so it's probably redundant at this point but a wallpaper can make or break a setup so I like the fact that here he has you know the trees and stuff was just gonna go along nicely to the actual plant he has so for the actual important stuff his a 34 inch samsung ultra wide as the primary display or only display I should say and it appears to be wall-mounted so checking out the peripherals on that nice novel Keys hexagon mousepad he has his custom keyboard which is a custom Alice layout it's all acrylic and he has retooled lube MX black switches here with the Logitech MX master 2's Mouse and obviously a white controller if it wants to use that as a secondary peripheral but the color way all the matching here at the custom keyboard looks super nice poor audio he's rocking the Sennheiser HD 700 pounds therefore the speaker's you see in the back that are on stands on each side of the monitor well a Fender r30 bluetooth speakers then for the PC inside the NZXT h 500 i case is an Intel i7 9700 KF CPU with a deep cool Castle 240 RGB a IO got 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance RGB program on the ASUS Maximus X 390 motherboard and the gigabyte or SRX 20/80 extreme graphics card I like matching the RAM to the white braided cables and stuff again just to make though the white accents of the PC pop a little bit more but all together Anthony really digging the clean appearance you have the green kind of accented in the wallpaper the plant and the mainly for light panels as well so any color in an all-white setup like this is gonna stand out a bit now we've got emergency magazine which also looks like something you would see in a magazine with the just the greens in those plants popping out at you I don't know if they're faker they're real but those things are living and we gotta just you know take note right now I really liked you know these stacked monitor orientation and here we kind of have that with a primary one eye level then the secondary one kind of like you know at chin level looking down a bit reference monitor we'll call it the primary is an AOC 32-inch and that secondary wanted a Samsung 24-inch monitor as you could see here he just has like games and stuff there for the peripherals that's an icky kmg 9 keyboard in the Zowie FK 1 plus Mouse those crazy-looking speakers are the quadrille Argentum 430 and a little not pictured he has the HD 680 Evo headphones from super luxe now over to the PC another small ITX build this is the cooling satellite plus case inside here is an i-5 7600 K CPU with an msi gtx 1070 TI armor graphics card that's all we really have for specs a lot of times with ITX builds like this and there's no side panel the internals and the visuals and the internals aren't up most importance so they don't really submit photos on the inside if that's okay with me but still in the show is this damn crazy entertainment space for kicking back lounging and enjoying that crazy 65 inch OLED TV I never heard of it but it's the crun big OLED 9990 fine arts TV I just want to kick back here and just watch everything this looks super chill and super comfy over here man so there's no doubt in terms of design emergency Magazine knows what's up I'm just digging all around the white wall at the black sound panels they're kind of making those stripes to go along with the wallpaper it's all just 100% good next up from Virtua we have the stacked monitor orientation and I'm loving the warm lighting we get from that bulb here on the right side definitely going against the cool lighting coming from the window on the left side of the setup and together it meets right in the middle for the monitors so the primary display on the bottom is a 27-inch BenQ with a 27-inch asus monitor up top and it's flipped so the chin is up top creating a more seamless bezel there in the and for the peripheral to the eraser BlackWidow chroma X keyboard but keeping them lights all white and then we had logitech g502 Mouse man I haven't used my g502 since like September and looking at it it makes me miss all the good old times we had virtuals making good use of those IKEA peg boards that are very very popular now and also very stylish in a way because behind the monitors he has those mounted which you can use to then mount his headphones they're nice and conveniently or headset sorry this is the Razer Kraken 7.1 and then another small form-factor ITX case this one is so small could fit behind that primary monitor underneath it's the damn case a for inside the risin 730 700 X CPU with the Noctua l9 I chrome acts cooler we got 16 geeks from g.skill Triton z RGB neo ram on the gigabyte OS X 570 I Pro Wi-Fi motherboard in the graphics card is the nvidia RT x 2070 super founders edition and you guys saw this is a super super clean build for it being so small and compact now what I also like is he has this sort of secondary workspace off to the right side of the setup where you can use to get some work done so writing just unwind and relax and it's separate from the actual desk set up because he doesn't have to really you know get it all cluttered up and stuff with his own separate area so I like how he has this huge desk but kind of broken up with two separate spots but man virtual digging it all around I'm just very partial and it the stacked monitors is something that I always really dig seeing and here at the span wallpaper and the nice mix of colors you have going on it's pulled off beautifully and then last but not least we have Luca Merc and something about this episode it is just filled from start to finish with killer minimal setups I'm loving loving this in the corner of seemingly a living room store it's a living space a big window right there for all this natural lighting I love it so his primary monitor is an Asus 34 inch ultra why the PG 34 8 Q with the vertical one on the right side being an Asus 24 inch but also 144 Hertz those are both on one monitor arm so he could have them you know not taking up too much space but then mounted in those different orientations like he has down to the peripherals his keyboard it's a vortex poker 3 all-white key caps with the wooden wrist rest as well to go along with the Logitech G 500 and you might have seen in the previous shot his headphones are the Sennheiser HD $5.99 with a mod mic 5 to have an active like a gaming headset the PC here this is the ever so lovely fan tax and to evolve case inside we have an Intel i7 4790k CPU with dark rock pro 3 CPU cooler can't really make out the RAM or the motherboard here but then we have the Asus GTX 1080 Ti Strix graphics card so slightly limited in terms of specs but it still looks really nice with the orange and blue theme inside and for another look in that living room space really just clean and organized here with a little table there the the sofa and stuff this just seems like a really really awesome apartment whether it's like a like a studio apartment or just just this is just a living room I don't know regardless it is really really nice it sounds stupid but look at this thing this is so clean alright guys I'll wrap it up for episode 203 of room tour project I hope you all enjoyed don't forget so anything you like I'll
