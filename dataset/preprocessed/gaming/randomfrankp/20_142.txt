what's up guys i'm random frank p back with an episode of cool tech under 25 for december the series we show off some of the best tech you can buy under that price point and don't worry we still have cool tech under 50 dropping tomorrow as well as our top 10 cool tech for all of 2020 still to come so today just 25 bucks to give you some more affordable gift and gadget ideas to not only ask for maybe but for you to pick up for someone else you know some other gifting ideas you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and speaking of which i think first up for just eight dollars is a really good stocking stuffer and it's a good gift really if you pick this up for anybody it is a microfiber cloth and screen sort of spray cleaner all in one so you give it a spritz and you clean it down with the microfiber cloth surrounding the entire tube the idea here is definitely pretty simple self-explanatory you look at your screen right now it's probably gross right fingerprints oils smudges and yeah you can just wipe it on your shirt that's not gonna like clean it really with this you have the cleaning solution all in one you spray it on you use that cloth coating then wipe it down wipe it clean and what's great is the tube actually comes out of the container so if this ever runs out you can always just fill it up put it back in and reuse it so you know you're touching you're using it you're you're doing face smacks on it so you can see right there the imprint of my fat smushed nose right against the screen got my lips a little bit of cheeks and forehead you don't want that on your screen spray it down wipe it off and you're good to go so just like eight or nine dollars definitely a good pickup not only for yourself just to have but i think a great gift for someone else like i said stocking stuffer a gift for colleagues friends anything next up is something that i've been using and absolutely love it it's this three-in-one moft-x sort of phone stand grip and wallet so as you can see right here this flap folds out so it can be like a grip while you're using it it's magnetic so you can fold it down have it be like a phone stand but also in here you could fit some cards for like your credit card your id anything fit it all in here in the back of your phone these moth deck stands come in a few different colors i have it here in the navy i saw like a dark green a dark red a charcoal color i believe they have them in different sizes as well for like laptops and ipads and stuff this one just for my iphone i think for 20 it's definitely a useful gadget i'm always keeping a lookout for these like multi-use sort of things so this here three in one definitely useful and it's simple it's self-explanatory that's the point of this gift list and i've never been a pop socket kind of guy because it always just sticks out too far in the back you can feel that in your pocket so this nice and thin and discreet doesn't stick out too far at all keeps that slim thin profile which i definitely like but i think what really sold it for me like i showed you is having that card slot on the back just great for if you want to run out without your wallet throw your id in here your credit card a gift card insurance anything like that i have two in here you can probably fit another one but yeah this comes in at 20 bucks and i think it's definitely a cool pickup next we have the turtle beach battle buds these are pretty much you know ear buds for gaming whether you want to plug these into your xbox controller your ps5 controller use this with your switch mobile pc pretty much anything what i like about these is that they're just simple earbuds if you just want to play quick round or something chat to your friends you don't gotta wear a headset but these have an actual microphone attached to them as well i don't know about you but i haven't seen too many earbuds that have a full out microphone attachment it does come with a few different silicone ear tips to fit your ear size and they each have the hooks on the earbuds as well to fit better inside your ear and you know they sound decent i'm not going to lie they sound okay but now switching over to the embedded mic test and as you hear it actually sounds pretty damn good i don't know how they pulled this off but i was really really surprised how good this mic sounds and i'll be honest with you guys i buy a lot of tech for this cool tech series and a lot of times things are junk i'll toss them to the side i didn't have a lot of expectations for these i'm being very honest about that so i picked them up they sound decent like i said if you want to play a few rounds with your friends you don't want to worry about having a headset on even just take one out have one earbud in chat with your friends it'll get the job done but this microphone it sounds really really good what i also like is the in-line controls you have it so you can control the volume you can mute your mic and then also on the back is a button for taking calls if you have this plugged into your phone so i picked these up for 20 dollars a few weeks ago and it does unfortunately seem like they bumped it up to 30 but i would definitely keep an eye on them because i have seen these at 20 in the past before so hopefully the price will drop for you again soon but yeah just for that price definitely a good pickup you heard that microphone that's some good stuff okay next up like i said in the beginning uh maybe some you know gift ideas for family members maybe your grandparents because this is a pretty interesting phone magnifier so as you saw you have this 12 and a half inch sort of magnification screen you prep your phone in the back here but what's also pretty cool is this all just rolls up and collapses into itself for a nice slim discreet sort of store away product and you know grandparents have probably trouble seeing their phone i'd assume so if you want to pick this up to play games on there and have a bigger screen also you watching netflix youtube anything like that and plus it's always the thought that counts so if you buy this for your grandparents i'm sure they'll appreciate it and they'll probably use it they come in a few different colors and finishes this is just like that walnut veneer here but it's just super simple you literally just roll up that panel it's magnetic so it'll stay in place pull up the magnification screen there's a little wood that will sort of pop out and then sit in the lip so the screen pops up then you just put your phone in the back and then now the screen magnifier will just pretty much project your image on a larger 12 and a half inch screen there obviously you're gonna have some distortion with your screen i promise you it's not as bad as it looks on camera because i have all my studio lights so it's reflecting and absorbing a lot of that into the screen itself but like i said for watching youtube netflix playing games it'll definitely get the job done and i'm sure your grandparents could appreciate this and having them not strain their eyes seeing a tiny screen anymore this was like 13 and then lastly is something that i like to use that's these outlinks qr stickers you can put these on whatever you want and then with your phone you can use them to catalog categorize pretty much anything you want so for me i know this is very you know particular to my case i use these with all of my pc builds so i'll put a little sticker on the back inside the app it's like a really useful whiteboard pretty much for each of these stickers you just point your phone at it and it'll automatically either bring you to that specific page or sticker if you have it in the app already but for all the pcs i built on the channel it's a great way to really manage where a lot of the stock is and pretty much find out what hardware is in a certain build so for example if i want to reuse something like the western digital black nvme i can do a quick search it'll show me where that is what pc was built in the app is really user friendly to use like i said you literally just point the camera at one of these stickers and it'll automatically bring you to it so for ten dollars what's the point in me showing off these stickers right well it might be a good gift idea for your dad is what i was thinking so for ten dollars you know different amounts you can buy different sizes and i'm sure your dad has a lot of stuff in the garage right maybe in the shed a bunch of boxes of different things tools storage all that stuff with these stickers he can organize it you know catalog it document it and then instead of sorting through certain things trying to find where something is with these qr stickers it'll show you in the app what is what where is where definitely pretty useful and like i said i use these with my pcs but we also use these with our christmas decorations and our seasonal decorations so we can see which box is which what is in each box instead of having to manually just dig through and look for something pretty simple 10 qr stickers a cool little gift idea and guys that'll wrap it up for cool tech under 25 for december hope you enjoyed like i said i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below in case
