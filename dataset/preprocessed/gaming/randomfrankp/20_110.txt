what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 242 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup and this week a clean and minimal edition last time we did one of these it got like no views what the hell i thought you guys like these either way see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check out all the gear and hardware but we'll kick it off now 2 42 right after this this video is sponsored by asus and the rog falchion wireless 65 mechanical keyboard featuring some really cool additions like a matching keyboard cover and dust tray to keep it protected a touch sensitive side panel on the left side of the keyboard for volume control media playback it's all completely programmable offering of cherry switches and boasts a 450 hour battery life if you're in the market for a new 65 wireless mechanical keyboard they got you covered i have a link for you in the description down below first up today we have chong l and this one is just the definition of clean and minimal i mean take a look at that desktop there's pretty much just the essentials going on yeah a few extra cables you can see dangling around but that's okay you know i mean if anything at least they're white so it matches the desk and the wall so it kind of blends in so for his display that mammoth is an lg 38 inch ultra wide monitor super sleek love the way it looks and a great complimentary wallpaper as well and as you can see here hanging off the side of the desk is his headphones the sony 1000xm3 for the rest of his peripherals in the logitech g915 tkl with logitech g305 on the razer pro glide so all wireless peripherals here then checking out his pc he has the nzxd h510 elite in white off to the right side of the desk with a ryzen 9 5900x cpu cooled by the nzxt kraken x63 aio an msi b550a pro motherboard 32 gigs of g-skilled trident z rgb ram and nvidia rtx 3060 ti founders edition how in the world did you find one of those then a little peeky poo underneath the desk you can see he has all the cables and power bricks and stuff mounted up top and one of the little cable gutters there doing all the work pretty much for that cable management remember out of sight out of mind so all together chong as i said before with just the essentials here for the setup i would recommend you know spicing up the room a little bit adding just something else because it does seem pretty bare right now um i don't know if you moved in recently if you got plans upgrade the room a bit but something else around the room i think bring this up together a little bit more you know tie it together nicely and if you can find a way to mask those two white cables coming down from your monitor so it's all just a seamless setup i think it it do some wonders now we've got dylan with a really nice all-white setup and a bit of a toppo theme i believe i spot yep that's uh that's what's up it's weird because it's topographic but people say toppo uh so you know topo sure checking it out his monitor here is a gigabyte m27q it's a really nice 1440p 170 hertz gaming monitor black and white topo wallpaper as well and that is mounted on a arm as you can see off to the right side that bracket coming down to the desk so it does give it a more you know floating seamless appearance right underneath the monitor also it being white obviously helps mask it into some of the speakers on each side we have the bose companion 20 and yes that toppo desk pad there is the random frank p naval keys um these were in stock recently i hope they still are the black ones sold out but this light gray one might be it'll be down below then for the peripherals the main peripherals here we have a kbd fans low aluminum profile case so a nice custom built white key caps white braided cable even the white leds inside to make it really shine and glow nicely and the mouse here is the ponage ultra custom their ergo edition tell you what it's a pretty nice peripheral setup then in the back you can see his [ __ ] stack with the [ __ ] moddy 3 dak and the [ __ ] magni 3 amp and they are powering his mash up at sennheiser hd 6x for the headphones and then of course still going along with the theme one of my favorite cases out there from fractal it's their meshify c case in all white inside the ryzen 5 3600 cpu on an asrock steel legend x570 motherboard got 16 gigs of corsair vengeance pro rgb ram and a sapphire nitro plus rx 5700 xt gpu and i'm really liking the white and black hardware inside you know matching everything uh white braided cables definitely looks clean so really good stuff dylan not any rgb here we're literally just white leds all across the board fitting in with the theme perfectly oh yeah and i always get questions about the chairs and desks and people set ups but i can only read what specs i'm given you know sometimes they provide it sometimes they don't so in this case i do have some specs for the chairs and desk it'll be dropped down below with everything else now we've got elysian composure and this one is you know slightly a bit more on the busier side but i still think it fits that clean and minimal vibe to me because it's my show and i tell you what's clean and what's minimal and what's not no but this one's cozy and i think cozy kind of fits in with the setup theme as it is if you disagree i'll just delete my channel so checking it out i'm loving the vibes here lots of really nice colors going on all blends nicely lots of like trees and plants around the room as well and at night time not only is the setup outlined in rgb but so is the bed right next to the setup as well but in the daytime you want more you know natural light in give those plants that well-needed energy no rgb but still looking really nice and gives it a more natural look all across the room so checking it out for display he's rocking an acer predator x34p it's her 100 hertz ultrawide monitor really digging whatever that mountain graphic is that he has mounted above the monitor and even those geometric and angular lines in the wallpaper itself just naturally you know leads your eyes more towards the setup so good job matching that visually and he sneakily has this on an arm bracket as well because you can see right behind that right speaker is where the bracket comes down onto the desk so another good job at hiding that we're three for three then down to his peripherals he has a royal clutch rk 68 wireless keyboard and the mouse is the logitech mx master three in addition to his apple ipad pro it's their 12.9 inch model and these speakers in the back are the eclipse pro media 2.1 then also hanging off on the side of the desk for his gaming headset the razer black shark v2 definitely a good choice now this entire setup is random powered from this laptop you can see here sitting on the shelf and i don't have a name or a model of the laptop at all just some pretty impressive sounding specs here including a 17.3 inch 4k display an i9 9900k cpu 48 gigs of ram and an rtx 2080 all jam-packed into this laptop wish you would uh tell us what the name is buddy i'm not calling you a liar i just need to know you're a truther but man just take a look at this shot and this just you know wraps up this room perfectly because it's just super cozy earthy love the blues and the oranges mixing together nicely all the plants around gotta give it to your elysian composer this one is really really nice next up is matthew this one gives me like a really productive vibe you know like i sit down here i don't know if it's all like the bright lighting and stuff or the white but i feel like i sit down here i mean business my work is getting done checking out some of the gear and hardware that single monitor is a dell ultra sharp 24 inches and this setup is also powered by a laptop you can see over there on the left side which is an asus 15 inch slate gray notebook don't really know the specs unfortunately i do wish i knew more about the room because it does seem sort of cramped like a lot of these shots here are all pretty you know narrow and closed in um so if he is working with a smaller room it's really good to see that this compact really setup here has a lot of good stuff going on so he's doing a lot with the limited space he may have again i'm not 100 sure check out his peripherals uh they are a yankee ykm tendency keyboard and mouse combo not too sure about that exactly but it could be you know a product that's pretty popular overseas then mounted behind the setup in the monitor he has the ikea scotus pegboard very very popular great for organization got some pictures and stuff up there also adds a lot i think visually to the room in the setup so for actual setup gear and hardware that pretty much does it for this one again wish matthew gave us like a wide shot of the room so we can see what he's working with here uh before your productivity desk setup like this definitely looks real nice now we're gonna toss it over to mike and he's gonna tell you all about his 2021 desk setup what's up my friends mike again glad to have you guys back i'm super excited to share with you guys the key changes that i made to this space that works for my knees as a full-time content creator on youtube and instagram for the monitor i've been using a 34-inch ultra wide monitor by benq this is specifically designed for digital content creators it has a lot of useful color profiles and it comes with a super adjustable stand and a built-in kvm switch this allows me to switch between different computers without needing to unplug my mouse keyboard and speakers which is super useful anyways i love the ultra wide screen it's like having two screens in one it's also super useful using three windows as well when i'm researching scripting or editing videos moving along the next thing that i added was this desk shelf this is one of the most important additions to my desk the wall at top gives it a very natural and warm look to the desk and really elevates my entire setup as for a function the shelf can act as a speaker stand keeping my speakers at a higher level close to my ears i can leave my ipad on it so it's like a ipad stand as well and it also has a lot of compartments for storage on the right hand side there's a sliding tray that houses all my essentials i can also hide the keyboard underneath the shelf so that i can free up more space for other uses so using this shelf is great because i can access a lot of things at arm's reach and on the other side my mac mini is also hidden well underneath the shelf so it hides all the cables and wired mess behind it and moving on to peripherals i'm still using the same logitech g502 for gaming and the ergo mx for video editing the new upgrade here will be the keyboard i'm using the logitech wireless mechanical keyboard or the blue clicky switches and man typing on this is so satisfying because it's more clicking than clacking sounds the keyboard's wireless connection has been great with my mac mini and since my ipad is usually right in front of me as well i love how i can easily switch the typing on my ipad just by connecting it through the bluetooth mode on the keyboard as for speakers i'm using the iloud micro i use this for video editing a lot and the sound is super accurate for me to monitor my audio levels it's also got a lot of settings on the back to fine-tune the sound and they even have a built-in kickstand to get it to the perfect angle and since getting these speakers i don't really use headphones for editing videos but when i don't want to disturb my wife sleeping in the other room i've been using the dropped pandas and they're definitely the best sounding wireless headphones that i've tested so far right now i'm using the herman miller embody chair it's really good for your back if you like sitting in a more reclined position and it also gives you a lot of flexibility in how you sit you can move around in it you can stretch and you can sit cross-legged in it because of its flexible back rest and soft foam seat besides the ergonomics i just love how incredible this chair looks the fancy design with the black and blue color schemes really matches my setup it also makes the entire space look more like a battle station so sometimes when i'm sitting in it i feel like i'm in the pilot seat of a gundam as for my computer i'm still using my mac mini setup with the sing egpu and external storage and that's it for now guys thank you so much for watching and i'll see you in the very next video bye all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 242 of room
