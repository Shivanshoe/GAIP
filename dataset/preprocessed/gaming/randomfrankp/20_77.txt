what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 25196 minus 24 945 of room tour project the series will show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup 251 episode 251 if you see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now numbers math room tour project first up we have drew f with an absolutely insane star wars man cave here an entirely star wars themed office that is just mind-blowing literally every single thing in this setup is pretty much star wars themed and there's a lot unpack here but first just for his primary setup he's using two dell 27-inch 4k displays the s 2721 qs model and as far as peripherals on the desktop go in all logitech with their craft keyboard logitech mx master 3 mouse even the speakers the mx sound 2.0 so a nice looking setup for sure you know very simplified got the echo show 8 underneath the monitors for like a smart device but what i want to focus on is everything else and i don't mean to have to come off rude by any means you know it's a nice setup for sure it's powered by a macbook pro but it's obvious the room itself is what's definitely crazier i mean these are like super nice looking replica helmets lightsabers everywhere numerous ones stacked up on the wall mounted you see that death star you see all the rgb going on that just looks like you're in the actual movie is this the office of george lucas is drew your alter ego this is a set this is a star wars set but feast your eyes on that crazy contraption right in front of you mounted on that wall um i don't know what it is at first i thought it was this just absolutely insane looking wall mounted pc that would have been the greatest wall mounted pc to ever exist in the entire world but it's not because he said his setup is just powered by the macbook pro and i reached out to him for you know clarification or for more pictures of whatever this crazy wall contraption is and i didn't hear back from unfortunately so damn it drew i mean george lucas you got to think of the people we want to know more you know it's diy whatever it is it's probably made to resemble some sort of like mainframe motherboard of a ship i don't know but you can see there's like actual components inside that's why i thought it was a pc i thought it was like a like i thought i saw a fan for a cooler or a graphics card but it's not so damage drew you are teasing us all on this sunday morning i'm editing this earlier obviously but everybody right now on sunday morning is confused and envious and jealous because we want more drew feed us them details now we've got brad t don't call him bratty but i'm really feeling the vibes of this setup this setup looks like it would belong to like one of my good friends back home like it's just that same vibe that i feel familiar with if that makes sense probably not because you don't know my friends but anyways brad's got two dell monitors yet again these that were 1440p 165 hertz panels got the tetra shape set up with another monitor light bar uh pretty much replacing a desk lamp which i am seeing all the time lately and i am 100 behind it ford's peripherals you have the glorious gym mk pro with one of their glorious coil cables durak l2 switches inside and the logitech g pro wireless mouse to go along with logitech g pro x headset and you can see underneath the pc underneath the desk there he also has the pc panel mini um great for you know controlling audio remappable so you can probably you know control the headset right through there if you want but now into the actual pc the nzxt h510 case i just read his email like five times and uh brad did not tell me his cpu uh but he told us everything else like his nzxt kraken x53 aio with 16 gauge reduce kill trident's the rgb ram on an msi b550a pro motherboard and evga rtx 3070 but no news on the cpu well brad other than that i like everything else i'm liking the plants i like the frame i like the nice you know monochrome contrast with the black and white frames the matching prints and stuff it's all together like i said before just very earthy calm chill really digging the vibes on this one not digging the emission of the cpu kind of through wrenching my plans but that's okay it's a nice setup you'll get a pass now we've got womp sack don't call him um swamp ass i don't know that did not work out his name is womp sack no further jokes and i'm loving the colors here from the pinks purples and blues definitely gives you that gamer setup vibe you know got the massive nana leaf roar light panels on display right behind the setup and loving the wall art and the wallpaper choices here so forest two displays they are both an lg ultra wide 34 inches he's got them both on a dual monitor arm so his primary is right in front of him with the left monitor being you know more so off to the side would like to see that gap closed a little bit and for its peripherals here's the corsair k57 rgb keyboard it's their wireless version with the corsair harpoon rgb wireless mouse for audio in the back you can see the creative pebble v2 speakers and also he has the corsair void rgb elite wireless headset now over to the pc we have the corsair spec omega rgb case it has an intel i9 108 50k cpu i gotta admit until having five numbers following a letter and a number to begin with just doesn't roll off the tongue but man at least womp sack made this pc look nice for his coolers got the corsair iq h159i elite capellix cooler 32 gigs of course of engines rgb pro ram an msi mpg z490 gaming edge motherboard and an evga rtx 3060 xc gaming gpu so he's spanning those pinks purples and blues from his setup into the pc nice and matching even has a little like gundam decal on the cooler itself all stuff i can appreciate a nice matching setup you know with rgb especially a lot of it plus you throw in the nano leaf or light panels things can get messy and messy quick but here it flows nicely it's nice and tamed and well executed next is andy c with a really nice and clean pretty much all walnut setup here love the the richness and the dark wooden color this has again like i said before you add the plants into it and you get those earthy tones for a single display is going with a 24 inch from aoc 1080p but 144hz you can see he does have it mounted on a bracket off to the right side there but it's still using a monitor riser pretty much just extra storage on the desk to you know put things underneath make it nice and clean behind the monitor you also have some gobi light bars adds a little extra splash of color then downforce peripherals has an ergodox ez keyboard these are really nice i reviewed this a long time ago actually if you want to dig back into the archive also it's a logitech g903 mouse and these are both on a grovemap felt desk pad and also on that monitor riser with the bose companion 2 series speakers in addition to that for his headset he has the cooler master mh6710 also on a walnut riser or walnut stand but now we get to check out that pc this is the 4md t1 case nice and compact always love a nice small form factor pc inside is an amd ryzen 5 5600 cpu with an ek 120 millimeter aio 16 gigs of g skill aegis ram whenever i see the word aegis like that always looks wrong it's like a bad insult from the 90s yo mama so fast she got the aegis [Music] [Applause] and we got the gigabyte b550i aorus pro ax motherboard and an asrock rx 5500 xt gpu and then behind the setup is his partner setup so we got a two for here he said she's pretty much you know powering this with our macbook pro uh still you know nice and organized very clean still fitting the theme of the office i can definitely dig it you know this definitely gives you those productivity vibes work from home you gotta make it nice this one checks off all those boxes and speaking of which another work from home setup here from hard drive that like i just said is checking off all those boxes this thing is gorgeous there's so many different layers to the setup that i love it's just again rustic but still earthy and clean and minimal and emphasis on earthy again because you'll see why in a minute but first off taking a look at his desk setup going with two dell 24 inch monitors side by side and you know this might sound stupid but this might be the first episode where every single submission where they had two or more monitors had the same exact model usually people like to mix and match models but here everyone had the same you love to see it and now you're probably noticing there's a third display above the setup because that is the frame from samsung because in other photos it looked like gorgeous artwork above it that's the whole point that's what samsung's trying to do with the frame tv but as you can see it's a 55 inch tv now down to its peripherals he has the kikron k4 v2 keyboard with logitech mx master 3 mouse using the delta hub carbio wrist rest for the mouse also for audio we have the audio engine a2 plus speakers and the blackout blue yeti microphone now over to the pc got the nzxt h510 case again in black of course inside color matching orange to match you know the the leaves and the autumn themed wallpaper and unfortunately he kind of pulled a brad on us by not giving us the exact sort of info for the specs but we uh all we know is there's an intel i7 we know there is a corsair vengeance rgb program so not too sure on the specifics of those also say cooler master liquid cooler he wrote not too sure the model but we do know we have a gigabyte b550m auris elite motherboard and the galax gtx 1660 super gpu but right now i'm not concerned about the pc because my eyes are drooling yes you heard me uh my eyes were drooling over the gorgeous display of aquariums and terrariums in that moss masterpiece everything he has going on in this room is immaculate usually people submit photos of their aquariums and stuff unless it's like you know directly related to their setup i kind of ignore it but this you can't it's gorgeous it brings literally so much life and fresh air into the room and not only is it a cool place you know get some gaming done get some work done but now it's the cool place to just hang out chill and literally relax this is
