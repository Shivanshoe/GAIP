new optical switches a multifunctional dial new keycap font finally a standard bottom row and lubed and improved stabilizers corsair has been listening what's up guys i'm random frank p and today's video is all about the brand new flagship release the k100 optical rgb mechanical keyboard this is the follow up from the very popular 2017 release of the k95 platinum but then they bumped it up five points to the k100 so of course they are finally delivering with their own lineup of optical mechanical switches there's a lot to go over here lots of new features so if you're interested in this keyboard if you're thinking of picking it up you want to buy one yourself we'll go over it all in this review so visually first up out of the box the new features will stand out right away to you as the keyboard has enough you know changes to warrant a new product name but it's still familiar to the product lineup and builds from previous releases the board is still pretty nice looking with that brushed aluminum and the black anodization to it so it'll look very clean if you can keep it that way that's always the double edged sword to the brushed aluminum looks nice but you have to keep it looking nice and surrounding the board is a subtle 44 zone strip of led lights they call light edge and i say you know subtle kind of jokingly because rgb is never subtle but now instead of having a light strip running along the top of the keyboard like we saw on the k95 it's behind the top of the keyboard running along the back side with strips on the left and right side of the board illuminating as well but the board itself is very well made there's no flex to the frame at all and overall for it being a full size layout it's still pretty slim looking which i really like so checking out some of the new features returning on the top is dedicated multimedia keys with a bit of a construction change the mute button is now flat and it's kind of embedded into the frame and it has this even illumination around it and the four playback buttons underneath are now the sort of glossy top to the key speaking of glossy another change comes on the forehead of the keyboard where you have the illuminated corsair logo and the key indicators so here's where the macro leds are the mute windows lock indicators cap lock scroll lock those are now all going to shine through here and i will say i'm pretty conflicted of this particular design choice since it's like a quarter of the top of the board and just this glossy strip you know embedded into the brushed aluminum it stands out kind of weirdly but one of the more interesting additions comes with a new dial on the top left this is going to have a few different uses depending on what you want to configure it as inside the iq software but out of the box it does have a few presets that are already assigned to it so when you press that center iq logo which itself is actually a button you'll notice that shine a certain color red is for recording macros blue is for adjusting the brightness of your rgb lights so real quick and easy way to just dim or increase the lighting you can use this to jog through music zoom in and out of windows switch applications vertical scrolling horizontal scrolling plus the ability to obviously go inside of iq switch it up customize it and i've always welcomed something like this on a keyboard just to add more and more functionality to it the ring itself is knurled on the outside and the left side of the dial is your profile key for switching your hardware profiles on the right side is the windows lock then obviously as you come to expect on the left side of the keyboard you have your six dedicated macro keys g1 through g6 the keycaps here do have this metallic finish to kind of separate them from the rest of the keys and this can be any sort of function or macro you create plus it still has the integration with elgato stream deck so those streaming shortcuts you have or functions whatever you use could also be set to use here some other visual things to touch on before we move on to the keys and switches inside the box they now include a new redesigned magnetic wrist rest definitely welcomed the foam they use inside here is memory foam it's nice and soft but it also has this slight texture pattern on it and love it or hate it i don't know you have a little corsair branding there just smack dab in the middle of the wrist rest i will say though this one is miles miles better than any wrist rest they put out in the past really liking this one and since it's magnetic it just clips right onto the bottom of the keyboard no longer do we have those plastic clips scratching the brushed aluminum every time like we did in years past then also while we're here underneath we still have the cable channels for routing cables nice and cleanly underneath we have the usb passthrough on the back side so if you plug something in there you can just route it nicely on the bottom side you solve the full rubber pads on the top and bottom corners and the feet now are flip out feet they flip outward instead of up and down this is just to prevent it from ever collapsing on itself in case you ever applied more weight to the keyboard sometimes you flip up feet would just give out and fold back up okay so moving on corsair did right by us by not only switching the font to a less bold and aggressive looking character here but the pbt double shot keycaps now have this nice slight bit of texture to it so they're never gonna fade out and have that shine to them and after all these years we finally have a standard bottom row never thought i'd see the day but now you can buy custom keycap sets and use them fully with the standard bottom row and included inside the box is also an additional set of fps and moba keycaps these are just the textured alternative keycaps if you want to swap them out and use it instead but now we can talk gaming and performance with their brand new optical switches known as optics the op-ex switches are designed by corsair it uses that infrared light beam to actuate and set the signal right to your pc with zero debalance and we can finally eliminate any key chattering issues which have been plaguing my k95 unit since last year and these new switches are very fast they actually at only one millimeter with 45 grams force with a total travel distance of 3.2 millimeters they're also rated for 150 million keystrokes so longevity is improved speed is improved optical switches are an improvement in pretty much every regard you can see now with the rgb lighting and that top crystal shell on the switch it's very clear and bright the rgb shines through nicely you even have the little corsair logo now instead of the cherry logo so thank you corsair was waiting for you guys optical switch and now for my experience using these new switches and most of you guys know i always prefer a linear switch as it is and i've been using these speed silver switches for the past two years and these actuate at one millimeter versus the 1.2 millimeters do i notice that no obviously not but the properties are similar you know the feel and the response overall doesn't feel that different to me since they are just very quick and linear and that's good because when you are gaming you want that fast switch advantage but also to someone who maybe you know hasn't tried speed switches in the past if you pick these up you're definitely gonna feel pretty early on that shorter actuation distance especially if you can train your fingers to just lightly actuate the keys at the one millimeter point instead of bottoming out your keys you will definitely feel a difference and again since these are optical switches that signal is sent right to your pc you couple that with their new axon cpu inside the keyboard which allows for 4000 hertz pulling over the standard 1000 hertz pulling on most keyboards and it's gonna still feel lightning fast and also real quick with that new cpu it's actually doing a lot for this keyboard you know behind the scenes it allows for more onboard storage capabilities with holding up to 200 macros and lighting profiles 20 layers of hardware lighting effects and that's all going to be able to be saved on the keyboard so you can bring this to a new pc and have all those lighting effects and macros still saved onto the keyboard itself so you don't even technically need iq because the k100 also has 10 preset lighting effects on the keyboard itself saved with function 1 through 10 so you can just go through and cycle the effects and macro recording can still be done on the keyboard itself but obviously for a better customizing experience you can go into iq and do all that deeper customizing there but yeah before we go deeper into rgb and iq my experience so far gaming with this has been great but also like i said relatively unchanged since i'm used to that fast linear switch experience but in the end what it comes down to is that these are better switches in every regard faster more reliable and more efficient than a traditional mechanical switch all right so now we'll do a sound test of their linear optex optical switches [Applause] all right so a few things to touch on as we heard from that sound test one these stabilizers here that now that they're lubed they sound miles better than years past you heard it too with the space bar it just sounds so much better than any stabilizer we've had on previous corsair keyboards not only are they factory lubing stabilizers now but they also ditch that wire that would just rattle to no end so thank god or thank you corsair and also for the switches themselves as a reference compared to what i'm used to with speed silver switches those are always like a higher pitched so now these they sound a lot more solid and you combine that with the pbt keycaps and it's a more satisfying switch sound and feel uh but what's not satisfying as you also probably heard is the dial and that iq button i do wish when you were scrolling on that dial it had more of a tactile kind of sharpness to it but that iq button when you press it in it just feels very out of place and it's shifty it kind of feels like it wasn't supposed to be a button and then they added it it's just very meh feeling and that'll bring me to my next point which is why is that iq logo even there like when have we ever seen a company have their software logo on a keyboard so when i first saw pictures of this keyboard i thought that was actually an led screen and whatever function you had on the dial could be displayed there uh that would have been cool and again like i said in the past in previous videos they have the technology we've seen it with the elgato stream deck and stuff so wish they could integrate something like that into the keyboard with a screen i just don't like having the iq logo and button there i don't know i just think it's weird now when talking a screen integration onto the keyboard this is still compatible with their nexus attachment but still that's an optional accessory it's also an extra hundred dollars but you get what i'm saying i wish we had that customizable screen on the keyboard also that iq button itself can't actually be customized it's solely for cycling between the functions of what that dial does and i get that but it would have been nice to still be able to kind of you know change that up but going even further i wish iq would have a bit of a 20 20 refresh to it the dial itself like i said out of the box does have those stock presets but if you were to start making your own profiles and stuff you're now gonna have to manually configure what the dial does and that's definitely a bit of a annoying and tedious task because first you have to go and sort of make your own actions or make your own macros manually and then manually apply them to what each the left and right direction of that dial is going to be and then you have to go to the dial tab to do that so i wish it just had a bunch of kind of preset actions like a library of things already configured for us that we could just drag and drop not manually create every task every single time iq though is still relatively unchanged here you can go in and switch up all the rgb lighting and like i said you have those 44 zones they're all configurable you can change each individual zone to a different color or you know just change up the effects in unison have it all sync and go to whatever sort of rgb rainbow show you want but again if you don't want to use iq to configure the rgb lights you have those 10 onboard profiles already out of the box so the actions tab is where you create the macros or reassign keys you have actions library which is a listing of your current created actions and you have the lighting effects tab and lighting library hardware lighting and hardware library just seems repetitive to me all these tabs corsair please give this a nice polish okay and by the way guys out of the box uh with this keyboard it's actually set to just a thousand hertz so you will need to change it to 4 000 hertz manually in the iq settings to actually take advantage of the speed i feel like there's just too many hoops to jump through to be able to properly configure this keyboard all right so quick recap brand new lightning fast optical switches known as optics they feel very very nice new keycaps a less aggressive gamer looking font which is always good we also have a standard bottom row big thumbs up for that have the macro keys dedicated media keys and the multi-functional dial so all together like function feature wise it's a very good keyboard but it doesn't come without its cons and there definitely are a few first thing like i said configuring the the uh the wheel can kind of be annoying especially if you don't really know what you're doing inside of iq so i wish that was a bit simplified second i'm still pretty torn for the decision to go all gloss here on this uh indicator section just doesn't really fit in with the aesthetic and i found myself cleaning this like every 10 minutes because somehow just handling it it gets fingerprints all over it and third you know i'm a man of the people i'm on your guy's side it's an expensive keyboard okay it's their premium flagship release now and it's 230 dollars you compare that to the k95 platinum which was 200 when it released that was still their top-of-the-line flagship release so now we're getting that price tag but bumped up 30 bucks bit of a premium for some optical switches and the wheel and stuff but also you look at what razer just released with their black widow v3 pro that's also 230 so i feel like razer put it at that price and corsair said okay we're you know direct competitors we can also release our flagship new keyboard at the same price so like i said i'm on your guy's side i wish that was a lot cheaper 200 would even still be fair for it considering that's their flagship kind of price point but it's still in the end if you're talking about features performance with the switches and stuff as a gaming keyboard if you're not looking for the custom and stuff in the custom keyboard market for a pre-built like this it's definitely a pretty good keyboard it's going to be my main gaming keyboard going forward replacing my old k95 platinum finally because now i have to deal with the the key chattering issues that i've had for the past year we can finally get rid of that with the new optical switches so i definitely think it's a great great keyboard if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below and guys i'll wrap it up for this
