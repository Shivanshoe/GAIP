what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be checking out what's new with the 61 gram razer viper mini that not only slashed some grams on the weight but also slashed the price tag at just 40 dollars so in case you're interested in it you want to find out more we'll talk about the new additions the features what's changed and what i think about it in this video of the razer viper mini so i've already done a full review of the original viper in the viper ultimate as well so you want to find out more about those definitely check those videos out but surprisingly with the viper mini we get more than just a redesigned shell a lot of times when companies put out a lighter mouse that's pretty much just all that's changed that is not the case here we have a pretty good amount of differences so when you take it out of the box at first glance it's gonna look pretty much you know very similar to the viper but as you start to stare at it and look at it a bit more you'll see those differences in those changes so first obviously with the redesigned shell coming in at 61 grams there are no holes which is a big plus that they can cut some weight and not have any holes in the shell but in terms of size it comes in at 118 millimeters long 53 and a half millimeters wide at the grip width 38.3 millimeters tall at the highest point and just around 14 millimeters at the front now for comparison the regular viper is 126.7 millimeters long 66.2 millimeters wide and 37.8 millimeters tall and then visually you can see the differences of how it stacks up against other small mice on the market like the ultralight 2 cape town that i modded the mm710 and the model o minus with the smallest one here being the ultralight 2 followed then by the mm710 with the viper mini being pretty similar and close to the modelo minus i will say a claw or fingertip grip is definitely going to be recommended here due to the size of the mouse that's also going to depend on the size of your hand you know if you're younger and you have small hands you could probably get away with palming it if that's what you do but yeah claw our fingertip recommended but back to the new additions and changes first off razer ditched the rubberized side grips which surprisingly was a common request i found from the community i personally like the rubber but you know that's okay and we also lost two of these side buttons on the right side of the mouse so it's no longer technically ambidextrous by definition but still ambi by design and we also get an added dpi button underneath the scroll wheel which can obviously be remapped if you want to change that up flipping it over we also get another zone of rgb lighting with a light strip on the butt of the mouse for some nice underglow when it's on your desk shout out to the speed underground and even more changes come underneath the sensor is a bit scaled back from that 5g optical on the viper and then the focus plus on the viper ultimate here it's a 3389 optical sensor you say it goes up to 8 500 dpi and the 3389 is the same sensor from the deathadder elite the mm710 also uses it many many others so it is kind of a bummer that the sensor takes a step back but again that's where probably most of that you know price difference is going to come into play for it to be more affordable so it's it's a give and take compromises thankfully another addition we have is improved mouse feet with the highest grade of ptfe this is exactly what we have with the viper ultimate and this is one thing i really wanted them to change from the original viper so now that they're buttery smooth it's gonna allow for some real nice quick flicks and then complementing that is a speedflex cable this is the same speedflex cable from the original viper mouse which is good because that is very very lightweight nice and flexible as well so there won't be any drag resistance on your desktop and won't get hung up so a lightweight cable to complement the lightweight mouse and a ptfe which is the modern day holy trinity so there is one more change in addition to all of the others which running back real quick new shell dpi button included loss of rubberized side grips loss of the two right side buttons added underglow new ptfe feet then the relapse that 3389 sensor but the last thing is what they say is going to be improved optomechanical switches to kind of emulate more of a mechanical switch sound which should make them sound more crisp personally i don't see too much or hear or feel too much of a difference i don't know what exactly is changed in these improved switches but also do a sound test so you could hear everything sounds in this mouse then also comparison to the switches on the viper you now in terms of quality as you just heard as well when i was shaking the mouse there was absolutely no rattle anywhere so it's good to see for the quality of plastic they're using and seemingly a thinner internal wall not only is there no rattle but there's absolutely zero flex anywhere i could squeeze the mouse pretty hard and it doesn't budge that's impressive so just to recap for those who aren't familiar my main mouse since released has been the viper ultimate and before that i was using the regular viper as my main so i'm definitely familiar with you know the layout and the feel of the mouse but having it you know technically scaled down in size now it did take me a few rounds some battlefield to get used to mainly just the the areas of where these side buttons are on the left side i do use those frequently in games and just having to kind of readjust my grip to be able to hit those from what i'm used to with my muscle memory was a bit of an adjustment but all in all for the size yes it's a smaller mouse but i will say that it does still fall kind of in that area of a small to medium sized mouse because with the mm710 ultra light 2 those feel just a lot more lightweight in your hands this it's a definite you know noticeable change but it's not as drastic which is good because we're getting a very familiar mouse for all the viper and viper ultimate users but it's not you know a huge reduction in size personally i don't mind the fact that we lost the two right side buttons i will say it would have been nice if they would have included optional rubberized side grips inside the box so for those who want that they can just stick them on and for those who didn't like that and requested the change they could just leave it how it is that would have been cool and also again it's not a huge deal because the 3389 is still very popular and trusted but the fact we are taking a step back to a lesser sensor if you will from the focus plus and their 5g optical sensor device 8 500 bit of a bummer but again it's a trade-off at the end of the day this mouse is only forty dollars which is crazy crazy affordable you really have to give razer props they've been killing it in terms of their you know their new products and their their mouse designs over the past few years forty dollars for a 61 gram lightweight mouse that doesn't have holes in the body is crazy under 50 bucks you really cannot go wrong so the viper mini gets a big thumbs up from me if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below but yeah that'll wrap it up for what's new with the
