what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we have a really nice sleek and compact amd pc build featuring the brand new rtx 3080ti graphics cards and you guys know i love a nice small form factor pc it's always a challenging but rewarding build process so in this video we'll go through the bill talk about the components show it all off for you guys today so the case we're going to be using for this build is going to be the fantax evolve shift 2 air and they sell it in both a black and an anthracite gray version which is more metallic silver it's the variant that i have here and they also offer this in either a tempered glass version or the alternatively named air version which has the mesh side panels it's the version i have it's going to be better for cooling obviously but if you do prefer aesthetics for your build you can go the tempered glass route but checking it out i really like the design it's a smaller footprint overall but still allows for a lot of room on the inside to build even fitting more recent gpus which are larger it has the internal cage for building and the easy access stands 490 millimeters tall 170 millimeters wide and 270 millimeters in depth so again it's compact small footprint on your desk or entertainment center but plenty of room for components speaking of which our cpu is going to be the amd ryzen 7 5800 x it's got eight cores 16 threads bass frequency is 3.8 gigahertz out of the box and turbo clock speed 4.7 gigahertz making this a really powerful chip for the price really good bang for your buck now it does not come with a stock cooler so we're going to be going with an ek 120 millimeter aio and ek is very well known for their water cooling components so i was definitely interested in checking out their all-in-one cooling solution plus our case only supports 120 millimeter radiator for the gpu like i said the newly released rtx 3080 ti and believe it or not this is the first time nvidia ever supplied me with a graphics card so i'm definitely pumped to check it out and see the boost performance we get versus something like the 3080 that i currently use and that'll all be going on my gigabyte b550i aorus pro ax motherboard it's an itx form factor that's built in bluetooth and wi-fi so for the case it's going to be an ideal fit and itx motherboards are usually dual channel for ram so i have two 16 gigabytes six of hyperx predator rgb ram giving us 32 gigs total here these are clocked at 3200 megahertz i'll also be using a one terabyte stick of the saving rocket nvme pcie 4.0 m.2 internal ssd giving us a mouthful blazing speeds and i've used these cyber rockets and multiple builds in the past they are great then lastly for our power supply is going to be a corsair sf750 and the key with this is the fact that these itx builds need an sfx power supply so here the form factor is going to be much smaller but still modular and at 750 watts it's going to provide ample power to run everything we have all right we're going to get it set up with a little build montage [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] food [Music] do [Music] all right so the build's all done inside our fantastic evolve shift to air case with the ryzen 7 5800x and our rtx 3080 ti this is obviously not a dedicated review and benchmark video of the gpu there's just quite frankly a massive lack of interest in that kind of stuff right now and rightfully so but more so a video just fitting those components inside a nice compact itx build like this so i'll talk you through kind of the process and some of the things i wanted to bring up with a case like this and we'll get into like you know thermals and stuff in a minute as well um first off just obviously kind of to kind of point out to you with it being a vertical build one of the things that you always kind of see with these type of cases is either the motherboard and stuff being mounted 90 degrees to the right up top or on the bottom like we saw with the uh what was it the nzxt h1 which is always kind of odd right and this has it up top so what you do is you press on the top sort of grille of the case and it'll open up and that's where all your i o is pretty much for your motherboard so everything you want to plug in even like you know your gpu and stuff it all gets connected to the top of the case and then funnels out this little cutout on the back and that's not a big deal obviously but it is just a minor annoyance having to go through the top side versus the back side like we've always been used to now that does mean our motherboard is going to be mounted 90 degrees to the right as you saw so the rams on the bottom but it also plays a role into how our aio gets mounted so with this case only supporting a 120 millimeter radiator it's not ideal because a lot of times with your aio you want to avoid your tubing and stuff being vertical that's going to just you know pose a lot of potential problems with the motor dying out you know air pockets and stuff so in this case and actually with this aio one thing they do which is kind of cool to see is they're very flexible with how they have the tubes so they can pretty much go not a full 360 but you can move the tubes like a 270 degree rotation so i did have to kind of maneuver them to go out and then down to the little gutter because that little cut out there is where you kind of you know put the tubes in so it's not butting up against the panel so will this cause an issue over time i'm not 100 sure because it's not a given that it's going to you know die but again the fact that this aio is very flexible with the tubing is definitely a good thing and like i said it gets you know routed kind of behind here in the cutout just for better you know efficiency and cable management which is one thing this case is absolutely great at tons of mounting points tons of little spots to hide cables route them through there's grommets so phanteks did a really really good job with cable management here very impressed all right so flipping it around now for a gpu a few things to bring up one of the odd things this case does is it only includes a pcie 3.0 riser card i feel like it should have been 4.0 right this is a modern case it came out in the last six months so why not include the 4.0 instead of pcie 3.0 it's not going to be a huge deal because you can go into the bios and set it at the 3.0 so compatibility probably won't be a big issue for a lot of people but again you would have liked to have seen that you know included or at least given you inside the box in addition to the 3.0 another thing i did was with the actual bracket and you know the amount that it comes with inside i flipped it around and they give you the option to with this one screw and how it gets mounted inside the case so stock this card would have been facing you know turned around the other way and that's again not going to be a big deal to a lot of people but with these you know the newer 3000 card lineup it has an intake on one side and an exhaust on the other so this would have been blowing the exhaust into the case versus out so now with the mesh side panel i mounted it reverse and now the exhaust is going out the mesh side panel which i think is going to be better for our temperature obviously and i feel like that was proven pretty well because i saw an average 86 degrees celsius i played two or three games on different titles probably benchmarked it for close to like two hours on my end and i feel like 86 giving all the power and hardware inside here that's pretty damn good for temps and again with the mesh side panel obviously tons of room to breathe here much better versus if this was a tempered glass side panel it would be choking pretty significantly other thing you may have saw when i was doing the montage was on the bottom i mounted an additional exhaust fan and it does allow for a 120 or a 140 millimeter fan and i just put one on the bottom to again help dissipate a lot of that heat and stuff that's you know going on inside the case but even here like you can see for yourself with the 3080 ti it is a relatively larger card but there is still a lot of room in here if you do have a bigger card now this case would probably also benefit from an aftermarket card you know uh one that has you know two or three fans on the one side versus the intake and outtake but still enough size uh just really good job from fantax implementing the vertical orientation like this but allowing for bigger and stronger cars potentially with all this room um so i talked about real quick you know just the temperatures here really not bad for the gpu um in battlefield i was getting i believe it was like close to 160 fps which is you know on par with what i expected to see i believe with the 30 80 i was getting close to like 145 on average so the thing with these gpus is the price of performance versus a 3080 it's just not going to be worth it it's really not it's more powerful yes it's kind of closer to the 30 90 in that regard but for the price jump not worth it i believe on average it was somewhere around 10 like a 10 increase in fps but the 3080 ti is gonna be better more so for things like rendering like that that more so a kind of workflow versus gaming so it's really hard to recommend this upgrade right now with the shortages and really that's the lack of visual boost you get for that price kind of tying it back around this is a really poorly organized video and i apologize for it uh with our aio and our cpu i was getting 81 degrees average celsius which again for a 120 millimeter um in this case with the 3800x i feel like that's also very good so i went into this you know wanted to build a nice powerful build with a small footprint but my big concern again was the temperatures because a lot of times with itx cases that's the big big downfall is temps but with the mesh side panels i think fantax did a really really good job so again just more so a build video but if you do want to see a dedicated review of this case let me know if you want to see more itx builds let me know just wanted to get this out there show off some new hardware and really it was just a thing for me to kind of do in my free time i wanted to see like i said if i can get some really powerful hardware and a nice itx build like this so uh i had a good time itx builds always pose a fun challenge which is why i like doing them so guys that'll wrap it up hope you enjoy it i'll put all the hardware if you want to check it out in the description down below if you like this video give it a big thumbs up show your support
