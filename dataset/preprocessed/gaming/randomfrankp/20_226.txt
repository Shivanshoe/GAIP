what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 207 of room tour project the series where you show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup say anything you like have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now episode 207 first we have the automatic this one with a triple monitor setup as you can see with a two on the bottom and the massive food in Huynh inch for the overhead and I like that you know white wood in wallpaper he has really long desk let's check it out so like I said for that overhead is a 49 inch curb from Samsung and the bottom two monitors are all from Samsung these are 32 inches at 144 Hertz in the one a millisecond response time so they're gonna be great for gaming now I'm gonna start to check out some of the peripherals on the desktop you could see in some photos his actual desk pad is gonna be you know flip-flopped and stuff but we'll focus on that his keyboard is the drop alt you can see he has he shine through key caps on them with the final mouth ninja air 58 and for audio you can see his speaker's the Razer Nomo chroma and while not pictured here they're under the desk he has the Astro a-50 headset now you're probably wondering you know where is the PC and this is actually not a PC gaming setup you can kind of see under his set up on the shelf he has this 15.4 inch MacBook Pro this is the i7 with the Retina display and this is also primarily a console setup as well as his xbox one but I don't know we know what he can do in terms of gaming on the MacBook I've never tried it so maybe he has it partitioned so he can game on the PC side I don't know but it's got all the piece of gear he's got the really nice setup so whether he's know a casual game or a hardcore gamer it really doesn't matter if this is his gaming setup he pulled it off nicely regardless of gaming just on console or the MacBook Pro again it doesn't matter it's about to set up and it's pulled off real nicely next up is Cameron and I love the whole aesthetic here you can see between the wallpaper that print above the setup he's got this like waves kind of thing going on and I love the colors as well with the oranges and the blues it all blends together really really nicely so for those monitors his primary mounted is a pic so px7 it's 1440p 144 Hertz and then on the left side the vertical monitor the 24-inch from Acer now for is peripherals his keyboard is the magic 468 smart 2 got some grey key caps on there as well to kind of complement the white with Logitech G 305 Lightspeed Mouse and white as well and for audio he has both the Barrett dynamic DT 770 Pro headphones and the HyperX cloud 2 headsets we kind of switch them up depending on whether he's gaming we listen to some music hanging out that kind of thing then over on the right side of the desk is the PC with the side panel facing forward so you can see what it's got going on inside the risin 5 3,600 X CPU with the arctic freezer at 34 eSports duo cooler we have 16 gigs of course revengeance RGB program on an msi be 450 tomahawk max motherboard in an msi r-tx 2070 super Ventus OC GPU with the fractal mesh fic case and again the colours inside all going nice and blue definitely a clean build so a good job on that and altogether like I said before I just love how everything flows and blends here a little bit of Ivy on top of the PC as well but the orange and blues it looks so good mixed together whether that's a light strip going up the side of your wall there can't really tell but it adds a bit of nice and of an accent piece you nailed it Cameron now we have Cray 23 and guess what when it comes to being minimal and clean you got it this is definitely Cray high see what I did ha alright that's all just delete that so check it is help I love that wooden desk you can see that is natural real wood gorgeous I've got the nice balcony there nice view it's all about the National Miss which this has wooden desk ambient lighting that's top-notch stuff for the monitor there's a 34-inch Alienware ultra-wide nice rainmeter wallpaper as well and for the peripherals it's not all shown here but I can tell you right now it's some top-notch gear you can see for audio he has the will audio wa7 fireflies tube headphone amp with the Bowers & Wilkins mm1 speakers and always loves seeing a custom keyboard this is the feel it's got 67 Graham's Helios V one switches that's gmk Metaverse keycaps a Marvel rest rest it all just looks super nice and for the mouse Logitech G pro Wireless and as we usually see with really nice minimal setups we also have a small form-factor PC this is the stream comm da 2 in size at AMD risin 3,700 X with the thermal write exp 100 cooler 32 gigs of coarser vengence lpx ram gigabyte X 570 eye or s pro ITX motherboard with an EVGA GTX 1070 graphics card so man what a killer set up this is definitely Cray as I cringing Lee said before but I got to point out the unicycle there that might be a first I don't think you've ever had anyone on here own a unicycle so cray good job all around this setup is awesome I love it it's minimal got that natural vibe but also very classy at the same time something I think it's that lamp I think my grandparents have that lamp but I'm feeling it because it blends in and it works really well here next up is Coby D shout out to the Mamba r.i.p and this is one of those crazy setups that goes a hundred percent to the wall with dedication of the theme I love all the collectables all the figures the prints everything in this setup because you know at the end of the day you want your setup to reflect yourself your passions your hobbies because it's what you're surrounded by 24/7 right so when you see setups like this that have all that it just it gots it gots to make you feel good so for his displays he's rocking the TIE fighter setup as I call it with the primary being a BenQ 27-inch and the two vertical ones on each side are a neck multi sync they our 24 inches and I'd never heard of it and they got us a shout out for a lot of the DIY here because the desk and this monitor riser are all completely homemade and just that that's stained on the wood it looks really nice complements the actual wood on the desk as well now down to the peripherals these are actually both from rack and as far as I know if that's how you pronounce it they are a peripheral company overseas primarily in the Philippines I believe I was told but the keyboard is the rack LOM Aang Pro and the rock captain Mouse could be butchering it I apologize a nice wooden wrist rest again to complement all the other wooden accents on the setup but as a duo acid keyboard looks pretty dang nice now over to the PC this is the tech where alpha MTG case inside the risin 5 3,600 CPU with an ID cooling SE 21 4 else no addition cooler 16 gigs of T force RGB Delta RAM and an as rugby 450 M steel leged motherboard with an asus strix gtx 1070 graphics card yellow and blue on the inside going along with that kind of like like I got like a lightning feel when I see yellow and blue pulled off greatly and take a look at that cable management hot damn you know with a DIY desk you probably factored that in so we built that shelf underneath so you can have the power bricks and the cables so good job on the execution because this is a hell of a nice looking desk and a hell of a nice looking room Coby good job RGB light strip behind the desk under the shelves collectibles out the wazoo and I wanted to take a second if you're still watching and say I hope you're all you know staying safe out there if you are if you're washing your hands give this video a thumbs up so we can bump and boost that engagement in the YouTube algorithm because it's the devil and then last but not least is another great job of a setup when it comes to getting the most out of your space even if it's very very limited and that's exactly what we have here this is a really nice setup underneath a bunk bed and as you can see in a super small cramped room so no limitations I think we're gonna keep and hold him back and that's what I love seeing he's even got the Samsung 49 inch ultrawide monitor under that bed and yeah that come on that takes some cojones nothing's gonna hold him back so checking out the peripherals on his desk he has the razor Huntsman keyboard with the razor basilisk mouse and for audio to kind of like extend his desktop real estate he has the speaker stands built out to actually support his speaker's the audio engine a5 plus and then he also has the ath m50x headphones from sennheiser held up you know kind of like on a peg underneath the bunk bed you can see there the top left-hand corner of your screen very well-thought-out all around now they can head into the PC inside here and I gotta make a note real quick this is the risin 720 700 X I remember even like a year ago everything was all Intel CPUs these gaming PC's now every CPU we're seeing is rising so good job Hamdi but yeah and sexy crack is X 72 ai yo to keep that nice and cool 16 gigs of course dimensions RGB proram I'm gigabyte x4 70 or scheming 7 motherboard with the zotac gtx 1070 TI inside the fantex evolve x case on the bottom of the desk off to the left side there so yeah I've said it before but just absolutely phenomenal job that should give anybody inspiration which is the whole point of this series if you also have a very small room or cramped space there's no reason to be held back get creative and don't let your dreams become dreams just do it in this episode of room tour project is brought to you by Corsair and the k95 RGB platinum XT keyboard this 2020 release is gonna
