what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be going over my top five gaming headsets of 2020 plus a few honorable mentions so you can see which i think are the best of the best that came out this year for each one we'll go over them in detail talk about all the stuff you're going to want to know but i'll do the mic tests at the end so instead of you know breaking them up into their own section we're going to have them all back to back to back so you can hear the direct comparisons you can really hear the mic quality and how they sound in comparison to each other and also we did our top five gaming keyboards video our top five gaming mice of 2020 so if you want to check those out definitely do today's top five headsets completes the trifecta of the best gaming peripherals of 2020. all the links listed for you in the description down below and starting us off today at number five is a really good budget option from cooler master these really surprised me through the mh630 and they come in at just 60 dollars which is a fantastic deal really really impressed with these so for the design overall they're very simple primarily plastic and stuff for the construction but they are lightweight in return but it also doesn't feel flimsy at all you do have that purple accent ring around the ear cup so take it or leave it they feature 50 millimeter neodymium drivers and the ear cups themselves are a mesh but they're nice and thick provide great padding and a great seal on your ear overall both the microphone and the cable on this headset is removable which is really nice to see you have built-in volume control plus a mic mute button on the back of the left ear cup and the gooseneck mic sounds really really good like i said you'll hear that sound test at the end ear cups also rotate 90 degrees for a better fit on your head and like i said with these really thick cushioned ear pads and the overall plastic construction lightweight feels really nice and what really surprised me about these besides the great microphone quality is the neutral sound signature overall it's not trying to do too much it's not trying to push the base of the fact where it gets over muddy bass is nice and tight and punchy great audio and spatial awareness overall i was just really impressed with the sound with these and like i said for just 60 dollars cooler master is doing some great stuff in the audio space and for twenty dollars more they do have a version that has rgb lighting around the ear cup instead of just a stock purple and it's usb uh this plugs to your pc with the just the standard mic jack and audio jack and stuff but i mean you shouldn't want to be paying an extra 20 bucks just for an rgb light ring around the ear cup i think all things considered like i said 60 bucks fantastic value definitely need to be on my top five for sure next up is the headset we reviewed probably a little over a month ago at this point and that's the brand new hyperx cloud 2 wireless you're probably familiar with these from the original cloud 2 one of the top selling headsets of all time now a few years later we get the wireless version and they do not disappoint whatsoever design wise it's practically the same as their cloud series so it looks pretty much the same all black with the red accents on the ear cup and the yoke stitching in the headband looks really nice they feature 53 millimeter drivers that are specially tuned and i don't know how they do it but they always just sound super clear these are very good sounding drivers they have a little bass port up top so it doesn't get overly muddy and stuff it gives you a nice solid punch ear pads as well are memory foam and their premium leatherette from hyperx so nice and cushiony for sure you have your power button and mic mute button on the back of the left ear cup with the usb c port for charging and the volume dial on the right ear cup the mic itself also removable but again since these are wireless one of the things i was concerned about was there was going to be a noticeable downgrade in sound quality and no none whatsoever they still managed to make these sound absolutely incredible with those 53 millimeter drivers the sound stage is just so expansive but everything still feels controlled for example but the one area i did mention in my review was that the like the high ends is a bit harsh in some instances mainly with music and i wish they had the ability to be eq'd in their software uh but unfortunately they don't but besides that they sound very very good now ironically one of these trade-offs and sort of complements to having the higher end frequencies kind of increased a bit and even in some of the mids is the fact that your ambience and the the world around you uh does sound a bit more sparkly so for example i was able to hear birds in certain spots in battlefield where i didn't usually you know hear them i just wasn't really paying attention to that or i can hear a tank sort of like cranking in the distance sound like the like the rocks are getting caught up in it battlefield has a great great sound design overall and that's one area where yeah it might be a bit too sparkly but it makes it sound really lively battery life on these also very good at 30 hours and they're super flexible but durable with the all aluminum frame to here and yes just give you a great clamp overall and weight distribution on this is uh just unrivaled i think they did a really good job with their wireless variant this year and it comes in at 150 next up is gonna be the newer version of kind of a similar sentiment to this last one uh last year we had the g pro x headset from logitech now we get the g pro x light speed which is their wireless version we're gonna toss it to dimitri from hardware canucks because these are his favorite of 2020. well hello good people i'm dmitry thanks to frank for the invitation my current favorite headset for the year would be the logitech g pro x wireless i chose this as my favorite headset because i spent a lot of time in vr after work doing workouts with box vr i'm still playing alex too and this headset size wise expands beautifully to still go around the rift s headset yet still create a nice seal so i'm totally consumed in my vr environment battery life is good up to 20 hours and i can monitor that in the software i never use the microphone but the blue voice functionality is there if you want to use it it is charging with a type c connection which is great there's plenty of volume and the reason another reason why i chose this over the new hyperx wireless is because of the sound quality i actually prefer the sound quality on the g pro x plus a lot of the customization you get with eq uh in the g hub even though i never touched them but some people care about that so that is why the g pro x wireless headset is my currently favorite recommendation for 2020 if you're looking for wireless so as you heard they were his favorite of the year coming at number three on my list but i mean everything he said is spot on they sound so so good they're another company who can manage to replicate that same pretty much lossless audio quality versus their you know original wired headset to now wireless feel really comfortable and in terms of you know like i said a clamping pressure i mentioned in previous of the headsets and stuff this one probably has the best out of all that it is a little bit on the heavier side due to the materials but clamping wise it feels really really good and it's just they're doing some great great stuff from logitech and again mic quality all that stuff you'll hear that towards the end of my domain back to back then we'll go over our final notes on that uh but yes g pro x great great stuff with their wireless version here from logitech coming in at number two this one is pretty special and we're going to toss it to brian from bad sea tech to mention this real quick yo what's good everybody i'm brian p from bad seed tech frank asked me to come by today and talk a little about my favorite gaming headset from 2020. i know this one ranked really high for him as well this is the pc38x from drop and sennheiser if you can get past the yellow what you find is a really solid combination of the older sennheiser frame and the drivers from the newer gsp 500 so you end up with an open back gaming headset that allows you to hear a bit of the world around you that's got great clarity and sound stage but still delivers the bass that's pretty rare for an open back headphone it's not muddy or overblown either they sound really good not only that but they've lowered the impedance to 28 ohms so you don't even need an amp you can drive these with just about anything you can plug a headphone into so your console controller or your nintendo switch will handle these great they include two different cables inside the box you can hook these up to whatever you want to without having to find a splitter or an adapter they take about two weeks to fully break in after that they become super comfortable they have really minimal clamping force and plenty of padding where you need it they've got these big oval ear pads and like a sport mesh they also include a set of allure pads as well these are really easy to swap out so you can experiment around and see which one sounds best for you the mic you've been listening to this entire time is permanently attached it works with a swivel up for mute down for live there's no software of any sort just a simple volume wheel on the right side while you may not be a fan of this boom style mic it sounds better than most for a gaming headset and because it's always attached it makes it easy to reach for for stuff like zoom meetings distance learning and these sounds so good you'll probably find yourself gravitating towards them from music listening as well needless to say they also perform great for gaming with enough bass to get you like amped up and immersed in the moment but not so much that it's drowning out the important details that you need to hear in terms of detail and imaging i.e knowing exactly where your enemy is coming from these sound dangerously close to drop in sennheiser's own hd58x which you've probably heard about about the only real performance downside i can think of is that the open back nature of these means you can hear the world around you and other people can hear what you're listening to as well so it doesn't make these an ideal choice for mobile use all in all even at a price point of 169.99 they did a really nice job with these and they're an easy recommend for me particularly for console players big thanks to frank for having me on today feel free to stop by the channel if you want to know more hope everybody has a safe and happy holiday and until next time stay up so i think brian pretty much hit the nail on the head in every aspect of this headset the pc38x is one of my favorites obviously coming in at number two and in the gaming headset space there is such a lack of open back and i have always loved it because it's just more immersive i think it makes you feel like you're in the middle of the battlefield in the middle of the action versus just having you know a driver on each ear blasting the audio into your head so they sound so good they nailed everything about this headset maybe just besides the yellow accents but again whatever um and also again as you're gonna hear probably the best microphone so very very impressed with these um really cannot give them a glowing recommendation enough and honestly between number three number two and number one i had a very hard time uh pretty much pinpointing which one i was gonna give that top spot to and the ultimate three two one ranking but for me i think it comes down for number one my top headset of 2020 is the razer black shark v2 pro and to throw a wrench into things i'm even going to share this top spot with their v2 x okay because the v2x at just 60 was one of my favorites of the entire year and i actually contemplated putting that between number one and two but then last month or month or two ago whatever when they released the wireless version of the v2 which is now the v2 pro they both absolutely blew my mind so first off i think when it comes to overall value uh the v2x at 60 is one of the greatest deals in just the headset market to date it's phenomenal the v2 pro does get a price jump to 180 which is definitely a bit pricey yes but they're just doing something so different than what they've done in the past from their cracking lineup the audio in these i really think is unrivaled not only can you eq these in their software you can take advantage of their razer 7.1 surround sound which i think is the best emulated surround sound out of any company they do surround sound right and also their certified thx sound both feature their triforce titanium 50 millimeter drivers the driver construction into the headset is broken up into three different parts hence the name triforce which individually tunes the highs mids and lows and for the v2 pro the bass really surprised me and i think all together at how well it could handle um some extreme eq'ing in their software so for example when i bump the bass and the treble up even more it doesn't get overblown it doesn't sound worse it's all very controlled in a sense where it's not making it sound worse at the extreme scenarios and for the more in-depth breakdown of the actual sound quality you know i did an actual review on the v2x and v2 headset when these came out but they sound really really good footsteps directional audio i think is just perfect in these and again with the v2 pro being the wireless version of the budget option of the v2x but the hyper speed technology also causes zero frequency distortion background noise nothing to the wireless headset and it's also decent at battery lasting 24 hours on a single charge for the design i love the nod to the old pilot headset look um if you remember the original black shark these were pretty similar to that but i had more of a mechanical look and in my actual review of the v2x i stated they were the most comfortable headset i've tried and that still remains the same something about them all together they are the most comfortable gaming headset i've ever used and it's the same for the v2 pro so they nail designed a nail construction they mailed how it feels on your head i love the little volume wheel right here on the ear cup for controlling your volume you have your built-in controls on the back of the ear cup as well on this left side for muting your microphone the power button as well as the uh port for charging and then on the v2 x you pretty much just get that same volume dial and then just a mic mute button on the back so very simple very very comfortable and the mic on the 60 v2 x is incredible like it's one of the best out there and it's just 60 on this so people are probably going to complain that i'm full of bs for putting razer at my top spot today and there's something about razer in general that's very polarizing to the gaming market and gaming audience you either love them or you hate them so they get the other side that hates them giving them a lot of crap 24 7. but the fact is this new lineup is phenomenal and it deserves to be number one best of the year of course in my opinion and you can look at any other tech reviewer look at any of the reviews out there i've talked to a lot of my tech reviewer friends and they all said that yes this headset is phenomenal and they're actually killing it this year so it's not just me saying this you can look out there all the claims will back it up we all share the same sentiment uh razer doing some really really great stuff but at the same time like i said any one of these three really uh could have been worthy of that top spot because the pro x light speed sennheiser and drop pc3 and x and the black shark series um all so so good you literally cannot go wrong with either one now we'll do the mic test right now i'll save the runner ups until after this again so you can hear all the mics and how they sound we'll do them back to back to back starting from five ending at one and i'm also including the black shark v2x because like i said they kind of shared my number one spot so my tests grab some headphones all right check this out somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me and i need the sharpest tool in the shed but she was looking kind of dumb with a finger and a thumb in the shape of an l on her forehead well the years start coming they don't stop coming fed to the rules and hit the ground running did it make sense not to lift for fun your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb so much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking the back streets you'll never know if you don't go and you'll never shine if you don't glow hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play hey now you're a rock star get the show on get paid and all that glitters is gold only shooting stars breaks the mold that's the truth it's a cool place and they say it gets colder you're bundled up now wait till you get older but the meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture the ice we skate it's getting pretty thin the water is getting warm so you might as well swim my world's on fire how about yours that's the way i like it and i'll never get bored hey now you're an all-star hey now you're a rock star get the show on and get paid and all that glitters is gold only shooting stars break the mold somebody once asked can i spare some change for gas i need to get myself away from this place i said yep what a concept i could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change if you know what i'm saying well the years start coming and they don't stop coming fed to the rules and hit the ground running did it make sense not to live for fun your brain gets smart and your head gets dumb so much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking the back streets you'll never know if you don't go go you'll never shine if you don't glow hey now you're an all-star get your game on go play hey now you're a rock star get to show one and get paid and all that glitters is gold only shooting stars break the mold and that is the classic 2001 smash hit from guy fieri all right so i hope you could appreciate that mic test but real quick some final thoughts before we move on uh on the mh630 again for just 60 dollars it's mind-blowing and as you heard the microphone on here super super clear i am just so impressed with what they're doing with here for that price then moving on to the pc38x from dropping sennheiser i think the microphone on this is probably one of the best on any gaming headset it just sounds so natural which is very very hard to find and this headset in general i think is one of the best in the entire gaming headset market like this is a great great mic and a great headset overall then for the two black shark ones you know as you heard with the uh the v2 pro it sounds okay this is 180 then for 60 the v2x i think has a crazy good microphone um i don't know they're somehow different because you just heard the stark differences again very clear great mic again only 60 bucks these two super impressive for the price overall now for honorable mentions what i'm going to do for this is i'm going to use the actual microphone for that headset and use that to explain each of the headsets for the runner-ups and spoiler one of them in there has a mic that might be on par with the sennheiser i think okay our first runner up is a bit of a different one always kind of fun when you see these this is a haptic gaming headset it's the corsair hs60 and it has this haptic base technology in the drivers where they actually move and vibrate to certain explosions and gunshots in game so it's a really cool sense of feeling your audio to make you more immersed and it does a really really good job at it it's not too distracting it's overpowering it's done just right what i don't like about the headset overall is that it has this camo design to it i really wish it was a more neutral looking headset because i would probably wear these a lot more if it wasn't looking stupid i know when it comes to a headset you know looks is one of the last things you care about but they definitely should release this in a neutral colorway but definitely still deserves to be mentioned as it comes in at a hundred dollars it sounds good for the price and like i said you get that extra immersion when you're gaming with the vibrations and the feedback next up from creative we have the sxfi gamer headset and this one is very very interesting it does a few things different than a typical gaming headset and it's got a lot going for it so first off as you can hear the microphone quality is actually pretty good i'm a little bit bassy they say it's professional streaming grade and stuff they call it their commander mic i definitely think it's probably top five out of the ones that i've tested and stuff so good on that side it's usb-c so it can connect to your phone your switch ps4 and adapter to your xbox so very versatile but it does two things in particular that's pretty interesting first off is their built-in battle mode with the usb-c cable and what that gaming sort of sound effect does is kind of boosts the openness of the world so it sounds wider but what it does is it helps with positional audio and the fact where like a lot of the mids and sort of useless audio going on in the world like ambient sounds and stuff it kind of eliminates that and just mainly focuses on uh things like footsteps gunshots explosions again for your awareness and stuff it's really really interesting how they use some sort of i don't know if it's like ai or whatever but whatever tech they're using to accomplish that is very very interesting and then they also just have their sxfi sort of surround sound mode it's good uh but it's not the main selling point here but for 130 dollars i think it's definitely a uh worthy headset of being mentioned because it is just so different some things i don't like about it is i think the construction is kind of lacking i'm not the biggest fan of the overall looks of it i think it looks like it's from the early 2000s it's trying too hard to look cool and it's just not doing too much for me but good sound good mic it just does something new which is refreshing to see and then the last runner up for today is going to be the turtle beach stealth 700 gen 2 wireless headset this is the newer version and you probably know these from doc these are dr disrespect's main headset which is why i wanted to check it out and i was actually pretty impressed i haven't really tried turtle beach stuff in the past and these sound better than i thought they would which is why i wanted to include them they sell them in two different variants you can get them for the xbox or you get the other one in the playstation version uh but what's annoying and which is why i ultimately didn't make my top five is if you want to use it with your pc you have to buy the actual uh separate xbox wireless adapter to even be able to pair it in the first place so i wish they would have either included that or some sort of you know usb dongle that pairs it automatically so i think that's definitely a bummer like i said good enough to be mentioned but not good enough to necessarily make my top five all right guys i'll wrap it up for my top five gaming headsets of 2020 plus a few honorable mentions hope you all enjoyed but more importantly i hope this video helped you out because while i know this list is just my personal opinion uh the fact is as a tech reviewer i check out tons of gaming gear tons of headsets and what these nine in total i think were the best of the year so if you're looking to upgrade to a new headset hope the video helped you out and all the links
