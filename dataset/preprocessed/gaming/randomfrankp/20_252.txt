what's up guys I'm random Frank P starting off 2020 with a cold and episode 200 of room tour project the series we saw some of the best setups give you some ideas inspirations for your own setup message we're starting off the year with a milestone episode 200 our special guest is gonna be mkbhd showing off his new setup that powers his channel we're also gonna go with a clean and minimal themed for this episode so see anything you like I will have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out let's start it off first up we have Kelvin L and I know this is not your prototypical minimal setup but it's a really good job of keeping it clean and organized and as you can see he throws a really unique spin to the set up with all the faux foliage so I'm really diggin the nature theme he has going on it also gives him his place to integrate his tanks for the pets that he has it just fits in naturally and it looks really cool so as far as gear he has two monitors the primary being the Asia Predator X 34 P and the vertical monitor on the left side being a viewsonic 27 inch display as force peripherals to the Logitech G 613 keyboard with logitech g502 light speed wireless mouse on an extended mousepad from Corsair you could see the Google Nest hub there in the middle as well kind of acting like a third display got that smart home integration and then for his audio gear his headset is the racer Kraken pro with the Dino do zo two speakers so like I said before with that wall where he has his tanks integrated also fitting in is his PC wall-mounted there right in the middle this is the NZXT eh 700 case in size an Intel i7 9700 k cpu with the coarser h 150 ai ai o got 16 gigs of G skilled shrine and z-r GB RAM on a gigabyte or a Z 390 ultra motherboard with the gigabyte Oris r-tx 2080 extreme water force graphics card I'm loving the custom braided cables as well and the orange color theme he has matching inside to make it really pop and stand out from the green it's a nice complement then when you first walk in the room he has the entertainment setup with a massive TV there ps4 nintendo switch and very fitting that he's playing Monster Hunter even got the neon joy cos there for the switch but altogether just a really unique setup again not the most minimal thing you're gonna see but it's the approach that count it's still very clean and organized and I love the dark and just moody feels it get so very cozy but you have that integration with the nature definitely goes down as one of my personal favorites next up we have Burton this just looks like straight out of a design magazine it looks just refreshing and it really doesn't even look real but it is I'm about to hit you up to be my interior designer but checking out his desk set up going with the single monitor here it is an alienware 34 inch ultra wide 1440 feet 120 Hertz and taking it off the stock stand and having it on your own monitor arm I think fits in appropriately here because the stock stand on that is that very like gamer aggressive look this visually fits in perfectly now down to the peripheral you have a ROM McCoy you milk keyboard inside our gather on silent ink switches the Oise keys are actually spring spot but 35 gram Springs and the key casts are gmk white on black super clean looking build lovely custom aviator cable as well so nice to see a keyboard enthusiast with these setups so the light linear wise keys on the keyboard the light gaming mouse you know us up and they are both on an extra large HP omen gaming mouse pad then for audio his headphones of a bear dynamic DT 1770 Pro with an antlion mod mic Wireless to make it like a headset they're being powered by the JD s labs atom amp and the speakers on his desk are the audio engine a2 plus in white now we'll check out the PC with the NZXT h 500 i case inside the intel i7 8700 k CPU with NZXT kraken x 62 a io 64 gigs of Corsair Vengeance Ram on an asus strix z 370 F motherboard an EVGA r-tx 28 ETI FTW three graphics card but I'm digging that really muted black build a set at give going on nice and stealthy and really clean if then even the entertainment setup is looking super clean as well got a massive 65 inch Panasonic 4k OLED TV Xbox one ps4 all the console gaming goes down here but damn Burt this is another one for the books you've definitely got an eye for this type of thing this just doesn't accidentally happen you can tell a lot of thought was put into formulating this set up in this room from the prints the decor the color matching this is crazy now we have mark following suit with a nice long wooden desk a big play off to the left side keeping that desk top free of clutter one thing to note you could see the giant window off to the right side of the room and I love the shadows it has casting across the set up I think it looks really cool it might sound stupid but it's all about the lines to play solo monitor mark is using a viewsonic 27 inch display 1080p but 144 Hertz and a 1 millisecond response time so definitely a good panel for gaming down to the peripherals maybe ducky one too many white keyboard with a glorious model Oh Mouse in white as well you can see matching it all to that theme and they are on the solar series mouse pad from novel keys for audio is headphones with a bear that mimic DT 770 Pro 80 ohm headphones with the audio engine a 2 plus speakers as you can tell these are pretty popular when it comes to minimal setups then for the PC we have the Leon leo 11 dynamic case got that pink purple and blue neon vaporwave aesthetic going on inside the intel i7 7700 case cpu with the NZXT kraken x52 a i/o 16 gigs of g.skill tried and z-r GB RAM on an msi z170 titanium motherboard with an asus rog Strix RTX 27 t GPU custom painted white black and white braided cables the whites leaving on the AI oh good job with color coordination here so if I had to describe this one I definitely say very open and chill it seems like a very nice clean space overall the entire room like ice out that massive window there you have all that natural light coming in filling the room as well and it's also worth noticing the cable management job here with the IKEA Signum rack underneath keeping on the cables off the ground nice and tidy definitely goes a long way so good stuff all around here mark now we've got howdy-do T and this is a really great example of you know doing a lot and optimizing what space you have so look at this desk it's probably a 30 inch doesn't quite look like a 48 inch desk so you have the essentials everything you need to keep the setup running right here freed up space by having a floor lamp and a little plant on the right to add some color now for the display this is a dell ultrasharp au 25 18d 2560 by 1440 and it's sitting on a monitor arm that gets mounted off to the back side of the desk so again it's not taking up actual real estate on the actual desktop now for is peripherals the keyboard is from rama's the m60 a he has zeal rogelio switches that are spring swapped with gather on Yellow Springs in the key caps you see our gmk oblivion r1 and for his mice he actually uses a combination of three different ones for productivity he has the Microsoft modern Mouse in conjunction with the Apple Magic Trackpad 2 which sits underneath the keyboard and for gaming he switches it up to the BenQ and Zowie EC to be davina mousepad is the ninja FX high in artisan and those IMS are the shure se215 now for the pc a nice and tiny ITX build off to the left side this case is a new Volos deck in size at AMD rise in 3600 cpu with an active NHL 12s cooler got 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance lpx Ram on the asus x4 7 TI motherboard in a gtx 1070 TI bounders Edition graphics card so again good job of keeping the desktop clear of anything unnecessary you have the main gear everything right here and I love how the gear has style you know the 60% around my keyboard the small ITX build even the custom rainmeter wallpaper I'm digging it I'm digging it yo what's up guys I'm kitty HD here and this is my setup currently for 2020 the first couple days of 2020 thanks for having me on first of all ok so this is a type of setup that changes many times during the year a lot of little thing as well little tweaks will eventually change but a couple of main staples have stayed here for a while first thing is the chair this is a Herman Miller embody I've had this for years and the other is this desk this entire mass is set up it has to be big enough to hold two monitors and two monitors this is an x desc err Pro it is a motorized desk so it does raise up to standing height which I'll do right now and this thing's been a tank it does have power built into the bottom which I have a lot of things plugged into and not ideal cable management right now because hey in the video world not everything is perfect but I'll go ahead and show you the Mac Pro that's down here is the one that I've been reviewing and editing with you can see the SD card reader sticking up there is in perfect position um up here are two of Apple's Pro display XD arse both of these are the Nano texture matte version and then to the size of these I've also had these for years actually Yamahas HS eights on top of these oral x foam out isolation pads if you put this straight on the desk of a rattle so that's what these are for this is Pegasus is promised Pegasus 80 terabyte raid so a bunch of hard drives in here connected it straight to the Mac Pro this is why there's a lot of cables and I have a wireless charger here and a wired charger for my phone so whatever phone I'm using can be charged up color wear black ear pods pro this is going great and I have a some battle scars on this desk some heavy things have come through here over the time that I've been using it so it's not exactly pristine but that's the whole point of using something everyday my mouse and keyboard so this is a the current Mouse of choice but again like I said things change all the time this is the glorious pc gaming race model Oh in matte black the small one but uh I just recently switched because my MX master III was giving me some connection problems so this is a wired mouse for my first time in a while so far so good it's on a red artisan mouse pad this is a key con k2 k3 k2 with a couple fancy custom switches from our custom key caps from other keyboards but I like their little red ascends Escape key and a black magic trackpad too you have the universal audio Apollo twin which is essentially a big fancy volume knob but it's all so the preamps to these Yamahas and if I ever do use headphones it's a sin hazard HD 8 20s over here's some media microfiber a little iPad stand but that is the current set up early January 2020 this will of course continue to evolve I should also mention there's some some isolation pads for audio as well I'm over here editing and that's a Logitech 4k webcam okay that's it thank you so much catch you guys later alright guys I'll wrap it up for episode 200 of room tour project hope you all enjoyed and a big shout out and thank you to
