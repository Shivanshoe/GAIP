what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under 50 dollars for january the series we show off some of the best tech you can buy under that price point if you see anything you'd like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and shout out to last month's winners i'll be in contact with you so you can claim your tech and if you want to win something from today's episode all you got to do is comment down below your favorite item why you like it and then leave a big thumbs up now first up we have a 24 pin rgb cable for your pc this one is from xpg it's called the prime argb this is obviously what connects your motherboard to the power supply to give it power in the first place but this is just meant to be a visual addition to add some extra flair to your build this rgb extension cable has 12 fiber optic sleeves on top of the other 12 white braided cables underneath and once powered it comes to life getting it connected takes like five seconds you literally just connect this to the end of your 24 pin cable already or if you have an extension like i do you can just replace that and this can either be powered solely through the attached rgb header if you have a compatible motherboard or you can use the included sata cable to power this which also gives you a controller module to change up the effects and speed there are eight different built-in lighting modes plus static colors you just want the cable to illuminate you know without any fancy flashes and again whether you choose to plug this into an rgb header on your motherboard you can control it through your motherboard software it's compatible with like asus gigabyte msi asrock boards or use that controller extension now the only real downside to this is the lights fire up from only the one end instead of evenly illuminating across the whole cable and these are kind of hard to come by right now i know leon lee also has their shimmer plus cables but both that and this one from xpg have been going in and out of stock like crazy so if you can manage the snag one of these when it's available do so i picked it up from around 48 msrp third-party sellers are inflating the price a bit but again find it in stock you'll be on your way to adding some more lights and rgb to your build if you so desire next up is a lifesaver for you photography and videography fans out there this is a two-in-one filter it's both a cpl and an nd filter in ones as you can see it's very very adjustable this one from newer is a 77 millimeter thread so this attaches on the front of my sigma 50 mil it's the art series f 1.4 so i attach this on the front of my lens and get a lot of flexibility when it comes to you know getting the most out of my image and obviously depending on what lens you're using you can get different sizes for those threads so on the actual filter itself the top ring with the pins in it that's for adjusting between the five stops of built-in nd from nd2 to 32 so you can pick you know a certain level that complements your image this allows you to open up more to get a more shallow depth of field and then add the nd to avoid blowing out your image and the whole unit itself is also adjustable that's for your cpl which is a circular polarizing filter this allows you to nearly eliminate reflections from things like lights on a product box reflections off glass reflections off water so for example you can see the reflection here on the side of my timber glass side panel for my pc you can see that when i turn the filter itself it completely eliminates that glare and now you can see through the glass a lot easier this is just a perfect use case for it glare just disappears another example here you can see the glare on the keyboard and the sheen on my desk which is just reflecting the light off the soft boxes in my studio so turning that cpl filter makes the image just looks better more matte and flat versus that reflection you saw which made the details of the desk the details on the keyboard a lot harder to see and again for visual comparison this is how it looks without the help of the filter i'll take it a step further for you guys with this stream in my backyard you can easily see the reflections from the sky on top of the water and just like that like magic it's gone you can see right into the stream it's just a more clear image now and then real quick for the nd this is pretty self-explanatory but just to show you uh me in front of a window here my face is all blown out way too overexposed but then you can see when i adjust that nd to take down the highlights it allows me to keep the camera still at f 1.4 while still having that steady bow cut in the background so i adjust the light with the filter without having to touch my camera settings it's built really well weather sealed aluminum alloy frame and it's also going to help protect the glass in your lens because it sits in front of it if anything happens this will take the beating for you so a really clutch product to add to your camera arsenal and uh definitely worth it i think this was 50 bucks but again this is the 77 millimeter version for my lens so depending on your lens and your thread size all together it may adjust in price but this one was 50. now next up hang with me because the product is admittedly boring in idea but just genius in execution so let me paint you a picture okay you want to push that drawer back or you want to push that entertainment center back with your tv against the wall but there you can't there's that outlet behind there the the extension cable coming out you're dealing with like a three or four inch gap right that's annoying you just want to push this flush against the wall but you can't balance also hard to get to you can't easily unplug something from there and that's where this slim outlet socket cover extender comes into play and it is a lifesaver sounds boring again but like i said genius where has it been all my life so i know for me and my house there's at least two areas where i could be using this right now one's an entertainment center and the other is a dresser and i just can't push it back because the damn outlet so with this you plug it into the wall but with the extension cable you still have access to those outlets now and you don't have to worry about reaching behind trying to fiddle with it i feel like i'm not even doing this justice by explaining it you get the idea you understand what this is it does also come with some cable organizers which is nice if you want to have the cable routed nicely down the wall as well as some labels if you want to you know label which plug is which this was only like 25 bucks and it's definitely worth it okay next up you guys know i'm a big keyboard guy whether it's gaming keyboards or custom builds you know how it is and i understand that when i show off you know keyboards under 50. a lot of times they're 60 they're crazy rgb and while that's you know appealing to a lot of people out there there's also an equal amount of people out there who do not like that so i found a pretty good bridge keyboard to get you started into customizing it stuff this from velocifier is an 87 key keyboard and as you can see it's also wireless it has white leds and i think just for the price of i think it was like 46 dollars it's a really great starter to get you into keyboards swap out the stock keycaps put on a different set like i have here and be on your way so the reason i chose this over others out there is again there's no crazy rgb for people who don't like that just white leds but also the 87 key layout here is something that i prefer because you do have more keys than 60 just allowing you to do more with the keyboard so stock is a very simple looking keyboard it has those plain stock keycaps but what i did and again a nice bridge into getting into custom keyboards is if you can find a cheap set out there or a set you might already have from a different keyboard swap them out with this replace it and i think the simple all matte look of the keyboard itself really can complement whatever sort of key set you want or use not want you get what i'm saying and again it is wireless so it does come with a bluetooth dongle if you want to just use this wirelessly over bluetooth with your pc but there's also the charging port on the back side which is usbc so if you choose you can also pick up a custom coil cable and really start to make this looking like a completely custom build even though it's not it costs you 50 bucks you can pick this up in a few different switch types we have it in red for this unit and switches on the shell itself says ttck so see visually nice and customized and we'll do a sound test of the ttck reds i just think all in all for a starter mechanical keyboard for those who don't like rgb for those who don't like 60 layouts this one from velocifire is pretty damn good for between 48 to 50 bucks and last but not least is something that you may have just seen and that is this hyperx wrist rest but the thing that makes this interesting is they have this cooling gel inside so it's a very cool to touch wrist rest which depending on where you live there's a lot of humidity um having a cool wrist when you're typing or gaming cools you down i picked this up during the summer months again when it was humid and the cooling gel inside mixed with the memory foam rest itself is just a really cool comfy combo the size is big enough to fit a full extended keyboard the bottom base is also all rubber so it won't slip around on your desktop and in terms of branding you can slightly see the hyper rack sort of embossed into the actual cloth it's barely noticeable they do have the red stitching around the side so depending on your color theme that might be a deal breaker i personally don't care at all it's just a really cool wrist rest and i mean that literally not in the cringy sense like it feels cool to the touch which i think is a really nice addition it's only 20 bucks as well so i figured what the hell i'll try it out and i really liked it and i've been using it for the past like six months so alright guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for january the 1st of 2021
