what's up guys i'm random frank p and today's video for whatever reason is very highly requested i've had a lot of people asking me to do an updated edc video so this time around we're gonna have a bit of a twist this is gonna be my minimal blackout edc now obviously we're in the middle of a pandemic right now i'm not going out every single day nor am i necessarily even bringing these with me every time i go out each one's obviously gonna have a different use case depending on where i'm going what i'm doing and again even though edc is everyday carry you get the idea given the circumstances so everything you see everything i go over will be listed for you in the description down below in case you want to check it out look at the boring stuff out of the way starting off with my phone but what's not boring about it is the skin so this is the iphone 11 pro max you know it's great for what it is it's a content creator gets the job done however what i'm really digging about this is the new pewdiepie collaboration skin from dbrand but this as you can see is the triple blackout version so i'm a big topographic guy you know it's kind of like what i'm into sounds stupid um even though this isn't technically topographic it still fits that theme so it kind of has that look to it and i'm just really digging the sort of gloss on matte accent here it just looks really really good and you're familiar with d brand they have tons of different skins for all your devices different colors textures uh but when i saw this one i knew i had to pick it up add it to the phone again it's not technically topographic but uh it's close enough it looks good and going along with that we'll just get the less interesting things out of the way and then onto the better stuff uh i recently actually during the summer i picked up the airpods pro for a flight and they really surprised me how good the sort of background elimination was and the isolating the background noise on here i just have this like three dollar silicone sort of shell from amazon you know it's whatever protects it from drops and stuff like that and also i cannot stand the stock silicone ear tips so i have these black memory foam ones don't remember what the brand is necessarily but they just fit better in my ears and again just the black ear tips with the black silicone case adds a nice you know accent kind of breaks it up from that all-white apple look uh so like i said three four bucks for the silicone case gets the job done all right next we'll just talk keys real quick again get this out of the way nothing real fancy going on here still sticking to the blackout vibe uh the organizer and the key ring i have is from orbit key and you may notice this thing this is a recent edition um i don't even know what it's necessarily called this was again a cheap little pickup on amazon but because of the pandemic you know this is supposed to like open doors and stuff like that but it has these touch uh these silicone little tips at the end and you know i'm a big wawa guy i go to wawa a lot all right so with the touch screens there if i'm ordering food or coffee you use this you press it you don't gotta open the door you know avoid touching things you use this you open it up it sounds dumb but honestly i use it a lot more than i thought i would just fits right on my keychain and i think it was like seven dollars on amazon just a little addition to the edc okay next we'll talk about the wallet which is probably the main thing when it comes to an edc this i am loving so i've done a lot of different videos kind of regarding edc and stuff like that and you guys probably know i change up my wallets a lot this is the ridge wallet and i have it in the forged carbon sort of style and i think it looks super nice it's very lightweight as well and it does a great job of keeping that minimalist vibe as a wallet so if it's up to 12 cards inside i really just carry like the main ones that i need with me this one also has the included cash belt in front so if i want to you know carry some bills with me i can it keeps it nice and snug but i just love the thin form factor here um and it's just a really nice change up from some of the thicker wallets that i've used over the years even though i've tried to keep it minimal this one definitely uh is has been my favorite hands down and one of the things i also picked up because i am someone who will lose my wallet all the time i've showed off in different videos you know wallet trackers and stuff and as you can see this one is the size of a credit card this one is from in way and it's essentially a small bluetooth tracker there's an app on your phone and it connects to your phone via bluetooth but it still actively tracks it so say you lose your wallet somewhere it'll show you gps location of where you were last in contact with your wallet and it's great i never really lost my wallet out but i lose around the house a lot but this is going to you know help me put a little bit of my mind at ease if i do ever lose it out and something is so small it's also rechargeable which is really cool but yeah everything inside the ridge wallet they sent this over to me to check out i loved it and i've been using it ever since if you guys want to pick one up you can if you use code frank p at ridge.com frank p it'll save you 10 and that's free worldwide shipping and stuff and again i just love the look here minimalist and it's the forged carbon color way i think is really really nice now next is something that i will bring with me if i'm going out on a day trip if i'm going somewhere overnight or out on a shoot and this is the orbit key nest and this is super awesome when i saw it i knew i had to pick it up so it's pretty much this carrying case organizer the top of it is actually a built-in wireless charger but then you open it up and inside is where you can fit a bunch of things and just really keep it nice and organized so in this particular unit like i said i just you know bring it with me if i'm going out like a day shoot anything like that or if i am going somewhere like i'm saying in a hotel i can pack a lot of things in here and it's also a great like desktop gadget since it is can keep everything you know nice and organized plus it doubles as that wireless charger regardless some of the things in here that i've showed off uh this is a little task knife from grove made i also have their gold version i get a lot of comments about that but i'm when i was doing the blackout planning and stuff i knew i wanted to pick this up so uh love that fits in great super nice looking as well i've seen a lot of youtube videos recommended to me when it comes to edc and everyone has like a nine mil and a knife so i figured this blackout edc fits it a hundred percent uh some other things real quick that i just have in here for like a day trip i showed off cable card in two or three videos by now but this little guy is just jam-packed with features this itself is a wireless charger it has a built-in cable built-in flashlight it also can triple as a micro sd card reader so you put the micro sd card in here plug this into your pc it'll transfer files it's a phone stand the cable card is clutch for like 35 40 bucks definitely a huge fan of that tiny little notebook if i'm ever out when i'm like jotting down video ideas or shots that i need for a video nice and tiny fits in right here i think it's like three and three by like five inches maybe tend to go along with that i don't have a fancy edc pen that's like a hundred bucks i see a lot of that as well very expensive pens i'll just use what i have you know not a big deal and then uh with this this is the seagate one touch this is an external hard drive it's super super tiny i guess it's actually classified as like a portable ssd but as you can see this is super small so if i am going out on a shoot i want to transfer files to my laptop or whatever this is my go-to for that and on top of the actual orbit key nest has some pockets and stuff i don't have it filled right now but i got my cables in here and like i said it's just really really useful and with the included cable if you plug it into a pc or an outlet this top right here doubles as a wireless charger which is really cool which is why like i said if you want to also use this as a desktop gadget you can and i haven't seen really anything like this out there so when i did first see it i was like okay i need this and it is awesome big shout out to orbit key for making this and uh it's super cool super cool also as we wrap this up um i'm not going to show off like a my laptop or the ipad and stuff because i've shown those things off before those are kind of a given when i'm going out but my main backpack my gear bag which is probably too big for that overhead shot this is the wandrid provoke i've mistakenly called it the wandered peak in videos in the past where i've showed this off and i've brought this with me on numerous trips it is pretty big but also pretty compact at the same time it folds out it expands it is a great great backpack it's been my go-to use this a lot holds up really nicely looks still brand new like i said i showed this off in some videos but that is hands down my go-to backpack wandred provoke and then lastly it's not necessarily blackout but i'm always i've said in my back to school video um i just have a thing with different types of water bottles and canteens this one from iron flask even though it's not technically black out i think this is called like the midnight shadow edition where it's black and then it transitions and fades into white i think it's really nice water is essential drink your water drink a lot of it and when i saw this on amazon i was like listen i have a problem collecting canteens and water bottles and this is only going to fuel that even further so pick that up as well so that pretty much wraps it up like i said not everything is going to fit in my pocket obviously when i'm going out somewhere but each of these have a different use case for where i'm going what i'm doing and i think the orbit key is kind of the exception to that because this is what i'll bring with me when i'm traveling you know for an occasion so i get this pack it with gear accessories stuff like that little gadgets put it in the backpack and then i'm good to go so like i said if you want to check anything out i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below and guys that'll wrap it up for my minimal blackout edc hope you enjoyed if you did give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp at last if you haven't already hit that
