what's up guys i'm random frank p and straight up i was wrong you were right so for the past few months i have been getting relentless questions asking why i haven't checked out the razer g502 jk the razer basilisk ultimate and i think the reasoning behind that is because this came out just a few days or weeks after the viper ultimate came out and that's been my main mouse since released so i think it was kind of like out of sight out of mind i didn't pay attention to this because i was content with the viper ultimate but i say that because you guys know i would go to war for the g502 i've been using this in previous iterations of it since 2014. so for five years i was used to this in this shape and then you look at the basilisk ultimates and they pretty much are the same shape they're twinning a hundred percent so for people who've used this and loved it can you say the same for the basilisk ultimate yes this mouse flew under my radar 110 so in terms of physical appearance i already alluded to it but the shape is damn near identical to the g502 it's ergonomic has that thumb rest on the left side the angular and aggressive left and right paddles all that jazz and also when talking physical appearance it is 130 millimeters long 75 millimeters wide which also includes the thumb rest but without it just the width of the actual body 62.5 millimeters wide and it stands 42 millimeters tall on my scale it comes in at 106 grams which is a bit lighter than the g502 light speed at 114 grams so for those dimensions it is definitely on the medium to larger side of a gaming mouse however i'm still firmly in the camp that you know a heavy mouse isn't going to make you a worse gamer but i get in today's craze of lightweight mice that yes these are kind of out of shape if you will as for some of the other physical features we have 11 total buttons here and on the left side above where your thumb sits there's this little piece of rubber that comes off giving you the potential to add their optional pretty much paddle here we've seen this on the previous basilisk mice and on the g502 this is their sniper button but this you can obviously program to be whatever you want both the left and right side of the mouse has this really nice rubberized texture to it for enhanced grip your thumb just sits perfectly in that groove there big fan of that and yes as you can see we do have some rgb lighting the scroll wheel lights up the razer logo obviously illuminates and we have a strip on both the left and right side although that right side strip is kind of pointless because it is so small there no one's ever gonna see that but yes we do have rgb flipping the mouse over we have six feet that are definitely equivalent to hyperglide this is the 100 virgin ptfe very very smooth helps your mouse just coast along a mouse pad surface you can see on the top and bottom plus underneath the thumb rest there where that fin kind of sticks out and around the sensor your on and off button to the left and above that is a profile switcher another interesting thing to note is the resistance wheel so if you want it you know slower and super tactile you can adjust that or if you want it you know nice and smooth and silent you can adjust to that as well or find a happy in-between spot we don't have anything close to what the g502 provides with their hyper scroll which is kind of a bummer yeah but i do like the option to really customize it and fine-tune it you'll see under the sensor we have the two contact points for hooking this up to the dock and what this dock does is it lets you pretty much charge this when you're not using the mouse you set the mouse on the metallic contacts and then it will automatically charge your mouse for you now the mouse features the same technology from the viper ultimate which includes their 20 000 dpi focus plus optical sensor and their optomechanical switches inside which are rated for 70 million clicks i'll do a sound test now so you could hear all the goods of the mouse now i just want to talk about my experience with it and how it felt to game spoiler very good and almost nostalgic to a point there's just something to be said about muscle memory it's quite incredible how your body can just naturally adjust to things and pick up where it left off and since the grooves and the shapes are just so identical to the g502 using this was like you know it was like home you know what i'm saying since i used that mouse for five years it just felt natural in my hand so when switching over to a mouse like this there was absolutely no delay i felt like i was still using that mouse but now since we technically have a more reliable updated technology in the basilisk ultimate it's gonna perform better and you could just you know roll your eyes at that but the fact is it is 25 faster than what logitech uses in their light speed technology also due to their optical switches versus just traditional mechanical switches in most gaming mice since these are using the infrared beam to detect when you actually press down on the clicks that signal is immediately sent to your pc and again you can roll your eyes but it is true the technology they use here is superior and on my desk just for reference i even had the g502 light speed on as well as my viper ultimate so there were three different wireless peripherals on my desk and there was no problems which is definitely good thing to see because that means that like lands and stuff if you're at a party and there's other people with wireless mice typically there would be some sort of interference or issues but that was not the case at all long time users and lovers of the g502 you're not gonna skip a beat with the basilisk ultimate now one of the more annoying things with a razer and their mice is the fact that you do need synapse and let's face it it's just annoying to have to need and rely on software um so once you get that all downloaded you can go in and configure it and you can save some profiles it's kind of limited you could save your dpi settings and stuff to this but it does not save your actual lighting profiles so for those used to synapse you can go in you can remap the the buttons on the mouse and stuff and that's one of the first things i did like i mentioned i changed the toggling of the dpi for those two buttons below the scroll wheel i just changed one to cycle and the other one on the bottom to be pausing music and stuff for spotify i don't know in that additional paddle that they have i've always been used to that being a sniper button but i changed that to their hyper shift so i could pretty much access like a secondary row of functions and stuff now i don't really use it too often and it is kind of slightly out of place i wish it was a bit closer to my thumb uh but it is their favorite need to remap those to like i said some secondary functions next is the performance tab for obviously adjusting your sensitivity so your dpi setting the stages as well as the pulling rate i just have two dpis um on the mouse because that's just the way i prefer it i don't want to accidentally toggle it and have it go all crazy amounts so i just have one at 450 which is what i've been testing this mouse on on a particular mouse pad and the second one at 600 which is my my native dpi if you will and then for rgb this is again it's the same stuff you can add the preset effects make it you know the wave the rainbow do a static color breathing in and out but since you have 14 individual zones here for both the left and right strip the mouse wheel itself and then the logo you can change those independently as well so you can have certain effects on certain areas of this mouse if i were you i would keep it just at like 10 brightness help that battery speaking of battery this is rated for 100 hours which is definitely better than the viper ultimate that is obviously with lighting turned off so if you keep lighting like i said ten percent on don't don't be doing anything too crazy in terms of lights you're still going to be getting phenomenal battery life out of this i've been using this now for two weeks and just from being used to the diaper ultimate i have been putting it back on the dock but i think the most i've seen it get down to is 70 so you're not gonna have any issues with this battery life which is definitely good for a wireless mouse you can also help extend the battery life in the power tab and synapse by the wireless power saving which is like how many minutes this stays idle until the mouse completely turns off to help save battery same with the low power mode once it gets below a certain percentage and then real quick is the calibration tab for adjusting to your mouse pad the smart tracking pretty much calibrates your mouse pad surface and the asymmetric cutoff will pretty much determine your liftoff distance automatically for you so bringing it all together my experience has been a 10 out of 10. i love this mouse i definitely feel bad for overlooking it i wish i would have looked at it earlier and used it but at the same time i'm still very content with my viper ultimate because of the main difference there is the weight so while yeah 106 107 grams is going to be still more than people want nowadays for me it's not a big issue but it obviously would have been nice to have that cut down a bit the only thing that i really really wish this included that we have on the g502 is that scroll wheel with the hyper scroll it's uh something special for sure but yeah now this mouse is not cheap and it's not for everybody this comes in at 170 with the gaming dock so that is definitely pretty pricey it's all going to depend on your financial situation and how fat your wallet is so i mean it's definitely a good mouse and if you do pick it up you're not going to have buyer's remorse and they also sell a different basilisk x hyper hyperspeed version which is a battery operated bluetooth version as well which kind of does do away with all the good features that makes the basilisk ultimate worth it so you have no adjustable scroll wheel there's no rgb like you don't have that additional paddle to add to the mouse there's no hyper glides it's a 16k optical sensor but it's much cheaper at just 60 and the battery life here is pretty crazy for up to 450 hours over bluetooth or if you want to use the hyper speed dongle that comes with it you get 285 hours they say but yeah talk to your wallet first see how it's feeling and all right guys that'll wrap it up if you want to check any of these mice that i showed off today out obviously including the basilisk ultimate i have it for you in the description down below if
