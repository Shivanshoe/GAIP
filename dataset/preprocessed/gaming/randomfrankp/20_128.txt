we'll have the clean and minimal edition always a fan favorite if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you right down in the description so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 237 this episode's sponsored by the corsair hs70 bluetooth headset if you're looking for a wireless gaming headset under 100 that works for it all mac pc xbox ps5 your switch your phone your mom anything they got you covered with the hs70 bluetooth it's got great sounding custom tuned 50 millimeter neodymium drivers a fully detachable noise canceling uni-directional microphone and stellar build quality if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below first up liking all the plants here definitely adds some nice greenery to the setup overall and strana has going with the single monitor and as you can see peeking behind it something's mounted as well so for his display is a deco gear 35 inch ultra wide and behind it is an echo dot and a laptop mounted on the wall an hp 15-inch elitebook so in addition to his gaming pc on the left side as you can see the laptop there he can probably you know dock in dock out as he needs checking out his peripherals nice and simple here especially with that like sort of muted color theme going on the keyboard is the kikron k6 rgb and he also has the razer basilisk x hyper speed wireless mouse on an extended rgb mouse pad from aukey but you could see in the daytime he keeps it off nice and simple at night time the rgb comes on for audio way back peeking behind the plants are his speakers the logitech z5 and also hanging off the side of the desk are the skullcandy aviator headphones also what seems to be a hard drive cage mounted there underneath the desk and speaking of which a quick little peek a pretty good job in terms of cable management really nothing hanging down onto the floor now they could check out the pc over on the left side this is the leon lee lancool 2 mesh case inside an amd ryzen 5 5600 x cpu with the stock cooler 32 gigs of g-scale trident z rgb ram on an msi mag x 570 tomahawk motherboard with an asus rtx 3080 strix graphics card definitely a nice and clean looking build a great job with the braided cables and routing them as well he does have the components on the left side here since the pc is off on the left you can't really see it but then on the right side you could see a little five inch display he has mounted on the other side of the side panel so he could you know monitor temps usage all that kind of stuff so a definite clean and minimal organized setup and i like how it's like completely different at nighttime versus daytime like they look like two completely different setups but i'm loving this shot with the chill earthy vibes it has next up we have cookie curls and yes this is a female submission i know we don't get too many of them so it's really nice when we have this variety of setups and this one just looks fantastic i love the organization here everything you can see has its place and it just fits so well together checking it out for the solo monitor is a 34 inch ultra wide from lg loving the color matching all around too from the roses to the matching wallpaper the mouse pad the candle and getting into some of her peripherals you can see those desktop speakers are the elac ub5 and the main set here has a really nice custom keyboard ability iron 165 fe in white with gmk olivia tangerine switches with tx 75 gram springs inside's also a copper plate with some dampening foam and a nice color matching custom coil cable and the mouse is the model d then also in the room i love her keyboard shelf to have them all on display and also with like accessories and gadgets that complements the look of the build so just checking some of them out she's got a tgr jane v2 a key cult number one iron 165 fe another iron 165 and a 0.9 this is a serious collection i love how it's on display and again everything on that shelf complementing each keyboard down to her pc not too much information in terms of the actual um hardware components and stuff but she does have an intel i7 5960x cpu with 64 gigs of ram and a nvidia gtx titan x this is also in addition to our macbook pro 16 inch which has an i9 processor 64 gigs of ram as well and an amd radeon pro 5900 for graphics this is also a really nice look from behind the setup you can see the great job on cable management as well everything kept nice and tidy and then across the room a 59-inch lg c9 oled tv really nice entertainment center here big old speakers man this entire room is just super clean even over to the spotless makeup vanity you gotta love it so i am loving this setup here from cookie curls in addition to the crazy keyboard collection uh i'm gonna put her channel down below she does really awesome sound tests of her keyboards and builds so definitely check it out but great great stuff here next is a nice and modern looking dual setup for min and his brother so the dual set up here side by side all sharing the one massive wooden desk held up by one of those ikea alex drawers i believe but in black so i like the faux sort of brick paneling in the back to contrast the black peripherals and accents throughout so the room very clean and organized i'll try to you know breeze through these since there's two setups here uh for the main it's the lg ultra wide the nice 34 inch here uh the peripherals for this desk setup are the kikron k2 keyboard with the logitech g304 mouse got the sony ch510 headphones and the jbl flip 3 sc speaker the pc is the ndxd h500 with an amd ryzen 5 2600 cpu the cooler master hyper 212 cooler with 16 gigs of g-scale tridenzi rgb ram msi b450m mortar max motherboard and an msi gtx 1660 ti graphics card and then the brothers build will just flow right along into it here we have the zigmatec athena case possibly with an amd ryzen 3 1200 cpu 16 gigs of core serve engines lpx ram on an azroc b450m pro 4 motherboard and an rg strix rx 570 gpu but for this setup over on the left side this is a dell 27 inch monitor with an rk61 keyboard and the logitech g102 mouse an lg xboom pk3 speaker so we don't typically show off dual setups like this because there's just too much gear to get to in the episode format but i think the way it all comes together here is really nice and simple so i did want to show it off and also a little collection of some keyboard builds and stuff i always appreciate some custom builds and yes everybody asking switch it up is coming back soon so yes the really nice brother set up here from mind d next is tom from bite review i'm sure you guys are familiar with him and his channel i've actually had him on a few times even a few months ago in 2020 this is 2021 setup going super minimal with just the laptop here uh this is the macbook pro 16 inch got an i9 cpu 16 gigs of ram a radeon 5500 m all docked in this nice wooden laptop stand but man just check out the simplicity i absolutely love it uh the monitor itself is a dell 27 inch it's their ultra sharp so it's gonna pair real nicely and for his peripherals he has a kikron k2 wireless keyboard with a nice baby blue mouse that's going to complement his wallpaper this is actually a microsoft surface mobile mouse so funny to see that paired with you know a macbook pro got a nice snake plant a homepod mini a link amiibo but i just think the color coordination here is 100 on point from literally as i just said matching the wallpaper to the blue and the mouse some of those like warmer tones from the sand and the wallpaper to pretty much almost the exact color finish for the desktop and again another peek around the room the nice mounted skateboard the pegboard everything here you can just tell is done with style so man bite review killing it once again i look forward to these yearly submissions of his super clean and minimal setups because he knows what's up next up we got mikey mike's eating his mike and ikes with the dual monitor set up here nice and simple side by side very symmetrical as well with that spanned wallpaper big old window for the ambient lighting you guys know i love that all white desk all white room pretty much very clean looking so for those two displays they are both identical they're a 27 inch from samsung the sr-35 kept up with a dual mount as you can see a great job of cable management as well nothing really on the desk utilizing wireless peripherals i just want to point out how i love this succulent stand down to his peripherals man this is like the keyboard of the series lately another kikron this the k2 v2 with a logitech mx vertical mouse and for this shot i just want to say i'm feeling these vibes here with the the cork mouse pad hard drive earbuds calendar like this is just a super nice looking shot here and then on each side of the desk for his speakers the razer nomo 2.0 speakers and for the pc this is from deep cool it's the magcube 110 case inside that amd ryzen 5 3400 g cpu with their wraith prism cooler 16 gigs of gigabyte aorus rgb ram on a gigabyte b450m gaming motherboard and the gigabyte gtx 1660 graphics card so lots of love the gigabyte call that some gigalove digging the red and white for the theme inside as well then also right next to the desk utilizing some of that natural light from the big old window is a display case with tons of collectibles and figures in there oh that looks really nice right off to the side but man yeah you know clean minimal ambient lighting you got the green literally behind the setup with that's the trees and the little little succulent plant there so i'm definitely digging it fits the criteria all right guys that'll wrap it up
