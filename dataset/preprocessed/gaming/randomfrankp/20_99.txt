what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for may the series we show off some of the best tech you can find under that price point see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but also shout out to last month's winners i've been in contact with you so you can claim your tech you guys crushed it last month so i picked 10 winners today and if you want to win comment down below your favorite item leave the video a thumbs up and obviously make sure you're subscribed i'm only going to pick subscribers to the channel now first up this thing is actually dope it's called the sofa baton weird name but it's awesome and with recent news about the logitech harmony remote being discontinued this guy takes its place it replaces all of my remotes around the house pretty much all into this one sofa baton literally my lg tv remote android shield the amazon fire stick my vizio sound bar even two rgb light remotes all replaced right into this it has all the buttons like a usual remote does but built it up top is a little lcd screen which you can go through and pick and choose what the source is for what you want to control so you can go through all your devices visually there on the screen there's also an app which keeps track of everything this is where you can pair your remote whether it's searching their database for a device using bluetooth to connect or via the infrared light beams in the app itself you select which button on the u1 remote you want to then change or reassign then within three or four inches you aim the remotes at each other and press the button you want the u1 to learn it soaks up all the infrared rays and now it's on your new remote so instead of needing like three different remotes i can just use it all right here on one turn on the tv navigate it through there control and power by nvidia shield audio it's all done here and it's really annoying but i'm sure a lot of you have your own cable box remote in addition to your tv remote so now combine them all into one and one of the things you can do in the app in addition to reassigning every single button on here is create macros for certain buttons on the remote i don't know what you would need a macro for on a remote maybe like different inputs switching and putting in different i guess channels but you can do it i don't know why but you can do it one thing i discovered that i didn't even see they really advertised is with my rgb lights up in my studio since everything there has their own remote and it shows you know the tiny infrared remotes i figured hey would that work and it does so upstairs i can reassign all the rgb to this remote itself i even did a thing where on the remote it has the red green yellow and blue little buttons there and i assign those to actual the rgb lights it's little stuff like this that just makes us even more of a valued item i guess and we'll say that with rgb lights it is kind of finicky at points you can now walk around your house like matilda so as you saw six of my remotes now all conveniently stacked into just one remote with the sofa baton you won very very convenient and totally 45 dollars next i know the ps5 is still hard to come by but sock is becoming more available if you have one currently or you're planning on getting one this all-in-one nexigo dock bundle is a must-have it holds games charges your controllers has two built-in fans for heat dissipation has an extra usb port if you need it plus comes with a wireless battery pack for your controller so taking a closer look built in on the left side by the fans are two usb-c ports here you conveniently set your controllers down and have them actively charging at all times so you never run out of juice plus it gives them a nice place to stay when you're not using it then on the right side of the dock are slots to sit 11 games i currently only have two but hey as the library grows they'll be kept here nice and tidy then also included for you is that 1 500 milliamp hour battery pack that gives you an extra 10 hours instantly of power for your controller it just sits right up top it's pretty small overall it doesn't affect the overall ergonomics of the controller or anything and again just having all this bundled together with the dock i think is a crazy good deal and plus like i said the main point of this is to act as a cooling station with the built-in fans and i haven't had any heating issues with the ps5 as it is so honestly i just keep them turned off but at least it's there if i ever need to use them everything in this next ego bundle is just 45 all right you're gonna like this one now i'm sure a lot of you are also in the keyboard community like myself and one of the hardest parts is finding an in-stock key set whether it's a group buy it's years away you don't want to spend 200 for a crazy overpriced gmk set what about for under 50 bucks designing your own set oh yes this is where max keyboards comes in they allow you to create and customize your very own custom keycap set just like i did here for my custom grid 600 keyboard literally i picked the font the icons the layout everything here i created myself and they printed it and you can do this too with different colors different color keycap sets whether you want certain keys be certain colors or a font to be a certain color you literally have the complete control and freedom to design your own set the keycaps themselves max keyboard uses are abs and you can pick from 61 keys 87 or 104 for a 60 layout tkl or a full size and it's an oem key profile so it's compatible with cherry gadaron kale otemu razer corsair pretty much your standard mechanical stem so it's real quick i'll show you on the website itself you can pick between either the 61 key 87 or 104 both the 67 and 81 key are gonna be the two that fall under 50 you pick your bottom row layout i went 6.25 then your keycap print method it can be printed on the top the side both or blank and then you upload your artwork they do have a template you download in which you go in and design it so they can just easily print it off for you again you pick your font you pick whatever you want in here your colors you create it yourself and they print it for you for just 45 or 47 dollars comes conveniently packaged for you so you can just take them off put them on your keyboard and now you have your very own custom keycap set to match any keyboard or setup theme you have for under 50 bucks now buckle up because here we have the govi flow rgb light bars and these are literally just like the philips hue play light bars but you don't have to spend a ridiculous 200 and you don't need a dedicated separate hub hey phillips suck it these are 50. so built-in is a module where you can control the lights but obviously with their govi app that's where you can really customize the effects and the colors to get the most visually out of these flow light bars they have preset scenes in the app you can make it static colors have it pulse and go along the music on your phone or with the built-in microphone on the light bar module if you're using these around your room it can react to audio going on in your room but the functionality the customization it's all here for what i think is a crazy good price point and obviously with the majority of us here being gamers yes you add these to your desk setup and you can do so in a few different ways to really spice up the looks so first it comes with four stands two of them are for sending the lights up vertically so you can shine and blast lights onto the wall behind your monitor this way the light's gonna go blend nicely and give it that nice ease of contrast from your display to the wall i've always been a fan of backlitting like this just looks really nice or if you want if you just hit them on your desktop and have the lights shining right there blinding you in the face or again just turn them around face them towards your wall you do what you want listen you're the captain of the ship no one's going to tell you what you can or can't do with rgb lights but what i prefer to do and i think it's definitely the smart choice here is mount them on the back side of your monitor it comes with two extra mounts with the 3m adhesive on the back this lets you mount it on your monitor like this in this way it'll free up that desk space if you don't want them physically sitting on your desk or on your stand and now it's going to give you that nice ambient backlighting that i just think can really elevate a setup as i mentioned i picked these up for just 50 just saw recently they were up to 55 currently the gobi is always dropping the price on amazon so odds are you can find them at the extra five bucks off either way 50 55 definitely worth the price i'm sure it'll be cheaper soon and there's a much much better deal than phillips and then last but not least is my favorite headset from all of 2020 and it's one of the top selling gaming headsets in the entire gaming market from the last year this the razer black shark v2x and now as you can see switch to the mic so you can hear how it sounds during this entire portion so this released last summer and honestly sounds as good if not better than headsets two to three times this price and if you don't believe me check reviews of your other favorite youtubers out there they all repeat the same thing the value of this headset is absolutely insane inside it uses their very own razer triforce drivers they're 50 millimeters each and in terms of design i really like the simplicity to it it goes for that like pilot headset design it's very minimal looking you just have a mic mute button on the back of the ear cup and the left side's a built-in volume dial for controlling your audio what really stood out to me was the really good sounding spatial and directional audio for you know this stock stereo experience identifying footprints very very good with these for fps or competitive gaming bass impacts sound really nice but also inside the box they include a free codes you can go in and enable the 7.1 razer surround sound so you had that included here and also for being emulated also sounds phenomenal it's just crazy what razer is doing here with this the microphone they use here is their hyperclear cardioid it's on a goose neck so you can you know position it angle it in front of you and overall it's very very comfortable nice and lightweight no pressure points at all and i don't wear glasses anymore but when they are on absolutely zero pressure points very very comfortable even if you do wear glasses i am just extremely impressed like i said my favorite headset of all of 2020 now instead of retailing for 60 bucks which was already way more than fair down to 50 on amazon if you want to get them i think they have it renewed for just 40 bucks on amazon so a crazy good deal for a gaming headset if you're new to marketing to pick one up highly recommend the black shark v2 x and guys i'll wrap it up for
