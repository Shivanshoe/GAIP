what's up you llamas i'm random frank p back with episode 241 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if there's anything you'd like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 2 41. all right testing a new mic yet again today you know the routine let me know how you think it sounds so first we have oxygenx with a scandinavian inspired setup and as you can see tons and tons of green all around next to the setup on both sides bunch of natural ambient lighting and he said it's to kind of go for like the scandinavian theme so i think all together this nails those northern vibes for the gear you can see that massive display that is a phillips brilliance 49-inch monitor and underneath it he does have a secondary display which is his gaomin drawing tablet uh the exact model is the pd156 pro so it's not like a second monitor you know per se but it still helps them get that extra screen real estate and also to use for productivity and speaking of which this is not a quote gaming setup this is all powered off of this 20 20 16-inch macbook pro so for his line of work when it comes to productivity that's gonna help him get the job done along with the logitech mx keys wireless keyboard and the mx master 3 mouse on the steelseries quick prism mouse pad then for audio on his desktop his logitech z533 speakers got a blue yeti microphone and up tucked away on the shelf are his headphones which are the neurophones haven't heard of them before but i checked them out and they look pretty damn cool not gonna lie now at night time this setup completely transforms from you know the clean and earthy vibes to all the rgb so that's what you know the more gamer vibes come in here but still visually makes for a really cool looking setup altogether so oxygenix really really digging this one i've seen a lot of you know greenery when it comes to setups but this one's definitely up there now we've got duarte with a really nice triple monitor setup looking nice and organized as well with the floating appearance there having to mount it to the wall really nice job on that so for those three displays the primary is a 24 inch from benq and the two outer monitors are 24 inch ones from hp i say it a lot but i always appreciate a nice complimentary wallpaper especially one that's spanned across all three like this instead of people who just clone one single monitor so a really good job here spanning that looks great with everything combined taking a look down to the peripherals we have the razer black widow chroma keyboard with a corsair harpoon wireless mouse got the bose quietcomfort headphones there peeking off to the right and his speakers on each side are very interesting they're the harman kardon aura studio 2. i really like the design of them i've never tested them or heard them myself but they look killer especially with them being see-through kind of you know lets the rgb behind it shine through even more then tucked away under the desk is the nzxt h440 case definitely a classic with an amd ryzen 3700x cpu and the courser h60 cooler got 32 gigs of hyperx fury ram on an asus prime z 390p motherboard and gigabyte gtx 970 now i will say uh you might want to move that pc out a bit because the exhaust from your ai oh it's slimming right up against that backboard probably a bit toasty and then a quick shot on the opposite side of the room and i gotta say i'm liking the hanging edison bulbs around the bed the underglow there there's a joke to be made about the cat and the other term for one i'm just not gonna go there all right duarte i'm seeing you you're keeping the room nice and cozy the pinks and purples and oranges and the wallpaper imagine the rgb light and i like how everything else is like white and wooden so good accents really good tones all around now we've got eye technique and i apologize in advance our man submitted photos in a four by three ratio like it's 2007 so if any of them are crops oddly uh that would be why but either way he's still got a killer setup so as you can see there's a lot going on there's five total displays here and it's all powered off of one pc so he has sort of two separate setups that all is conjoined as one so for his primary setup we'll call it he has three msi monitors that are 24 inches 144 hertz a piece with a massive 58 inch 4k high sense tv mounted as the overhead then on the right side a 27-inch 144 hertz monitor from dell with a 43-inch 4k fire tv as the main display so that that is the overhead all right into some gear and hardware for his primary setup again for his keyboard is a custom linworks dollinger with gmk noel and the logitech g pro mouse in their special limited yellow colorway also he has the roku surround sound system which today i learned roku makes audio stuff then for the side setup an nk65 from novel keys in the watermelon colorway and seemingly no mouse over here then over to the pc we have a nice snow blind build from i buy power it's one of their popular pre-built with that screen pretty much for the side panel inside's an intel i5 9600k cpu got their own cooler 16 gigs of adata rgb ram and a gigabyte rtx 2070 for the graphics card but i really like the all white interior here looks real nice and clean and then a shot behind the setup you know a place to chill or relax you saw the ps5 next to his pc so i assume could sit back here chill for a bit get some console gaming done on that massive tv that's mounted above the setup so whether it is pc gaming console gaming six total displays he's got it all tons of rgb lifx tile panels nana leaf aurora panels as well all the rgb all the gear for my technique man oh man now we've got marijuana hope i said that right and he's got this crazy satisfying looking triple monitor setup that is just great in terms of symmetry the art behind it with the sound absorption looks like those um like wooden panels definitely looks more classy with the wooden blocks but man lots of good stuff here so getting into the monitors this primary is an asus tough it's 27 inches 144 to 165 hertz if overclocked 1440p and then the left and right monitor are each a dell 27 inch ultra sharp on each side he has some lights as well as you can see for streaming and stuff like the elgato what is that the key light and the key light air mounted there then for his main peripherals we have a logitech mx keys keyboard yet again with logitech mx master mouse the elgato stream deck and then for audio we have a rode nt usb microphone some wave master 2 pro speakers in white and the bose quietcomfort 35 series 2 wireless headphones over to the pc inside the nzxt h500 we have an intel i9 9900k cpu with a be quiet silent wings three for the air cooler with 32 gigs of core surveillance rgb pro ram an asus rog strix z390 gaming motherboard and nvidia rtx 2080 palette super jet stream graphics card man lots of good gear all around here for this setup and i like in the daytime what it is you know more so monotone lots of black and white going on the nice wooden desk really pops but then like you saw before with the nighttime all the rgb glowing different wallpapers it just comes to life for this crazy gaming and streaming setup that i think is just looking killer so great job bringing this all together but still making it look really nice and organized at the same time like i said in the beginning symmetry here that is pretty much everything when it comes to making a really pleasing looking setup for visuals and then lastly we've got aki from the philippines coming in giving a more simplified vibe like the small form factor pc there a nice condensed space but you can tell this when he gets down here it's business you know what i'm saying so forrest display is an aoc 24 inch at 144 hertz with a 32-inch sony bravia tv as the overhead there and then as for his peripherals he has these sky lung gk gk68xs keyboard and inside he has glorious panda switches not too sure on the keycap step but i like the custom coil-braided cable there matching it nice walnut wrist rest and then for the mouse the logitech g304 for some audio gear he has the altec lansing octane 7 speakers with the sony wh ch 710n headphones always convenient to say and then over to that nice looking pc it's the slider sm 560 case inside the ryzen 5 3600 cpu with an alpin phone black ridge cooler got 16 gigs of course of engines lpx ram on a gigabyte aorus b550i pro motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 2060 windforce oc gpu nice and compact just how i like them not what she said but all right aki i can tell you you're you have a fine eye for when it comes to you know design and stuff because even though it's a very you know simplified minimal setup the way it's all laid out put together you can tell a lot of thought was put into it it's all done really really nicely and you're doing a lot with a more compact space so i'm a big fan of what you did here this episode's sponsored by the corsair hs70 bluetooth headset if you're looking
