what's up guys i'm random frank p back with my favorite tech items of the month for may the series where i show you some of the favorite tech that i've been using behind the scenes if there's anything you'd like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and first up we're gonna start with one of my favorite custom controllers lately from colorware this is my very own custom ps5 controller i'm sure most of you already familiar with colorware i've actually showed off a custom g502 they painted me in the past but now with the ps5 controller fully hand painted and decked out just to my liking this was kind of showing off in the background of the cool attack under 50 for this month got a ton of questions about it so i did want to show it off for you guys so while there are replica shells you can pick up to kind of customize the look and color of your controller with this being all hand painted the quality is just second to none again these are not skins or vinyls this is hand painted on their website you can go in and sort of pick whatever product you want and with the ps5 has a full configurator there so you can individually pick certain parts of the shells the buttons the touchpad and create whatever sort of color combo you want color match it to your room your setup anything they have matte colors metallic colors it all can just look crazy if you want but i wanted to go for the white and black theme sort of an inverse color theme with a regular controller but i also wanted to have a nice topographic sort of pattern where the touchpad is so what i did for my setup was the body of the controller the buttons and the top touch pad are all a jet matte black and then the middle portion where that bottom shell is is a matte smoke white color and i think just the end result here looks absolutely killer loving the pattern there the nice black and white inverse look like i said and i know you can do custom engravings up top i don't know if you can actually do the actual like logos and patterns like i have here that might just be like for a creator thing honestly they sent this out to me because i saw mkbhd had his logo there i reached out sent them this and they sent this back looking killer but again it's one of my favorite products i've been gaming a lot of the ps5 lately been using this i just think it is like hands down one of the nicest controllers i've ever used sony killed it with this controller it is awesome and now it looks even better i think next is something that i didn't think i would use that much but i've been using it pretty much almost every day which is why i'm showing it off for you guys and that's remarkable too this is pretty much an all-in-one digital notebook there's no distractions there's no web browser no apps nothing just a digital notebook so i've talked about it a few times on this channel in the past but i do have like a notebook obsession like i'm constantly buying new notebooks because really everything that gets planned out for this channel whether it be video ideas scripts rough ideas for like a thumbnail or something i all jot it down in notebooks and they're just all over the studio so now i can consolidate it all into this right here remarkable too and yes i do have an ipad that i use but what makes this so special is the actual physical feel when you're writing on this it literally feels like paper and it is hands down the closest thing that i felt digitally to actually writing on paper it's just really really unique the display itself is kind of like that e ink so physically your handwriting looks exactly like it would one-to-one on paper you can also change the tool in which you're writing from like pen pencil marker highlighter all that stuff there's eraser tools resizing and rearranging tools it's all built in right here in the ui like i said you can take notes draw anything on here there's a bunch of templates and stuff built in but it's also really cool is you can load up pdfs on here i actually use this solely to fill out all my tax documents because i can load up pds sign them all here send them back via email you can also do things like convert whatever you're writing into text and then send that off as well the battery on this is also great i'm using this for over a week and i have more than 50 battery left on it it's super lightweight thin portable as you can see you can get different styluses for it different accessories and i will admit for what it is it is a bit overpriced i would say uh it's more expensive than i would have liked to pay for it however like i said this is something that i genuinely use almost every single day after when i first got it in thinking i really wouldn't use it that much but it is just very very useful if you're someone like me who is always writing things down you have tons of different notebooks you know jotting ideas sketches anything this has been a lifesaver next up most of you guys know i'm a big coffee guy and i don't typically splurge on big gifts for myself all too often however that was until i saw this fully automated coffee and espresso machine the latte go 4300 for me i always start my mornings with a cup or two of coffee just to get me going and if i don't then odds are i'm gonna be very unproductive that day but now with this the whole luxury is the whole automated process of having a drink fully created for you instantly this definitely comes in clutch lately at the press of a button this makes numerous drinks really without you having to do any work at all you just pick your drink customize the strength the amount the milk the froth then from there it does everything for you and honestly for me the convenience here is a real seller because in the middle of the day for example i'd just be more inclined to run the starbucks or something versus you know putting on a full pot and having most of it go to waste but now i can have my own starbucks on my counter so you can see here the milk was seamed automatically creates a nice head of froth as well and my macchiato is on its way to being made in under a minute's time looking delicious smelling delicious and i love how you can see all the layers from the milk the espresso crema the froth this model here makes eight pre-programmed drinks all controllable with a touch screen interface again you can adjust the amount the strength of the brew the amount of cream or milk you want there's also settings for making just hot water if you want to you know make tea or something or just steaming milk each of your drink settings are also stored to one of three profiles so instead of customizing your drink every single time you make it it learns your settings and saves it to your profile thought that was pretty cool for the coffee itself it does take both whole beans and grounds up topic to shoot for the grounds and the top surface is a hopper with a built-in ceramic grinder for the beans and it grinds it fresh for each individual drink you make you can adjust the fineness of the courses of the burr as well but at the end of the week or so inside it poops out 12 pucks into the little internal cartridge so cleanup is super simple and the side loading carafe for the water only has to be just scaled every 5 000 cups so when it comes to maintenance frilly it's super minimal and easy to use there's just nothing like that perfect cup of coffee in the morning you know what i'm talking about especially when you have that like perfect blender bean to go with it and

shipping is also included thanks again to trade for sponsoring now we have one of my favorite pickups you guys know i'm all about the macros dials knobs wheels all that good stuff this is the monogram creative console which are these modular pieces you can add and build up to create your very own editing deck or really use them to control anything on your pc you may remember a few years back if you've been a fan of the channel for a while they were called pallet gear i did a review back in 2016 i want to say these are a newer refresh with some newer additions so first this set is called the studio console they also sell packs with different controllers and modules but you can also pick up and add different pieces to it like i did here with picking up a slider set to add and that's what i really love about this it's the customization the freedom to really just create your own editing device that fits your setup or your workflow the sides are all magnetic so they just snap together and they connect via pogo pins to a magnetic pad on the side so really when it comes to configuring it again you can design and lay it out however you want what i like to do with my main setup is build them around my keyboard and use it just at an arm's reach so it's all going to fit in nicely on my desktop it doesn't take up too much space at all and i can have it here for the ease of access everything connects to the main core module which has a screen to display your profile or application along with two built-in buttons then from there you connect and build out i have these mainly for color correction and premiere pro with their lumetri color so again i can set the dials to be things like highlights correcting you know contrast color temperature color tint sliders are great as well for jogging a timeline or adjusting track volumes you can use these vertically or horizontally it's all configurable in their software which is a ton of customization for pretty much every single shortcut and function in the software you're using but you also do things like change the sensitivity of the modules and how quickly or slowly they perform that action for example the dials are able to be pressed in so you have a whole other set of functions when you want to actuate it but personally my favorite module is the orbiter this acts similar to a 3d joystick in a way with full x and y axis control as well as an infinite encoder ring built around it this is useful for not only like 3d modeling in cases like cad or also programs like unreal engine for game design but i use it for like i said before full color correction with my color wheels in premiere so i can physically adjust the colors in all 360 degrees it's just super convenient i love how customizable it is and it's definitely a killer pickup for photo editing video editing music production really anything and lastly is about that home gym that some of you have seen in recent videos i get a lot of questions about it so i'll give you the breakdown here upstairs my minimal office is tonal which is an all-in-one smart gym that is super compact as you can see it's just mounted right there on my wall has a 24 inch built-in touchscreen for navigating and it features over 170 workouts comes with the bench the bar rope handles for all different workouts and has some really cool features for training you can lift up to 200 pounds there's no racking or unracking traditional metal weights inside it's all done magnetically so when you're working out it provides resistance throughout the entire rep so you're getting more efficient and an effective workout and it sets your waist after every move and every workout so it's learning your power pretty much every time and adjust your weights going forward like i said over 170 different workouts you could sort by muscle group do pilates yoga even they have all different types of stuff they have like the live daily programs you can join a virtual coach or you can just free lift if you want but each move you can do can be done in four different ways to kind of change up your workout one is the smart flex which dynamically adjusts the weight for the most effective rep each time you can kind of think of this like a variable resistance training then you have the eccentric mode which adds weights and your muscle just normally relaxes in a wrap like when you lower during a bicep curl this just gives you that non-stop burn then there's a chain mode which simulates the feeling of adding real chains to every move you do so it gets more challenging as you lift up or push out so with this and each rep the weight's going to increase instead of just staying the same then you have burnout mode which reduces weight every single second rep as you start to fatigue and work your muscles just complete exhaustion it also has 20 sensors built in that's constantly monitoring your motions and provides you real-time feedback on your reps which considering it's just me in the room that's always helpful and there's even a spotter mode where if it senses that you're struggling to get your last few reps up it'll ease up on the weights a little bit just you can finish off the rep the machine itself has fully adjustable arms lets you get upper and lower body workouts move them in and out all the touch of a button very easy to do and what's great is you just do all this without having to change machine that's why i really wanted an all-in-one home gym like this that literally just goes on the wall it's all done right here another great feature is things like the bar and the handles have these smart buttons on them so you can just easily toggle the weights on and off so you're not constantly you know under full load when you're starting or ending your rep just switching on weights like that is very convenient i listen to my own music but built-in has different music and playlists for your workouts in total i've probably done only about like 25 of the moves that it fully offers if that since i got this in november and no this is not sponsored i bought this and they're always actively adding new workouts and routines so it's good to see that library of workouts always growing on your profile it keeps track of pretty much everything there's also an app that you can go and track your workouts see your history even create different workouts to load to your machine it's definitely an expensive pickup yes it definitely took me a lot to fully cave in and buy this but i'm definitely happy i did like i said i had a lot of comments about this when you've seen it in past video so just wanted to show it off for you guys all right guys so that'll wrap it up for this video of my favorite tech of the month hope you all enjoyed and i've done these you know in the past not too frequently though i'm still torn whether to do them monthly or quarterly i think quarterly kind of fits best you know but let me know your thoughts down below and also in the description i'll have everything i showed off for you guys today and again thank you to trade for sponsoring remember the first 100 people who click the link in the description will get 50
