what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode two of endgame the series where we take a look at some tips tricks and mods you can do to your gaming peripherals and last august was episode one so my bad for the weight and there we did some mods for your gaming money so check that out if you haven't already today we're gonna be focusing on gaming keyboards if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and we're gonna start off with this silicone roll which is a great alternative to eva foam so this roll i got on amazon is 25 and a half by 19.5 inches comes in at 1.8 millimeters thick so it's not going to have any issues fitting to the bottom of your case under the pcb and can naturally be compressed as well and you may even want to double up and use two pieces depending on your build there's obviously nothing wrong with foam and a keyboard obviously in fact if you have foam at all it's considered a luxury nowadays but just when comparing the two materials side by side silicone is gonna do a better job dampening that resonance so for my insert i'm tracing the foam pad that did come inside the keyboard you can trace the damper that you have to get the exact dimensions or use a ruler kind of eyeball it and cut your own insert then from there i'm going to cut it down trim it down so it's nice and snug to the bottom of the keyboard for things like the holes for these standoffs and routing cables just mark that as well when you're tracing the template and since it's only 1.8 millimeters thick again you can easily just stab your scissors through create the cutouts it's arts and crafts all over again but it is really just super quick and easy to do this is gonna be going inside a completely plastic housing for the keyboard so the results with the silicone versus the foam insert should definitely be worth it and once it's inside and you have it properly applied you can reapply the screws fasten it all back down again with this silicone material it's going to slightly compress it'll let you press it back down together with no issues at all and also provide sort of a softer give when you're typing as the internals press down onto the silicone this is how it now sounds with the new dampener so as you heard from the sound test you can probably tell the silicone dampener does a lot better of a job than the foam dampener does when it comes to keeping those higher pitched resonance sounds down inside because it's an all plastic body there so it absorbs that a lot better especially with the space bar it sounds a lot less high pitched now next up isn't a mod but it's more so a tip that'll give you guys and i guarantee you 9 times out of 10 when you buy a keyboard you toss the box and the packaging aside but inside those boxes most likely comes with this little plastic cover again you probably threw it out or it's still in the box and these plastic covers are absolutely fantastic for being a dust cover on your desktop especially if you have pets everywhere there's a lot more hair flying everywhere a lot more dust around you this is going to do a great job of pretty much eliminating that i know it sounds stupid and again this isn't like a world shattering reveal to you guys but if you still have your keyboard box check it you might have one of these in there just put it back on your keyboard at night if you're gonna be out for a few days keep that dust collecting in your keyboard down to a minimum and it really didn't even occur to me until a few months back when i bought this actual acrylic keyboard cover that i used on my display shelf behind me then i started noticing that every keyboard i got in also came with one of these so i was like why pay 25 bucks for this when you get one of these in the box for free so again a little tip for you guys now is a loop station from space cables a 63 slot sheet of acrylic for disassembling organizing and lubing the anatomy of your key switches and i'm sure you're familiar with space cables and their actual custom cables they make but the loop station here is going to be a must-have accessory for anyone in the community because obviously when it comes to customizing your keyboard once you're down that rabbit hole lubing your switch is just another tuesday so with the 63 switch slots it has a fitted cutout for the bottom housing of your switch and above that is a slot for the stem to sit and this layout and the whole purpose of this lube station really is just for the ease and convenience of the assembly line production it's all laid out in front of you you lube housing by housing spring by spring stem by stem lube your switches in that tedious fashion like workers do on an assembly line this also makes it really easy when you're done and it's time to reassemble the switches because all you do is just pop back on the housing and you keep it moving there's a lot of different loop stations out there different colors materials some of different cutouts even but i mean really they all do the same thing at the end of the day and i like the size of this one personally because it's about the size of a keyboard as it is and it fits perfectly with my keyboard kit which i'll show you in just a minute this one's only thirty dollars and real quick so i was just using it that stem holder that i had that was keeping the stem in place so i can lube it that's actually a gemstone tong and they're used by jewelers when it comes to like handling uh little tiny gemstones but it also works great for switch stems companies do sell like keyboard branded ones anywhere from like five to ten bucks i got this just generic gemstone one on amazon for like six and again gets the job done perfectly you don't have to physically hold and touch the stem and worry about getting lube all in your hands the little prongs here works out great but now we can talk about the star of the show my custom keyboard building kits prep deck and i've shown a glimpse of this in the past yes i talked about it here and there but this series is just a perfect fit to showcase it and the prep deck product itself is actually intended for the kitchen it's made for prepping and organizing meals and ingredients while you're cooking but we're cooking up something else keyboards so i bought this and completely repurposed it for the hobby because if you think about it this is literally perfect for it and all the accessories you need when it comes to building a custom keyboard it has five removable containers for storage perfect for keeping loose switches up top is a spot for spices originally but i've got vials of lube conveniently stored there at an arm's reach then on each side of the prep deck are two pull out drawers for even more storage in one i've got brushes tweezers switch pullers extra lube dielectric grease most of my tools get stored here then in the other drawer is a perfect spot for all my switch films foam and dampening pads bump ons the dimensions of the compartments here are literally perfect like it was made for keyboards each of the containers also has internal storage inserts i keep things like stabilizers springs all that stuff nice and organized then i can just cue up switches i need to lube and keep them here for the next builder project and since the fold out lip is like a cutting board originally here is where i put the loop station and now the entire prep deck comes to life and makes my life a hell of a lot easier and a hell of a lot more organized i just really can't think of a better all-in-one kit like this then when you're all done you fold it back up put it away until the next build and space-wise it's really nice and compact this whole thing started as an instagram ad that i saw it kept getting served to me over and over and i always felt like it looked cool but i had no purpose for it then one day it just clicked and i was like this is the perfect kit for keyboards so i picked it up i believe it's around like 120 bucks i think amazon has it 400 there's different like colors and styles you can get for the actual fold out lip and stuff so again if you need something like this i'm sure odds are a lot of you do if you're into the whole keyboard community and stuff i think hands down it's one of the best all-in-one solutions for a keyboard kit like this so guys that'll wrap it up for episode two of endgame hope you enjoyed like i said i'll have all the stuff we showed off for you guys in the description down below and give me your thoughts
