what's up guys it's potential spam calling welcome back to episode 228 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if you see anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 228. this episode is sponsored by asus and the rog strix xg17 ahp portable gaming monitor at 17.3 inches this 1080p 240hz display with adaptive sync can really take your gaming to the next level whether you want to add it to your gaming laptop as a secondary display portable console gaming bring it with you and your itx build to your buddy's house the choice is yours it even has built-in 8700 milliamp hour battery for up to three hours of wireless gaming at 240hz if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below first up we've got wayne and this setup comes directly from our discord channel so check the link down below if you want to join that we have some setup submissions and stuff and this one looking really nice lots of black and white going on for the hardware and peripherals nice wooden desk and the rgb behind the actual desk kind of you know adds that more warmth to it overall got a big-ass light up there in the corner so i assume in addition to you know gaming probably some streaming and stuff going on as well but let's talk hardware because he seems to have the reverse stacked ultra wide here because this primary is a 27-inch lg monitor with the 34-inch lg ultra wide mounted as that top one but again the wallpaper is spanned so it's going to look nice and a clean mounting job as well considering it's held up by just the one bracket now into his hardware as you can see there's a lot of stuff going on on the desk so we'll keep it to just the the main gadgets it's got the elgato stream deck the amazon alexa show five up there uh for the main peripherals get the kbd fans gk 64 keyboard with box white switches inside the mouse is the glorious model d headset is the steelseries arctis pro wireless sitting on a very very nice mouse pad by the way and also for audio the mackie cr4 limited edition desktop speakers and i think it's pretty hard to ignore that gaming pc in the back looking super nice vibrant in all cool white it's the leon lee 011 xl case inside an intel i7 9800x cpu with an nzxt kraken z73 aio got 32 gigs of corsair inventions rgb pro ram on an asus rog strix z390e motherboard and an rtx 2080 super gpu with some leon lee rgb power cables and stuff which is gonna give it that crazy like neon-ish look to the cables and then also in the room you can see he's got a 43-inch toshiba 4k tv so you can kick back and enjoy some of his favorite tech youtubers i wonder who made that video it's pretty nice wooden desk and also i'm really digging the way he has it set up also uh with the like metal pegboard for stuff just really looks nice i love seeing custom pegboards like this really adds a lot to a room i think so good stuff from wayne b digging your gaming and streaming setup definitely nice and like i said this is from discord so check out our channel down below if you want and you're gonna see some more setups from discord because there's some fire ones coming next we've got stormy the ninja and we had him on a long time ago he sent me these probably sometime around march or april uh he unfortunately moved out of la so this setup this crazy nice looking space is no more but i'm definitely interested to see his new space if he sees this and wants to get in contact again but i am just loving how industrial i think is the word i'm looking for is for this setup i think that's the proper word but showing off his gear what you're seeing right there on his desk is actually three displays even though it doesn't look like it because his primary is a nice 38 inch dell ultra wide and above that as you might have seen in that previous shot it looks just like you know maybe like a wall print but it's actually a samsung tv it's their the frame series the 49 inch tv then also right in front of him is the wacom cintiq pro 24 inch graphics tablet then for peripherals his keyboard is the rama m60a sequence 2 keyboard got the nice oblivion keycaps on there purple teleo switches got the extra fi m4 mouse and the rama m10 numpad we do have a limited amount of photos unfortunately because he sent these to me right as he was moving but you can see that pc over on the right side that's a repurposed hp blackbird zero zero two case which was just a beauty at its time and even now looks really nice inside an intel i9 9900k cpu with an nzxt kraken z63 aio and nvidia rtx 2080 ti super gpu so like i said pretty limited on overall photos and like more specifics in terms of gear and stuff we can give you guys some more looks around this crazy i don't know if it's like some sort of loft or what but this entire space the entire room seems really awesome great place to kick back and chill nice living space over here as well it all just seems so minimal but like i don't i just can't think of the proper word for i said industrial before uh just cozy everything even the the pups napping living the life and speaking of which stormy the ninja this is living the life man i absolutely love this and i'm really hoping i know you said you moved so wherever you are now that it's you know equally as nice and you're still loving it putting it together either way i'm sure all of us here would love to see a nice 2020 update whenever you can but man this is one for the books now more to the minimalist side here we've got erwick with a pretty nice looking music production set up primarily you know we show off all different kinds of setups so it's not limited to just gaming and i feel like people always lose their mind when we show off something that isn't strictly gaming related so get over it this is a real nice music production setup with the single monitor here is an asus 24 inch display and he's got some really cool uh stuff going on as you can see with his hardware the primary peripherals here at the razer sinosa chroma keyboard with logitech b170 mouse the speakers he has mounted are the personas eris 3.5 and also for audio got the ath m50x headphones and as you can see again with this gear i'm going to put most of it down below so you can check it out because i don't know exactly what it is and he has it all listed for us which is great but i'm not going to try to pronounce them all so i'll probably butcher him so uh yes if you're interested in all his music production gear it will still be down below for you under his name speaking of down below we can check out his pc and this is the nzxt h210i itx case and he has a custom wrapped in like a marble vinyl wrap which looks pretty cool inside the intel i9 9900k cpu with the ngx to kraken x52 aio got 32 gigs of g-skull trident z royal rgb ram on an asrock z390 phantom motherboard and no gpu so he's using the integrated graphics with the 9900k as of right now he said uh we'll eventually pick up you know a gpu but hey you can get work done without it and it's been working out so far then props to you man because this is a real nice cozy looking setup i love the extra stuff you did with the custom wrapped pc case even wrapped some of this out of the speakers there and it all just seems like a really chill space next up we've got carson m another discord favorite here this one was submitted and uh i was like yo we gotta get this on the show looking real nice with all the artificial iv and plants you know i'm a sucker for that [ __ ] but either way it's looking pretty good here with the matching wallpaper you've got the teal sort of like under glow underneath the desk with the rgb lighting carson man some good stuff so for those two displays got the stacked orientation here the bottom monitor is a benq 25 inch display at 240 hertz and the one on top of that is a dell ultra sharp 27 inch 4k monitor so you can use you know one for gaming and one for like productivity and stuff for his peripherals he's got the ducky one two mini pure white keyboard with the logitech g pro wireless mouse also you can see right next to that is the logitech g pro x headset with logitech mx sound 2.0 speakers on his desktop and then we can take a look at the custom wall mounted pc glowing teal as well looking real nice it's the thermaltake p3 snow edition case a very popular wall mounted pick from most people in the community we have a ryzen 9 3950x cpu with the cooler master master liquid ml 360 p aio 64 gigs of g skill trident z rgb ram on an asrock x570 pro 4 motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 2070 super gpu all engulfed in some fake ivy and this is actually a bedroom setup so you can kick back on the bag got the nice mounted tv there rgb lighting behind it some more artificial plants and then just really just you know hang out chill seemed like a really cool very nice vibes going on to this uh this bedroom setup so carson you know i'm digging it you know i appreciate the spanned wallpaper i'm digging the matching sort of like desktop lamps on each side everything here just goes together and flows perfectly and then last we have bentley with a setup that features three curved monitors as you can see lined up real nicely a bunch of those nana leaf light panels on the wall to add more pinks and purples and blues to it fitting in with that theme and as you can see this does appear to be like probably like a fresh build in a room because the room is very clean that that rug is spotless so i feel like this is probably like the first time maybe like you know building in this room so i want to hear you guys thoughts down below because i like it obviously it's a pretty cool setup but i feel like it just needs more to it more in the room to make it seem lively but either way those three monitors are the samsung odyssey g7 32-inch display got the nice wallpaper spanned across all three monitors and forwards peripherals go in a nice white theme here with the corsair k70 rgb mark 2 se keyboard which is their white variant of this and the glorious model d you also got the rgb in those peripherals matching to the rest of the setup then for audio he has the corsair hs70 wireless headset on their corsair rgb headset stand and the logitech g560 light sync speakers but speaking of the corsair hs70 yesterday i dropped my review of the corsair hs60 haptic feedback gaming headset so check that out if you missed it and then for the super vibrant gaming pc this is the corsair crystal 570x case inside is an intel i7 9700k cpu with their corsair h100i platinum s-e-a-i-o which again se is for their white edition and stuff with 32 gigs of course of engines rgb pro ram on an msi mpg z390 gaming edge motherboard and nvidia rtx 2080 super gpu gotta say good job for keeping most of the hardware and components inside to that white theme and taking a little peek underneath the desk again great job with cable management as well nice and tucked up off the floor good stuff so i'm digging it all around bentley but like i said this does appear to be like a brand new you know room brand new setup here so i'd like to see just more things going on to add to the room overall i don't know what it is i can't quite put my finger on it but if this is the case and it is you know a brand new room but obviously over time you'll grow into it and you'll add more things uh but definitely good job all
