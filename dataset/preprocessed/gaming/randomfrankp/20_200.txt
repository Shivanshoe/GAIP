what's up guys I'm random spank P back with episode 217 of room tour project the series where we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup almost cracked if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it all out but we'll kick it off now episode 217 first up we've got Darth our D obviously going for the Star Wars theme from head to toe I always love seeing stuff like this not just you know Star Wars seems but setups that go full-out with dedication like we have here and as you can see for the room it's like I said everywhere not just on the monitors and the PC setup but the shelves the collectibles this guy knows what's up and I'm loving it so for his primary desk right here had his main setup this is a 29 inch LG ultra wide mounted up off to the side is a massive TV then on the other side of the l-shaped desk he has to a cert when t 2 inch models lined up side by side now for his main peripherals on that custom Star Wars mousepad is the coarser gaming k55 RGB keyboard a great budget option and the corset m55 RGB pro mouse with some Harman Kardon speakers and again more collectibles more figures but over to the PC this is a corsair 220 T RGB case in sides an AMD rise in 730 700 X CPU with 32 gigs of juice skills tryna and z are GB RAM on the gigabyte X 570 motherboard and the gigabyte RT X 2060 GPU and camouflage in there is that red chrome Darth Vader pop figure so take it all in because I'm loving the attention to detail everywhere here the custom Star Wars terrariums even and I'm sure a lot of these collectables and figures are definitely worth some money I know I had a lot of these growing up I wish I still had them because they're probably worth a ton but it's not about probably the monetary value right for him it's about the whole room and adding to it and just taking it to the next level with everything Star Wars and that's why I love it next up we've got Siobhan s and I am loving how this is just so clean and just bright you know it's something about maybe the photos here but this just pops and it stands out and then if you want to switch it up turn the lights off and then boom some more RGB behind the desk in the PC behind the monitors looks good as well but I'm thinking the daytime look here so for his primary display is a 25 inch from Alienware 240 Hertz so great for gaming and then off to the left side there is a 32 inch model from BenQ which as you can see he has hooked up to his MacBook Air you know for some productivity and stuff one screen for gaming one screen for working you get the idea and forest peripherals we have the Logitech MX master 2's mouse and the drive Oh calibre v2 RGB keyboard with some goal and accented key caps here and then for audio get the Logitech G Pro X headset but now in the background we can move over to that IcyHot PC it's icy cuz it's like you know the white and blue but it's hot you know I'm saying alright enough of that this is the Corsair of course their crystal to ATX RGB case always love how this looks and insides an Intel I $9.99 hundred K CPU with the cursor h 100 i RGB platinum s e aí o 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance LED Ram on an msi z3 90m gaming edge motherboard with an EVGA r-tx 20/80 super graphics card with the light blue RGB lights with the white fans it just makes it all just look so good like I said that IcyHot kind of look so if I could dub this sh'mon I'm calling your setup icy hot not trademark you can take it but I'm really diggin it I believe he's a youtuber hence the the sound foam up on the walls again gaming productivity the best of both worlds all-in-one setup now we've got Kevin s in this one you guys already know it's hitting with V the peg boards from Ikea and it's hitting with the stacked monitors so you guys know I like these in first time I saw this actually thought that like the wallpaper or whatever that is behind the monitors I thought that was all one massive pegboard so I have to take a second look but it still adds that cool kind of trippy effect it really adds some nice depth to it especially in this shot this is really nice so for his displays his primary is an LG 27-inch with that mounting the stacked monitor up top for the 22 inch from LG as well and then on the bottom little iPad Mini acting as a third screen which is always really cool and for is peripherals with a Razer BlackWidow chroma keyboard with the eraser viper ultimate on the razor goliath his control mouse pad and for audio not pictured here but ath m50x headphones now over to the pc inside the NZXT h 210 i case he's rocking the risin 730 700 X CPU with 32 gigs of g.skill Trident Zinio RAM on the asus rog strix x5 7 TI motherboard with an msi gtx 1650 super gaming X GPU but I'm diggin the internal orange and blue color theme going on and then a shot of the pegboard always satisfying I always love seeing the organization on these and there you go there is a th m50x headphone 2 spoke about earlier and yeah I know they're all the rage right now but deservedly so I love them and then another shot left is set up but again with RGB fully engaged in full RGB mode and I like versatile setups like this you know the chameleon setup where one day it could have one color theme one wall paper the next day switch it up and it all still blends because you know the desk and stuff is white you have that flexibility here with a white setup so this is looking good now we've got Daffy and this is dapper now adapters not the right word at all but it is dope but Daffy he's got a lot going on here tons of RGB as well as you can see so let's check it out because at his desk setup he's rocking a 34 inch Alienware ultra wide as he is primary with the Dell 22 inch vertical monitor up on the left side loving the red and blue RGB lights by the monitors which is going to you know match the wallpaper color and even kind of blend to a purple look and then for his peripherals we have the corsair gaming k95 platinum RGB keyboard with the putting key caps logitech g930 light speed mouse got a note great job of cable management I assume you have a hole in the middle of the desk and you're out it looks seamless and that a sound bar is the Sound Blaster X katana RGB sound bar and the SteelSeries Arctic 7 headset you can see on the other side there where the TV is got the ps4 as well so PC gaming console gaming it's all here and for that case as we dive into it it's the corsair 570 x mirror case in sides arisin 730 700x cpu yet again with a coarser h 150 i pro RGB a i/o 16 gigs of g.skill tried NC r gb ram on the asus rog x5 70 crosshair 8 hero motherboard with an asus RT x 28 EOC GPU but yeah RGB fans as well and it's all RGB like I said lots RGB going on however when the RTP is off it still looks really good I do think it makes it look cleaner because the wooden desk stands out you know the plants the ivy but still I mean regardless whether its RGB on RGB off it's definitely a good setup see what I did there Daffy but yeah but like I said best of both worlds console gaming PC gaming I am all about this then last but not least we have Juke o 7 and I was actually thinking about this one being impossibly clean and minimal addition but there is still you know a good amount of things going on and I figure you know why not just show it off now because what I love about this you know obviously the tree the leaves the green you get the idea but again matching it to the wallpaper with the nature vibes the wooden desk which is really vibrant it looks great if you had a dollar for every time you heard me say that so for the displays his primary is a 27 inch from Asus and that TV up top is a 55 inch procaster TV then hop it into the peripheral to the HyperX alloy fps RGB keyboard got the yellowish green lights and they're going on with the Dakota Falcon mouse which looks like it's straight out of Ironman and for audio his desktop speakers are the clips are 14 p.m. now over to the PC the silentium PC Armas ar5 case I assume this is from overseas we have arisin 5 3600 cpu with the cooler master hyper evo cooler 16 gigs of HyperX fury ram on a tomahawk be 450 motherboard and a gigabyte our TX 2060 graphics card this has got a lemon-lime feel to it with the yellows and the greens you know so yeah I dubbed the icy hot one before and now I'm dubbing this the lemon-lime you can book me on Fiverr to give your setup a tagline and I also do birthday parties soju co 7 I'm diggin it like a you can also kick back on the couch there either watch some TV play some games on there if you want since you have that distance but I just love the nature aspect to it with the window right there oh no I'm getting the country vibes for men alright guys that'll wrap it up for episode 217 of room tour project hope you all enjoyed and don't forget if you saw anything you liked
