third make sure you're subscribed obviously i'm only going to pick subscribers if you want to win now first up today not the most interesting type thing but maybe from the market for something like this you might like it this is a laser tape measuring tool from hodo photo tools makes some really cool stuff and this like i said if you're in the market for a laser tape measuring tool might really come in handy forget the days of pulling out a ruler or a tape measure with this it's all done via the built-in laser once you turn it on you just point the laser at whatever subject you're measuring like the distance of how far away it is press the button again and then right there on the display it'll tell you and it's accurate down to 1 16 of an inch so very accurate and as you can see i did a quick little demo for you guys i had the lens 15 inches away and it shows 1 foot 3 inches and 1 16. now to reiterate this is not meant for you to physically like measure something in the air like this it's meant from point a to point b you point the laser and it shows you right here it also shows you on your phone if you download the app it's not necessary at all but if you do download it it will store all your recent measurements that you have once connected via bluetooth and then from there what's really cool is you can physically map out dimensions of say like your room for example so i now have the physical dimensions of my studio i went from wall to wall mapped it all out and it's there in the app real time so while we show off the more you know like gaming tech gadgets and stuff on the channel this definitely strays a bit away from that but it's still pretty cool i've never seen a laser tape measure tool like this before and the fact that it is so accurate like i said down to 1 16 of an inch is pretty damn crazy so definitely a nifty little tech gadget and it comes in just around 35 did i spike the lens enough for you guys all right so even though they're not a sponsor i want to remind you guys that all the cool tech 150 products that i've showed off for the last three plus years i have archived on my luster profile i'll drop the link to that down below but literally three plus years worth of cool tech under 50 items all archived and categorized nicely for you guys if you want to check out recent stuff all in my luster profile now next up is a really cool desktop gadget definitely timely as well this was actually suggested by a fan i believe aaron on our last live stream this from sharper image is a desktop fan and light bar and i figured now you know it's getting hotter summers here it's the perfect time to show it off for you guys so from sharper image it's called the axis 16 air bar and the built-in fan has three different speeds as well as the light bar that has three different brightness levels and all the buttons are touch sensitive and the fan itself has a full 360 degree pivoting head so you can move it and position it really wherever you want angle it so it you know cools you down and i'll tell you what for the 16 inch size it works pretty damn well it definitely cooled me off pretty quickly and again i figured with summer coming up say maybe like your hands get sweaty while you're gaming or something why not have this perfectly positioned desktop fan with a light built in right in front of your peripherals so it can keep those hands from getting clammy and all nasty it's not loud either it's definitely more on the quiet side which i was pretty surprised by and again i just love these multi-devices like this because not only is it a fan like i said it has the light built in so definitely a pretty cool gadget and also it comes with a vertical stand so if you don't want to have this physically laying on your desktop you can just put it in the corner or on the side or something and stand it up vertically so many use cases digging the functionality so again shout out to aaron for suggesting this on the last live stream dude if you don't have one already hit me up i'll totally buy you one this is being highly considered for my cool tech under 50 hall of fame especially at the more than affordable price of just 37 i'm sure a lot of you can find this not only useful but probably a necessity for your desktop or your gaming setup and speaking of your gaming setup i'm sure a lot of you if you're a fan of the channel are probably also keyboard enthusiasts so why not blend the two and have a key switch power button for your pc so this little 12 desktop power switch lets you use a mechanical key switch to turn on off and reset your pc definitely satisfying to have that tactile click when you want to turn on or off your computer so this obviously is an external power switch doesn't go into your pc or anything like that and getting it hooked up is very simple so you know those annoying little pins in the bottom of your pc it connects your case to the motherboard yeah that's called your front panel pins or your f panel or as i like to call it stupid anyways that's where this connects so you unplug your current case pins you plug in the power pins as well as led pins as well that's literally it it'll take like two seconds once you figure out where it goes on your motherboard again every motherboard is different and then just like that you can now use this mechanical switch instead of your cases power switch this will let you position it and put it really wherever you want the cable itself is stupid long like way longer than it needs to but i also thought it was cool because now you can use really like whatever keycap you want to kind of personalize it and match your setup so if you have like artisan keycaps for example it's an extra cool way to kind of show that off and integrate it into your desktop i don't know maybe your pc is farther away from where you actually sit at your gaming setup this here will let you you know turn your pc on and off easier i guess more convenient in that sense maybe you're about to get caught in the act and you want to quickly shut down your pc to make it seem like you weren't doing anything hey i'm just throwing out scenarios you get the idea though it's a simple little gadget like i said 12 dollars a nice clicky mechanical switch put a cool keycap on there put it wherever you want on your desktop it comes with sticky pads so you can mount it as well and i'll just have it at an easier arm's reach again 12 bucks super affordable next up again if you're a fan of the channel you know i am a huge fan of one thing and one thing in particular that usually makes it to the series we find it really cool i'll give you a second to vote now yeah if you guessed a or b you're 100 correct but from piketty we have his brand new r26 macro pads and these as you can see are dope so these are 26 macro pads could definitely bump up your productivity or even your gaming obviously with the macro pad you guys in the routine by now but you could set these to be anything you want hotkeys for gaming quick tools for photo editing video editing desktop media control literally anything you want it's all programmable and here we have this nice navy and gold version as well as a transparent white version with the rgb lights on each side of the macro pad you have four keys so eight total plus a big old knob right in the middle you always clutch volume dial or use it to adjust your brush size in photoshop you get the idea and i am a big fan of the shard 3d printed case it's called has this really nice and cool looking geometric sort of design to it it's just very unique looking and all together for the purpose it serves pretty compact as well i mean like it's not that much bigger than your gaming mouse for example so for under 50 the r26 comes as a kit you can't get it assembled for more but again it's going to cost you some extra money and then from there you can choose your switches whether you want cherry switches kale got clicky linear tactile pick whatever switch you want then to customize it not only can you pick your keycaps you can pick what color you want your keycaps to be same story with the knob pick the material and color of your knob and then for the 3d printed case you can choose a bunch of colors as well and also choose whether you want it to be like a flat design or the shard geometric design like we have here so tons of customization altogether the kit comes to just under 50 bucks again depending on how you configure it it could be more but insanely cool absolutely love stuff like this if you want to configure it you can use vial which is the software that'll let you reprogram and remap the buttons and the dial to be whatever you want functions pretty much endless customization here you can check it out and again just 50 bucks for the kit i think is more than fair just considering the endless possibilities of what you can set these keys and the knob to be every gaming setup needs a cool macro pack so again just really crazy cool and innovative from piketty love these desktop macro pads like this and also if you want to check out on the website as well he also made the macro pads we showed off a few years ago he's got a lot of really cool stuff in production but now we have the upgraded gb3 and gb4 macro pad you can mount under your desk under your monitor tons of really great stuff from pikachee again just around 50 bucks cannot recommend this enough killer stuff and then last but not least today is this biometric smart cabinet or drawer lock that lets you use your fingerprint to open or lock said drawer so this kit is obviously diy since you have to install it yourself wherever you want to mount this but for an example today i'll just show you on one of my ikea drawer units they give you all the hardware you're going to need and a template to cut the hole and the unit consists of three different parts the fingerprint sensor and then the internal lock mechanism which all needs to be connected and the striking plate which is what catches the deadbolt and prevents it from opening this can be installed on the top or the side of your drawer all depends on really where you're mounting this but once it's all connected and set up you now have a place to securely store all your valuables or anything you don't want out in the open keep it now locked away that only you can open with your fingerprint it could store up to 40 different fingerprints as well so you can do one finger you know multiple times from different angles or just record numerous fingerprints from all your fingers so only you can unlock it with these once it's opened the drawer also auto locks after five seconds on its own which is nice it's on a timer from the second it unlocks and say the internal battery pack dies or for whatever reason you can't open it i don't know maybe your fingerprints got burnt off and a cooking accident i don't know it comes with this micro usb key that you can use to emergency unlock it so underneath the sensor is a micro usb port just plug in a little flash drive key and it'll open for you you can also get this in different colors to match your drawer but the black one seems to be the more universal option i found it's cool it's tech it's under 50. in fact it's only around 25 bucks so i figured why not include it today keep your personal items personal alright guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for june hope you all enjoyed don't forget everything you saw today will be listed for you in the description down below
