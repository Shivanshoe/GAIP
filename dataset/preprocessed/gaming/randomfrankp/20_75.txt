what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be talking about my top five favorite gaming mice of 2021 so far we're about halfway through the year a little bit more we have a ton of gaming mice coming out for the holidays a bunch are just around the corner so these are my favorite that i've been using and have tested for in the past six seven months so far if you want to check any of them out i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below and today's video is also sponsored by karma which is an app and a chrome extension to save you guys some money shopping the web for coupon codes discounts all that stuff more on that in a little bit now first up starting off my top five is actually gonna be a runner-up because again this is all preference off my personal favorite list so far but i still want to give you guys an honorable mention that's going to be the swift point tracer and i bet nobody saw this coming because it's the complete opposite of today's trends but that's really why i like it it caters to that entire audience of people who aren't just gamers but those who need a crazy mouse with 15 specific functions and you may remember the popular swift point z mouse from a few years ago this is pretty much its little brother but technically it's far from little tipping the scales at just around 115 grams and obviously given the large ergo size this will not be for the baby hands out there it has knuckle buttons paddles on paddles extra inputs for deep clicks it's literally macros on macros photo editors video editors mmo players rejoice inside is a 12 000 dpi bmw 3360 optical sensor no fancy light cable or hyper glide feet but the amount of sheer inputs and customization you really have now with this makes it a great option for those who need something like this mouse now it is a bit on the pricier side at around 150 but like i said before i wanted to give it the runner-up nod because of just how crazy it is all the extra customization and functionality that's really capable of this and it's not your everyday mouse for you know the current mouse market you know it's really shifted to the lightweight wireless mice and stuff and this is not that even though it is for i would say a wider audience with gaming productivity you know cad 3d design all the stuff that you can really take advantage of this for um like i said definitely worthy of the runner-up knot and as i also mentioned this video is sponsored by karma's if you're trying to save some money karma can definitely help you out karma's an app and a chrome extension that's constantly using tech behind the scenes to scan the web for coupon codes price drops all that good stuff to save you guys some money on whatever you're shopping for and i

do of the karma link for you in the description down below hopefully you can save some money on some gaming mice if you're trying to upgrade hence today's video now coming in at number five is a relatively newer mouse on the market and that's the brand new very customizable razer orochi v2 coming in at 60 grams this little egg is certainly on the smaller side very popular though as a mobile mouse but also given the shape and size you can see it's pretty much a direct competitor with logitech g305 another very popular mouse already out there one of the things i really like they're doing with this is the top shell is now swappable you can pick from a ton of different designs and colors they're constantly making more and giving people more option to really customize the look of their mouse i think that's really cool it snaps on with magnets and you got a new mouse pretty much so the roji v2 does have their hyper speed technology and for the sensor it's their 5g 18k sensor and they're also using their newer 2nd gen razer switch these are not optical switches but they are rated up to 60 million clicks so these are like i said a newer version of their previous switches underneath we do have 100 ptfe feet for a nice and smooth glide and in terms of battery popping off the top shell you'll see two slots one for a double a and one for a triple a this is really cool because now you don't have to do the triple a mod you could still cut down on some weight and the longevity is crazy you can use this over bluetooth and get over 900 hours or with their hypersmooth technology if you just use the included dongle you get up to 450 hours i really like the upgrades we have now in the v2 and it's no wonder why this is so popular already so the rochi v2 is just around 70 bucks which is definitely a bit of a heftier price tag than logitech g305 like i said before but it's gonna be often compared to due to the shape and size uh but i think the upgrades here make it worthy for those who really like and need a mouse like this but for me it's just not my favorite size not too comfortable for me which is why it comes out number five but i can understand due to the popularity of the size while for someone out there this could very well be end game but for me number five today orochi v2 now number four is a bit of a familiar one but an updated version this is a pwnage ultra custom sim this is a symmetrical version of the ergo one we showed off last year and again the big thing with these ultra custom mice is the fact they are literally ultra custom swappable shells left and right clicks tons of colors and color combos for you to create only a mouse that's gonna match your setup aesthetic but want to match your play style as well because with the solid shell and the honeycomb offering your mouse can range anywhere from 68 grams or up to 79 grams if you go all solid swapping shells is all tool-less it uses a little magnet to snap into place and they're now offering color matching cables if you want to use this wired or for charging as well as colored skin grips to add to your mouse inside is a bmw 3335 optical sensor up to 16 000 dpi we have omron 50m switches inside that give a nice crisp click integrated rgb around the scroll wheel the inner shell glows and there's a strip along the backside and there's three different modes you can use this mouse with the office mode is more low powered also kills all rgb lighting rated for 66 hours of battery the gaming mode with rgb on is rated for 40 hours or obviously you can use this wired if you please and it recharges fully in an hour which is good to see underneath you have 100 ptfe feet including an additional set inside the box if you want that really nice slick glide without having to buy you know additional aftermarket skates that they wear out and i just really enjoy using the sim i found that gaming with a mix of solid honeycomb shelves really didn't have too much of an effect on me meaning even though i was shedding a few extra grams my gaming was consistent and adding the solid shell also didn't throw me off you can pick up the sim for 80 which is a really good price but you do have to pay obviously extra if you want the colored shells or extra grips and stuff like that and again i reviewed the ergo version last year and i just really really like opponent is doing here i think this mouse is super underrated right now now number three is gonna be admittedly a bit of a controversial one because of the price and of the brand and if that doesn't give it away well we have the final mouse starlight 12. but for what it is it really is unlike anything out there currently so the big selling point with these new final mouse releases are the weight and construction because final mouse is using this magnesium shell to cut down the weight into uncharted territories really coming in at 42 grams for their small version and 47 grams for the medium version which is the one i've been using because i think the small is just too small for me my medium version came in at 49 grams on the scale but still that's light and it's crazy because when you first pick it up it feels solid in the sense that the magnesium chassis won't like give into it if you squeeze or put too much force on it the bottom is not magnesium though that definitely has some flex to it if you squeeze it so don't do that but it's literally so light that i thought the box was empty at first it's really something once you first hold it now we all know how final mouse is very over the top and out there sometimes on social media with their tweets just their way of doing things but man credit where credit is due because this thing is feather light and really unlike any other mouse i've tried out there again if you use the small version it's barely 40 grams think about that inside they are using their own final sensor it's called with a resolution up to 20 000 cpi rated at 100 hertz pulling finally and the battery life is also crazy i use this for around five weeks before i had to recharge it and i'm not gaming like 12 hours you know every single day they do say the estimate's gonna be around three weeks for the average gamer but it can stay on and idle for up to 16 weeks that's insane now gaming with this was fun for sure which is why it's making the list today at number three it really does kind of feel like an extension of my hand at some point given it's lightweight flicks were on point and we have the 100 ptfe feet on the bottom so this thing just flies on any mouse pad and if you're using like a control pad combined with this weight you're gonna be dialed in like you're on adderall i usually use a hybrid like speed mat and i think that was just too fast for this so these starlight 12 mice came in four different variants for color options from silver gold black and here red and i will say the kind of painted design it has is kind of too cheesy for my liking they're going with this whole greek god approach i do wish it was just one solid color something less busy at the end of the day these retailed for 190 which yes is bonkers but like always they sold out way too quickly so your best bet is hopping on ebay and spending way way too much of an after charge of people just trying to make a book now for number two winding down is one of the newer ones on the market this is the steelseries prime wireless i reviewed this back in may when i say this thing is the king of shape for me i mean it at 80 grams my fingertip claw hybrid grip just instantly fell in love with this ergo design one thing i noticed here is a textured matte finish that is just oh so subtle but it provides a really nice grip in the hand and i said it uses this micro texture which allows for quick and easy cleanup of oils from your hands that could cause like you know smudges that all wipes off in a second but just the feel is really nice like it's not quite rubber it's not quite plastic it's a really cool combo we do have subtle rgb with the illuminating scroll wheel inside of their brand new optical switches called prestige om and they're a magnetic optical switch designed completely from the ground up by using this tension spring mechanism inside it actuates the infrared light being registered to your pc that signal is then sent immediately allowing for a hundred million clicks so they're fast and they got the longevity and the sensor inside the complement their quantum 2.0 wireless tech is their true move air optical allowing for a 100 to 18 000 cpi range battery life also awesome 100 hours you can't complain you can't complain at all i love it it comes in just around 120 bucks so as i said in my review of the prime wireless i feel like hands down pun intended this is the most comfortable mouse i've ever used the shape the size feels like it was sculpted to fit my hand and my grip preference i absolutely love it and it very well could have been number one today but something recently came in and uh kind of stole my heart and is now stealing the show because we have the endgame gear xm1 rgb dark frost i know it's wired i wish it was wireless that would hands down be my new main going forward but this guy love everything this might be a shocker to a lot of you out there considering a few things one it's not wireless two i've said a lot of times in the past that i prefer a nice ergo shape and this is symmetrical like technically it's ergo because it only has the two side buttons on the left side but you know by design the shape it is symmetrical you get what i'm saying and going right along with that is their dry grip coating so on this dark frost version you can see you know it's translucent you can sort of see through it giving the rgb a really nice but diffused glow this is gonna be also great for people who are in the custom keyboard humidity out there maybe you have a polycarbonate board this would go along with it perfectly they also have a dark reflex version i think it's called which is all glossy black but just the shape the coating it is all nailing it it does tip my scales at 78 grams which obviously no complaints there and it's actually lighter than the original xm1r rgb i just put that one on i think was around 82 grams on my scale so somewhere along the way they shed 4 grams here inside the pixar bmw 3389 sensor goes from 50 up to 16 000 cpi adjustable in 50 cpi increments by the way a lot of these mice are only adjustable in like 100 or so so i like that extra customization and we also have klgm 4.0 switches they are custom made by end game gear and they're rated for 60 million clicks underneath like we've seen before ptfe feet nice and slick glides very very smooth and the paracord given you know it's wired a very light and flexible does not cause any drag or resistance doesn't cause any interference at the end of the day which is always good uh would i have loved this to have been wireless of course once that happens that's gonna be my number one uh but given you know it is wired at least the paracord here nice and flexible does not interfere with any of my gameplay gaming with this has just felt like new i don't know i've made the viper ultimate pretty much since release right i'm sure a lot of you know that the transition from that to this was seamless i just felt like i was on cloud nine i love everything about this mouse the xm1r dark frost comes in at 70 bucks as well as the dark reflex version if you want it glossy instead of matte so while that'll do it for the top five gaming mics of 2020 so far so i got a few more months that we do the whole wrap-up of the year i do want to mention two other mice that i know i'm going to see in the comments down below and again you've this is completely my preference for me and my hand size and my gaming style so i want to mention them anyway just to get some clarifications out there i normally see questions about the rocket cone pro air which is a very good mouse i have it in i've tested it at the end of the day i still just prefer the shape and the size of the prime wireless so this kind of took that spot for me again it's a good mouse i just like this better than the other ones on this list better as well and also the extra fi size rail that's a very popular mouse right now as well but i personally cannot stand the shape it is just way too flat very uncomfortable for me like it was painful to use for a while it's kind of adjust to it because it is so flat it's like using a pancake again i know tons of people love that mouse and that's great but for me my hand size my preference i just cannot cannot do that no but alright guys that'll wrap it up for this video of my top 5 favorite gaming mice of 2021 so far if you want to check them out i'll have them all listed for you in the description down below as well as the download link to karma again to save you guys some
