i'm crying i'm crying i'm cramping oh i'm cramping literally was just gonna do the intro and my body said no what's up guys i'm cramping frank p back with episode 263 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup and this week we have the nice fan favorite clean and minimal edition if you see anything you like ah say anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 263. this episode's sponsored by me and the ctrl t keys deep c topographic key cap set which we are launching together for any fans of this nice deep blue and teal colorway that will look great on any keyboard head over to control t keys dot com to check out the full layout and compatibility and use code rfp at checkout to save five bucks now first up today we have mixpit and maul this is definitely a bit more overkill than the traditional clean and minimal setups well guess what this is still pretty clean and minimal loving the really clean approach here a great looking custom desk and just there's barely any clutter going on so really liking what i'm seeing now that massive overhead is a 65 inch phillips tv and below it is a 49 inch ultra wide it's a samsung odyssey g9 so like i said not the traditional setup you see in the clean and minimal editions but it's still checking off the boxes really down to the peripherals he's rocking a moto speed k87 keyboard with the rocket cone amo mouse both of which are in white also on top of the razer goliathus extended chroma which is also in their white mercury colorway then on the desktop for some audio he does have logitech z906 speakers as well as the skull candy crusher headphones now we're gonna check out the pc over on a separate little shelf on the right side of the room the shelf here is mounted to the wall so it's completely freestanding pretty much and inside the corsair crystal 570x rgb case is an intel i9 10900 cpu with the corsair h100i white capellix aio 32 gigs of gcl trident z royal rgb ram and the asustrix b560a gaming wi-fi motherboard an evga gtx 1060 ftw plus gpu and a little bonus shot inside the custom desk here this little fold up spot in the back where he has all the cables routed all the power bricks and stuff so it's out of sight which also is going to add to making the whole setup itself a lot cleaner but yes a really clean looking setup we got the all white walls white desk white peripherals and then a lot of rgb to add that extra accent and pop to the room all without the clutter next up we got studio237 and this is actually his private office for his company and i am loving the warmth here in all that green the plants on the desk that big old window for the natural lighting definitely some cozy warm vibes going on this one here going real simple with a single display it's the asus pro r it is 32 inches at 4k and then on each side of the monitor also acting as like a stand for some of the plants are his speakers these are the edifier s 350 db and also for his peripherals on the desktops going with the kikron k2 also has the nice wooden wrist rest there to complement the wooden desktop and for the mouse logitech mx master 3. another thing to note is i'm digging the matching lamps in both the floor lamp and the mini desk lamp there and just the overall vibes of the room the decor and stuff just very like i said cozy lots of warmth now checking out the pc which is hidden underneath the desk not too much on display really here's an amd third ripper 1950x cpu with 64 gigs of courser vengeance rgb ram an asus prime x3 99a motherboard and an asus rtx 2080 ti graphics card but again not really on display so we're not gonna have the best visuals here unfortunately for you guys most likely just a spacing thing doesn't seem like there is enough space to you know accommodate that large case and since he's right next to a wall and a big old window not really room there either but it's all good the room itself is still absolutely gorgeous and again just look at that floor to ceiling window man no wonder those plants are thriving now we've got bat toys and i'm not gonna lie my first voiceover attempt i call him bad boys because of the uh autocorrect and then i was checking the email before i went to upload and i saw it was bat toys i didn't want to call them bad boys that would be weird but this one is textbook clean and minimal all white walls white shade white desk then that nice punchy monitor vibrant wallpaper there monitor arm off to the right side so it still has that floating appearance rgb behind it to throw that color onto the wall this is what's up so he's rocking the asus predator x34a ultra wide on top of that as well is a monitor light bar acting as the desktop lamp because you can see there's not an actual dedicated lamp on the desk and man i just love these pictures great job great job now down to the peripherals his keyboard is the kiddos key dose nj80 nice and wireless with the all-white keycaps some color accents and then a volume knob as well with a white logistic g903 hero mouse that he actually said he has some skins on there to give it that nice white look and definitely looks pretty sick also on the desktop for his audio got the very popular harman kardon sound stick 3 wireless speakers that's those translucent towers well the mini towers there with the hifiman he 400se headphones powered by the ifi hip amp and deck definitely some tasteful hardware and also on the desktop as you can see you got the ps5 and visually it just matches perfectly and he also has one of the little playstation signs there in front of it over to the pc in the nzxt s340 elite case in white inside the intel i9 9700k cpu with the nzxt kraken x62 aio got 16 gigs of g skill trident z rgb ram on an msi z370a pro motherboard the gigabyte rtx 3060 ti gaming pro gpu definitely looks nice and clean matching black and white yet again this pc is the epitome of the setup really so bat toys not bad boys i'm digging the room i think the very simplistic and minimal prints above the setup definitely give it that nice extra touch just to have some things up there so it doesn't feel too empty a little bit of splash of green on desktop with the plants a nice touch as well and i might be wrong but i feel like that wallpaper choice is like isn't that like one of the um ipad wallpapers or just one of the mac os wallpapers i don't know so that's kind of throwing me off but at least it's nice and punchy as well like i said before just stands out really nice next up we have norbert and this is powered entirely by his laptop so a dedicated laptop setup believe it or not this is like one of the most common requests i get is to show off more laptop setups and this one is gorgeous it's right there as you can see on a stand on the left side and it says msi modern 15 it's a 14 inch display an intel i3 11 15 g4 cpu inside and that's then hooked up to an hp 27 inch monitor it is on a desktop arm so it's stitching the natural stand that it comes with but it kind of has it hidden by the little faux ivy there and again i always like a nice rgb light shirt behind the monitors or behind the desk just to give it that depth and separation from the wall so it looks really nice here it makes that faux ivy sort of pop a little bit moving on down to the desktop for us with a logitech k380 keyboard with a rapoo mt 750s mouse definitely seems to be like a logitech mx master sort of clone then for audio on the desktop go in the nice budget route with the very popular creative pebble plus speakers and then for his headphones the jbl tune 500 bluetooth headphones you can see it there mounted up on the wall alongside the controllers as well because on his desktop he also has the xbox series s well not on the desktop right off to the side there you kind of see it peeking through so a laptop and console setup here but again pulled together really really nicely digging the contrast with the white wall and the gray accent wall right next to him on his left side then it's the little things like up on the shelf there having the contrasting and matching black and white xbox controller a very well put together setup norbert and then things that make you go um we got the maku and this is just insane so clean that it does look like a render not gonna lie it's not a render that's just how good these photos are and the funny thing about it is like if you take a look at it there's a decent amount of noise in some of the shadows and you know like the black desktop as well where it looks like added film grain but the photos and the setup itself is so clean that it just gives it that appearance so anyway i'm gonna stop talking about how good these photos look and we're going to talk about how good the setup actually is he's rocking a 34-inch gigabyte g34 wqc ultrawide and i am absolutely loving that desk he said he got it custom made by a cabinet maker in germany and just hot damn that is like easily one of the nicest desks i've seen it's got that like super minimal but like contemporary look to it let me just google real quick the definition of contemporary made sure i used it correctly technically yes when it comes like interior design contemporaries of style so i'm gonna chalk that one up as a yes that's a very nice and clean contemporary desk also with the herman miller embody chair so we know there's a lot of high quality decisions going on here down to the peripherals also fantastic stuff got a custom mode 65 keyboard i wish we had more specs on the details of this lovely lovely stuff from mode with logitech mx master 3 mouse on an extended leather mouse pad and then for audio over on the right side of his desk are his headphones the sennheiser hd 560s in conjunction with the antlion mod mic wireless so great sounding headphones can also be doubled as a headset then over to the pc which is not on the desk it is yet again under the desk here we have the nzxt h510 case with an intel i5 11400 cpu with a be quiet dark rock cooler 16 gigs of g skill aegis ram on an asrock h570 steel legend motherboard and an rtx 3060 ti gpu he just said it's from nvidia i don't know if that's like a custom backplate or something with like the little honeycomb cut out there and the purple rgb it could be from an aftermarket seller i'm not too sure but either way it's a nice looking card but man this is gorgeous super clean super super minimal loving just a little print on the left side you know it's not hung up it's very abstract it's just sitting on the desktop and i absolutely love that thumbnail worthy a
