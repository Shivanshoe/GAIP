what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 248 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if you see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out if you're interested but we'll kick it off now 248. first we have toby manuel with a really nice and clean setup here loving the warm tones and you guys know me started off with a setup like this gonna set the vibe this one's nice and cozy so toby has two displays with his primary being a 24-inch benq zowie it's their 240 hertz gaming monitor and the secondary monitor on the left and the vertical orientation is a 27 inch from acer this one at 144 hertz he said it's primarily used for like photoshop and just secondary browsing down to the peripherals keeping that warmth going here at the aesthetic got the ducky one two mini and the glorious model d both have the orange rgb glowing and on the steel series quick extra extra large mouse pad then for audio up on the matching wooden shelf with the matching headset stand is the arctis 7 from steelseries then over to the pc inside the phantek's evolv x case is a ryzen 7 5800x with an nzxd kraken x63 aio on the msi b450 gaming pro carbon ac motherboard 32 gigs of course of engines pro rgb ram and an asus rog strix 2070 super for the gpu with the orange and white leds inside really topping off a nice build rgb light strip behind the desk seemingly really good cable management gotta give it to toby here because this one i think came together really really well finally executed next up we have kitty cat and this is directly from her instagram and i am loving this japanese cherry blossom theme she did a fantastic job with this tons of customization here tons of little trinkets and accessories that all go into completing the theme there's just a lot of detail going on so checking it out she has an apple led cinema display at 24 inches as our primary monitor which is also hooked up to a macbook pro 15 inch but as you can see got that awesome pc off to the right down to the main peripherals got a kikron k6 which is custom spray painted also has some extra keycaps on there again to fit the cherry blossom theme with a white logistic g305 in the background you can see for the apple products with the apple magic keyboard and the apple magic mouse then for audio the ak gk 612 pro a fantastic pair of open back headphones loving the choice here now over to that pc i mean just take a second and take it all in this looks so nice inside the corsair carbide 275 r case again just so much detail to the pinkish peach colored rgb lighting inside some pink fans and just all like the fake you know artificial flowers lining the bottom of the case it's insane and just look at the the crystal work on these components like i know this is like more of a common thing now at these companies making these crystallized hardware but it fits inside perfectly so here's the ryzen 7 3700x with the id cooling zoom flow 240 x aio 32 gigs of g-skull trident z royal rgb ram and the pilot game rock 30 70 oc graphics card so i don't say it too often for long time you know viewers of the series you have heard this before but these are the kind of setups that just inspired me to do this series you can have you know a japanese themed setup sure but it's all the attention to detail all the other aspects that go into completing the looks and the aesthetics of the desk setup you can tell just a lot of hard work and passion went into this setup and as a final result it looks stunning really good job now is alex mclean with a nice clean triple monitor setup but very you know aesthetically pleasing to the eyes there's a lot of symmetry going on the setup dead center of the two windows got a tie fighter setup going on so again symmetry always pleases the eye that's why there's two boobs instead of one so checking out the three monitors the primary is the razer raptor 27 inch which i feel like we rarely see the secondary monitors then are a 24 inch from dell again in the vertical orientation for the tie fighter display setup and you can see it now but a lot of razer gear starting off with the razer black widow v3 mini hyper speed keyboard he also has the razer basilisk ultimate for the mouse on the razer gigantis v2 extra extra large mouse pad then for audio on the desktop the razer opus anc headphones with the razer nomo speakers and also you might have seen in previous shots the razer kaya pro webcam and the siren elite microphone hooked up behind the primary monitor but he also uses the razer blade stealth to hook up to their core v2 which inside is an msi radeon rx 5800 gpu but then he's also using the razer tomahawk atx case on the right side of his desk as his primary you know pc with an intel i9 9900k cpu with the courser h100i pro rgb aio an msi mpg z3 90 gaming edge ac motherboard 32 gigs of course of engines lpx ram and a gigabyte rtx 2080 gaming oc gpu razer all across the board here so a really nice and organized for all the gear and hardware going on gaming setup in the bedroom and you know minus the green razer leds and their products there's really no other rgb going on so he's still keeping it nice and concise for the most part in terms of all the flashiness going on this could have been real crazy with the razer rgb chroma setup but now keeping it nice and classy now we've got virtuex with the massive ultra wide monitor beautiful looking wall mounted pc crazy nice wooden l-shaped desk seemingly a hundred different 3d printers going on lots unpack here we won't get to everything but for his primary display he has a 49-inch samsung chg90 you guys know the dlt's 49-inch monitors it's pretty much the same same exact screen real estate as two 27-inch displays remember screen's measured diagonally so the math doesn't sound right but it's the same exact dimensions and at least four 3d printers that i could see here that's one hobby i really wanted to sort of dive into more but unfortunately i never did now for the peripherals here's a kbd75 rev 2 in the all silver case with some kale box white switches inside and jtk photo studio keycaps so a nice like you know light blue white and gray theme then over to the mouse logitech g903 lightspeed then for his audio game some really good choices of hardware here he has the smsl m500 amp and dac powering his sennheiser hd 800s headphones and also the kef q150 speakers and then overlooking all of that is that insane wall mounted pc which is pretty much just a custom wall mounted case he made with you know like laser-cut acrylic and stuff so here's the intel i7 8700k cpu on the gigabyte z390 oris master motherboard got a thermaltake pacific s 240 hardline water cooling kit radeon rx 6900 xt with the ek quantum vector water block and in terms of just like visuals it's just laid out put together really really nicely super clean and then as you saw an entire sim racing setup with the dof reality h3 motion simulator which i said it before i just i want one of these a ton of gear i got a butt kicker and stuff so we can feel those vibrations a massive 82 inch samsung q70 tv a crazy looking kef speaker setup man i i just want to come hang with you like if you live in pa let me know because i want to come and chill in here for a bit and i really want one of those motion simulators but you know what i really love about this room is that it's crazy badass but it only has you know the one ultra wide so it doesn't have to have a crazy gaming setup to speak you know just for the desk setup it could still be crazy in terms of the the hardware and only gear going on but still looking like a really nice well put together room so i absolutely love everything about this easy 10 out of 10. then last but not least is from adapts design and yes this is a render and it is a really good concept of a really cool gaming room obviously with the twitch logo and stuff this is meant to be like a design for a future streaming setup but it's all the details that bring the room to life some of the figures stuff on the shelves realistic looking things that again just bring this render to a more realistic looking image and i've gotten a lot of renders submitted before most of them look like booty this one though really great and it just does look like an actual great gaming room that if brought to life would be a dream to chill at so i'm not going to talk to you about like the gear and hardware that he used obviously because it's just not real but again i appreciate the thought even like you know some of the razer hardware corsair products for the pc again it's a thought that counts but i just really thought that how the room was designed was really cool that badass looking ceiling the the twitch logo sort of like illuminating while you're streaming the dual monitors the overhead tv like come on this looks great this episode's sponsored by the corsair virtuoso pro xt wireless gaming headset cut the cable and immerse yourself adobe atmos surround
