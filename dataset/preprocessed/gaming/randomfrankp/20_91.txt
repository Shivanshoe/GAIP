what's up guys i'm random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for june the series we show off some of the best tech you can buy under that price point if you see anything you'd like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but first shout out to last month's winners i've been in contact with you so you can claim your tech from last month's episode but sit tight got a lot of really cool stuff to show off for you guys now first up i know everyone loves these multi-purpose lamps and stuff but this four in one charging station is definitely pretty cool if you're in the apple ecosystem that is in addition to it being a cool looking lamp the light has three different color temperatures and the brightness can all be controlled via these touch sensitive buttons built into the base so for its main use this can wirelessly charge your phone your air pods and an apple watch plus it has two additional usb slots on the back side for charging additional devices on the left side is the dock for your air pods it works with both the regular first edition and the airpods pro then in the middle you can just sit your phone down and have it like lie against the wireless charger then over on the right side is a magnetic dock for charging an apple watch so five devices here can be charged on a very sleek and modern looking way i will admit the quality here isn't as good as it looks it's all plastic and not aluminum as it would appear but hey at least it actually works now given the shape and size here i feel like this would be best fit for like a bedside table or your nightstand that way you can just charge everything up overnight but hey if you want to use this on your desk as well you know no one's going to stop you i just think it's better fit for a nightstand and this comes in just under 50 bucks next up sorry not sorry but you know the deal with this channel i'm always going to be looking for something with macros knobs dials functions all that stuff and guess what found another gem so one day i'm scrolling amazon as you do looking for some new tech to blow money on as you do then i came across this fully aluminum multimedia controller from vader and i bought it as you'll do now what separates this from the rest of them out there is a the build quality two it's usbc and d you control not only the volume but you have full media playback control as well period so depending on your setup if your keyboard doesn't have dedicated media keys or if you just want an external controller like this at an arm's reach for that extra convenience to quickly mute the audio skip tracks all that stuff this is definitely going to be clutch now one of the more interesting additions this thing has is the button above the scroll wheel and it correlates to the three led lights and this gives you control of the volume level adjustment so for example the first setting adjusts your volume in steps of two keep the little spotify widget up top the middle setting adjust it in steps of four and then the third setting adjusts it in steps of 10. so you get a big jump there i don't know how useful this is going to be in particular in most people but it is a nice addition if you need it so this is a bit pricier than most media controllers out there as this comes in at 40 bucks but again the build quality is much better than the plastic ones you'll find on amazon and having actual dedicated media keys makes this a no-brainer if you're looking for something like this to add to your desk setup now next is the most exciting thing admittedly but hot damn is it useful i have these all around the studio this is elgato's multi-mount great for cameras lights anything really you can mount this to and it's really useful because you can also pick up separate you know arms adapters ball heads really deck this thing out to take advantage of it so first is right off the bat i use this next to me when i'm filming it holds one of my back lights and i have a diffuser in front of that this one's connected to their floor base so it just stands right by my side but also i use their desk clamp for when i'm streaming i have it right off to the side i have my camera connected to it then with the ball head i can angle it just have it right there got tons of height adjustment as well and again you can buy the other arms added to it super easy to set up proves its name with multi-mount you know but also i'll show you from when i first got this in and reviewed it like two years ago i think when you're live streaming you can also do things like use this as an overhead camera so that's what i did a few times i did it for having an overhead shot on my desk you can see like my mouse movement and stuff just a little example to show you what you can do the customization the flexibility literally very very flexible and the multi-mount kit starts at just 50 bucks so again fits the series voila next is perhaps one of apple's most reasonably priced and sensible products the 29.99 apple air tag these compact circular shaped trackers are made to help you find anything you attach them to keys bags pretty much whatever you can think of and since there's already thousands of accessories for them on amazon it makes decking them out and using them with anything you want to track them with a breeze i picked up these little rubber adhesive pouches that let you stick the air tags to anything so for example just to show you stick it on your laptop if you're the most careless person in the world you're constantly misplacing it the little keychain accessories on amazon as well are super cheap got this for like four bucks you can add them to your backpack your purse keys anything but what makes these better than the rest of the trackers that i've tried is how it works with your iphone and the find my app it uses your location to personally guide you to the air tag or whatever you're missing and as you get closer the phone gives you this haptic feedback now say you lost something for good you can set it as lost inside the app then whenever someone with an iphone passes the air tag out in the wild it'll use their gps to constantly update the location of the device so you can find it and that's the real advantage this has over tile for example millions of people own iphones so whenever they pass your lost air tag it'll give you an accurate location but say you're looking for your keys around the house you can do things like ping it to play a sound so you can audibly track it but again with the haptic feedback and the arrow leading you in the right direction it just makes it really simple to use there's also a full map inside the app that shows you all your devices and where they were last seen i'm not going to pull that up though then you'd see where all my stuff is i do wish your tags were a little bit slimmer though but this is just tracking done right and surprisingly so is the price one of them for 29.99 or you can get a four pack for 99.99 then last but not least is this wooden resin wrist rest for your keyboard people have seen this in recent videos and been asking me about it and man i gotta say with my setup and theme it fits perfectly this one's from novel keys it comes in three different sizes and three different colors green like i have here blue and a purple then depending on the size of your keyboard whether it's 60 a tkl or full size you can pick one up then choose a color to match it and the quality here is just beautiful you got the rich wooden accents and this slight sparkle in the resin it just gives the color some pop and it has a slight shimmer effect to it it's not going to be like sparkling on your desktop or anything but it does have this velvety effect going on i don't know you know what i mean you can see for yourself now people may prefer a soft wrist rest as opposed to this sure i know i used to as well but technically this harder surface is better for angling your wrists and due to the resin material it has this natural like cooling effect which is definitely nice for these summer months now come on tell me that doesn't look good so while this isn't the first thing you think of for a tech series you know it is for your tech though and they're priced affordably as well the 60 size comes in at 35 the tkl is 37 and the full size is 40 bucks now i do also want to give a shout out to artisan labs who also makes these custom resin wrist rests you've seen this in my setup probably since the beginning of the year uh the only reason i didn't show this off today is because it is more than 50 bucks but they can make custom ones for you different colors to match your setup so really good quality i've used this for a while but again it's just not under 50. it's more personalized you pick the colors and they make it it looks awesome i'll have it down for you anyways in case you want to check it out but guys i'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for june hope you all enjoyed if you did give this video a big thumbs up show your support and don't
