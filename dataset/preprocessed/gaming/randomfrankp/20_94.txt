macros knobs dials a touch screen you know this is right up my alley what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're checking out the avermedia nexus which is this all-in-one control center for your live streams youtube twitch a very interesting device that is supposed to combine you know a stream deck with a touch screen here with something like the go xlr so first up let's see real for a second because avermedia has been in the game for quite some time now and mainly being known back in the day for their capture cards and competing with elgato this following suit because now they're getting deeper into the streaming market with this all-in-one streaming controller like i said pretty much combining the elgato stream deck with something like the go xlr once you get it in and unbox i'd say all things considered it's pretty compact it won't take up too too much room in your desktop keeping it organized is always a challenge as it is but at just eight and a half inches wide and five and a half inches deep i think the control center is size you know just right for the usability and right away you can see the multi-functionality of boasts with six dials four physical pads and a built-in five-inch ips touch screen display so again when it comes to streaming the versatility here with the controls should only make your job easier included for you inside the box is a magnetic kickstand to prop it up towards you a usb type b to type a cable a 3.5 millimeter trs cable quarter inch adapter and the power adapter and since you use this to control different sources and different gear getting it properly set up with your equipment is all done through the back side where the i o is tucked away slightly recessed into the device itself you have a 3.5 millimeter line in and line out on the back right a balanced xlr and quarter inch combo jack an additional 3.5 millimeter line in jack an optical audio in the usb port dc power port and then a physical power switch then plugging it in and powering it on you're mount with an rgb light ring that goes around the sides the six dials light up as well as the four rubber pads then that screen is now able to be configured and customized in their nexus software the dials do have tactile steps to them as you turn it up and down and the led light above it will reflect the current percentage these dials can also be clicked in to mute the source and as for those four pads i'll just tell you right now i hate these i think they're way too big like having only four here in this space just seems kind of pointless to me definitely would have preferred having more screen real estate if anything here and when you press down those pads it always reverts to either going to like one of the sides first and then actuate it's never a clean press down it's just mushy i hate it no bueno and also my bottom right pad it gets stuck in every time i press it in then i have to physically pop it back up from the sides every single time big yikes so with the physical buttons out of the way if it's not obvious enough already that touch screen is where a lot of the versatility is going to come in really let you customize this and it's what i'm most excited for so let's focus on that for a minute here is a 20 block grid for adding functions hotkeys scene switching launching graphics or really whatever sort of streaming macro you would need to do it's a 5x4 block grid and just like we see with the stream deck it's all drag and drop in the software you're currently only limited to 5 pages per profile and there's currently nothing like folders you can add so you do currently have a limit of 100 blocks per profile but you can add multiple different profiles i don't know how many but i can see them though adding infinite pages and folders and stuff in the future and when it comes to configuring the screen it's kind of like adding widgets from your smartphone where you have the grid some widgets are larger than others you can place them down it'll take up more space but this is where the nexus really comes to life i think you can choose either show the grid on the screen or just keep with the icons of the functions you can do things like add gifs or upload wallpapers to the back of the screen if you want anything to really personalize it which is nice but what i think is really cool is the integration it has with some of your streaming apps inside the nexus software which i'll dive into in just a minute you can see things like streamlabs obs obs studio youtube twitch functions for the nexus itself system functions direct control and even spotify so you just drag and drop you can rename each function or upload your own image or gif for it again just like we see with the stream deck but one cool thing i really like is with their expanded widgets for example with like youtube and twitch you can drag things like current viewers total subscribers and even have a live chat box on the display itself they do take up more room than your standard one block here but i just like the visual of having those extra stats right here at a glance i will say for my time testing though chat did seem to be about 10 seconds behind the real time chat on youtube and the viewer count isn't real time at all it was always about 10 to 15 viewers off and it would only update every like 30 seconds or so but it was never an actual real-time counter like we have in the youtube live studio also as you can kind of see the chat would flash every now and then when a new message would pop up which at first was distracting but i feel like this could be fleshed out and kind of polished in an update so it's not as annoying to see but again even though chat was slightly delayed it's still there so if you don't have a second monitor with chat pulled up this is now going to give you an extra opportunity to read and interact and i would always play my game windowed and then have chat off to the side to read it but with this i don't have to some other cool integrations with spotify they natively have full media controls you can add as well as you know like a playing now widget so it shows you the track the artwork the duration of the song it's really no different than what pops up on your screen anyway when you're changing tracks but again having that here on the secondary display i think is cool for visual sake i will say though again the spotify integration as a whole is kind of hit or miss skipping tracks takes about a second or so delay to register it's not a big deal but i would like it to be less sluggish then for whatever reason my pause key was always grayed out and it would not let me use this to pause the track i don't know if that's a bug or what it was going on but i literally could not pause music using the touch screen however if i assign the pause track to one of the physical buttons for one of the pads then it would work and then i could pause the track just not using the button on a touch screen very very odd one thing i would personally love to see is the ability to make this entire five inch display a reference monitor of your stream so i don't know if they'd have to add like an hdmi to the back in the future for this or if it can just be a widget that integrates with the current streaming app that you're using but being able to see your stream in real time here i think would just be really really cool it would also be great for people who only have one monitor and have no way of actually checking how their stream looks so again maybe they'd have to add an hdmi in the back to plug it into your computer to act as a secondary monitor but again not even for streaming necessarily just having this be a secondary display i think would be really cool now even though it's the most boring part of reviews when it comes to configuring this software is extremely extremely important so we'll head back to the pc and show you the nexus software and how to get this really set up and customized okay so now i'm gonna run you through the nexus software which is yes like i said not the most interesting thing but it's how you configure everything you get it all set up and as you can see it's visually not the most appealing uh definitely a bit dated yes i'd like to i like it to be a bit more clean and modern uh but at the same time it's pretty self-explanatory in terms of navigation and getting things set up very similar to yoga stream deck software and that first launched with a sense where everything is drag and drop for the hotkeys and widgets so i'll bring it to a clean page real quick just to show you and again you want to launch different websites apps hotkeys multimedia all drag and drop you can go in reassign what the function is rename it as well as redo the logo whatever displays um as that function you can also do things like scale the image fit the screen fit the image to itself and boom right there you can see in the app it updates very very easy one thing i didn't show you before is the mixer dashboard which is pretty much a redundant visual example of your six dials on the nexus itself so when you actually go to the audience mix when you change your different uh sources and stuff you could see those levels update real time and that's cool if you want to get you know an actual finite number to what the actual dial is instead of just going by the leds on the dials okay not the most useful thing it's pretty redundant as a whole but it does you know work well if you do want to see those numbers now i'm going to go into the software settings because this is where you know most of the configuring is going to come in as well for membership it's just tying your different accounts and stuff so it can register uh to the actual software and you know be linked to your different profiles general is just a lot of the software updates and little things like that hardware though this is where it starts to you know get more into it so for the touch screen you can configure the um whether it goes to sleep or not adjust the brightness the grid as well as the different uh backgrounds for it you can upload the pictures and then it'll save five here in the software for you so that's where you can go in and do all of that next up for function keys that's the four pads on the nexus you can have them be the color of the icon that you assign a solid color that you pick or if you want to just turn them off you can i keep it icon color so it's kind of color coordinated uh below that is volume indicators this is where it gets interesting because uh for those six actual dials you can have them all be one color uh you can't assign different colors to different sources for the six dials which i think is kind of you know like a no-brainer why wouldn't you want to do that so you can in your head color coordinate what each of those dials are but at this time at least you can't one thing you can do though is have the dials be sort of like a real-time uh level and volume indicator however it only works for the audience mix which is kind of interesting so i could see here on the device uh the actual real-time levels of my mic and it only it's very buggy again because it only works for my mic when i'm playing a game when i have music going on through spotify which would ordinarily be either the game chat i mean the the game dial or the system dial that all stays blank so the mic does work but again it's not the most useful because it's still kind of uh slow and you know kind of lagging behind then you have these surround lights for controlling the rgb that goes around it with that strip you can have a scroll rgb blink pulse solid color or turn it off it's not the most useful i would keep it a solid color if i were you but below that again also kind of buggy and interesting is the interactive effect where you can have the streaming light be a certain color and a recording light be a certain color so when you're streaming this will pers this will be a certain color or recording you know that whole thing so i thought you know that would act like a tally light where when i was live everything would go red to let me know okay i'm live but that's not how it worked i tested it with both streaming and recording and in either case it did not go to the solid red like i have it set so i think a visual tally light would have been a great idea if that's what this is trying to be cool but it's not working so again it's it's still very very early on the software but i would like to see that be an actual visual tally light for me and then at output you can go and reassign uh what you want the sample rate of the mixer to be it's capable of 24 bit 96 000 hertz or 24 bit 48 000 hertz and most of your streaming and recording software out there is most compatible with 48 000 so i would keep it that you could change what your line out mixes from your creator mix audience mix and chat mix because you do have different sub mixes which we'll talk about in a minute and then your chat mic you can have it pretty much output with the effects you can assign or without the effects and i always go without the effects so we're going to bring it back over here because one of the things you can do with this which is you know pretty cool is have your dual mix different sub mixes for your creator mix your audience mix and then reassign each individual one to what you hear versus what they hear again things for chat mix game mix system mix console mix if you're using this with like a xbox or a ps4 your line in and your mic you can assign all those different levels so for example when you're streaming i could listen to spotify play music i want to play but have it so the audience mix does not hear that and i can play something like you know royalty free music for you guys to hear that i won't so having different sub mixes is definitely useful it's not laid out in the most visually you know appealing way and there's no way to link either these uh which is what you can do with with things like the elgato wave software their wavelink that makes it really easy to link them so when you adjust you know one mix it does it for the other mix as well so you do have those different submixes and i'll show you right here you can see for audience mix as i was telling you before about the actual volume indicator you can see my levels for the mic uh but it's it's not the most useful because it's very slow and sluggish uh and yeah that's that's not the most useful so i can see what my actual volume level is here and you can go in and to adjust it but you don't really have any uh sort of indicator it's just right above for the mic mix and the gain mix you can adjust from zero to ten it's just not the most intuitive okay and then also for your different microphone types i have a dynamic mic with the mb7 so that's enabled you can also enable the xlr condenser mic if you need that which requires phantom power or a 6.3 millimeter like if you're using the combo jack in the back to plug in a mic or a headset that way you have all that right there and then you can also do things with your mic and enable things like equalizers different echo effects reverb compressors noise gate that kind of stuff and you can also go in then and you know adjust all that into a different sort of menu here which gives you different eq control for your base mids trebles you can set go through some of the preset ones uh but what's interesting is you know if you want to have a cool uh voice effect like echo or reverb uh you have the option here to enable that but then there's there's no way to assign that to an actual widget to drag and drop onto your nexus which is you know kind of stupid because you you would think if i want to just you know if something happens or i want to have my voice sound weird for a minute just to add that extra effect i could toggle it on and off real quick but you can't there's no widget for that you have to go in and manually do it in the software so you have to have the software pulled up to do that again it's things that can be fixed and improved in the future but kind of annoying right now that it is not readily available so i mentioned it before but lots of stuff here is sluggish it's you know lagging behind a little bit like i showed you before with the chat and the real-time um subscribers and stuff or the real-time viewers and stuff it's very sluggish and behind i do expect a lot of this to be updated and you know kind of polished going forward because this is the launch day one software so again running you through it you do have a lot of you know versatility and flexibility with what you can do and customize and control but it just needs to be you know pushed a step further i think to really take advantage and use a lot of these uh sort of widgets and hotkeys uh to to the most potential that would benefit you while you're streaming or live streaming and uh by the way this is what you're hearing right now is all plugged in with my microphone which is the shure md7 i mentioned it before but yes this is plugged into the back so everything is controlled and what you're hearing is all done through here a dynamic microphone so i'll be the first to admit that obviously i'm not a streamer i'm not a full-time streamer my job is making reviews here on youtube so i'm possibly not you know the best person to give you my full two cents on the whole ins and outs of how this would actually you know be used from a daily live streamer but what i can tell you is you know just like i said from my experience using this the past i had this for two weeks now and using it sort of as like a daily device on my desktop um launching different you know macros functions different integrations and stuff like i said so using it that way and like i said with spotify very buggy when i was streaming uh the integration with youtube and stuff kind of lagging kind of behind but i'm also not somebody who really can give you the full rundown on the internals and stuff i know there's some talk out there about the preamps in this not being uh powerful enough to run some of the top tier mics out there like the shure sm7b the re20 there's different speculation on what it can and can't run in terms of the power of the preamps i know for me though with my dynamic mic the mb7 it was fine i even had it turned down minus two decibels because then it was peaking so for my use case uh it was okay so unless you have one of those you know top two one percent microphones that are very expensive and very power hungry um i'm not 100 sure if it's going to be able to push it to its fullest potential obviously uh but again for me and my mic it sounds fine i will say though with the preamps there was a a fair bit of at least on my end a noticeable noise floor a very slight hiss that i know was noticeable but to the stream it probably wasn't because once i was gaming and stuff the game audio in the back you couldn't hear if you're playing music you're not gonna be able to hear that and nobody when i was streaming brought it up either so that sounds fine for me but again i didn't want to point it out that i noticed a significant noise floor definitely humming going on so this is one of those cases where i really want to like this but i can't in its current state it's not me it's you so hopefully later on down the line again i understand this is day one launch software that should improve over time yes but right now there's just too many things holding it back it's one step forward two step back oh this is cool it can do that but it's slow and lagging oh that's a cool feature oh but it can only do that it's that type of thing and it's also 350 dollars where you look at sort of the landscape of these streaming devices uh the go xlr and the xlr mini those are upwards and that's i think around 450 uh stream decks anywhere from one to two hundred dollars their their prices are always fluctuating and they have three different models and stuff so this is that sort of in between spot where it would make sense that's com combining the best of both worlds in a way but it's still just limiting at the moment so who's this going to be for somebody who sees the potential of the touch screen as well as the dials definitely not those buttons again those four pads are terrible i would have much preferred they ditch them all together and expand the screen that would have been great or maybe just give us a few sliders there i know with the dials you really need sliders but during a stream having a slider is just more a lot more smooth when it comes to manually crossfading whether it's you know a song or an effect you know being able to mainly just drag that down or up is a lot smoother than turning a dial which is increments of five so i prefer sliders personally over dials but again i wish i could just ditch those four buttons expand the screen altogether and it's just too laggy right now hopefully the software will smooth that out over time but man getting choked up 350. can't say yes right now unfortunately so keep an eye on it and if you want to you know track the road map their future plans for and all that stuff i'll have a link for you in the description
