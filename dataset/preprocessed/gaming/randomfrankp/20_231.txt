what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with episode 206 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas of inspirations for your own setup and this week is the highly requested budget edition giving you some ideas of how to improve your setup and show you other ZAR working with while not breaking the bank at the same time now keep in mind as I always do for these budget episodes everyone's term and definition of budgets going to be different the whole idea is to show off setups that are way more scaled back than what we usually show off and also in some instances we have you know prices and stuff because people submit what an estimated budget is for their setup also they might have bought things on sale used secondhand all that stuff so either way because anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll kick it off now 206 in this episode of room tour project is brought to you by Corsair and the k95 RGB platinum xt keyboard this 2020 release is gonna give us now a brand new wrist rest all the same features you love from before plus an integration with their shreem deck software with those six macro keys allowing you to do certain things while streaming and have all those commands tied together if you want to check it out I'll put a link for you in the description down below alright first up we have Dylan B and this whole desk construction is actually pretty interesting it's a part of one of those reversible flip like desk and shelf combinations so here you can have it all built up you can see as you starts to pull the bed out the shelf while staying level pretty much just goes on the ground so then now his setup is underneath the bed having that two-in-one combo is not only gonna save a lot of space but kind of make it you know more organized in the room and then up top he has its bed when it's fully you know ready for some Z's and to show you guys I found a little video online of how this works this is animation I don't know where this is from so whoever made this please don't strike me thanks but yeah you can see how it works shelf when he wants to have it up and then he wants to go to bed close it nice and compact what villains working with here and as you could tell this is gonna be a laptop setup so no designated PC and monitor and stuff this is the Acer nitro 5 for hardware has an Intel i5 8300 H CPU eight gigs of ram and a gtx 1050 TI for the graphics card and as you can see he has the laptop kind of propped up so the actual screen is more level with his eyes it's sort of like where your monitor would be then he has all his peripherals attached to that so he has his own Logitech G Pro keyboard do you 502 mouse and a hyper x cloud singer headset got the mousepad a little bit of turf there but for you know in total for the actual peripherals looking at around $200 and then pretty much just everything else comes into play with the actual laptop itself so depending on what he spent on that when talking budget this is a really great executed setup but like I said before I can take advantage of the reversible desk and bed kind of combo there to save a lot of space mixed up we have palsy and this is one of the more interesting setups I've ever seen and I love the dedication and all DIY that he made to pretty much having an entire setup in a briefcase so yeah this is crazy as you can see all the hardware and gear it folds up right into this briefcase we can bring it with him anywhere he goes and he made this all himself so I just love seeing stuff like this mole talk Hardware in a minute but first off for his entire briefcase setup he has three USB powered monitors they are generic 15 inch 1080p USB type-c monitors and not generic as in like they're just generic monitors that's actually the brand name so he saves a lot of power by having USB C monitors and since they are so thin and lightweight they just fold into each other for the peripherals he has the RK 61 keyboard in white and Logitech MX anywhere 2 s Mouse 2 wireless peripherals to cut down on all the cables and then as far as actual hardware inside he has a rise in 5 3600 CPU with an octal n hl9 a cooler 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance Ram on a Zaraki 450 fatality motherboard and an Elsa s ACGT X 1080 TI graphics card I've ever heard of the ELSA sack there's a joke in there somewhere but all folds up into this briefcase he can bring this with him anywhere it's essentially a portable setup so I know a lot of the stuff you said he got aftermarket it saves some money on it going to generic USBC monitors also can help save money so really really great execution of having a portable setup all in a briefcase loving this now we've got cocoa with the dual monitor setup but what caught me about this one was the fact that he said it's only cost him around $600 total some things being gifts some things finding mostly on sale or used so he definitely found ways to save money so for the two displays his primary is an Asus 24-inch with the vertical one on the left side being a Lenovo 24-inch but you think about it 1080p 24 inch monitors are much more affordable that was probably only around 110 tops maybe even cheaper who knows but for is peripherals we have a magic forest smart 82 keyboard which he got from 55 bucks Logitech G 102 Mouse for $22 and SteelSeries quick mousepad he got for 17 bucks so now starting to get some price tags here he supplied and those speakers here they look pricey but they're really not that bad these are the Pioneer DM for tw and they're only 60 bucks now on Amazon brand-new they're 150 but again he said he bought them used so pretty good deal for just $60 that's what the whole budget themes about you know saving money finding deals when you can now for the PC unfortunately we don't have a dedicated photo of the actual hardware inside so instead we're gonna have to kind of act like a peeping tom here got a little side glimpse of what's going on but this is the CIT f3 micro ATX case which he got for 40 bucks and inside is an Intel i5 3570 cpu four gigs of ram and a gtx 1050 TI phone gigabyte for the graphics card which he got four or 120 it's all about the deal so if this in fact did cost him five hundred and eighty five dollars as he estimated this is absolutely phenomenal for that just cuz it's a budget episode and a budget setup doesn't mean it has to look budget this looks extremely nice well put together and organized and it's under $600 now we've got Gavin G and this one is definitely clean and minimal a hundred percent but also you might take a look at that PC and think what's going on there yes that's a DIY chassis he's got this one is all around looks really nice for a minimalist budget setup so for his display he went with a Samsung 27 inch space monitor this is the one with the really flat stand so you could have it like kind of flush against the wall these new or around $300 but again just looking around on eBay and Amazon I have seen them used for around 150 to 200 but this is the most expensive thing in the set up down to the peripherals also not really going full budget here yet we have the ducky 1/2 mini keyboard and Logitech MX master 2's Mouse in total hey you're looking at around you know 200 bucks for these maybe cheaper because the keyboard itself is 100 and the MX master 2's is going to be a bit cheaper because the 3s is out these are I think around between 60 and 70 so not bad and for audio his speakers are the Logitech Z 150 but over to the PC this is a really cool DIY chassis it's that's like open air you know open concept frame design I did a pretty similar build a few months ago over the summer the case was the motif Monument for reference but here he made it out of wood so essentially this is gonna just cost him what a few bucks have you had to go out and actually buy wood but for hardware he has arisin v 2600 CPU to be quiet dark rock for CPU cooler 16 gigs of HyperX fury ram and an asus rog strikes beef 450 i motherboard in an EVGA gtx 1660 TI graphics card so definitely respectable hardware i'd say that comes in that budget to mid tier level definitely not breaking the bank by any means which again goes to show you how nice and clean and organized of a setup that you can have that looks way overpriced but is still on a budget so I don't really have you know prices he didn't really include an estimated price for this but altogether you're looking at around nine hundred to a thousand dollars total for a setup like this which i think is an outstanding value for the final result and then rounding it out we have Nino what I like about this is like nope no offense this seems just like your more average setup but it's still pulled off nicely and just ignore that MacBook Pro in the back that's not very budget but we're just gonna talk about the other gear in hardware for the set up like his 27-inch Dell monitor there these are very affordable for 27 inches at just 110 dollars it's also 1080p at 75 Hertz another thing I really like I know it's very simple and also super affordable from Ikea is those peg boards and not only makes the setup look a little bit nicer but it adds a whole new layer of organization and it just I think looks cool they're definitely pretty popular too so for is peripherals he has the key cron k1 ultrathin keyboard with Logitech MX master 2's with some Bose speakers in the back $70 keyboards $60 Mouse $50 speakers not bad at all for prices that under this desk is his PC this is the fantex eclipse p400 case inside is an AMD FX 8350 rear am on gigabyte ga 970 a motherboard in the EVGA gtx 1050 TI graphics card which definitely seems to be the popular budget option altogether I'd say estimated at around $400 total for the PC Sony no my one bit of advice to you would be to possibly Center the monitor a little bit more on the desk it seems a bit to the left side just something with that shelf up top it all just seems off centered but other than that you did a really good job alright guys that'll wrap it up for episode 206
