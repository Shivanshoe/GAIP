what's up guys i'm random frank p here with my yearly back to school tech video to show off some really useful things you students can take advantage of regardless of your schooling or your age middle school high school college university these are all things i think you guys could definitely use and they're all under a hundred dollars to save you guys some money so keeping the budget in mind you see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it all out plus a free trial to sign up for amazon prime so you can take advantage of free one day shipping two-day shipping same-day shipping all that stuff definitely check it out if you haven't already remember when i was in school man it was like yesterday now i've got gray in my beard first up this is gonna be for the online schooling student or maybe someone who's often you know using a microphone because we have the eraser siren mini which for the price hands down is one of the best sounding microphones i've ever heard so i'm sure if you need a mic this will be right up your alley and the audio quality you're hearing right now is from the racer siren mini i'm not lying it's not my usual mic you know i'll tap it for you so you could hear and it is very very good and natural sounding for the price it is a super cardioid pickup pattern they call it so it's going to emphasize when you're talking directly to the front of it and as you can see very small and compact looking like a little you know egg-shaped capsule type thing you could take it off the stand and put it on like a mic arm already it has a thread on the bottom so you can attach it on whatever sort of mic arm you have at your desktop comes in black white and pink with three different colors and just you can hear this very very good for the price it retails for 50 i just checked it was just around 40 bucks lee was a little bit under 40. so very very good sounding microphone for the price really hard to complain right and again i'm not faking this moving right along i know everyone loves these multi-purpose lamps and things but this four in one charging station is definitely pretty cool if you're in the apple ecosystem that is in addition to being just a cool bedside lamp or use this on your desk this light has three different color temperatures and the brightness can all be controlled by these touch sensitive buttons onto the base so for its main use obviously use it as a lamp but can also wirelessly charge your phone your charger airpods or your apple watch plus on the back side it has two additional usb slots for charging other devices so lots of charging going on here so right in the middle is the wireless qi charger for your iphone you place it right up against it it'll start charging for you on the left side is the dock for charging your air pods or the airpods pro it's universal there so you can fit them both in then on the right side it's a dock for charging your apple watch it's magnetic so all in total five devices can be charged at once it's very sleek and modern looking i will admit the quality here isn't as good as it looks it looks like aluminum but it's actually plastic but i mean at least it actually works you know now depending on whether you are a student in the dorm room you're still living at home in high school whatever i do feel like this would be best suited for like a bedside table or a nightstand but obviously you can use this however you want if you want to use it on your desk if you want to use your dorm you know feel free i'll just give it my two cents and it comes in just under fifty dollars next is this tribute home speaker which has a ton of things going on in addition to being you know a mood lamp or a night lamp for your bedside table this has got a lot of features jam-packed into it so when you first see it with that like gray fabric it does resemble like a bluetooth speaker for example there's a lot more than that because it is a bluetooth speaker actually uh you can pair your phone to it you know play music but that's pretty standard but it also has things like white noise it could play it's a nice static in the background bird noises rain noises bunch of different ambient noises built in there's a radio obviously right there on the screen is the clock it's an alarm this thing's covering all the bases so on the bottom are two usb ports one your standard than a usbc this is for charging some devices as well the touch sensitive ring around the screen makes it really easy to navigate and you know set the alarm toggle through the different sounds or change the volume stuff you're listening to music it's made really well it's built really well i think execution wise you know flawless i like the addition of the little mood lamp around it too if you want like a nice warm light at night time or if you want the rgb going there's also a mode where it'll flash and pulse to the music you're playing this one admittedly is a bit more expensive and i think it's the most expensive thing we're going to show off today because it comes in just under 90 bucks however if you want to save some money but you somewhat something like this a nice sort of bedside multi-use clock alarm lamp speaker this is the lenovo essential i've seen it for like 30 bucks i got it on ebay for 20. what i like about the lenovo smart clock essential is really how sleek and minimal it is you can put this really anywhere and it's going to fit in especially like the dorm room and stuff you know so obviously it's a smart clock you can have it there right in front of you the numbers and stuff are big and bold but also has like a little weather icon to update you on that which is nice but a big thing this features is google assistant so it's like a smart clock like i said before where you can ask it questions and it'll help you out uh it does have bluetooth built in like i also said so you compare it to your phone listen to music there are some buttons up top so you can control it you know manually change songs or adjust the volume but also around the back it's this really nice and subtle ring light so it will glow at night time so they have a nice little glow if you guys remember in last year's back to school tech video i actually showed off the lenovo smart clock um not the essential but like the more uh advanced one with the actual like touch screen and stuff so this the more budget user-friendly version if you don't want to have to worry about the screen and all that extra stuff that comes with it oh they're both under 50 like i said this one was just around 30 or you can pick it up on ebay for like 20 bucks definitely pretty useful definitely pretty cool next up something you may need to finally activate your pc or laptop is an official windows 10 pro activation key so over on yourcdk.com which is a site that i've been using for years to activate all my pcs you can get a windows 10 pro key for just 15 you'll see it's listed for around 20 but to save you guys some money code vip random will knock 23 off at checkout you see a little promo code box in the bottom just enter code vip random it'll take it from 20 down to 15 which is obviously much cheaper than buying it directly from microsoft but also for the students who may need office for school reports or projects there's also office 2019 pro and same thing instead of 58 bucks you can use the same vip random code to bring it down to 45. once you purchase your codes you can go to your profile and see all your previous orders there you'll see the view keys and code button where you can find all of them you purchased to redeem on your pc and also if you're confused about the whole activation process they do have a how to activate button up top so bring you through a whole guide on how to actually do it plus some troubleshooting tips in case you mess up so again code vip random for 23 off windows 10 pro in office 2019 pro next is a killer gadget for students and that's the eye scan this lets you scan your notebook or your textbook and now have digital copies of your book or your note on your phone or on your laptop makes studying very easy so design wise it's very simple in execution there's two buttons on the left side which lets you sort of change the dpi of your scan all the way up to 900 dpi so you're going to get a nice crisp image and also you can either scan in jpeg or as a pdf you will need a micro usb because that's how it saves all your scans and it does come with two double a batteries which is nice that's how you power this you know but like i just showed you you can get the rechargeable batteries and be good to go so once you power it on you hit the scan button then just slowly roll the eye scanner across the page that you're trying to scan again whether it's textbooks or your handwritten notes whatever you're scanning will now be saved to the microsd card and all the times i've tried it the scan quality came out great it might take you a few tries to you know figure out the exact speed and the sort of width of the page you're trying to scan so once you nail that down you're going to have phenomenal looking scans so definitely kind of a life hack you know you got a test coming up make studying super easy scan your handwritten notes scan that section out of your textbook make studying a breeze uh this is just around 50 bucks now next up is something i definitely classify as a must-have for students and that's apple air tags they're legit a great pickup i know how forgetful i am and you know i'm sure we'll misplace our keys and wallet just stuff in general time to time and these air tags will help fix that immediately i picked up a few of these and some covers and keychain holders really digging this one from nomad but you can also grab a bunch of like silicone ones on amazon for like five bucks but now you'll never misplace anything ever again now like i said before using these to find your keys or a wallet is a given but it's also great for students maybe in like a dorm room setting or if you can bring your laptop to class having this tracker will ensure you never lose your laptop or leave it behind somewhere ever lose or forget your backpack well you won't anymore maybe your backpack was stolen not with this but to me what makes it so important and better than some of the other trackers out there is how it works with an iphone and the find my app it uses your current gps location to personally guide you to the air tag or whatever is missing and as you get closer the phone gives you this haptic feedback as you approach but say you lose something for good like it's not in your house you can set it as lost in the app then whenever someone with an iphone passes the air tag out in the wild it'll use their current gps location to constantly update where it is on a map so you can see exactly where it is that's really the main selling point you know because millions of people have iphones so whenever they pass your lost item the location is going to be updated and accurate but if you're just trying you know find your keys or something around the house you can also just ping it and it'll play a sound audibly so you can track it but again with the app and the arrow leading you step by step to where it is it just makes finding things a breeze pricing on these is more than fair one is 30 or you can buy a four pack for a hundred bucks all right next up is something i just showed off in the cool tech 150 episode for august and people actually really liked it and it's very fitting for students and pretty much anybody and that is this multi-tool multi-device cleaning kit it's very useful has six built-in tools for cleaning your phone's charging port the speakers your cable even but you can also use it obviously for like your laptop ports or a tablet so checking it out ports one and three for getting all that dust lint and just gunk out of your charging ports on the bottom you probably don't think about it but considering how often our phones are in our pocket you know just like your belly button it's gonna accumulate a lot of lint over time get jammed up in there and maybe your phone's had issues charging recently if you don't you know use wireless charging odds are it's because there's a lot of just i don't know pocket lint just jammed up in there so tools one and three are for cleaning all that out the tools four and five are actually for cleaning your cable and the connector pins on that you know over time the pins can get blackened due to corrosion or damage it also comes with this cleaning solution so you could polish that all up clean the ports make it nice then tool six is a brush for cleaning out some of the speakers the microphone the earpiece on your phone again just clear out all that dust maybe your speakers aren't as loud as it used to be well again odds are because there's a lot of dust in there it's just under 30 and like i said definitely useful throw it in your bag your backpack your purse a drawer anything like that coming up next even though it's 20 a lot of us still need to use batteries to charge our tech or to power our tech and i've been a huge fan of rechargeable batteries but these from pale blue hands down the best i've used i've actually showed off a few different ones in this channel before but these take the cake so first up this four pack comes with its own charger kind of like a bizarre octopus type thing because they charge via micro usb and it might sound like a pain to charge each one individually but that's also going to be partially an advantage because if one gets low for example if you just use one or you have one left you can just charge one i'd use some in the past to have a dock where you need to charge two you can't just charge one do they gotta be two or all four so here individually that's definitely an advantage and it has a little sort of like glowing ring around it to let you know the current battery status but more importantly the reason why i went with the pale blue ones over other ones out there is each battery is over 1500 milliamp hours so you're getting more juice out of this but also each one is 1.5 volts and your standard you know just all the ones on amazon most of them are 1.2 volts and most modern technology does require a battery to be 1.5 volts to power things efficiently so you can get them for cheaper out there but odds are they're not going to be a big enough milliamp hour and it's only going to be 1.2 volts so it's not going to hold a charge and your tech's going to be dying a lot quicker i mean plus you don't have to go out to the store and constantly buy new batteries for your controller these you keep recharging them and you can get them in like a ton of different versions you know aaa double a 9 volt d batteries a bunch of different packs as well they are 30 bucks but again given the specs for a battery which sounds kind of stupid to say uh it's very impressive they're the best rechargeable batteries i've used now next up i don't care who you are you got to stay hydrated and this bottle here as you can see is definitely a bit different because it glows to remind you every hour to drink water stay hydrated but also as you can see this bottom is a built-in bluetooth speaker so you have the glowing you have the reminder but also if you want so you know you're in your dorm room or you get some homework done pair your phone to this play some music also by the way comes off so this glow speaker 22 ounce water bottle is from brand ice water which is an ironically sort of on point name for this but yeah there's not too much more you know explaining it needs to be done for this it's a water bottle it does have a few different lighting modes so if you do pair it to your phone to like play music and stuff something like the the lights will like dance to it kind of uh but i just use it pretty much just as the glowing reminder stay hydrated again 22 ounces and it comes in under 20 bucks all right so next up like i said before there's more than 10 things total because this isn't really tech necessarily you know but so i'm going to recommend it for you guys because it is a killer backpack alternative every student needs some sort of bag or a backpack this is the adidas amplifier 2 sack pack which is always very fun to say and it's pretty much like a drawstring bag you know uh but instead of having the actual strings which are very flimsy and definitely break over time these have the full straps you can pull it stays nice and tight and for the size you know it's it's fits a lot um i've got you know my macbook pro in here i think it's 16 inches you know i've got another laptop in here this 17 inches what else we got you got a lot of books you're students you need textbooks got that oh we got some headphones in here tons and tons of room i think i saw your mom down there but yeah for just around 20 bucks a very good pickup i love this i've used it for a while comes in a bunch of different colors as well so you can pick one up match it to your style definitely a pretty good price so all right guys that'll wrap it up for this video on our top ten even though it was more than ten back to school tech items under a hundred dollars to save you guys some money again regardless of your age your schooling who you are what you need hopefully this stuff helped you out have it all listed for you in the description down below
