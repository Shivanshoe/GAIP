what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with episode 218 a room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup this week the clean and minimal addition we also got a special guest to sift showing off his setup you're gonna like that one see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll kick it off now all right how y'all doing this morning of July 5th hope you all have ten fingers still and waking us up today we have Adrian s photography and I am definitely all about this I love that like DIY Ivy accent piece he has going up behind his monitors and up the wall it looks really good so you know definitely fits in for isola display it's a 27 inch asus monitor a 144 hertz panel and then for is peripherals it's a Logitech G 810 keyboard with a Logitech G 401 mouse on a nice leather mousepad and for audio sitting there you can see the headset which is the Sennheiser PC 360 and also off to the right side he has an iPad pro it's a twelve point nine inch model again great for you know editing and stuff photo editing since a lot of this as you can tell by his name Adrian s photography it checks out so for is PC that's the be quiet dark bass 700 case with a nice blue accents all around insides an Intel i7 9700 K CPU with a dark rock for cooler and then a ZOTAC r-tx 20 70 amp GPU all the info we really have on the PC as you can see with this case the insides can actually be flipped and kind of like a reverse build pretty unique so I think Adrian all around males the minimal and like cozy aesthetic going on lots of warmth as well with the cork board here obviously not cork board the peg board you know what I mean it just fits in with the theme wooden desk again love that touch of green with that IV panel behind the monitor if you want to check all this gear out obviously as well as his Instagram it'll be down below up next we have paint a dog and this one stuck out to me right away because again you guys know me by now it's been 218 episodes you feel like you guys know me as well as I know me you know I'm saying I think the point I was trying to make fair which didn't really end up happening was when I saw this I knew who would be a good fit for this episode so for the display that is a bell 25 inch it's from their ultra sharp lineup and it's held up nicely on a monitor arm off to the left side which is hidden you can't really even tell got the phone dock they're hiding it for the peripherals now the keyboard is a coolermaster storm quickfire rapid keyboard I feel like Coolermaster always just throws on ten more words to their product lineup and the logitech m5 10 Mouse with the audio technica ath m50x bt headphone to their wireless bluetooth version in those gorgeous white and walnut speakers or the pol Camden a m6 510 a now over to the PC this is the NZXT th one case and he went the extra mile to kind of customize that front panel to be an accented piece here you can see it's in walnut looks really nice and fits in with the rest of the setup inside that Intel i5 9600 K CPU with their own included a IO got 16 gigs of course revengeance lpx Ram on an asus strix z3 9 TI motherboard and in the video are TX 2070 super founders Edition GPU so it was super clean white and walnut themed set up I love the looks here you even got the touch of green with the plant in the wallpaper I will say maybe consider adding a real plant to the setup or even like a fake one a little bit agreed never hurt nobody next we have Bianca and you might remember her set up I think we had her on probably close to a year ago at this point this the 2020 version and she's made some nice change to the set up all around every time I see it something about it just feels so refreshing maybe it's like the color theme and stuff but I love it it's like vibrant but chill at the same time so for the display of a dell 27 inch 144 hertz panel this one also mounted on a monitor arm off to the right side but again a pretty good job of keeping it out of sight and then for the peripherals we have a ducky 1 2 mini in white with a tie how Hawaiian key cap set and Logitech G 305 Mouse also in white on an artist's in a high-end FX and mousepad nice and vibrant red here and for audio Astro 850 Wireless head in the can't do y-you two speakers gotta say that's a hell of a peripheral line up and then over to the PC this is the NZXT th 500 case inside that Intel i5 9600 K CPU with and xt kraken m22 a io got 16 gigs of G scale tried NZ r gb ram on an msi MPGe 390 gaming edge motherboard and the Asus Cerberus gtx 1070 TI graphics card and as you can see right above that on the wall we had been a leaf Aurora light panels glowing to the color theme make it an even stand out even more kind of even highlight in the RGB inside the PC so I'm gonna need someone to tell me you know what theme is it cuz I know like you I've seen the art style and everything here and she Bianca you nailed the aesthetic 110 percent but I just can't think of like a proper theme name for is it like you know the Hawaiian theme for that high how Hawaiian keycaps X I can get some Hawaiian vibes either way a beautiful setup next up we have Jordan P also a setup I found on Instagram and immediately fell in love with it something about I think for me the wallpaper I've set up before be an entire video on it but a wallpaper can make or break a setup you guys know I said it a million times and this ties it all together perfectly it's super clean everything is so well organized and I love it so for this setup he's rocking an autonomous smart desk to with their autonomous kin chair and for the displays we have dual 27-inch LG 4k monitors mount that perfectly side-by-side and for the peripherals we have the wireless Apple Magic keyboard with the Apple Magic Mouse and right underneath that is the delta hub wrist rest which I showed off a few months ago on cool tech under 50 and yes as you can see with those peripherals this is all being powered by his 2017 15 inch MacBook Pro in addition to his 2020 I pad pro with the magic keyboard for that which you can also use literally hand-in-hand with their like side car and stuff so you can pretty much use that as an extended display and also on the desk he has the Bose mini soundlink bluetooth speaker for audio in addition to the 8 terabyte lassy raid hard drive so again I know people like to hate on Apple for whatever reason and today its productivity its reliability and it also leads for a beautiful clean and minimal set up I just love that pop of red and that like acid kind of wash wallpaper you got going on good stuff Jordan and I'll also put his insta down below next up we got to see what is that guys my name is to see for sane firstly huge shout out to Frank for having me on here it is an honor to be here I kind of grew up watching these room tour projects so it feels a little bit surreal being on one myself so I make videos over on my channel called the safe Hussein about tech gadgets filmmaking and lifestyle and that includes also a detailed version of what I'm about to show you right now okay so the high-level idea here was to build a natural mobile and minimal desk setup I feel that a good desk setup tells a great story a story about who that person is and what they value at that moment in time for me for example that is reducing the clutter around me and embracing the outdoors more leaning into that is the centerpiece of this entire setup which is the bamboo Jarvis standing desk by fully I've customized it to have wire grommets and oled memory panel a monitor arm these super strong magnetic desk hooks and a bamboo desk drawer and my favorite feature these wheels so it can be fully mobile whenever I want it to be so I could do stuff like this welcome back now further to the nature theme right below where I stand is something called the move mat by eros which is basically designed to imitate and simulate the forest floor by including things like a bunch of bumps and shapes in order to massage your feet with my chair of choice is the highly unconventional capisco chair by Hague which was basically designed for those people who can't sit still and also like economics this whole setup is driven by my 16 inch MacBook Pro which is stored inside this pen I'll come under desk lockable drawer this is then connected to my monitor of choice which is the LG ultra wide 5k display now as for my accessories up top in order to complement the bamboo I went with a slightly darker wood and black leather from grove mate and I did this in order to have that little bit of a pop of color separation lighting up my desk is my favorite aesthetic light which as the bright tech circle LED lamp now because I do a lot of voiceovers and sometimes I record podcasts I have a shure sm7b wired up to the cleanest boom arm i could find which as the blue compass lastly it wouldn't be a natural desk setup without some vegetation for me that comes in the form of a succulent a cactus and a Majesty pump alright guys that's it for me if you want to see a much more detailed version of this I have it over on my channel thank you so much for this opportunity Frank I really appreciate it now back to you alright guys I'll wrap it up for episode 2 18f room tour project hope you all enjoyed and a shout out to to sift because that setup is gorgeous definitely a tech YouTube you're on the rise if you want to check his setup out
