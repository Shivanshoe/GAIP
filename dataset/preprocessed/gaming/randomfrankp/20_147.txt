features right at your fingertips you get the addition of a new multifunctional dial to let you change lighting music scroll pages anything you want we now have optical switches with their own op-x linears that are super smooth and fast with their new 4 000 hertz pulling capability in addition to a new wrist rest and dynamic rgb lighting zones this is definitely going to be a lot of people's wish list coming up this holiday season so if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below first up we have cullen and i'm gonna dub this one the nebula set up because i'm really digging that backdrop he has behind the entire setup plus the matching wallpaper spanned across both displays but then when you zoom out you can see he's got that neon like saturn sign mounted above it um if you take a look up on the ceiling he has like a star galaxy projection kind of going on and all together this just looks really really sick i wish i knew the proper name for like what this theme of art is for the wallpaper i just call it like i don't know like a splash but obviously it's more than that but it always looks cool um let me know if you know the name so his primary monitor is a 29-inch viotek 120 hertz ultra wide with the overhead being a scepter 24 inch monitor for the main peripherals is a red dragon k556 kala keyboard with the logitech g502 proteus spectrum mouse on an all-white extended rgb mouse pad then for audio you can see the logitech z523 2.1 speaker setup with the astro a10 headset and you have it rgb headset stand then we transition over to the pc we have the corsair iq 220 t case inside that intel i7 8700k cpu with a cooler master master air g100m cooler their naming scheme always just is ridiculous 16 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb ram on an asus prime z390a motherboard and the asus rtx 2070 oc gpu keeping all the internals to a blue sort of color theme for the rgb lighting with the black and white accents in there matching the setup and then a peak underneath the desk great job with cable management got the gutters there keeping everything nice and controlled nothing drooping down onto the floor always good to see so yeah man like i said calling this one the nebula setup from cullen even in daytime it seems like nice and refreshing and just very chill and relaxed but uh once the nighttime comes turn on all the rgb and then now you're in outer space you're in saturn really really liking it pretty creative overall i'd say and i think just the neon sign really tips it off it takes it to a new level and i would say whatever you're using to project that like galaxy up on the ceiling try to pick up a second one and put it behind the monitor so it goes kind of onto that backdrop then onto the ceiling right above it might look pretty cool hot damn this is another one i tell you guys like whenever you see these super clean and minimal ones in a regular edition like this it's me just not being able to have patience like this very easily could be the thumbnail for the clean and minimal edition but it's just so nice i had to show it to you now because i love it you know what i very well just may put this in the next clean and minimal edition as well because it's my show either way for the display here is an lg 34 inch ultra wide nice 98 inch wooden desk and i love just the accents and some things around the setup even though i would assume a lot of this is from ikea like that lamp it's super minimal but it looks really nice and fits in you got their ikea pegboard and it's actually like organized and done nicely i have one and it looks like utter crap i might take that switch idea though you've got the nice plant off to the side this setup has it all for the peripherals even down to here got the kbd8x mark ii keyboard for the switches they're lubed and filmed gathered on n1s and the keycaps here complementing the case of the gmk gmk-9s using one of those native union cables and for the mouse logitech mx master 2s on the random frank p and novel keys topographic mouse pad this is what you call tasteful good stuff good stuff by the way i know i'm gonna get asked about it no i don't know when it's gonna be restocked some other things you can also see the lenovo smart clock as well as the audio engine a2 plus speakers then over to the pc chilling with some sort of iv on the front draping down it's the nzxt h510i case in all black inside the ryzen 7 3700x cpu with the nzxt kraken m22 aio 32 gigs of g skill trident z royal rgb ram and silver with a zotac 2070 super gpu and just look at that clean glow on the inside like man looks really nice as well so what else more can i say really like how can you look at the setup and not get this just overwhelming feeling of love and then jealousy you know super super clean uh this is easily like a 35 out of 10 okay next we have the bad scott and scott you might be bad but this setup's good yeah that was pretty lame so we're just gonna keep it moving uh for his monitors got the ultra wide stacked orientation here the primary one is an msi optics 34 inch with the overhead being an msi optics 27 inch one thing i like to point out is that like hexagon pattern whether it's vinyl that he has up on the wall if that was just a plain gray wall i really think this setup would just look you know a lot more basic and plain just a little vinyl accents throughout it i think ties it together a lot more down to his peripherals the razer or not a chroma keyboard with the razer mamba mouse i believe that's a custom mouse pad that display on the left side is an echo show five and then for audio he has the kanto yu2 speakers and then for his headsets i like how he has a mounted underneath the shelf right off to the side of the setup so these are the steelseries arctis pro those are ones on the left side the middle are the bose qc35 and then the razer kraken mercury edition headset but now checking out the pc yet again the nzxt h510 elite case super clean build with the ryzen 5 3600 cpu and the nzxd kraken x63 aio and he also has the rad custom painted white with some cable mod covers there for the tubes again got to make it all match 16 gigs of course of engines rgb pro ram on an msi b450 tomahawk max motherboard and a gigabyte rtx 2060 super gpu again love in the all black and white internals here and all together taking a look at it you can see also underneath the desk it's supported as well with two additional legs and a great job with cable management so just a really nice gaming room here you can see you got the tv xbox one as well so you can kick back over there play some console games just really liking the way this all came together now someone call your average consumer because we've got george in the house with a crazy gundam theme set up loving the way he spanned the wallpapers there on the bottom three with a separate one for the top and you can see underneath he also has a fifth display pretty much with his drawing tablet and just a ton of figures around the room some pop figures this is pretty nuts so for the overhead it is a 55-inch 4k tcl roku tv on the bottom his main display in the middle is an asus 24 inch it's the vg24 8qg the two on each side are also 24 inches from asus but they're the vg245h and then underneath his main monitor you can see the drawing tablet this is the huion canvas pro 16 so just tons of pixels tons of displays here and it all looks so so good rgb light behind the desk rgb light behind the main tv man and you can see the pegboard off to the left side with a bunch of like arts and crafts stuff where i would soon be building those gundam figures this all just comes together really really well it's like chaotic in a way almost but not to the point where it's overwhelming i think it's still all put together pretty tastefully down to the peripherals we have the razer ornata chroma keyboard with the razer basilisk v2 mouse on a razer goliath extended mouse pad you can see the ps4 in the back with the pewdiepie skin from dbrand on it as well as the pewdiepie themed chair so we got a pewds fan over to the pc he said this is a pre-built from origin so this is the corsair 680x case inside the intel i7 10700 kf cpu which i had no idea was a thing with their frostbite 240 aio 16 gigs of corsair vengeance rgb ram and an nvidia rtx 2070 founders edition gpu and again props for the cable management because with everything you saw going on on his desktop all the hardware all the monitors this is how clean and organized it is underneath the desk that's some real patience and dedication to the craft and that's what this entire setup is dedication to the craft he has like you know the hobby with the gundam figures going all out with that loving the monitors the wallpapers all the pop figures around gaming setup at its best and then last we have i believe this name is pronounced maybe like mamacita i i apologize that wasn't your intention with the x is kind of throwing me off there so i'm gonna call it mamacita uh so let's roll with that but yes rocking the dual monitor setup red and white loving the use of the nail need for our light panels above the monitor kind of spanning to the side uh by the pc as well but yes very bright and vibrant here so checking it out for the two monitors the primary one is an lg 34 inch ultra wide coming in at 160 hertz and the vertical one on the left side is a 27 inch from lg at 144hz i gotta say good job on mounting as well because all you can really see is the one cable cover coming down definitely pretty clean overall and then getting into the actual gear and hardware and stuff on the desktop you can see got a sound bar there the elgato stream deck xl an xbox one controller as i got a secondary peripheral but for the main set got the razer huntsman mini in white to match the white model o mouse they're both on the razer goliath's chroma mouse pad then up top the pc we have the eraser kraken kitty headset which i've seen before but i never thought it was like a real product i thought it was just like some sort of mod but it's it's legit but for the pc codenamed alaska inside the leon lee pc-011 dynamic white case got a ryzen 9 3900x cpu with the corsair h100i rgb platinum se for the aio with 32 gigs of corsair vengeance pro rgb ram on an asus prime x570 pro motherboard and then the gigabyte rtx 2070 super gaming oc 3x gpu but again even for the internals here the rgb fans and all the rgb just to some of the hardware still matching red and white so i'm really digging this one and as you can see just right next to the setup you can kick back in the chair and get some console gaming done with that massive tv there mounted right on the wall got the nintendo switch ps4 the controllers mounted on the wall as well even have the additional keyboards up there on the shelf so when it comes to just a really great gaming space this one i think nails it really good job all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 231 of room tour project hope you enjoyed don't forget like i said all the gear and hardware will be listed for you in the description
