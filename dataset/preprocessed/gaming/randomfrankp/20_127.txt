[Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p and after nearly nine months we are back with episode 6 of switch it up the series will show off some really cool custom mechanical keyboard builds to show you more about what the keyboard hobby is all about if you see anything you like i'll have most of the keyboard builds and components and all that stuff listed for you in the description down below so you can learn more about them but we'll kick it off now episode 6. first up from youtuber wildcat who is a prominent member in the keyboard building community we have the helix labs aru an egyptian themed keyboard that was a prototype that was sent to wildcat to show off on his channel and i think it looks stunning i'm loving the hieroglyphics that are embossed into the top of the keyboard here and you couple that with the sort of artisan keycaps if you will for the arrow keys they are all made of a white copper completing this sort of sphinx novelty section here for the arrow keys you couple that with the brass weight underneath with this sort of wadget theme to it i believe i'm saying that correctly i hope we also have a brass play inside as well as a dampener to go along with their own sort of switches these are their own custom clicky switches known as skyler and keycaps here to finish it all off is a nice black on white now as a prototype wildcat said this was sent to him without too much information you know regarding the pcb or what stabilizers they're using uh but it seemingly seemed that you can buy this whole kit from their website or at least pre-order it in a bunch of different colors as well so like i said just really liking this egyptian theme they have going on so i assume it's an anodized aluminum to go along with the different colors they offer but again as a prototype i don't have too much info if i will drop it all down for you in the description but now we'll get into the sound test of their clicky schuyler switches so such a unique build from helix labs here i love that i love seeing certain themes like this again all down below shout out to wildcat next up from youtuber tag keyboards we have a really cool custom blackpink themed keyboard that he went full out when it comes to customizing the board itself is actually the inet square x60 and he took it from its original state which was a yellow aluminum frame with polycarbonate and completely turned into a black and pink keyboard to you know fit the group well how did he do that well first up for the polycarbonate plate he did use an actual black dye and then resulted to airbrushing to get that more consistent black coating for the frame of the keyboard and then to have that sort of internal pop with the pink inside for the actual plate he also spray brushed that now fittingly for the switches he used some gadaran ink switches of their v2 run he also lubed them with a crytox 205 grade zero lube and the stabilizers from c3 are also pink again to internally fit that black and pink theme even though it's not seen it's the dedication and speaking of dedication for keycaps to use gmk white on black and i know white isn't a part of black and pink so what he did was actually die his keycaps so now the white accents for the characters would now result in a gmk pink on black custom run here but in addition to everything else he custom printed some badges for the keyboard as well as even custom printing stickers to put on the keycaps just again to make some of those special references or nods to the group and i gotta give it to you take keyboards because this is an absolute phenomenal execution yeah it might not turned out of how you originally maybe thought when you're going through the whole process and some of the you know trial and errors going through but i gotta say this the final result i think uh you could sell this you know like it is just really really impressive i definitely encourage you guys to go check out his channel as well as his video so you can see more in depth on just the lengths he went to in terms of customizing and giving you this finished black pink themed keyboard so now we'll do the sound test with his glued gather on ink switches next up we have mark and he is actually from room tour project known as working i swear with his custom rama build this is the milk m60a sequence 2. and for the actual construction rama does it just really nicely it's milled down from a single piece of solid brass and aluminum then to match the mill colorway of the keyboard his keycaps are the cat alpha keycap set then going a step further to match the gold weight on the backside and underneath he has some sort of artisan keycaps with the escape key spacebar and enter key with this white blue and gold paint ejected into the acrylic to give it this really cool like swirl going on for it it all matches perfectly now unfortunately don't have too much information on things like the stabilizers or if you lubed anything uh we didn't really get to touch base that much after the pandemic but for his switches there are silent v2s that's also in conjunction with their silicone internal dampener on the inside so we'll check out those silence so a great all-around build from mark i always love seeing these rama builds in the end and it just somehow even like goes along with his tabletop or whatever just that rich wooden texture and color and you can even see integrated into the tabletop is those like gold specs and stuff so i don't know how he pulled it off it all just looks killer next up we have space cables and you probably know space cables from the cable company because yes this is the man behind those really nice custom coil cables that you've seen probably everywhere on youtube and instagram for custom keyboard builds as well as you know my channel here today with his rama m65a which he has sarah coated in this iridescent indigo montoya color that subtle accent is gonna pair nicely with his keycaps the gmk laser from mido and of course his own custom coil cable now inside he has some telios v2 60 gram switches which are luba crytox 205 grade zero for the stabilizers they are zeal gold also lube with crytox 205 grade zero we do have a melon keys laser novelty keycap as well as some extra things around the desktop to match like you know the red bull the air 58 desk matt it's all about aesthetics now the sound test of the loops helios v2 and then lastly we have the sonu with yes another rama board this again the rama m60a sequence 2 but now in the moon stealth colorway matching it all perfectly to his gmk phosphorus keycap set you can see there with the joy cons and stuff the custom coil cable uh definitely a nicer like you know muted gray light blue color way again for these rama builds all aluminum and popping off a keycap are his alias 70 gram switches which are not lubed unfortunately no info on stabilizers all right guys a lot of wrap it up for episode six of switch it up hope you all enjoyed and i apologize for the long wait but at the same time there's no real guarantee that there won't be another long wait it's episode seven because getting these submissions together and just finding quality good submissions takes a lot longer than you guys might think a lot goes into this behind the scenes to you and just get a single episode of switch it up out but either way hope you all enjoyed like i said i'll have the specs and the hardware in the description down below for some of the keyboard builds if you want to find out more if you like this episode
