what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out the brand new kikron q1 custom 75 mechanical keyboard that comes in at an extremely budget-friendly price tag so is this too good to be true uh this is doing a lot of really great things for not only the keyboard community out there but for those looking to get into custom keyboards as a hobby so we're gonna go through it all for you guys today like i said is it too good to be true we'll go through the pros cons my thoughts and opinions all that stuff in case you're trying to pick up the new kikron q1 so kikron's entering the 75 market here with a more enthusiastic approach versus their other releases in the past and naturally this is going to draw comparisons to the gmmk pro checking it out inside the box nothing too fancy a pretty standard unboxing experience we'll skip this for now and talk about what we get inside the box in a second but yes first impressions are that it's solid it feels nice with it being all aluminum looks nice i'm digging the color scheme for the keycaps got a custom badge on the top right a little bit of marinara on my left thumb but there is admittedly more going on than what first meets the eye circling back what we get included for us we have a key switch puller for the hotspot pcb a keycap puller extra gasket strips and extra screws and i was missing two hex keys for our screws maybe it's just because i have an early unit but yeah we also get the user manual and a nice startup guide kikron also gives us a nice stock coil cable with an aviator connector in the middle definitely one of the nicer stock cables on the market and since the q1 is both mac and pc compatible they include a set of 8 extra keycaps with appropriate os modifiers and a few extra keys as well and they do that because on the back left side is a dedicated mac and pc switcher which lets you toggle between the different preset layers for that os you can control like screen brightness for example if you're on your mac then right next to that is our usbc port for the cable but now let's see what the q1 has going on inside removing the keycaps reveal their phantom switches we'll talk about these in a minute underneath is the 83 key hotspot pcb then flipping over to get inside our 8 total screws removing these just takes a few seconds obviously but they're the only thing holding the top and bottom of the frame together because like i said before the q1 is gasket mount so there's no actual screws holding the actual pcb to the frame with a slight exception there are then six additional screws holding the plate and the pcb together that's if you want to swap plates we're not gonna be doing that today because we just have their stock aluminum plate included for us but there are then two screws holding the usbc daughter board to the top frame it's connected by one of those standard ribbon cables it's just easier to unscrew the board itself instead then once that's out you now have the pleasure of watching me put the frame back on as i flip it over instead of just taking it out then unnecessary steps frank i guess it makes it more pleasing for the presentation i don't know what i was thinking been off lately we've all had those days all right so one of the main differences between this q1 and the gmmk pro is the fact that this is a gasket mount board not only do we have a layer of foam between the plate and the pcb but you'll see four tiny foam strips on the top and bottom corners there's four on the top plate and four on the bottom this is what gets sandwiched between the top and the bottom of the frame those foam strips compress and gives your typing experience a nice and flexible feel and like i said this is different versus a plate mount keyboard where the pcb is actually screwed to the bottom of the housing kikron said with their foam gaskets this gives you 2.5 millimeters of flexibility just to show you real quick if you're not familiar or you've never used this type of mount on a keyboard before it's not like cheap or creaky you know your first reaction to probably seeing this flex might be that it is cheap because of the visual movements but it's soft it's gradual when you're typing your gaming you know it's up to you how much force you apply you know so if you touch type for example there's not going to be that much flex but the fact that we do have 2.5 millimeters of flexibility just gives you that really nice soft typing experience now you may have spotted earlier when i was taking the board apart inside the bottom housing is a very very thin layer of foam and this sits under the pcb it is glued down so you're gonna have to rip it out if you want to remove it but this is included stock for you and it kind of helps cut down the resonance since like i said the frame is aluminum so you are more prone to that more you know echoey metallic sound last physical feature before we move on as you see on the top right is the badge this one has my logo and was custom done by kikron but the badge can be removed and there's a standard switch socket underneath so if you want an extra key there you can do so but they did also say coming out for just ten dollars more is going to be the option to have a rotary knob encoder and having this knob is great for volume adjustment on the fly and it really is like a standout physical and visual feature on the gmk pro but it is good to know that if you don't need it on your q1 or you have you know well just no use for it overall you could still buy it without it which is nice another thing of the option of that checkout is your switch type with key crown selection of gatineron phantom reds browns and phantom blue switches in our unit are the gathered on phantom reds they're factory lubed and nice and linear but with our pcb it's a south facing five pin board meaning with the five pins you can use pretty much any switch offering you please and south facing is also great for different keycap compatibility and the rgb led in the bottom will shine up to the switch cutout now i will say one of the factors with this keyboard not having shine through keycaps and colored housing for their switches is the fact that you're really not gonna even notice the rgb like at all and with those colored housings it's gonna give the led a slight tint in whatever color your switch is but say you have different colored effects going on or the static color is like yellow or green i don't know it's going to be slightly diffused in the color of your switch housing so it's going to have like a little red tint to it or brown or blue again it's really not a big deal because you're barely going to notice the leds anyways i literally filmed like 95 of this review without the rgb lights even on and i didn't even notice i had no idea you're only gonna notice the lights are on if you're looking at it from like a real drastic angle on the side or where the bottom of the switch is noticeable and from a top down view as you can see there's no light bleed at all the black aluminum plate doesn't really help reflect the lights either so if you're an rgb lover and you're not using shine through keycaps you might be disappointed i usually keep it like a static white anyways but yeah you can't tell at all so in addition to our switches being lubed so are our stabilizers these are gatheron ins said you can also pick up like durrock stabilizers and they'll fit in here as well but yes the stock ones on here are factory lubes and generously lubed at that all right so now we're gonna do a sound test but listen up real quick we're gonna do three different versions okay first up is gonna be a sound test other three switch options with the phantom reds browns and blues then we're gonna go into the actual you know full sound test with the galron reds like i have in my unit and then we're gonna do a slight switch comparison with the gataron reds in my q1 versus how it sounds in the gmmk pro again both using the phantom reds you can hear a difference of each sound profile in each board so three different sort of sound test for you guys sit tight listen up put on headphones you you we'll talk about this in a second don't worry but for the phantom reds in the q1 as you heard yes it does sound a bit hollow and using everyone's new favorite buzzword pingy but not pinging in the sense where the usual sound test if you hear a pinging resonance most likely it's due to the switches but this case with the with the lubed phantom reds it's not the switches it's the board itself all aluminum and since we have that very you know highly flexible gasket mount here 2.5 millimeters of flexibility uh you saw that very thin layer of foam underneath so there's still a decent amount of room for the tray to move up and down like i said 2.5 millimeters so that's why it does have that more hollowy pingy sound you can remedy that if you want you can add more foam you're going to lose a bit of flexibility with the gasket mount it did say they're actually going to include an additional layer of foam inside the box but like i said with this being a pre-production unit i didn't get that either but it is an option so you can sort of absorb more of that ping and hollow sound but you will lose out on that added extra flexibility you're probably going to have closer to a millimeter versus 2.5 millimeters if you do put in more foam and as i just compared it to with the gmk pro again the phantom red switches in here this probably sound better to you because again it's more of a solid chassis uh the gasket mount in this board like i corrected on screen before it's technically gasket mount yes but there is zero flex or give to this board it's why a lot of people knocked it and it's known sort of to deaden your key switch you know it does it takes away a lot of the characteristics a lot of key switches out there so this sounds better in that sense where it's not as hollow but there's zero flex to this so it's admittedly gonna be a trade-off do you want more flex in your keyboard uh if so you're gonna have a bit more of that hollow sound but you can mod it you can do more things to it to take away that sound but still have a bit more flex so it's all up to you it's all comes down to preference that's what the entire keyboard community is about preference and i'm telling you guys it's not the actual key switches contributing to that ping it's the keyboard you can hear just the echo and that metallic ringing sound it has due to it being so hollow on the inside the phantom red switches the stabilizers here factory lubed all sound and feel very very good if it wasn't for that natural pinging we have here so using this for whatever gaming productivity doesn't matter what you use a keyboard for all that matters is that it works up to your expectations right and with this keyboard i have had no issues i did have some weird issues with the software but software is boring we'll talk about that as we wrap this up but yes in terms of its actual performance of the keyboard all good stuff all good stuff i don't have any physical numbers of like input lag or latency on that front uh but i will say people love freaking out about the gmmk pro being at around 25 milliseconds of input lag they say it's unusable for gaming which is just not true because what everybody likes to ignore is the fact that the ducky one two mini also has around 25 milliseconds of input lag and no one complains about that millions of people use it and no one says it's unusable for gaming so i don't know where that came from um i've never noticed or had a keyboard like that affect me i've used the jimmyk pro since release and i've never once been like i can't win this match because my keyboard no it's a lazy excuse it's not true and i don't know like i said the actual input lag latency numbers for the q1 uh but it feels just fine to me it feels like all my other keyboards that i've used so no issues on that end it's thundering now the big thing about the q1 that could pretty much make you overlook any physical flaw that you may have or thing you don't like about it kind of just vanish and go away is the price point okay the q1 fully built out is 170 and that is insane for reference again since it's naturally compared to the gmk pro this was 170 bare bones meaning you still needed to buy switches and keycaps okay you're looking at around 250 minimum to get this thing up and running versus 170 everything included for you already built that leaves you a lot of room to you know like i said before extra modifications if you want pick up a different coiled cable it does come with the beautiful one but if you want to get different color sure you can 170 for this is crazy crazy crazy good crazy good i can say it 10 more times and you look at the price breakdown they give you a lot of options on their website to configure it even more so you'll see here for today's pre-orders and just got released 170 for fully assembled but you can also get it bare bones if you you know have your own switches and key caps that you want to use you can save some money save 20 bucks but you can see here the cube one comes in black which we have a navy and a space gray so they're also going to have different colors later on down the line and literally like 10 minutes ago they sent me their navy unit which as you can see in the you know in more direct lighting it is more of like a royal blue i'd say but again i like the numerous color options we're getting but when you scroll down to customize the q1 it unlocks a lot of extra customization naturally so like i have my custom random frank p badge you too can have your own badge for just an extra 30 bucks which really isn't bad you can upload your own graphic and use it on your keyboard if you want to get a second set of their phantom switches if you want to try out like their the tactile or clickies or whatever they are 15 bucks for one you are gonna need three packs so that's 45 bucks but again that's very fairly priced for factory loop switches that are insanely lubed the other gataron switches you can pick from and add to your card if you choose cherry kale all that stuff so tons of options and then also different colored keycaps a lot of different colored keycaps a bit sus on some of the colors you know we're going to start to get into that whole uh clone discussion but that's a story for a different day and keycaps are an extra 40 bucks guess what how about plates yes we only have their stock aluminum plate in our keyboard but they're also going to give you the option to pick up a brass plate or a polycarbonate plate and honestly given all the customization they allow and how budget friendly at 170 this is for a fully pre-built custom keyboard like this that is enough to just mentally dismiss any cons or negativity you may have about this keyboard because now you have so much room to still customize it and modify it to your liking um if you do want to you know point out some things yeah the rgb on here isn't impressive like i said yeah kind of hollowy all things that could easily be overlooked for that price and it's really really remarkable what they're doing here so soon what this came out in march the gmk pro and just the fact that this is 170 bare bones they're giving you 170 fully built up and uh you know the choice is yours do you want a rotary knob extra 10 bucks you want different plates sure a bunch of different key caps sure this is good competition is always a good thing for the consumer and the custom keyboard market as a whole i think we're going to start to see the price is naturally going to have to start to go down from other companies and manufacturers out there because 170 pre-built that's all i have to say 170 pre-built i don't even want to talk about it right now but it is via and qmk compatible for software you can go in and customize it software is boring showing you real quick in via if you want you know configure it reprogram keys create macros you can do so layers zero and one are saved to the mac presets you have a switcher on the back like i said so zero and one is for mac layers two and three then for your pc presets qmk and via compatible for software so this review has gone on far too long at this point i start rambling time starts ticking all you need to know is 170 for a fully pre-built keyboard with tons of potential and customization yes it's worth it yes kikron is doing some great great stuff that'll wrap it up if you guys want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below if you like this review give it a big thumbs up to show your
