that's today's sponsor luster luster is a free shopping tool in chrome extension that does extensive product research for you from compiling reviews to prices so you can always get the best product for your money so instead of spending hours comparing prices for a product across different websites and looking for similar products luster does it all for you right on amazon and what i like is they even show me summaries of reviews they evaluated so i can trust these recommendations from reviews on places like wirecutter reddit youtube and other popular blogs and a tool i always use to see if i'm getting a good deal or not is the built-in price history chart it's definitely useful so to start shopping smarter save time and money with luster i'll have a link for you in the description down below first up today is a mini fridge for your desk or gaming setup and this one has this interesting looking rgb infiniti mirror which just gives it that extra pop to add to your room it holds up to six 12 ounce cans or eight of the eight ounce red bulls for example or if you have 16 ounce cans it'll fit four i know for me ever since my son was born i just need that extra caffeine throughout the day so having this stocked up with my go-to drinks is a must in the studio the fridge itself is nice and compact so it won't take up much room at all and functionally it gets the job done keeping drinks at around a chilly 45 degrees fahrenheit that is inside's a tiny led light up top to illuminate the can so you can see through the little window and say you want to turn off that rgb infinity mirror you can switch it off on the back it'll keep it running but not just without the lights and sound wise it's a very dull hum so it won't be loud enough or audible enough to annoy you so if you have a crazy rgb gaming setup and you're in the market for a budget mini-fridge under 45 this one from frigidaire is a cool little pickup and again with the infinity mirror and the leds inside it definitely gives off a pretty cool look oh by the way everything i'm showing off today as well as all the cool tech under 50 products from the last three years i'll have compiled onto one list on my luster profile so you can check it out i get questions all the time asking if i have some super list of every product from the series i finally did it the last three years all of my luster profiles so you can check it out again listed for you down below now next up is this invisible phone charger you'll see so it does require some physical things yes but once hooked up it is invisible included in this kit is the wireless charging pad and bracket plus a coiled cheese sticker and they give you magnets to make sure it's aligned properly and to confirm the thickness of your desk will actually work with this so once you determine where you want to place the wireless charger using the magnets on the bottom side of your desk stick the bracket right in the middle through the magnets this will then align it perfectly then you can just slide in the wireless charger so it charges through your desktop surface without you physically needing it on top but to strengthen that wireless connection the conductive cheat coil sticker will go directly on top of where the pad is mounted underneath this will give you now two options one you can either just have the smallest charger in the world with the sticker or you can big brain it and have it hidden under your mouse pad like i'm doing going forward now you'll just have to remember where the placement actually is but in terms of having a wireless charger on your desktop this is by far the cleanest way to do so it's invisible and it beats alternative solutions out there that require you to like drill holes in your desk this completely drill free and it's nicely hidden out of sight and you can always have your phone charging wirelessly at your desktop for just under 30 quick little note my desktop behind me which is a solid piece of acacia wood does not work with this it's just too thick over there and also if you have a phone case on it might not work either so if you want you know raw doggy bareback with no case and you have a desktop that is not a thick butcher block like i do you should be fine next isn't a piece of technology but it's for your desk and you know we show off a ton of different desk gadgets here for your setup so i think it's going to be useful for you guys it makes the cut today this is an under desk storage drawer and it doesn't get any more obvious than that simply mount this under your desk to keep all the desktop clutter down or just to have things at an arm's reach things like i don't know flash drives memory cards pens pencils charging cables all that stuff you get the idea right extra storage is always clutch because who doesn't need more i just keep it at my filming desk so i can rotate between props and my lighting remotes unboxing knives it's definitely a convenient pickup this one is the larger listing at nine by eight by three so it's not large by my definition but again for the items that often will clutter up your desk this will keep them nicely tucked away it's super inexpensive too only 20 bucks i can have everything right here what oh no no not what it looks like this is my uh my dog's favorite chew toy yeah luna's always down here a lot instead of keeping it on the floor i just keep it here when she comes down i can just toss it to her what'd you think that was now next up at the number four spot is a product that i think is such a good deal and i love it so much that i'm going to give them an award for it this is the donner em 11 portable amp and deck which has a ton of really cool features that it's just mind-blowing for the price so first on the oled screen you'll see built-in are 5-band equalizers so you can adjust your eq on the fly as well as create your own eq the big old volume dial there is for navigating or adjusting your eqs as well as your volume and the versatility only starts here you have a quarter inch shack in the front you can also use the included adapter if your headphones have a 3.5 millimeter cable and on the back side is a coax support as well as rca for if you want to use it with like desktop speakers or something now what makes this really special is the fact you can use this as a portable amp and dac with your phone it comes with usbc as well as lightning cable for your iphone and now you've just taken your audio game to the next level there's been countless times where i've wanted to you know use actual good headphones with my iphone when i'm out on a trip or something but it's just not practical but this lets you with ease then whatever you're playing or listening to you'll see the eq in real time bounce and dance of the frequency then obviously you can also use this on your desk setup for a stationary amp and dac if you've never used one before and the em11 boasts a 96 024 bit sampling rate and can power headphones up to 250 ohms so it drives my new dt900 pro x cans like it's nothing i'm honestly just blown away all these features in a super nice and compact form factor this is worthy of my first ever fictional award i made up because i'm so impressed this is the first entry to the cool tech under 50 hall of fame pricing for this as well super fair i picked it up for 40 however i just checked the listing was up to 60 however they have a 50 off coupon so you can get this for just 30 dollars what it's insane it's insane and then lastly we have a novelty product really it looks cool fits the vibe that's this mecca stand for your apple homepod mini or if you have an echo.4 i have a white echo dot that i'm using with this but with the white and black options they have it'll definitely look cool with the mecha stand it's like it's brain you know they said it was designed and inspired by bb-8 and r2d2 but i have to say i'm definitely getting more portal vibes than anything here and again this is purely for aesthetic a nice addition to your desktop if you have an echo dot for it and if this you know fits your vibe the legs and joints are adjustable so it can squat down or you can stand it up depending on how you want to configure it and there are cutouts on the back side for the ports as well as little cutouts underneath you can see like when the blue or red light is illuminated when you activate your echo it's just 29 bucks they sent it over and i was like hey kind of cool why not show it off so all right guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech
