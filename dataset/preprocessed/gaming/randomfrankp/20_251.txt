what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be reviewing and checking out what's new with the Corsair k95 platinum XT keyboard this just came out we'll go over a tall talk about the brand new features what separates it from the original k95 platinum and my overall experience with it so this is the 2020 refresh - the top-selling k95 platinum from 2017 nearly three years after its initial release this keyboard is available in cherry silver blue and brown switch options a mite unit here has cherry blues although after using the speed Silver's the past 3 years I'm probably gonna swap this unit out because Linear's for the win now when get it unbox it's gonna look identical to the original k95 because in terms of design it's literally the exact same keyboard we do have two physical changes that aren't - the actual keyboard itself but I wish it did something extra to kind of separate it make it stand out more on that stuff in a minute so one of the improvements our new PB Tiki caps a new wrist rest and that's it but the main selling point comes via software with their compatibility with the elgato stream deck software making these six macro keys a virtual stream deck inside the box they include the extra set of textured fps and mobile key caps and these new blue s keys to replace the grey G macro keys this allows you to do things like switch scenes go live mute your mic anything you would usually use a stream duct for but while we're on the topic of new features let's just knock this out real quick the nude textured double shot p bt keycaps feel nice and they're similar to what razer did on the huntsmen tournament vision although as you can see we'd still have that slight bold gamer font since they're shining through you'll have the RGB shown nicely to the characters and while that fine grain texture on them is either love or hate for most people I for one like it they still feel smooth to the touch and it's not rough or anything it's just enough to give you this little extra grip and the other new addition is they're brand new wrist rest this one is much more cushion and it's definitely a welcomed addition and a worthy upgrade from the original old wrist rest that one was reversible with these two rubberized textured side there was also magnetic so it just snapped into place but there were zero padding there it really didn't do much for me because there's just no give now we could say it's a proper wrist rest and is much much more comfortable if you guys remember I was always using a third party wrist rest with my k95 because I just dislike that sock one so much it's still just locks into place in the bottom of the keyboard easily removable if you want to attach it and stuff so no complaints here on my end definitely a worthy upgrade in terms of a wrist rest that is so that's all that's new to the keyboard and we'll take a closer look at those as streamed at keys in a minute but real quick let's point out what isn't new here and that's a standard bottom row come on of course there so we'll still touch on some of the actual features to the keyboard but check out my just review of the Kate 95 platinum if you want to see a more detailed look at this because I'm not gonna go over the same exact points because it would just be a replica review but some of the highlighted features are the dedicated multimedia keys and a scrolling volume wheel always a nice addition to a gaming keyboard and here they do it right on the backside with silver USB pass-through and the RGB on this keyboard yes it looks really nice you have an addition of the light strip on the top and back side pretty much so it's like shining out the side of your keyboard the logo on the forehead is also illuminated but again all the same stuff on the original k95 and as I mentioned before we have the cherry blue switches in this unit now after using the speed Silver's for the last three years I'm definitely used to them and I'm more of a linear fan as it is but for those who you know like the clicky cherry blue switches this is gonna be the same story here the rate of four one hundred million clicks in terms of durability and while there's no actual construction change to these stabilizers and stuff in the keyboard it definitely sound better than my original K 95 we'll do a sound test now so you could hear how these blue switches sound so while some Keys like these shift and enter still had a reasonable amount of play and stuff where the actual key is gonna be audibly rattling there wasn't that loud resonance like we used to have when I know you know a lot of companies out there will put those metal bars for stabilizers here with the actual stems and the housings it's decent for a you know mass-produced gaming keyboard yes there are better stabilizers out there I wish they would have maybe had like a factory Lube on there so we're just a little bit better but that's you know the enthusiasts in me talking now revisiting the main selling point of this keyboard with those s keys you'll actually have to download the old god or stream deck software this is completely different than Corsairs IQ software so yes you'll have to have two different software is running to take advantage of these s keys and if you're familiar with the stream deck software it's very easy to use in terms of your actual layout and customizing what these keys are it's all drag and drop from the the list of functions and macros and tie-ins with OBS stream labs mixer YouTube twitch all of the functions are there again drag and drop very very simple and you'll see next to the software there is those vertical six keys and that's pretty much like a visual reminder of what your keys are and what these s keys are gonna be so you can kind of have that bear on the screen you could also like drag it around if you wants if you have multiple monitors you can just drag these six visual Keys wherever but they're not actually like you can't press them on-screen so clicking them with your mouse doesn't actually toggle it and again the reason they do this is so you can see what those keys are sends on a regular stream deck you have the actual LCD screen here you don't have that now we're starts to get confusing for me and where I start to be cynical a little bit is the fact that the elgato stream deck tie-in isn't just limited to the k95 Platinum XT if you have an original K 95 you can also download the software and use it with that so it's strange that this brand-new keyboard with this is a brand new feature isn't just limited to this now I'm also gonna go as far as to say that this just isn't enough for me what I really would have liked is maybe replace the six physical macro keys with those actual LCD screens like on the stream deck or hell maybe replace that numpad with an internal stream deck so you could still have a numpad if you choose to use that but it's an actual stream back with the LCD keys and I remember when the stream deck first launched and then I'll gato joined Corsair my first thought was like yes we're gonna get a full you know stream that keyboard something like that you guys remember the old razor desk soccer ultimate keyboard like give us something like that but better your button said we just have a tie-in with software and an extra set of blue key caps now I get that every keyboard release doesn't have to be this you know grand update but it's been three years and three years in the tech industry is a long time and for their premium flagship keyboard I would have liked more innovation from Corsair giving us just you know new key caps that a new wrist rest isn't gonna cut it and I'm pretty disappointed overall and it's the same keyboard from three years ago it's also launching at the same price the k95 launched at $200 if you go on Amazon and look at the again the original k95 now it's around 130 140 so what's stopping people from buying the older keyboard for a 60 bucks off which still gives you the stream deck software compatibility is 60 bucks for textured pbt key caps and a new wrist stretch that's worth it probably not so come on course they're pre-designed the keyboard give us a new flagship with some sort of additional stream deck tie-in where we can actually have those physical screens possibly on the keyboard itself that would have been worth it in 2020 not a 20-17 keyboard and guys I'll wrap it up for showing you what's new with the Corsair k95 platinum xt hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out regardless I'll put a link for
