what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be going over my custom 850 dollar mechanical keyboard the mechanisk field this is a gorgeous custom had a lot of fun making it so i'll bring you guys through the process talk about it show it all off in case you're interested in the field itself or just you know the mechanical keyboard hobby in general so starting out the feel has been a staple in the keyboard community with its design and ultramarine colorway that really stands out pantone 3035c and you guys know i am all about that loving the way it looks this is from their r5 drop so it's been a few years since its initial release and over time they've only made it better it is a 60 build so it'll maintain that small compact footprint which i understand a lot of you guys out there may be used to your full-size you know pre-made mechanical keyboards from gaming companies but again for the custom market 60 is where it's at also personal preference for this kit from mechanics you can choose to either include a pcb at checkout or use your own as well as your plate option so i opted to go with their branded pcb as well as a brass plate because it's going to complement that ultramarine finish beautifully this trio will run you 360 dollars but taking a closer look at the fjall itself it has a removable brass weight in the anodized aluminum body you can see where unit 415 engraved to the weight we also have their included eva foam dampener it's going to add as a nice absorption pad underneath the pcb and the word field actually means mountain in norwegian so you can see those nice angles and peaks to the sides of the design it's really just a nice knot to its origin so the pcb here is their own wt60d it's even color matched to the ultramarine finish so it's going to look nice has these flex cutouts in the pcb for some extra give while typing now unlike recent builds i've showed off on the channel this one is not hot swaps the switches will need to be soldered also no rgb so we'll let the build visually speak for itself okay so moving along to the rest of our components as we start to build this up next is for our stabilizers i also went with their own mechanism ultramarine screw-ins it looks super nice with the gold wires translucent housing and color matching stem it's just gonna go perfectly with the build itself even though you really won't be able to see the stabilizers there's also no clipping needed here and since they're screwing they're going to be more stable get it with less rattle and i did apply some light lube to the housing and dip the ends of the wires in dielectric grease just for a more satisfying result their own stabilizers are 20 bucks now you're probably wondering about a band-aid mod possibly well kbdfan sells these stabilizer pads they're pre-cut foam stickers that go onto the pcb underneath the stabilizers and their size and cut perfectly to act as that layer to dampen any rattling from the housing onto the pcb and then for good measure i did apply a tiny swipe of lube onto the foam sticker and these for just two dollars from kbdfans now as for switches i wanted to use my turquoise teleos linear switches they're 63.5 grams gold-plated spring with this nice tiffany blue housing and stem they're gonna give you that nice smooth feel like you're surfing on ice [Applause] but yes i did lube them with crytox 205 grade zero lube and for the first time i used a lube station from space cables and my god it saved me a ton of time just being more organized and having it all laid out placed right in front of me so i can just go through and lightly lube the inner bottom housing applied a very light coat to the stem and again just with this lube station i can then go through and quickly reassemble them all to top shell i know lubing is often like a dreaded process of building a keyboard because it's very tedious it can get boring but honestly i really enjoy the process it lets you just put on some music and think about absolutely nothing but the task at hand for like an hour so you just mindlessly do the same thing over and over until they're all done and then in the end it's just really rewarding it's a really rewarding difference versus the stock switches and i'll do a sound test in a bit don't you worry i got you then once they're all lubed and assembled it's time to really get to soldering now what i really do when it comes to soldering a keyboard and since i haven't done this in probably like two years or so uh first just put a switch in each of the corner plus on the spacebar so i could solder them first they give the pcb and the brass plate just some even stability that way the other ones won't like snap out if i'm putting them in on the other side or something like that and again while doing this just go through got to carefully make sure all the pins from the switches are sticking straight up you snap them in one by one you'll see all the pins and plastic feet sticking through the bottom of the pcb evenly then from there once all the switches are soldered you just place it back into the field itself and then from there most of the work is pretty much done it uses just the six screws plus the two mounting posts which are actually removable now on this run and i will say even though it's not entirely visible as a finished result i wish the screws were gold matched as well or gold plated so it would just you know fit in a little bit better if you're looking at it straight on but again it's not even really visible when it's fully built up so as we start to wrap it up and add the visual eye candy for keycaps i went gmk metropolis which is one of my favorite sets and you've probably seen me show this off before especially when i redid my grade 600 peaks build when i swapped those key caps out to this set but it's going to work perfectly here because you have that dark blue color to the actual keycaps going to match the board nicely then that light blue almost teal kind of character for the key gonna go along with the look of our switches even though it's not a big deal you're not gonna really see the switches again it's kind of personal preference i want that stuff to either match or complement each other now the base metropolis set is a hundred and eighty dollars but that's just again for the base color set so i did get their midnight set add-on for the modifiers and the extra set for the icons so that's 330 dollars just for this set of gmk metropolis trust me i know i know i agree with you kill me then speaking of eye candy i knew with this build i wanted to go with a nice artisan looked around for a while and saw on instagram a tree alum she makes some beautiful resin keycaps and it was just perfect timing because she released these right as i got the field in back in i believe it was august or september and with the hue of the light blue and the teal finish in these artisan caps it really matches the build perfectly and i wasn't 100 sure which one i would go with was debating back and forth but then once all the keycaps are on you can see that nice brass plate shining through real nicely i took one look at the the gold specks and i knew that that had to be it again complementing the brass plate and i think it looks so so good it is a perfect keycap for this build and then the last piece to just top it off obviously we're gonna need a nice custom coiled cable to complement the looks of the build space cable sent over the perfect match it's got the teal braiding and the text flex so again complement the characters with that teal colorway as well got the nice tight coil and even put my logo on the black aviator and then just like that our field is done and looking beautiful everything here just perfectly complements each other and for me especially when it comes to visuals that's one of the best parts about building a keyboard you have that full freedom to really take in any direction you want there's so many different keycap sets out there switches ways to complement and just create a nice look for your keyboard so when it comes to aesthetics it's honestly one of my favorite parts about the whole building process you really start with just the case and then from there it's up to you to make your creation and just because it's a tiny 60 board does not mean it's a slouch because it comes in at over four pounds and uh tell you it's definitely hefty you know premium price you want it to feel a premium so we'll quickly break it down again the feel the pcb and the plate came to 360. my teleo switches were 72 dollars at release for a pack of 70. stabilizers were 20 my gmk metropolis set with the base the midnight accents and the icons 330 dollars even if you include the 10 shipping the single autry loom artisan i used was 50 and our custom coil cable from space cables is 30. so before you know it 850 bucks man i'm sorry keith and now the moment you've all been waiting for we'll do a sound test of our custom field build with the lubed turquoise teleo switches and what i'll do is obviously do the full sound test of the completed keyboard but also what i'll show you first is an example of how these teleo switches sound lubed versus unlubed the lubed switch will have the the the nice color colorway artisan and then the unloop switch will be the artisan with the x on it all right so now you're probably thinking that sounds like very quiet and honestly it's not the most satisfying response if you're especially used to like tactile switches or clicky switches but since these are lubed and you know they're being linear as it is one of the things i noticed is since these particular ones are 63.5 grams they're obviously a bit heavier so while typing itself naturally i can feel you know there is that there is more resistance when typing so if you're you know touch typing especially you're not going to be bottoming out all the way so it's not going to have that loud fulfilling response that you might be used to on some other loop switches but all together you can hear that dampening pad inside doing a lot as well the brass plate and again just the keyboard as a whole looks really nice feels really nice but audibly not the most satisfying but hey i'll deal with it because you know i love a nice smooth linear switch but yeah guys i really hope you enjoyed the custom mechanics fail build i know i did i love doing it and i'll have all the components and stuff that i use listed for you in the description down below and feel free to comment your thoughts on this keyboard and trust me stay tuned we have a pretty exciting build coming up very very soon as well but guys that'll wrap it up hope you enjoyed again give this video a big
