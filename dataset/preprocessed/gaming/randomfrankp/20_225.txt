what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today and you have another keyboard built for you guys but we're gonna be customizing and updating my grid 600 keyboard if you remember over the summer I built that up and it was one of my favorite builds that I've done today we're gonna be completely changing that up from top to bottom inside and out new switches new module new key caps new cable new plate very very different as you can see but I kind of like it so if you haven't checked out the original build video from the summer I highly suggest doing that but before I tore it down I got some clips of it real quick so you can see how it used to look we had that green Peaks module and it looked really nice with the gmk metropolis key caps and I had Ludgate around ink switches a very smooth linear switch but one of the cool things about the grid 600 keyboard is a fact that just changing that top module could give it a completely different look so we'll do a rundown in this video showing you the new setup in my grid 600 and also do a sound test because the two keyboards are polar opposites and that should be interesting so first up we just have those six screws on the back side of the keyboard which hold the module in place and then from there we can completely swap everything out and the only thing I'm reusing from this is the actual chassis or pretty much just starting bare-bones here so once the old PCB and plate was out at all just you know staying together so for the new hardware from one up I have their 60% hotspot PCB and I go with hot swap again because with these customizable keyboards it just makes it a lot easier to quickly switch out the switches no pun intended if I wanted to do that on the fly it makes it real easy without having to you know D solder and solder and stuff like that and for the actual frame I'm with a 60% carbon fiber frame from KVD fans it's solid but it's gonna give a bit of a give when typing I'll be using some genuine cherry screwin stabilizers and yes they are clipped lubed and we are gonna be doing the band-aid mod although like I've done in the past I'm just using medical tape does the same thing now I'll just give a more satisfying result to our stabilizers so they're not as ratalie now one of the main differences to this build is gonna be the switches like I said you used to have Linear's with those gather on inks now we're going complete opposite very clicky and tactile switches with the novel keys and kale speed maybe fit clicks these are not only really clicky but they're loud so in terms of how they're constructed these switches have a thicker click bar on the inside which is gonna result in that louder sound and feedback and with speed included in the name they have a total travel distance of three point five millimeters and a pre travel of two millimeters so they're gonna actually add around 1.5 millimeters so once you have the stabilisers on the PCB the frame in place and all our switches are attached we can screw it down and really all the building is pretty much done it's what I really love about the custom grits 600 is the fact that it just takes zero effort to modify it we can then attach our new flash module which you will see in more detail in a minute but the whole inspiration around this build was gmk dots this custom key cap set actually started as I believe in April Fool's joke then it got so much traction people loved it that it actually became real and as you can see it is just very very different instead of characters and functions we just have dots colored dots and it just looks really unique you either love it or you hate it yes it's not gonna be for everybody but in terms of aesthetic it really provides an interesting look to a keyboard and I'll tell you right now typing on this is not easy I'm horrible with it but again that's not the point it's about aesthetics welcome to the world of keyboards so there's actually two underlying tie-ins here the first thing is with these Navy key caps on gmk dots I wanted them to kind of go along with the color of the switches because those speed Navy switches are also a dark navy so again while it's not about the appearance in that sense I wanted those to match but they also complement each other and the fact that when I see gmk dots and those white dots on the actual keys I think of ping pong balls that's just what comes to my mind and what better to represent that then a loud thick click with the speed maybe so it all ties together perfectly in my head at least then the last piece is a custom coiled cable from space cables you already know what it is and this is just a great accent piece I told them that I was doing a Jim que das bild he said say no more Pham he sent it over and matches great you had the white cable at that black braid to hit on both the white and the black frame in the colored heat-shrink on the cable also hits on the colours of the modifiers Wow so once it's powered on you can see it come to life in that top module again the flash module has this built-in RGB light strip there are two buttons on the side in which you can control the lighting all that stuff and the built-in effects because there is really no software to control it it's all just done right here on this module and there's probably like ten effects built in I'd say you could switch between and also holding down on one of the buttons will change up the colors if it's like a static effect or if it's just a one certain color you can change that up pretty easily but I just like the cel RGB wave that goes through at the same time it's again it's hitting on all those colors it's breaking out those color accents and the modifiers and the funny thing is this keyboard was actually one of the renders used to show off Jam K dots and that's when I first saw the grid 600 that's when I was like this keyboard looks awesome what is it and that's what made me originally pick up the grid 600 and now from a render to real life I'm pumped and now is time for the sound test with these speed Thicke clicks and what I'm gonna do is let your sound test back-to-back because before I tore down my old grid 600 build I recorded a final sound test of the gather on ink switches that I looped so you're gonna hear just total opposites thick and clack tile smooth and linear back to back here we go you're welcome so what do you think I want to hear your thoughts down below do you prefer a tactile fit click or would you like these smooth Linear's I know for me personally if I had to choose I think I would go more than linear route that's just what I prefer but there is just something super satisfying about a super thick click and these I think you can put these right up there the speed Navis I would say with the Box Jade switches in terms of just audible feedback not only do these provide like a bump because they're heavier switch I believe they are 70 grams I believe I could be off but they're heavier and you feel that bump and with the box Jade's you hear that the nice sharp click this a louder thick click so comment down below are you a linear fan or a tactile fan but yeah I just figured a nice update to the grid 600 because since it is so modular easy to customize I figure once the gmk dots came in I do a completely new build to not only accent them but show off the flash module so that I wrap it up guys hope you enjoyed this video if you did give it a big thumbs up to show your support don't forget comment down below team linear team tactile feel free to follow me on twitter at
