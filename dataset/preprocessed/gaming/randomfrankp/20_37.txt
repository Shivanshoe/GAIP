what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be unboxing the 2021 razer costco bundle this known as their huntsman bundle um oddly named so i've done these unboxings pretty much every year you guys have seen the recent holiday bundles we're gonna dive right in see what we can get out of this 2021 costco razer husband bundle go over it all see if it's actually worth your money your time all that so interestingly um you guys have seen my do these in the past okay i've done these every year for the past like maybe three or four years now and typically these are packaged in a different package but we've just got boxes instead of a you know a themed nicely designed holiday bundle box so they're all just actually in their retail packaging so interestingly that is the case here so i'm just going to get these out real quick and we will see then what all we've got go over the value all that stuff kind of disappointed not gonna lie i was hoping for a nice you know thing i can put on the thumbnail a nicely themed box all right so i did see on the actual costco site they had a heroic bundle uh but that didn't seem to worth it to me i was definitely more interested in this huntsman package because the price here is very very interesting okay this all together on their site was a hundred and eighty dollars however let's take a look at actually what we're getting because right now the huntsman v2 tkl this is the newer version obviously the v2 this itself is 160. okay 160 for this right now when this is all 180. so 160. the black shark v2 this comes with the usb sound card this itself i believe is 100 might have been cheaper and stuff for black friday as well as the rest of this stuff but 160 100 the viper ultimate uh this does not come with the dock so it is just the very popular viper ultimate mouse itself their wireless version this is 130 again probably cheaper for black friday cyber monday but on their site 130 and the razer gigantis v2 large mouse pad i want to say they're 15 or 20 bucks i believe it's 15. so all this together retail msrp is 405 versus the 179 for the entire bundled package from costco so when you're talking price to actual value here that's insane that's insane so if you need you know a new peripheral upgrade for the holidays that's entirely what this is for obviously and we're not going to waste any more time i want to hop right in and again i'll show them off for you guys because while these are you know definitely popular products and stuff i understand not everybody um knows what this stuff is but i'm sure a lot of you definitely know at least about the razer viper ultimate i always try to open things like the most aesthetically pleasing way without tearing at all you know but sometimes it just it just happens that way that's all right all right so yes this is the viper ultimate they're a wireless ambi mouse i believe it's 74 grams you have the of side sort of grips here that are rubberized a very popular mouse in the mouse market because when this came out in october of 2019 this really started to shape the the rest of the trend for lightweight mice out there because you look at the design it was lighter at the time for 74 grams but it didn't have any holes or cutouts in the shell um great sensor and stuff and uh you know 20k dpi optical switches uh this really did some great things when it came out and i made this for probably 18 months maybe a little bit less but a fantastic mouse bundled in here is just uh crazy still crazy now at first when i saw this online i thought this was the wired 8k version because they have the 8k polling version out there which is not wireless but you know wired however this is like i said before the viper ultimate so we're still getting the wireless mouse which is still definitely pretty good upgrade you have the little receiver extender here you plug in the usb cable if you want this closer to your pc the dongle is then held underneath inside for it to be wireless you plug that into either your pc or the extender whatever floats your boat but man uh 130 mouse in this 180 dollar package all together and then while we're at it real quick just because again this is the newer one this just came out i want to say possibly in august maybe september uh it recently came out but again the v2 the actual upgraded version here is the upgraded model then of the original huntsman that uh also was really great to see in the market because as much as you want to give razer crap probably they've done some really good things over the years with listening to community feedback and what fans want to see and when this came out it really again helped sort of shape the rest of the market because they put out this 10 keyless version you know at the time it's it's called the tournament edition but the tkl really was starting to become more popular now we have 60 and stuff but yes the tkl version and this had i want to say maybe like five major upgrades over the original huntsman again i made a video on that if you want to check it out sorry if the uh unboxing is sort of loud for you guys the mic's always right up here but okay so checking out the v2 this is not a wireless keyboard but i'm not going to plug it in right now so first of the five changes to run through real quick if you don't want to check out the video you should if you're interested in the keyboard or the bundle is you get this nice soft touch padded wrist rest that is included obviously the keyboard itself is 160 and again this entire thing is 180 so just the value there is pretty crazy but you get this included uh the next change is inside they actually listened to i want to say my feedback and sort of tell them what to do with this was they put in a nice dampening pad so now you hear a lot less rattle and a high-pitched resonance that we had on the original which plagued the sound for a lot of people because it was just very very um like i said high pitched and we get on your nerves after a bit they also sort of put in their new line of optical red switches here because as you can hear they're linear not clicky and they actually put silicone dampeners into the stem of the switch itself the stabilizers now are lubed internally and underneath the keyboard with some rubber pads that are embedded sort of on the standoffs here so where all the stabilizers are there's a little piece of rubber underneath by the pcb and that just sort of helps absorb the uh when you bottom mount stabilizers again for a more satisfying less harsh sound and then this is also a 8 000 hertz pulling rate for the keyboard so it's reporting to your pc at you know the 8k hertz versus the just traditional 1000 hertz so it's faster you combine that with the linear switches and the fact that they are their optomechanical lineup and yes that is the v2 tkl for you guys so again that's 160 itself the mouse already uh 130 nuts nuts uh now the black shark v2 and i forgot about this because they have the the black shark x and then the black shark pro but i forgot they have this sort of middle tier model here which is wired unlike the v2 pro and the major i guess like the the main update over what would be considered like i guess my favorite model with the black shark x is the fact that this is just you know it gives you that usb sound card for eq'ing and stuff like that and just sort of getting more of that emulated sort of not like surround sound but that emulated sound with eqs you could mess with let's get it unboxed for you guys a little bit of dust on it maybe maybe it's just from me handling it right now on my desk but it seemed to be a little dusty out of the box which is odd so again i absolutely love the black shark lineup i have reviewed it it's been included in cool tech under 50 series it was it's one of the most popular headsets of all time because i want to say it launched for uh 60 bucks the v2x and it's recently been down to like 35 to 40 bucks and it is just hands down fantastic the sound quality the microphone quality the build the comfort one of the best headsets out there at that price of 30 to 60 bucks this again the same thing with the just really major difference here being this usb sound card i'm not going to do like a mic test right now for you guys because again i'm just showing it off i don't have anything here to plug it in real quick uh but i i've done numerous videos on this it was included in the 2020 top headset video of the year it was i did a dedicated video on all three of the models uh so if you want to see more about that and hear how the mic sounds check out those videos but yes just the comfort you have the built-in sort of volume dial here right in the left ear cup it's very simple i loved the original black shark model from like 2012 where it was like the mechanical arm you know that pilot headset look to it i loved that back in the day that was one of my first gaming headsets when i first started pc gaming again i think 2012 2013 and this just a more modern looking version love it love it crazy good value so again this is not the x but more the updated version for a hundred bucks then that'll kind of close us out with one of the more boring things you know a mousepad is always one of the more boring ones but obviously it's gonna be sort of necessary if you're gonna be using a nice mouse like the viper ultimate and here you get the gigantis v2 uh it's the large version which i mean it kind of i guess this is considered large whenever i think of large i think of like extended but i guess extended mouse pads are its own model and yes okay i don't know if things are coming out dusty and dirty by themselves if i'm just putting them down i probably gotta clean my desk a little bit cause there's just dust and glitter from when i was filming the holiday video and stuff from some of the ornaments yes gigantis v2 personally would have loved this was the new razer strider mouse pad that is crazy i love the strider but real quick just spotting a little bit of warping right here in the middle of the top and bottom from when it was folded up kind of a bummer uh it doesn't seem to want to flex out too much because the material is all rubber so it's probably going to be you know i'm not going to say permanent but i don't like that warping it's pretty obvious you can probably see on camera from the overhead shot again if they could have found a way to make this the strider be included that would have been great but on the viper ultimate you have the 100 virgin ptfe feet so a nice upgraded you know with it with these nice slick skates still feels smooth on here even though my desk itself is you know wooden and i can feel the texture through it because it's not an even surface this is actual wood so i feel those bumps and where each piece of wood is on your desktop you might not have that version so it's a thinner pad overall but again with this sort of smoother rubberized texture underneath this top is nice and cloth it feels pretty good feels pretty good now just checking the box real quick underneath it says this is their textured microweave cloth surface for speed and control and to be honest it feels like a traditional cloth mouse pad i'd say which is why i love the strider so much because that's sort of a hybrid best of really good slick speed with also some control but this just feels like more of a traditional cloth pad but again only 15 bucks for this so it's not a deal breaker i would still recommend the strider if you are getting this bundle for sure but man let's bring it all back together real quick razer viper ultimate you have the huntsman v2 tkl again included with their actual wrist rest and the black shark v2 just this is a crazy bundle again i know i've been saying it but the price here 405 dollars if you were to buy this all individually versus buying the costco huntsman bundle for 2021 which is just 179. so uh yeah i definitely recommend it again you are probably better off buying other peripherals separately that's gonna be more tailored to what you're looking for you know when you're sort of just narrowing yourself into an ecosystem like this if you're not too familiar with what else is out there you're gonna be hurting yourself in the end but if you have just crappy peripherals like you know a five dollar thing from your local gas station and you want to upgrade you don't want to break the bank and you want decent quality this is all good quality stuff stuff that i've used stuff that i recommend for 180 bucks this trio right here is gonna be a massive massive upgrade and improvement i guarantee it guarantee it you're gonna like the way you look so all right guys that'll wrap it up for the 2021 razor and costco huntsman bundle hope you enjoyed again insane value i just wish it came bundled with a nice holiday themed box instead of retail packaging but again maybe this way hey you could possibly re-box the stuff up and resell what you don't want out of this bundle i'm sure racer doesn't want to hear that but again if you don't want to use the mouse pad resell it if you've got one of these already like your own sort of keyboard and you don't want to use this keep it in the packaging resell it that's one of the bonuses so i guess not getting its own separate holiday themed box but whatever if you want to check it out i'll still put it listed for you in the description down below obviously with costco you have to be a member and stuff you have to have
