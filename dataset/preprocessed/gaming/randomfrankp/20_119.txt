what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out a brand new 60 mechanical keyboard that enters the gaming market this is the hyperx alloy origins 60. this just released today and while these keyboards are exploding on the scene we have a new competitor in the market following things like the huntsman mini from razer uh cooler master has their own 60. so we'll check it all out for you guys today go over the pros and cons do a sound test all that stuff in case you're interested in picking it up so first up like i said in the intro the 60 keyboard scene is definitely becoming more popular in last year in 2020 when they released the alloy origins core tkl keyboard i dubbed that my favorite of all of 2020. they did a great job with that so when i heard they were releasing a smaller 60 version i was definitely interested to see if that could hold up or follow suit with design and construction and i can tell you right off the bat it definitely does because when i first got it unboxed and i picked it up it has some weight to it it's definitely hefty and the material here is all that aluminum hence the alloy names it's an aluminum alloy construction the bezels all around are nice and minimal has the rounded edges to it so i think it looks really nice they get a thumbs up in that regard for the build quality and the visual aesthetics taking a closer look at the pbt keycaps they have a real slight texture to them so it's going to feel nice on your fingertips but also it's not going to show that gloss or that shine from oils or the fingerprints and stuff so it'll do a good job at avoiding that and one of the big things i always see oddly enough with 60 keyboards is people like really complaining that the reason they don't want a 60 keyboard is because they don't have all the functions at their fingertips but you literally do because the function key exists believe it or not so using that function key you still have access to like the arrow keys f1 through 12 is up top you can adjust your brightness the profiles you have media keys it's all side printed on the keycaps here that give you those functions so trust me you're not losing out and i get there's no pleasing anybody i've joked about this before on twitter when i show off a 60 board like this the vocal majority complains that there's no numpad then when i show off a full-size keyboard people are complaining that no one uses a numpad but i guess circling back my point was the function key on here still gives you access to those extra functions inside the box they do give you two extra goodies that i have on the board right now including the hyperx logo on the escape key and a familiar looking space bar toppo accents on a keyboard where have i seen that before hmm couldn't be me hmm no not me hmm toppo accessories for gaming not ringing a bell hmm mine will now now don't get me wrong i'm not saying i invented this in the gaming space by any means but i certainly didn't see it in gaming peripherals before 2019 when we launched the mousepad then last year the keyboard now hyperx with their own spacebar and i will say it's done very nicely i like how it's shined through that's definitely a cool little plus and also it's a bit textured so the grooves in that topo design you can feel those sort of individually it's not like aggressive it's a very subtle texture to it but i do like it i'm not gonna lie i thought at first when i got this in that it was like a little additional accent piece just for me but then i saw it was in their branding materials and i was like oh this is an actual part of the keyboard that everyone's gonna get okay cool again stuff like this the little novelty accented keycaps that companies are including i am all for 100 it's just funny that it happens to be topo also real quick the coil cable i'm using here is not included this is my own uh they do have a usbc cable included inside the box it's just a stock cable and do note it seems they took some feedback from the alloy origins core tkl because usb c port is now properly on the left side so it gives the coil cable users like myself some more room to have it nicely on display then lastly before we move on flipping it over you do have two flip out feet plus the full rubber pads in each corner to avoid it sliding around your desktop now as for the switches in this unit here i have their own hyperx red switch which is linear has the 80 million keystroke lifespan actuates at 45 grams down at 1.8 millimeters and has a total travel distance of 3.8 millimeters so while this is one of their three total offerings they have their tactile aqua switches and their clicky blue switches this is currently the only switch available but i assume they're going to be having all three available to pick from and while the design to the 60 here has the floating switches you can sort of see the right accents on the switches underneath it's very very minor though and really shouldn't be a problem death taxes and me doing a sound test to moisten your pants sound overall for the aluminum frame was pretty decent uh there really wasn't a lot of audible rattle or pinging for the stabilizers which is good a space bar maybe a little bit more but in terms of actual feel for the stabilizers i didn't notice too much actual rattling and stuff when i was using them they stayed in place so in terms of my actual use case gaming testing all that stuff put it through the usual paces which is just hating everything about battlefield v even though i continue to play it durability wise i tried to flex it a bit didn't really budge so all good there but yes gaming with these red switches it felt fine it felt right as i expected i do want to point out we'll take a closer look at it in a second but you do have to download their hyperx ingenuity software if you want to go and do things like change up more the effects because they just have the three on-board profiles to the keyboard itself and there's a microsoft store exclusive which is uh pretty annoying but i mean there's nothing for me to really complain about for the keyboard itself when gaming it's got the full n key rollover you know 100 anti-ghosting i didn't experience any issues with chattering obviously that would be a pretty big deal that i would have brought up by now no quality control issues it all just felt really good i'm very used to using linear switches you guys know by now so there was no adjustment on that front they still felt very smooth that 1.8 actuation point does give you the slightest bit advantage that no one's ever gonna really notice but hey those .2 millimeters might make a difference just keep telling yourself that the ruler only lies sometimes but no all in all for the keyboard again no complaints on my end felt great performance wise it does what you want a keyboard to do and yes while there's optical switches out there you have certain speed switches they're technically faster and more reliable once you factor in all the technology and stuff behind it but honestly things like your internet speed ping input lag refresh rate are all much more important so what i'm saying is this keyboard isn't going to hold you back at all all right so now for the ingenuity software which is my biggest issue with pretty much hyperx as a whole you can see it's really not too complex so i like the fact that it is relatively user friendly and simple but that could be to a fault because it's too simple in terms of what they offer so under the lights tab this we can change up all the rgb and it's right there on the bottom you only have 10 total effects with seven being the looped effects which is just pretty much their standard rgb effect offering or you can go up top where there is the choose triggered effect which gives you three more triggered lighting effects which for example when you press down on a key it'll then do a separate animation so you only have 10 rgb effects total which i think is very very limiting right i mean that's that's not a lot it's 20 21 rgb has been a pretty big thing since 2014 at this point so only 10 is kind of strange you technically can do things like stack layers on top of each other to create more effects but you're still limited to just those 10 ones they have for you now the next keys tab is where you can go in and you know create macros change up what each key does individually both for that base layer as well as the function layer which i talked about before that's where you can go in and you know assign the different profiles rgb your media keys the arrow keys you can create more functions than just the ones that are side printed on the keycaps so you're not limited in any way but then over on the right side of the software you'll see their presets tab and this is just pretty much the three profiles that they have on the board at all times so you can create more than just three presets or more than three profiles but only three actually save onto the keyboard so regardless of what you're creating you really only have those three to pick from at all times so if you make some different rgb effects and you have different macros and reprogram layers and you save them to a new preset well you can only assign three to the keyboard so at the end of the day i'll say this but the origins core 60. for a hundred dollars that's a pretty competitive value taking a look at the 60 landscape out there considering especially this is that aluminum alloy frames it's nice and solid plus you get pbt keycaps which is an advantage over most of the 60 keyboards out there right now but i do have to say please give us more than three on-board profiles improve the software a bit i know while i'm still annoyed that it's a microsoft store exclusive that's probably not going to change but give us more than just three on-board profiles that only gives us three rgb lighting effects to change on the keyboard itself that's very limiting that's very like 2012. we should have more than three on-board profiles at this point um also while you're adding the software give us more than the very standard rgb lighting effects those are very limiting and nothing you know too extravagant will say then lastly while i hinted before that they're going to be probably offering more switches available in the future um i would probably wait until this comes out in the aqua tactile switches because those are one of my favorite switches of all time i don't know what they're doing but they're you know like a brown equivalent the cherry brown switches with them being tactile but they're just way more smooth so they're a smooth tactile switch i love them so i would probably wait until those are available to pick up the origin 60 because right now while the keyboard itself is great i don't have any qualms with the keyboard itself i would just rather it have those aqua switches to be fully worth it in the end so like i said my main gripe is with the software being limiting keyboard itself not doing anything too special it's made well but the the aqua switches would make it a better purchase i say so that'll wrap it up for my review of the hyperx alloy origin 60. hope you all enjoyed if you did give it a big thumbs up show your support and also drop the link for you in the
