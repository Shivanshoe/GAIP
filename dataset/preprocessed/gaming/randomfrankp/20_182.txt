what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be customizing and modding the razer huntsman mini keyboard this is the new and improved linear switch version with those silicone dampers on the inside and you know this keyboard has been very well received overall it's very popular already but there have been some complaints so in this video we're going to take it apart and do some mods to make it better if you want to check it out i'll have the stuff we're going to be using in the description down below and obviously you know since we're doing modifications this is clearly up to you i'm not responsible if you completely [ __ ] it up everything we're gonna do is like a beginner to slightly intermediate level so you shouldn't have any issues here so to take it apart don't worry it's not too complicated or anything there are 13 screws in total you'll have to remove and able to take off the top plate don't lose these obviously but once they're all out don't just rip it apart at this point because underneath you have to be careful there is some wiring going on that we're going to have to disassemble my recommendation is to open it from the top side down so it's easier to work with those cables there on the bottom housing there's a flat ribbon cable and it's just held in by this plastic little lever you flip that up and ribbon will slide out then for the red black and white cable just carefully pry that out okay so first up for a dampening foam this is gonna be probably the most important part of this whole modification this is literally arts and crafts foam it's called eva foam i think it was like ten dollars this is gonna work perfectly for dampening the bottom housing the mini is roughly eleven and a half by four inches in size so just cut a rectangular piece relative to that you can trim it down after if it's not perfect but since it's foam it's gonna be really easy to you know just make it fit inside this i believe is the two millimeter thickness i would recommend either the two or the one millimeter only if you just lay the foam on the top and press down what it's gonna do is leave an imprint of the exact size you're gonna need to cut as well as where all the mounting posts are for the screws then from there you can just use scissors to poke through the foam so that the uh the mounting posts stick through cut little area for the cables to route through then once you press it down into the case you should be good to go the damper is going to make a big difference what this is going to do is help absorb any extra pinging in those vibrations on the bottom of the plastic housing you'll hear me do a sound test comparison in a bit so hold tight okay so next up is going to be optional i'll admit because razer already does factory lube their switches on the new linear versions but we're going to be applying a dry lube with wd-40 just make them even smoother we're pretty much just doubling down what they already did so razer claims they do factory lube their switches and in my full review we took them completely apart and inspected them i couldn't see any lube inside but it would make sense that they're using a dry lube like this because if it were a liquid lubricant like crytox for example it would probably trip and cause interference with the optical sensors so we're going with the dry spray loop to do this efficiently pop out all the switches from the pcb yes since they're not soldered in you can pop them in and out with no issues you will have to apply some force though it's a little heads up now the spray does come out pretty quickly and forcefully here so i recommend using a piece of tape or something to cover part of the nozzle so you get a smaller stream and then just apply a little bit under the switch along the spring like i said since there's no way to really deconstruct the switch without breaking it the easiest way to get the lube inside is to press down slightly so you can see the spring under the switch and just give it a little skeet ski you barely want any spray to get in i would recommend doing this in a controlled spot because this gets messy also smells like one of those haunted house attractions you know when you go in and it's just like that fog machine smell yeah 100 smells like this now next up for the stabilizers we're going to give just a little bit of tlc to hopefully eliminate some of that rattle and they don't use traditional you know stabilizers on their keyboard so it's going to be a little bit different here we're going to apply some crytox lube to where they snap into place and where the wire itself touches you can just use the wd-40 if you don't want to actually pick up something like crytox but we're going to be doing this for the space bar the shift backspace and enter keys we're going to apply lube on the top and bottom of the wire inside as well as just a slight dab on the plastic mount as well additionally we're going to add the band-aid mod underneath the stabilizer mount just for shifts and gigs as well as underneath the pcb where the wire is this will honestly just add another layer of padding to eliminate any micro vibrations and resonance that it may cause the bar under the pcb doesn't ever move but again just that extra layer here to absorb the vibrations won't hurt and you can use a band-aid to cut it up into small strips that's why they call it the band-aid mod or like i use some medical tape now with the internal mods out of the way you want to go back and completely reassemble the keyboard go through the tedious task of putting back in every single switch for the ribbon cable literally just place it right back to where it was with the little metallic connectors facing down you just slide it in and then close back that plastic lever to secure it into place and just plug back in that tiny three pin connector then when it comes to putting the screws back in you're gonna have to apply some force and kind of like sandwich it down because of the phone there naturally just gonna cause some resistance but again since it is foam if you just put some force on when you're screwing it down it will just naturally condense now next one of the more common questions that i saw in the review is people wanted to know if they could use their own keycap set on this i customize it mainly the pudding keycaps got a lot of questions about those and since it doesn't look like a traditional stem people don't know if it's compatible or not but yes since we do have that cherry style stem in the middle you can use whatever keycaps you want gmk pbt abs dsa sa xda abc xyz boob okay that's the end of the bit so yes you can use them because we not only have a standard bottom row on the mini but the optical switches still have that cross stem for mounting the caps i did show off razer's very own pbt keycaps in the actual review but i get why people you know are obsessed with the pudding keycaps with the rgb shine through can definitely make it look nice if you're big into rgb and this white set i have here is from hyper x it's like 25 and since we have the white board it's visually it's going to add some nice pop to it with the shine through caps if you have the black huntsman mini you can then go and pick up the black pudding version of these as well so while this isn't a mod for you know performance really this one is more so just for the looks also on the look side of things since we have a usbc port on the back you can pick up a custom coiled cable for it the white one i've showed off is from tez cables i'll drop it down below as well as a link to space cables which is the company i often you know show different cables off on the channel tons of different colors looks really great again another nice visual touch then lastly this really isn't a modification but more so a suggestion and that's going to be to use this with an extended mouse pad because with this keyboard on top that layer of the mouse pads also going to help sort of absorb the vibrations from it resonating on your desktop obviously depending on what material your desk is made of but it'll help kind of cut that down and absorb it when you're typing or gaming again suggestion but it will help in a sound test speaking of which now's the time we're going to do a sound test of the new keyboard with the modifications versus how it comes stock so back to back so you can hear the difference you damn so this sounds just miles better than the new and improved you know linear switches we have with the huntsman mini because they already have those silicone dampeners but now when you add that internal dampening foam with the eva foam just having that layer now absorb all the the vibrations and the resonance and stuff when you're typing or gaming it is definitely worth it to do just even that alone is going to make a huge difference dampening foam all the way and razer if you're listening hopefully you are maybe that could be a good suggestion to add to future keyboards i know durgod does it in a lot of theirs so again you already added the internal silicone dampeners in the switches why not do it to the keyboards as well because you hear the difference it sounds so so much better and it's funny because you look at the the huntsman tournament edition versus the stock huntsman mini that sounds night and day and now you compare the the improved hudson mini to the modded version and that's night and day as well so good stuff all across the board yes it still does slightly have that like rattlesnake sound when you ah not not too much not too much i know usually when people shake these does have a bit of a rattly sound but again with that dampener on the bottom it's not really giving much room for the switches to move inside so it does dampen that a little bit but again this isn't a shake weight no one's actually going to do that in real life it's just not necessary and i think just it was definitely worth it not so much with wd-40 you could probably skip that but in terms of sound eva foam all the way if you want to check any of it out i'll have it listed for you in the description down below good luck don't break your board i'm not responsible if you do well i'm random frank p hope you enjoyed have a good day
