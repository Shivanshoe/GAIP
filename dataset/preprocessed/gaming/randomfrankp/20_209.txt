what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 214 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas inspirations for your own setup and this week we'll have a special budget edition showing you some ways to improve your setup without breaking the bank now I always have to remind you guys every time I do one of these episodes that everyone's definition a budget is gonna be different there's gonna be a lot more scaled back no triple monitors no 2080 TI's more scaled back simple setups and remember just because someone's setup costs more than 20 dollars total that doesn't mean it's not budget so if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll kick it off now episode 214 first up we have on Tran and when I first saw this one I was like wait there's no way this is considered budget then I went through and I was really impressed with all the hardware and peripherals and managing to pull together a really nice setup like this I integrate still RGB it could still feel really cozy and put together it's funny how the reds and oranges you know make you feel warm and then the Blues make your PC cooler you just know how it works also improves fps so for the display it is an Acer 24 inch 1920 1080 P 60 Hertz monitor I don't know what the wallpaper he used here it's from but I'm getting like Skyrim pub vibes you know I'm saying just down in some Meads with the local Nords and High Elves by the way shout out to the fellow argonians how do I have a wife and then for the peripherals he has he raised your Black Widow ultimate keyboard with the g502 from Logitech which can be found for like 35 to 40 bucks extended mousepad and his speaker there is the JBL charge 3 and then over to the PC we have a real nice budget built here in an ITX case this is actually the Cougar qbx Mini ITX very very affordable inside is a risin 5 2600 CPU with 16 gigs of T force Delta R GB RAM an asus rog B 450 IDE motherboard and a sapphire rx 590 GPU so mr. Tran I think you really pulled a nice theme together here the warm RGB lighting and stuff matching to the wallpaper some touch of plants to match the the green RGB in the keyboard you guys some other things to make it more personal Snorlax some of those collectible figures and gets The Witcher really digging this now we have not us not to play on words there I'm liking it and this is one that I when I first saw I was actually gonna save for one of the clean and minimal additions but I was going through his hardware and I was like he he managed to pull off a really nice clean and minimal setup without breaking the bank and you have to applaud back starting with his 22 inch HP monitor sitting on the SATA key monitors then I showed that off an episode of cool tech under 50 shout out to the series go check it out we haven't already and I like to touch it a little moss terrarium the the snake plant little succulent always good to have that touch of green then for the peripherals we have the budget King that's a queer phantom 87 RGB keyboard hot swappable it is the king of budget under 50 bucks with the razer deathadder elite mouse on a novel keys camping desk pad you know what's up my man just loving it then over to the pc checking it out with some NZXT h200 case in white with a rise in 2700 cpu cooler master ml 240 a IO with 16 gigs of T force Delta R GB RAM yet again on the asrock fatality be 450 gaming motherboard and the XFX art X 580 GPU dig in the blue and green colors going on inside mix as well and by the way that light kind of strip is the fantex neon it's more like a thicker tube I have them in my build also under 50 bucks looking nice so not us not again you nailed clean and minimal while not breaking the bank it looks really nice I definitely got to applaud you for this definitely inspirational love that and then speaking of inspirational there's something that you might not notice right away but this setup blows my mind because again this could easily be included in a clean and minimal edition but it's more budget and I love when I start to see DIY integrations to save some money so we'll get into that in a second for his display it was a Samsung 27 inch curved monitor you know I'm gonna say it but I'm loving the ivy loving the plant loving the pokemons her areum peripherals we have a coarser gaming k55 RGB keyboard with the black storm merc RGB mouse for audio the logitech z 200 speakers and one that pictured here the Logitech G 35 at gaming headset now we're gonna move over to the PC and this is what is crazy cool this is completely DIY made from plywood and it's stained and treated he made his own case that looks something like you would see from like the Lian Li case pretty much for hardware he has here Eisen 5 3600 cpu with the Noctua NH u 12s chrome acts cooler got 16 gigs of HyperX fury ram on an asus tough be 450 + gaming motherboard with an msi gtx 1660 TI graphics card so again all of this saving money about building his own case you love to see that in terms of cable management everything behind the PC and monitor is all tucked away underneath in these sort of shelves as you could see which is gonna free up a lot of space underneath and guess what this is a nice-looking in desktop right this also DIY made from plywood stained painted and treated all he did was pick up some legs from Ikea and he has a super nice desk that's gonna match the stand color of his dIY homemade PC case oh my god I love it this is the kind of stuff that gives me inspiration every week to do these episodes and it doesn't get old when I see stuff like this it refreshes yeah coming up next we have Elliot's and again even though it's a budget setup guess what he wanted to spice his walls up a bit add something like the vinyl tape - can I get a design going to accentuate the RGB and just give it something extra you know and it looks really cool what this tape probably cost some like $2 then when the RGB is off during the day time you know could still rock like that but I'm definitely liking the addition of the RGB light strip around the desk on both sides and seemingly either behind the monitor or under that shelf can't really tell but it's bright and looking nice okay as you can see here in this shot under the shelf but we moved on to his displays say 24 inch from AOC that's on a DIY monitor riser as well it's built on top of to the desk and for the peripherals we have Logitech g13 keyboard with Logitech MX master 3 so a newer addition you know gotta upgrade the peripherals every now and then for the mouse and then for audio we got the Harman cohdon sound 6 3 and these are probably one of the more expensive things in these set up total so ok for the PC underneath the desk inside the Rison 520 600 X CPU stock Wraith cooler got 16 gigs of G skills Aegis whatever use I never Nana say it guys Aegis Akos I don't care MSI be 450 gaming Pro carbon motherboard with a galaxy GTX 1050 graphics card so again I really think is the addition of those three stripes on the wall take it from like you know it looks ok to a different level because it's a different dimension there you know there's more abstract the level to the design now going on feeding like into the monitor it draws your eyes to it more it's just natural you want to look at it because the lines it's looking good the RGB good stuff my man and then lastly but not leastly is angela with the all white and black stormtrooper setup as told by the pop figure and the matching wallpaper here so this one he said was under five hundred idols Donnell's that's a new currency try that again dollars so definitely a budget set up some things were gifted some things he got on sale so for the monitor that is a 24 inch and vision display and what I really like is you could see in this shot for his monitor riser that is just one of those styrofoam kind of packing inserts that I would assume came with some other hardware or even possibly the case he used for the peripherals that is a tekwar phantom RGB keyboard but he painted it himself white to match everything with the rack captain white mouse and then as you can see he also has his cables routed through that saira phone monitor riser now over to the PC we don't really have many photos of this unfortunately so this is kind of all we have to work with here this is the tecware nexus Mk inside the Intel i3 550 CPU with in case of HyperX fury ram and a gtx 660 graphics card but I do like despite the budget he still nailed the white and black PC build with corresponding hardware so altogether again I don't have an exact layout of what he spent where he spent it and how he got it but when he says this was under $500 total for him I'm gonna believe him and it's just you know you can see what you can do I like a lot of stuff like this I like the little bits like that DIY monitor Iser with styrofoam that goes a long way budget peripherals budget hardware this is looking real nice a really clean white and black budget setup all right guys I'll wrap it up for episode 214 of room tour project hope you enjoyed this special budget edition don't forget check the links in the description down below for all the gear and hardware you saw plus some very simple instructions and how to submit your setup if you want to be possibly considered in a future episode of room tour project just check the description down below for at all if you like this video give it a big thumbs up share your support feel free to follow me on Twitter at random Frank P and last if you haven't already hit that subscribe button hope you all enjoyed have a good day
