what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be checking out the Thor zone Mjolnir ITX PC this little guy is a beast and for an ITX case this is literally my dream everything I am looking for right inside this compact chassis it's very unique as well it's a pre-production model here so we'll go over it all do a build for you guys talk about the case and all that good stuff in case you're interested because I know a lot of people are so checking it out when I first saw this I was blown away by the design I've done different ITX built in the channel in the past and the form factor I think is becoming more popular but this case just sticks out of the crowd do keep in mind like I mentioned this is a pre-production model but I will be showing off the final unit when it comes now in terms of size it is nine point seven liters coming in at 350 millimeters long 209 millimeters tall and 131 millimeters wide the model here does have these performance side panels with a cutouts of ventilation but I'm gonna swap them out with the glass panels in the video to kind of show you the visual difference now it's really unique about this case the fact that there is an internal chassis and that's where you build or the core as they call it and then there's the outer shell which is own separate piece this is not only gonna make it easier to build but c-couldn't provide a nice unibody look to the final models the core just slides out of the case after you unlock it and I prefer this kind of method of construction here since you don't have to worry about the side panel is kind of cramping your style when you're building it we saw this also being done at CES with the razor tomahawk and one case and a case that's under embargo that you'll see next week but I dig it you build your PC on the internal core slide it into the shell and then you're good to go you know I'm not gonna focus on the actual hardware that I'm using too much so this main leaf is focusing on the case here but obviously with an IV X form factor you're gonna need hardware to complement that I have to give a shout-out to my Crisanta here for supplying some pieces they hooked me up with the rise in 939 50x CPU since they were so hard to get a hold of a delayed this video actually pretty long time so thankfully they hooked me up with that they also supplied me with a gigabyte Oris X 570 I pro Wi-Fi motherboard and our power supply the EVGA supernova 615 g m8 650 watt SFX PSU if you're not familiar with Micro Center it's everything a tech head could pretty much dream of all PC hardware peripherals anything and everything you would need to build your PC upgrade it just get into the whole PC ecosystem they have in their store and I actually did a video back in like 2015 where I went to my local one and got something to components and stuff for my build at that time kind of like a vlog so if you want to see me you know do an upgraded vlog at my store let me know so the 3950 x is a 16 core 32 thread beast at 4.7 gigahertz unlocked this is gonna be not only great for gaming but video editing and stuff as well since we are limited with space in a case eyes like this you can use an air cooler up to 51 millimeters tall and I went with the Noctua NHL 9 a chrome axe cooler which is their newer all-black model it's gonna keep the CPU running cool and super quiet and you can technically fit in certain AIO models like the coarser age 55 and the NZXT kraken m22 but i would check the requirements on the site because you are limited in terms of space obviously with some radiators so only certain ones are gonna work here after I installed a motherboard to the internal core I then installed my one terabyte Sabourin rocket nvme m2 SSD and since the motherboard here is Gen 4 we can take advantage of the blazing fast speeds now for the GPU were going with a reference 20 atti but as you can see on the back side of the cage here there's still a lot of room and that's where you install it it supports up to a three hundred and thirty four millimeter card in length and you just really snap into place on the bottom but the one issue I did run into here with this pre-production model was the little mounting bracket up top there was literally no room left for me to install this as you could see the top of the GPU just leaves no room for that mount to go so I assume they're gonna mod that for the final unit it's not a huge deal might have just been an oversight with the cards they were testing when building this it's just too tall for that bracket the fit since our GPU is on the opposite side of the motherboard it connects them to the PCIe riser cable that sits underneath nvme fan this just runs under the case entirely so you're gonna have to kind of Bend that riser so with a flat 90 degree angle and not kind of bowing out of the case then wrapping it up I threw in my RAM 32 gigs of HyperX fury added an additional 120 dr. Wilke romex fan as a intake then lock down our EVGA sfx power supply and then before you know it you have a beast of a PC in this tiny compact cage as you can see everything here is nice and tidy the internal chassis is reversible as well so you can either have the GPU showing out one side or flip it around and have the motherboard visible that's just what's really cool about this it's all contained here tiny space and all that they got to do is slide it back into the outer shell then you're good to go since this is the prototype like I said there was a documentation or any instructions on how to build this and I probably knocked it out in less than a half an hour so the build all in all was a breeze and that that's all done the power supply is located on the bottom of the backside and then boom the millionnaire comes to life with this internal RGB adding some nice accent glow the strip is located on the top would be nice to see if they added it to the bottom as well so we have that top and bottom globe and I legit don't know how to change the light so I'm just leaving it blue but like I mentioned earlier we do have the extra set of side panels to be good swap out the ones that we have stock on here are the performance panels for the increased heat dissipation but we're gonna put on the extra set of the tempered glass panels that's obviously for looks swapping it out was pretty easy they're kept on by these screws and using the internal hex key you can just unscrew them swap them out this is actually going to be changed for the final production unit and the panels are going to be held on magnetically instead of using the screws the glass panels we have here we're kind of a last-minute addition for me to show off and they're just kind of glued on pretty much but obviously if let me clean that proper that's gonna lead me then into things that are going to change I just mentioned the magnetic side panels or the first thing the next thing is they're gonna be using the same material for the entire case so you might not be able to tell on camera but some of the different parts of the outer shell are slightly just coated differently that's because they use different manufacturers for the prototypes and the outer shell is actually gonna be unibody rather than having it split pieces like this so you're not be able to tell like where it's broken up and construct it into different pieces next the performance panels are gonna have a kind of redesigned ventilation cutouts for increased airflow and lastly on the inside they won't be using this terrible tape which is just pretty much just helps the the core glide into it so right now every time you put the internal core into the cage when it's going along that tape naturally it's gonna just kind of break it down over time whether it is from the core rubbing against it with a cable or something popping out there is a bit of friction there it's kind of force it in and it tears the tape so for their final production unit they're gonna be using these plastic gliders on the inside so they it won't get broken down and it'll just coast in a lot easier and then lastly the case now comes in three different colorways a dark stealth and a steel this one is a matte powder coating which might be the south finish mashing down a hundred percent sure which finish this one is but just from me building it on my desk the coating got scuffed up very very easily I'm starting to chip in certain spots so I'd either go for the all-black metal or these silver steel finish instead so when it was all built up I put it on my minimal desk setup and it just fits in beautifully all in all it is a gorgeous case nine point seven liters and it really just complements not only the setup but just everything I have going on it looks nice and minimal and that is why I've been drawn to this case I've been following it from the early beginning on the Kickstarter and it is a really unique built I love the minimal look to it so when talking to them throughout this whole process if do you guys remember I showed this off back in November when I first got it so it's taking me a while to finally get all the hardware in because the the CPU and stuff is out of stock for how long it's been about three months now at this point that's why Micro Center hooked me up thankfully so finally got a build I've been in communication with them and that's how I know that all the changes that are currently making and stuff to make this a better case so pretty much everything that I talked about that I didn't like is gonna be addressed which is definitely a good thing and I like how they're focusing on cleaning up the outer appearance with being all unibody and stuff like that so really pumped to get this in when it's finally released possibly April March may even who knows but when it comes out I'll be doing a full build and it's gonna be my main minimal PC over on the set up behind the camera so definitely pumped about that I'm loving this case if you guys want to check it out I'll put a link for you in the description down below as well as to all the hardware that I use for this build even though it's not you know focusing on the hardware and stuff like that you can still check it out down below the last thing before we wrap this up might be one why I didn't do benchmarks or you know talking about the actual thermals that's because again I'm not focusing on the actual hardware here cuz I just threw in some parts that I had currently and since the performance side panels are changing and would it make sense to check what the temperatures are with the current side panels which I have right here because this is gonna be different they're gonna be adding more so it just what it makes sense to benchmark a pre-production model that's gonna be different from what you guys are getting so I figured there'd be questions about that I'll just address it now get it out of the way ba guys gotta wrap it up for my dream ITX case the Thor Zone Mjolnir hope you enjoyed if you did and you're pumped for that final build let me know give this video a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow
