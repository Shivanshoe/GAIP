what's up guys i'm random frank p and it's been five years since hyperx released the cloud 2 gaming headset well good news today we get the cloud 2 wireless guess 2020 isn't so bad after all so yes we'll run through it all talk about my experience the pros cons all the stuff you're going to want to know in case you're interested in picking up the brand new hyperx cloud 2 wireless headset been testing them out the last few weeks if you're interested in cutting that cord and going wireless got you covered in this review first up just getting it in and unboxed over the years hyperx really hasn't done too much when it comes to changing up the physical design and that's a good thing because if it's not broke don't fix it so in terms of the design language yeah it's going to be nearly identical to what you're familiar with the cloud 2. inside the box you get the removable microphone a usbc cable for charging the wireless dongle everyone's favorite d word and of course the headset you have the red accent on the yoke with a nice stitching still in the headband to the otherwise matte black body and construction and literally just as i mentioned it looks just like the original one thing i really do appreciate is how they kept it nice and simple even when it comes to the buttons and controls we only have three in total here on the left ear cup is the power button and the mic mute button then on the right ear cup is a very very smooth volume dial that doesn't have any physical stops so it can continuously scroll but an audible beep will alert you at 100 volume with the included wireless adapter it's a bit on the 2010 flash drive size so it's a bit larger than other dongles out there but literally the second you plug it into your pc and turn the headset on it just pairs instantly and since this is also compatible with the ps4 and ps5 coming out just plug it in and you're set you're all good to go you'll see a red led light on the dongle to let you know that it's paired the removable bi-directional and noise cancelling microphone pops into the left ear cup and with the mic mute button to show you it's actually muted a little red led circle around the bottom of the mic is going to illuminate just to kind of be there in your peripheral vision to act as that visual indicator but when it comes to the microphone right now you're hearing the raw unedited mic test and i think for a wireless headset you know it still sounds pretty meh that's kind of what you could still expect unfortunately in 2020 there's not a lot of wireless headsets out there that have really good clear sounding microphones this one's just you know in the middle of the pack i'd say but yes little so you can hear the mic test then obviously in terms of comfort and stuff with the name being cloud two one thing i always kind of compared it to was it being you know like clouds on your head because they are very very comfortable nice and flexible and uh you know adjustable as well to fit a wide size of heads if you will and we have the nice leatherettes memory foam ear pads on here they are over the ear so it doesn't really you know interfere with my actual ear itself nice and comfortable ample padding on the headband there's really no pressure points anywhere so definitely comfortable and again popular requests bring back the glasses test uh happy to report yeah no pressure absolutely feels great and i like the way they look too they're not big and obnoxious they're form-fitting so great great stuff from hyperx here but we'll talk about the goods obviously sound quality and a wireless headset is the most important factor right the drivers used inside here are the same 53 millimeter neodymium drivers that they had in the original cloud 2 these just fine-tuned a bit differently again for that wireless connection now um in terms of sound quality honestly it's fantastic you get a nice solid base punch throughout that's definitely helped out to the fact that it is a closed back pair of headphones i think imaging and positional audio is spot on as well i would say they're not the warmest sounding headset out there and at 100 volume when you have it turned all the way up the highs can get a tad bit harsh but i find that to be only the case really when it comes to vocals especially during music and stuff so during gaming it didn't bother me too much it honestly wasn't even that noticeable but it's definitely going to be more apparent when listening to music so i don't think it's to the point where it's like overshadowing the mids or anything or you know taking away for it because that's a gaming headset i'm not gonna knock them too hard for them being slightly too harsh on the vocals but man all around it just sounds really good and full i was worried that sound quality would maybe suffer a bit due to the fact that i'm going wireless but no definitely impresses me hyperx has a way with tuning these drivers it really makes them just stand out it's black magic now these also have the emulated 7.1 surround sound inside their ingenuity software and it does have that slight effect where in certain games it'll kind of like stretch the frequencies out a bit in an attempt to sort of widen the sound stage but it's also definitely going to depend on what you're playing what you're listening to because for example in a game like i often you know talk about battlefield where the audio is just phenomenal it's mastered perfectly it sounds really really good in fact when playing battlefield i prefer the 7.1 surround sound over just the stock stereo sound quality i don't think it's going to give you an advantage necessarily or anything like that but again don't expect that same surround sound quality and experience when you're playing those hentai flash games the quality of your game is going to matter the most here now there's still a bit more to get to so don't tune out quite yet but first i wanted to say real quick these come in at 150 dollars which for the overall quality here isn't too bad for a top-tier wireless gaming headset but i have a feeling these are going to be most closely compared to also a relatively new headset the razer black shark v2 pro these are 180 these are 150. in terms of sound quality i'd say they're both top-notch absolutely great and also for emulated surround sound i always say you know typically avoid it stick to stereo but in both cases here for both companies they both have very very good and usable surround sound so i think the one advantage i would give the black shark v2 pro is probably the mic quality uh but in terms of sound both neck and neck and you're saving 30 bucks here with the cloud 2 wireless and for just a quick mic test as you can see to make myself look absolutely ridiculous uh just doing a quick comparison of the black shark v2 pro and the cloud 2 wireless i'm putting a little indicator so you can hear the difference between the two so like i said i do think the black shark v2 pro does have the advantage in terms of the overall mic test here but again that's 180 versus 150 so it depends the 30 bucks extra is worth it to you for a better mic then you have both options really hey it's future frank p here uh checking in real quick because it's funny listening to them back to back like that they don't sound too different versus when i was listening to them individually but i still think the v2 pro just has a bit more body to it it's a lot more full sounding i think let's talk battery real quick that's also very important they have it rated for 30 hours at 50 volume i could say just for me and my testing it's probably even at 100 close to i'd say 26 and up uh so 26 hours you know rough a rough estimate there uh pretty damn good i'd say there is a little led indicator on the back of the left ear cup and that'll kind of act as like a battery status because when it's from 90 to 100 it'll stay green from 90 to 15 it'll flash green then when the battery is dying below 15 that little led light will turn red now you can use these while they're charging with the included usbc cable uh but obviously at i believe 18 inches this isn't gonna be optimal for that so it's good you can still use them while you're charging but i would recommend picking up a longer cable than this and before we do a wrap up with the pros and cons again we'll talk about the ingenuity software real quick just run through it because it's very very simple and relatively plain you can do things like obviously go in and manually adjust your volume uh your microphone levels as well you have the 7.1 surround sound button to toggle that on and off as well as mic monitoring i know it's a very popular feature you turn on mic monitoring so you can actually hear yourself while you're talking into the mic so you know that it's actually you know communicating talking to your friends and that's pretty much it i thought maybe there was going to be eqs in that sort of preset tab up there but that's there's not there's no eqs which is kind of surprising i figured they would have had some sort of you know different stock eqs in here or the fact you can go in and maybe customize and make your own eqs uh so i hope they add that seems like a common feature come on hyperx but yeah that's uh that's that's ingenuity for you pretty simple so as we close it out we'll do a quick little recap here for you guys uh first i think the build quality the overall comfort is phenomenal super comfortable super lightweight all things considered this seamless pairing experience is great you plug in the dongle you're good to go no having to wait for it to pair and troubleshoot battery life is good as well and then the sound quality absolutely one of the best out there just really full and it just sounds really really good for wireless headsets okay um on the other side of things when it comes to cons like i mentioned uh vocals and the highs can be a bit harsh when listening to music so to kind of go along with that i wish the software has some sort of eq's like i just mentioned so i can maybe turn that down a bit so it's not as harsh but not the biggest deal since it's really just with music and then the other thing is like you just kind of heard that my quality is just meh uh but i think all together for the price of 150 you look at the competition you look at what all the other companies are doing out there there's some really great options but for the price this hands down comes in probably i'd say top three of the year for just the overall package hyperx you made us wait five years but man you guys are gonna love this if you're a current hyperx uh cloud two owner cut the cord go wireless great great stuff hey guys i'll
