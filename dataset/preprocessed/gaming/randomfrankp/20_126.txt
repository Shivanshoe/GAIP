what's up guys i'm troy i got a basketball game tomorrow i'm a point guard i got shoe game and we are back with episode 238 of room tour project this series will show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup is anything you like i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below to check out some of the gear and hardware but we'll kick it off now 238 first up today is justin with the craziness going going on here so it might be hard to see at first but this is run by three different platforms pretty much he does have a gaming pc there's also the macbook pro and he also has an apple imac so all of that is right here also that wallpaper choice just pops really nicely also complements the rgb light strip you have behind the monitors so pinpointing which is which that overhead is the imac 27-inch it's their 5k 2017 model um underneath is an aoc 34 inch ultra wide monitor at 100 hertz uh that is for the actual pc the mounted there on the left side is his 16 inch macbook pro down to the peripherals of a hyperx alloy origins core keyboard with logitech g703 light speed mouse got the steelseries arctis 5 headset as well as the edifier r 1280 db speakers and in the back you can see the apple magic keyboard and stuff or the imac but for the pc inside the ryzen 5 1600 af cpu with 16 gigs of g skill aegis ram aegis aegis i always mess this up but on an asrock b450m steel legend motherboard and a gigabyte rx 5700 xt graphics card that's all inside the cooler master master box q300l case so i don't know if he works on all three different systems at once or what the particular that's my pup yeah but i don't know the workflow necessarily i'm sure you've got it down pat i'm sure it works for you fine but i really like the way you have it all mounted looks really nice together as a you know cohesive unit and whatever sort of room this is with those wooden beams i think it looks really nice got some you know natural lighting as well with some of the succulents and air plants i think it's a really cool productivity and gaming setup next up from jada master is a jaw dropping stunner of a clean and minimal setup here that just gives me gives me all the good feels you know what i'm saying it's moody it's futuristic i like the the space theme suddenly going on as well so checking out his monitors the primary there is a 34 inch ultra wide from alienware the mounted off to the right side the vertical orientation is a asus 24 inch there was sitting on a wooden sandy monitor riser which i think is a nice contrast to the otherwise you know white and black theme going on color-wise it kind of goes along to you know mars and the wallpaper as well as the wooden wrist rests and stuff but down for his peripherals the ducky one-two mini keyboard which he obviously customized and made it a little bit better walnut wrist rest as i said with the logitech g502 lightspeed wireless mouse then also for audio he has the eclipse pro media 2.1 speaker setup now for the pc off to the left side with a fractal design meshfy c case in white with a ryzen 7 3700x cpu got their stock cooler with some core serve engines rgb pro ram an msi mpg x570 gaming edge motherboard an evga rtx 3070 xc3 ultra graphics card but i love how clean that build looks inside man also i know you're probably curious but the chair here is the pursuit ergonomic from uplift desk so this setup is just all around a 10 out of 10. again i love the black and white theme with the splashes of orange throughout and stuff you can see in the background with the black wall but having those white hexagon shapes it all just complements each other perfectly jaded master knows what's up holy star wars we got dog of pavlov here hitting us with just everything six total displays two different sort of setups here for the l-shaped desk but i love all the star wars stuff around with those lightsabers pretty much just like adding a secondary rgb effect going on that's all in addition to the light ships around the desk and behind the monitor uh netherleaf aurora light panels you know why have rgb you can have a lightsaber on your wall alright so let's tackle this the top monitor is a 34 inch lg the left monitor is a 27 inch 4k from lg as well as the right monitor it's that same 27 inch lg 4k uh the middle monitor is a 27 inch 4k 144 hertz panel so a different model then underneath is a cumin 5 inch sort of like that mini reference monitor and no information really on the setup on the left side even but you have the laptop there in addition to that overhead monitor so six total screens here and each display each monitor has its own star wars themed wallpaper so god forbid anybody shows up wearing a star trek shirt down to his peripherals he's the corsair k95 platinum keyboard with both the corsair glaive rgb pro mouse and the corsair dark core rgb pro se mouse you can see in the back as well as some of those wide shots he has those corsair sort of rgb light sticks and also for his headset not pictured here but the corsair virtuoso rgb wireless gunmetal headphones now over to the pc we have an nzxd h510 elite case with an intel i9 9900k cpu and then 60 kraken x63 aio 64 gigs of team force rgb ram on an nzxt n7 z390 motherboard and an rtx 2080 ti graphics card as well as darth vader sitting up top watching over the throne and i can just love those lightsabers mounted on the wall behind it this is the definition of a hero shot got some helmets mounted on the wall as well with seemingly some rgb inside those as well to give them a bit of a glow then also in the room is the console setup get the entertainment center here with all the consoles on display retro consoles at least because you can see the ps4 and the xbox one mounted underneath the tv but man dog of pavlov here with the dedication all lg displays all corsair peripherals all star wars everything all day all night this is a mind f you know what i'm saying can't curse or family friendly gotta get those ads running you get me next up we have daily setup tech and this is from his instagram definitely check it out he has some really cool photos that he posts of his setup and set up evolution along the way this time now go with that really warm cozy vibe with the orange lighting and stuff single monitor so it's nice and simple looking but i think you nail the aesthetic all around the monitor is a 34 inch xiaomi ultrawide sitting on a grove made walnut desk shelf to go along with the wood and desktop here from autonomous that's their smartdesk 2 frame the chair is also from autonomous it's their ergo chair too and i gotta say i love the monitor wallpaper choice also matching the wallpaper on your phone to get the consistency there and even the lifx tiles mounted up to add some more orange glow to sort of bring out that strip from the spaceship in the wallpaper as well as the rgb light strips behind the desk down to the peripherals of a mode 80 keyboard with the logitech mx master 2s and a delta hub carpio on a felt extended mouse pad and for audio with the sony xm4 wireless headphones with the edifier s 305 db speakers and then on the shelf and the monitor riser is his dac powering those speakers the ifi audio zen deck now over to the pc a really nice custom water cooled build here this is the leonle 011d mini case inside the ryzen 7 2700 cpu 16 gigs of team group extreme ram and the gtx 1070 founders edition graphics card uh the pumps and the water blocks and stuff are all from ekwb but what i really like i think's creative is for the rubber tubing he used sandpaper and went along that to give it this sort of frosted look so i thought that was really creative and the final result here looks really nice so the super warm and cozy single monitor setup here from daily setup tech i think you did a really good job with all the design choices and everything that went into this setup you know it's the perfect touch all around like i said check out his instagram he also has a dedicated video on youtube about this very setup and then last but not least we have gokan with the triple monitor setup big old tv for gaming we'll call this one the vaporwave miami knights sort of set up with the the pinks blues purples like that's a need for speed wallpaper possibly but this is looking killer not to mention the integrated rgb strip into the actual desk which looks really nice now as for those three displays they're all 27 inch monitors from dell the primary one in the middle though is a different model because it's 165 hertz of the refresh rate while the outer two are 70 hertz i would recommend for a little tip to hide the taskbar though now down to its peripherals nice and clean all wireless and white as well with logitech g915 tkl lightspeed keyboard and logitech g305 mouse they're both sitting on the mad cat's glide 38 and then for audio he has the bare dynamic dt 1990 pro headphones on the corsair st-100 rgb headphone stand now over to the pc inside the leon lee 011 dynamic xl case inside that amd ryzen 5 5600 x cpu with a corsair h100 rgb platinum se aio with 32 gigs of core serve engines rgb pro ram an asus rog strix b550a gaming motherboard and the nvidia rtx 3080 founders edition graphics card really liking the white hardware inside mixed with the rgb and man only if you had like a vision graphics card to complete that all-white build think it would look sick get a little peek underneath the desk good job on cable management you see that little box off to the right side of the screen that's where i see mostly like the power bricks and power cords are being kept nice and tidy and then off to the side for gaming with the ps5 you can see there on the entertainment console he has a sony 55-inch 4k tv which is 120 hertz with this xh-90 model rgb behind the stand itself and the tv matching white headset there just the coordination is on point through and through so gotta say you definitely know what you're doing you put together a killer triple monitor gaming setup you got the ps5 setup as well really nice desk completing a dream of a
