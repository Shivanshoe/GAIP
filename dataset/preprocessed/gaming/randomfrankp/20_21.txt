you ever have that x that you just can't stop thinking about you experiment you try other things you just can't shake that one the performance we'll say was just too good and the way it all felt in your hands was just the best you can't stop thinking about it uh does your wife know you're talking about a mouse what's up guys i'm random frank p and yes we are talking about gaming mice of course and today we're gonna be talking about the razer viper ultimate and why i keep finding my way back to this and also we have some leaks about the razer viper v2 pro with the release of that seemingly right around the corner but for now i want to start off with some of the changes and little modifications i've made to the viper ultimate that really just brought me back home so real quick just give you a bit of my dating history or mouse history i mean so you can get where i'm coming from i as most of you know was a long time lover of the g502 both wired to the wireless that was my main and i still love it but then the model o came out and that was just really groundbreaking for the market and then the viper ultimate released and i was in love i used that all the way up until i started experimenting with other mice i made the steel series prime for a month or so that was a great mouse i then really loved the arocs wireless especially their ghost version i mean that for around three or four months then more recently logitech and shroud's g303 but i kept finding myself grabbing the viper ultimate whenever i had to recharge a mouse i think the big thing for me really is the shape it's just so really user friendly and it's ergonomic in the sense of the way that it's designed however obviously in the mouse market these shapes are named differently so technically it's an ambidextrous mouse you get what i'm saying it's the way it feels in your hand is so natural and when it came to gaming i felt that i was doing my absolute best whenever i would use the viper ultimate also when this released at 74 grams at the end of 2019 that was really really light for a wireless mouse like this i know nowadays 74 grams isn't mind-blowing but 2-3 years ago that was insane for a wireless release so to kind of rekindle that spark after all these years i wanted to do some changes and modifications physically and in terms of the performance to make it a bit spicier you'll see underneath i have these green sort of fang skates i replaced the stock 100 ptfe feet that came on this with the new pulsar super glide skates they are glass and they are the smoothest thing ever really no matter what mouse pad you have these things just feel like butter it is the craziest i you know i've showed these off before pulsar's doing some really great innovative stuff but yes these glass super glide skates on the viper ultimate with the green accents and the sort of fangs to cater to the razer viper branding aesthetically is perfect but man the performance on here it is just insane i typically mainly razor strider mouse pad which is a really nice hybrid surface it's the best of both worlds in terms of speed and control and now using these it is just like i said butter the biggest thing that i found i had to do was cut down my dpi a bit just because there's really less friction now with the glass on that hybrid cloth surface i felt that lowering from 650 to around 550 was better off and it helped sort of compensate now for the increased speed and smoothness but yeah i can honestly say these mouse feet are a game changer and they're putting them out for numerous different mice out there they're releasing them in waves so if you want to spice up your old mouse get that spark back again definitely check these out you will 100 be shocked another little modification i made you may have picked up on depending on the lighting is i added this color shifting faded paint to the left and right clicks i've been doing this to a lot of peripherals behind the scenes really i've also got a full keyboard coming up on this as well but i use this color shifting turquoise and emerald paint if you're familiar with chameleon paint it's like that and now the left and right paddles have this really cool color shifting fade down to it i did mask off obviously like the scroll wheel and the glossy accents on the mouse as well as the rubberized side grip so it wouldn't get on there and that's how i achieved this really nice you know natural fade look and again in certain lighting conditions whether you look at it you could turn the mouse around depending on the way the light hits it it'll either be a nice emerald color or turquoise or a mix of both if you look at it again in the right light i think it looks really really cool i didn't even apply any sort of top coat or a primer finish because the paint itself is really durable i've been using it for around like a month now i've had no smudges or cuts or anything into it and it does just naturally provide a little bit more grip to the tips which is what i like so just two little mods that really brought me back to the viper ultimate again from october 2019 when i first released till now this is still just my go-to mouse now as i mentioned in the intro there's also been some razer viper v2 pro leaks of an upcoming new version of the mouse so rather timely that i would find myself gravitating back towards this and real quick we'll go over these leaks they happened overseas they've since been taken down but it's all but been confirmed uh it's been on reddit and a lot of the razer reps who are active in the mouse subreddit they've been like you know wink wink this isn't true which obviously it is but yes the razer v2 pro name following suit from under death adder v2 pro for example and real quick taking a look at the available pictures that were up in terms of the actual like physical appearance and stuff it seems that there's no real changes obviously to the physical dimensions um they're now available in both black and white which we saw on the viper ultimate but now it is like a pure color white which i like versus like the white and gray on the original viper ultimate and just real quick three things stand out to me right away that are you know rather obvious is one no side grips so on the viper ultimate we have the rubberized side grips on both the left and right sides and it's that nice like you know rubberized knurl texture which i'm a fan of personally but believe it or not 5050. the community is very torn you either love them or you hate them so now to kind of combat that they seem like they've ditched it completely but it looks like in the one photo on the box they are now including optional rubberized side grips that you can just put on so you get a set of them inside the box for both left and right sides and both the left and right clicks so pretty cool to see and speaking of the sides we have no more uh buttons on the right side so even though it's a typically an ambidextrous mouse like we said before uh not gonna be so much for the left-handed users so sorry they're kind of alienating you by getting rid of those so now instead of having four side buttons we're only going to have two going forward and also no rgb so as we know the razer logo on the viper ultimate is illuminated here and it seems they've ditched that and now it's just that sort of like glossy accent like we saw on some of their uh previous mice which honestly i'm completely fine with because your palm covers that area anyways but no rgb is gonna mean two things better battery life and also it's gonna cut down on the weight which is gonna bring me to arguably one of the biggest changes now with the upcoming v2 pro it's down to just 57 grams it says versus the viper ultimate which was 74 grams at launch or still is and uh that's gonna bring it also lighter than i would say arguably its greatest competitor out there the g pro x super light that was 62 63 grams so now undercutting it down to just 57 grams which is gonna be crazy considering the shape really isn't getting smaller we would all love to see a viper mini ultimate but same shape just now significantly lighter at 57 grams and some other things real quick when talking internals it seems we have upgraded optical switches it says people use their gen 3 optical switches i believe and again these these photo leaks are just super low quality so it's hard to kind of make out a lot of the text and what we're looking at but i'm curious what the changes will actually be are these new optics which is going to be lighter or clickier i don't know only time will tell with that and also on the bottom of this just pixelated disaster is uh what it looks like the razer focus pro 30k optical sensor so an upgrade from the focus plus sensor uh which was 20k dpi now it's taking a jump to 30k dpi man does anybody even game higher than like 12 000. you know for example like i said i'm usually between 650 to 550 depending on the the mouse uh comment down below what dpi do you game at then lastly some other things coming to the new v2 pro underneath the mouse physically we have new mouse skates i don't believe there anything like i have here on the super glides with the glass skates so i'm not too sure the materials they're going to be using although they are rounded off uh in a bit of a different shape compared to uh the ones on the original viper ultimate so that'll be uh interesting to see what kind of differences that's going to make with it being rounded that will give you what i assume is going to be a more you know a softer sort of glide and also underneath no pogo pin connectors which means no physical charging dock take that for what you will i for one like that convenience of just putting on the dock at night however that dock was always hit or miss so i'm not like over here crying about it because we also now have usb c for the charger instead of the ever so dated micro usb on the viper ultimate so happy to see that change going forward which will then lead me into the question of what this will retail at since there is no actual dock uh when it's first launched it was 150 with the dock and i believe like 120 or so without it prices have since obviously gone down a lot so will this retail also for 150 will it be cheaper will it still be high because of inflation prices i don't know but i'm definitely interested to check out this new much lighter viper v2 pro coming up again the leaks say end of april razer raps on reddit yet again we're like that's not accurate wink wink so we will see but yeah guys a little revisit and just why i'm still so drawn to the viper old after all these years especially with news of these leaks coming to light now of an upcoming v2 pro so hope you enjoyed if you liked the video you appreciate the leaks let me know give this video a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at
