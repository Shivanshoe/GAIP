what's up guys I'm random Frank P starting off 2020 with a new episode of cool tech under $50 for January the series we show off some the best tech you can find under that price point if you got some gift cards lying around from the holidays this should come in clutch if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out now first up is the Adhan it photo grip Qi a wireless camera and shutter grip it also has a built in wireless charger this is gonna let you get a more natural and economic grip when taking photos or videos on your phone and while you're using it the built-in 3000 milliamp hour battery is gonna wirelessly charge your phone at the same time once you pair your phone via bluetooth on the side it's an additional button and an LED for the charger when you turn that on say you're out shooting and draining the battery this will help give that extra boost this does also fit any smartphone the spring-loaded lip on the bottom does expand and as you can see here I'm using it with my iPhone 11 Pro Max and there's no issues at all now into some of the other cool stuff with this the shutter button is actually detachable so you can just slide it out of the grip there and use it like a wireless shutter remote if you need something like that the entire unit is also balanced you can use it like a stand and have it sit upright but also inside the box is a mini tripod you can use that if you want you guess like prop this up some more or use this as an additional grip and this all comes in a just $50 and for the overall value here I'm really impressed with it if you're big into mobile photography or videography this is a must-have next is inspired from the mass mods video I did last month and that's these multi-use dragging grips there are these tiny hexagon texture stickers you can pretty much add to anything to give it more grip since they're pre-cut it's very easy to just attach to your phone a gaming mouse a controller Nintendo switch anything you hold essentially and having that little bit of extra grip there is gonna make a difference you can configure them however you want so here as you can see I have them kind of spaced out on the handles of Xbox controller and even for something slippery like the glass texture on the back of my phone I have it on the sides where I hold it and again just the concept here pretty straightforward giving you extra grip and I said in the beginning this was inspired from the amassed mods video I did we reused actual baseball bat grip on a gaming mouse this kind of accomplish that same thing here I'm putting a few on my razor Viper ultimate and it does give it kind of an interesting look there at hexagon shapes but the texture for the left and right clicks feels great the pack here in total comes with 57 stickers and again you just put them on anything you want and the pack is only $10 so it's not tech necessarily but it's for your tech I don't know I think they're cool next up I can think some modern decor especially when it comes to a desk gadget so when I found this light-up world clock I thought it'd be a pretty cool fit for this series in four o'clock it's definitely pretty interesting if you take a look at it and instead of it looking like a traditional clock here it spelled out with these scrambled letters I have it in the black version there's a copper one as well but I like to look to this one much more so the clock reads top to bottom and the way at the time is spelt out and it'll show you the time in 5-minute intervals so you know is fifteen minutes to four or twenty minutes to four so it's not going to show you every single minute just like I said in the 5 minute intervals it'll update before a piece of office or desk decor like I said if you just want to have this to quickly glance at the time and get an idea it'll do it in its unique way but I still really think the concept it's eight inches by eight inches you can choose to mount it if you want but obviously with it being square it is more fit for putting on your nightstand or a desk again it's something different it's not your ordinary clock and that's exactly why I like it this comes in at $30 and again speaking of desk gadgets that's what half this series is about this is also a pretty cool product this is a Bluetooth speaker but also doubles as a wireless charger great desktop accessory this is from sharper image and again I love products like this I can double as something giving you multi use on your desk so it's pretty much gonna act like a wireless Qi charger the whole front is it gonna act like a docks you can stick your phone there and it is a rubberized surface you can just put your phone there one slide off and I'll still wirelessly charge your phone for you and then the rest of it is a speaker with this fabric finish to it you do have volume and playback controls on the front underneath is the woofer for the bass and on the back of a button too pair this to your phone via bluetooth plus an auxilary input if you want to use this wired the speaker itself does sound good yes it's not going to blow you away or fill the room but it sounds adequately fine and the wool from the bottom does provide a nice punch so doubling as this sleek best top phone stand and speaker is gonna be cool if you use won't you prop this up next to your monitor or something so we could charge your phone tell you the time as well play some music or you know turn it horizontally watch some YouTube videos charge the phone at the same time you get the idea this comes in at 50 bucks then last is gonna be a product unlike anything I've ever shown off in the four years I've done this series so let me know if you like this category of products or not that's gonna be a game Star Wars Jedi fallen order definitely one of my favorites so like I said I've never shown off a game before but this is definitely worthy because it's an extremely fun game if you're a fan of the whole Star Wars you know lore this is gonna be right up your alley and it's not like the traditional Star Wars games out there it's kind of like a mix of you know Dark Souls maybe even a bit like the inche Artist Series mixed in because it's a challenging single-player story based game there's a lot of strategy built in navigation and puzzles trying to figure out how you're gonna beat the next boss not gonna give too much away but like I said if you're a fan of the Star Wars series you're gonna love this one I picked it up just for the new years and I could not put it down really fun game and like I said if you want to see more you know future game suggestions like this let me know when I picked it up on Amazon it was on a sale for like 35 bucks it might be around like 45 now and if steam had it on sale but either way if you're watching this now or in a few months it should be under 50 still so yeah that'll wrap it up guys to this episode of cool tech under $50 for January hope you enjoyed and don't forget I'm starting to think like I have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out you've liked
