what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 2 11 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup and this week we had the clean and minimal addition to in one month I know but they're always very popular who say anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it off but let's start it off now episode 211 all right ladies and gentlemen let's kick it off on this Sunday morning even though it's Saturday night when I'm recording this but we got Joey H with a really nice kind of black and white setup going on here with some interesting Flair going on and I say that because what I really like about what he did is not only find a way to integrate two more monitors to make a really clean looking triple monitor setup but he used the lifx beam to outline his primary display which looks pretty cool I think and that is by the way T Samsung 27 inch space monitor which is why it's pretty much flushed right up against the wall and the two stack monitors on the right side are 24 inch monitors from Lenovo down to the peripherals for his keyboard he has a Leopold FC 660 M keyboard with white fox key caps to go along with Logitech MX master 2's wireless mouse also get a nice look at the marble texture desktop here and for audio there's a pioneer diem 40 studio monitors and again has to clarify this yes speakers can also be called studio monitors in addition to his headphones the audio technica ath m50x and then as for the pc inside his NZXT h 510 case in white is a rising 7 2700 X CPU with 16 gigs of g.skill treinen Zinio Ram on Asus prime X 470 Pro motherboard with the gigabyte RT x 2070 super so a really good job of making the build as well all black and white to fit the rest of his setup if you take a look around the room and it just fits that whole theme he's definitely got that minimal vibe going on really diggin the overall aesthetic and you've got to love it you know I mean obviously he did some photoshop to make it more that black and white look and highlighting some color like that tiger print which looks pretty cool but again I am loving this 110% really really good stuff here Oh baby then on the opposite side of the spectrum we have Niles and this one does throw a lot of color at you and it's still just as nice I think I love all the green in the blend of the pink going on pink and teal blends really well here and he uses that nicely all throughout even dabbing it to the wallpaper as you can see it's got a really nice wooden desk as well so for his primary display or the only display here we got the ASA stuff 35 inch ultra wide which is a 100 Hertz display that is mounted on a monitor arm off to the right side and that first I thought it was wall-mounted so still looking really clean despite it actually having a monitor arm then down to the peripherals even matching everything here looking really nice his keyboard is a tofu akh KB with v1 t leo switches inside and the g wolf skull Mouse and in the back you can see charging also got the Razer Viper ultimate but I love that extended mousepad even got the walnut wrist rest to match the desk color key caps accented coil it all fits and then for audio those headphones of the Sennheiser HD $5.99 and in the back those speakers are from Edifier the s3 50 DB then for the pc inside this really nicely on li tu 150 case give a rise in 939 50x cpu with the Noctua Nhu 12 a cooler 32 gigs of G skilled shite n0l RAM on the Asus cross-layer 8 impact motherboard with an RT X 2080 super founders Edition GPU I hope that coolers getting the job done I'm sure you know better and I probably monitoring that but a really nice tiny compact build to fit in with a beautiful classy calming setup here love all the plants love the natural wood and desk everything here it just flows you know what I'm saying next up we have Martin T also going for that natural approach and when I say that guys I mean by natural yes a wooden desk is natural obviously plants making even more natural I'm eating it in the literal sense of the word but Martin's rocking two monitors here obviously the primary and then on the right side a vertical one to probably take advantage of the limited space he has so as you can see there's not too much actual desktop real estate so you can have that one mounted vertically to still take advantage of the extra pixels the primary is an acer 31 on a half inch monitor and the vertical one is a 24 inch of glioma monitor into the peripherals maybe an pro to wireless keyboard in white with some green accented key caps and the razor lancehead mercury Edition Mouse on again like a custom extended mouse pad the succulents the cacti and for his audio gear the Razer Kraken 7.1 v2 mercury Nishat headset and they trust Titan 18 790 white speakers very nice and then underneath the desk which is the one of the IKEA desks you can see he has his PC on the right side which is the BitFenix phenom m arctic white case it's as at AMD risin 5 3600 cpu with the arctic freezer 13 cooler 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance lpx Ram on an msi be 450 M mortar motherboard and an msi Radeon rx 5700 GPU unfortunately no pics of the inside that's ok I believe you but yeah I appreciate the execution here keeping those plants alive and the theme going strong and then we've got the eye candy here the reason you picked this video cuz of that tasty thumbnail from super storm we have a super nice setup its cringy to say that I don't care but you know it this is clean and minimal all day of the week I love everything about this the prints on the wall the literal lack of zero cables anywhere in sight the clean mounting job this is a beaut so for his monitor that is the Acer predator x34 P the nice 34 inch ultra wide a great choice and a very popular one for gaming as well down to the peripherals we have the cooler master master keys Pro L keyboard with Logitech MX master 3 Mouse they're both on an extended mousepad and if you take a close look you could see he has his keyboard cable routed through the desk but also through the mousepad just for that extra layer of clean for audio not pictured here with the ath m50x headphones and those two desktop speakers are the Bowers & Wilkins mm1 hi-fi speakers down to the PC inside of an intel i7 8700 k cpu cooled by the Noctua NHD 15 32 gigs of coarser benches LP x ram an ASUS Maximus 10 here a motherboard with a suit RG Strix GTX 10 ATT IOC GPU as you can see that is kept off the desktop to maintain that clean and minimal appearance still but I do feel like a really powerful ITX build to replace that printer on the right side what made me take this to the next level although I don't know what this would look like taking to the next level because I think it's already a 10 out of 10 and if you guys are feeling this and all the right places hit that thumbs up button down below if we know what I'm saying cuz yeah this is it super storm my man you know how to make a setup and then lastly we've got Noah and when I first saw this this gives me that work before play type of vibes you know because it does seem like an actual work setup as opposed to anything else like obviously this isn't screaming gaming setup kind of tucked away it seems as well which is why I feel like when you're here it's calm you shut out everything else you get to work but I didn't take away from the fact that he kept it real clean real minimal only the essentials here his monitor is a BenQ 27-inch which is kept on a bracket that not only supports the monitor but also holds up his laptop which is a 2016 MacBook which is seemingly powering everything here does it always have to be a gaming setup to be clean and minimal peripherals are the razer blackwidow Toyman ignition keyboard a nice 2014 throwback with Logitech MX master mouse seeing a trend I feel like when it comes to cleated minimal setups odds are you have a lot to tech MX master mouse whether 1 2 or 3 they know their market and then for audio he has the Jabra soulmate speakers with the JBL tune 600 wireless headphones so listen I know a lot of times and people on this series you know a lot of you are gamers PC enthusiasts you see a MacBook Pro you roll your eyes but it doesn't matter because like I said doesn't always have to be a gaming setup that we're showing off and here in this case we still have a clean minimal workstation that fits the bill and I got news for you guys if you don't like Apple setups you're not gonna like my actual secret setup that I'm working on behind the scenes for a future video and all right guys that'll wrap it up episode 211 of room tour project hope you enjoyed the clean and minimal
