what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we had razor con which is their 2021 sort of press conference and you know media briefing showing off some upcoming products so i figured today why don't we go through sort of like a breakdown in the reaction to some of the things they revealed for us to see what we're gonna have coming out over the next few months into 2022. so first up was sort of the big like you know marketing product we've seen from razer over the past few months or so over the past year with the pandemic and that's this razer zephyr which is you know formerly known as project hazel when they revealed it at ces a few months back and this is now a crazy looking you know chroma consumer ready face mask pretty much now this guy the zephyr is a choice like you're making a choice to buy this and wear this out right it looks crazy it's a statement piece i'd say uh you know because you could rock like a cloth mask and be fine but to put this on with rgb lighting it's cool it's crazy it's out there right let me know down below are you gonna buy this is it a hit or a miss i can't really tell yet um but obviously you know like with the pandemic it's not over yet so this is their sort of um interesting launch at putting out a lifestyle gaming hybrid sort of you know looking mask for protection when you're out and about and it's crazy because not only do you have the rgb lighting and stuff but when you look at it there's these n95 filters inside and on each side there's fans and different chambers so you have these intake fans to sort of like circulate air because the zephyr itself creates like a perfect seal with the silicone sort of a base on the inside around your nose and mouth so obviously it's going to get pretty humid in there right pretty stuffy so with these built-in fans it's circulating the air to also keep you cool and you can notice in the front it is transparent and minimally touched on the fact that you know uh you they still wanted to design something to help you you know pick up these uh communication cues and stuff uh non-verbal cues so now you have this transparent sort of housing in the front you can see through the person's lips and what they're saying uh this thing is just insane okay um so again this is dropping today you're going to see this tomorrow because yeah so it's dropping right now the mask itself is 100 which honestly for that price is it's less than i thought it would be considering you know it still has rgb and all the stuff going on uh but still kind of pricey it's an additional filter packs are 30 bucks where you can get a bundle with additional filters for 150 total so like i said before i want to know your thoughts down below on this drop a comment next looks like they announced this uh some new kraken headsets you know with the kraken v3 v3 hypersense and the v3 pro so these are pretty interesting you know i've owned the original kraken way way back when it's like 2012 or 2013 i wasn't the biggest fan of it was very you know bulky and stuff they definitely refined it since but one thing that they sort of you know combined now with this to bring it back something that i always personally loved and we now have this sort of haptic feedback we saw with the playstation pulse headset we saw it with the razer nari ultimate headset a few years ago and i've always been a fan of that physical feedback and the vibration the haptics when you're gaming because it just adds that whole other level of immersion and stuff so now they're bringing back the haptics sort of revised they said the actual physical feedback from the audio is changed it's uh more it's more expanded to fit wider lower end frequency so it's not just gonna like you know have that same sort of pulse over and over it's really going to change and be you know effective depending on those lower audio frequencies it looks like there's also three or four different levels that you can change this hyper sense to which is pretty interesting uh and just going through real quick i said we have three different models here looks like the hypersense is limited to the v3 hypersense and the v3 pro it's the same drivers and stuff the triforce drivers uh just now the hypersense v3 has the hypersense in it v3 pro is the wireless version and the original kraken v3 or the new v3 uh does not but again supports a wider range of frequencies in the low end like i said you have the four um sort of steps of adjustment if you wanted to change the level of the haptic feedback and it's just one thing i said it before but i've always loved this new level of immersion with gaming so i'm definitely going to want to check these out it's the type of thing where you either love it or you hate it i'm a big fan so these item they should be dropping pretty soon looks like we're going to uh obviously different prices here the v3 is a hundred dollars but for just thirty dollars more with the v3 hyper sense uh it's 130 so i don't really get why they have the stock v3 for 100 bucks definitely would be worth it to go 130 to get the hyper sense either way kind of a weird launch there at the original v3 and the v3 pro the wireless version is 200 again all the same actual drivers so they're gonna sound the same they all have chroma now you can just decide if you want that physical haptic feedback when you're gaming or not and they seem to be releasing today or like i said tomorrow by the time you see this except for the v3 pro which will be out in time for the holiday so over the next month or so min then touched on the new razer book preloaded with windows 11 and starts off at 9.99 which i think is the first time they've actually offered the razer book at this you know lower affordable price point considering um they have like three different models all different specs i'm available in the mercury color and the new one launching today is the quartz pink color variant um i think it was funny they really hit home on these laptops have all the ports you know kind of poking fun at apple this week with their launch of the new macbook pro and sort of reintroducing ports they took out years ago so now they're getting praise for bringing these ports back razor's like hey we have all the ports we've had all the ports so yes new razer book and then we actually get a first from razer excuse my voice there uh and then is the honbo chroma aio so now switching over to some of the pc hardware and stuff razer launching their very own aio stepping into the cooling game for the first time with this all-in-one and it comes in a 240 and 360 radiator option and the cpu cooling block you know unfortunately doesn't seem to have like a fancy oled screen or anything pretty standard here it's rounded has the illuminated logo on the inside a chroma ring around it but design wise it does look very razor and it also leads into the reveal of some new fans as you can see on this with their kunai chroma fans and you can buy these separately but they also do come on the aio these again available in the 120 millimeter and 140 millimeter you have that clone you have the chroma light ring around the fan it looks they said these are actually 21 decibels quieter i'm sorry 21 quieter than the competition due to the hydraulic design to the fans and it creates 70 more static pressure so it's interesting to see and when this releases uh if it can be you know that fast and powerful and that quiet considering they have comparisons to the competition and these could also be daisy chained together uh and i assume they're gonna sync with like chroma and stuff with like the synapse software i see that's all gonna be synced and the third release to go along with this then is with their new uh aio and the phantom selves is gonna be a pwm fan controller this is so you can create you know the custom fan curves control the speeds obviously then connect up to numerous fans to this it says up to eight fans to your pc so gonna be interesting to see then how this ties into uh into synapse because i would have thought it would be cool if you can plug it like one little header into the motherboard and then control it all through synapse i believe nzxt does that now nzx does have a fan controller um so yeah it'll be interesting to see how this all can be integrated into synapse later on down the line then also announced another brand new sort of pc hardware venture right on cue with the fans is their new katana chroma power supply so they said it's platinum rated uh you know platinum efficiency rated so it's got the highest grade electronics and capacitors on the inside and here men really touched on the fact that with this platinum efficiency they really want it to be energy efficient uh you know talking about eco-friendly sustainability which is you know good to see in here obviously and the katana also has you know that light ring on the inside with the fan uh cables are modular so it's a modular power supply we obviously assume that would be the case and this is gonna be cool when it releases they said it's gonna come in q1 2022 uh they said it is completed they're sort of waiting for uh i guess the certification to come through oh just capping back then on some release dates the aio will be launching in a few weeks in november the fan fan controller are dropping today actually uh but yeah still probably more info to come on the katana and stuff interestingly i'm looking at it right now show it's going to be available in 750 watts and 1600 watts so just those two options i believe which is a pretty big gap and it's like you know this 750 watts is going to be you know the more normal one it's gonna cover most builds um obviously if you have you know a lot of the newer modern hardware it'll be kind of pushing it 750 watts but you should be okay but man 1600 watts that's a big boy i don't know what kind of system's gonna be needing that but that is massive and then next was razer enki the follow up from their easter the gaming chair last year and i never checked this out when the easter launched you know i knew about it but i wasn't interested in it because i had my own hermann miller m body so i didn't really care about gaming chairs but i had no idea how popular and successful the easter lineup was so you know it only makes sense that a year later we're getting not only a follow-up but a new version now with the n key and they talked a lot about obviously comfort weight distribution and stuff some of the new changes they're making to the design for comfort i was really digging these uh butt cheek heat maps that's always cool to see and some of the new things are like you know upgraded leather and cushioning uh more ergonomic curvature for your back and the shoulder arc and they're also gonna be releasing an enki x which seems to be very slightly different i'm not a hundred percent sure exactly on uh you know what that's going to entail because you'll see in a second but from what i can see it's the same exact chair just instead of the 4d armrest you have a 2d armrest on the x so just a physical vertical adjustment instead of the 4d and i guess a sort of difference in like the reclining and stuff but uh what's interesting here is they're actually releasing a one thousand dollar enki pro which is finished in carbon fiber completely different upholstery a bunch of other bonuses and changes to the mouse or the chair sorry but man a thousand dollars is a lot for a gaming chair uh but the n key x like i said the budget version with the x is going to be 2.99 and the regular n key um is where is it 3.99 so n key pro the more premium option n key x and anki same chair very minor differences but the same actual chair and cushioning like i said the main difference being the the difference in reclining and i believe the 2d and 3d armrests and then lastly for the end of their major announcements you know they talked a lot about other like collaborations and games and game integrations and stuff but one of the more interesting ones uh it's kind of switching back to hardware real quick is men showed off their halo infinite sort of line of peripherals but that's not really new we've seen these tees before and stuff but they announced that they dropped a collaborative graphics card with a radeon uh bringing us a 6900 xt colored looking it's a graphics card to match you know master chief a spartan looking graphics card you got that like hunter green and gold sort of accents to it but as if we didn't need any more you know physical limitation to turn to stock they're only making 117 available world wide and again by the time you see this tomorrow because i'm making this now you'll see it tomorrow today they're probably going to be gone on to the scalpers up on ebay bots that's a bummer but interestingly uh they also touched on like you know collaboration with main gear they talked about um they're actually collabing with asrock to put out razer motherboards in the future but that seems to be the bulk of the announcements and main hardware releases coming up and actually i just want to check real quick because i believe it is still going on this razer con live stream uh is a lot longer than i thought it would be looking like it's been uh streaming for just around four hours now and yes that does seem to be the end of the major major announcements so unfortunately it's not like apple we're not gonna get a one last thing no real you know peripherals that were released like no new mouse and keyboard coming out was definitely hopeful for a razer viper mini ultimate but uh but no maybe in 2022. but guys that'll be the end of the sort of recap and reaction to the 2021 razor con hope you enjoyed like i said something new kind of like a different sort of reaction video just to see what they were going to be putting out what we can expect in the coming months if you like this
