all right so literally just got this 77 inch 4k tv delivered like five minutes ago and i'm down here you know taken out of the box and just got an alert that uh something else pretty special just arrived so rarely do you get a 77-inch tv delivered and that's not the highlight of your day we gotta set this up [Music] [Music] [Music] oh what's up guys i'm random frank p and today as you saw in the intro we're gonna be checking out my brand new beast of an itx pc the main gear turbo this guy is completely specked out looks gorgeous as well like check out that custom hardline cooling inside got the acrylic going on this machine is probably the most powerful pc i've owned and also one of the smallest so i got it here in the upstairs office today which i've been spending a lot more time in uh also you can tell probably untreated for audio so a good amount of reverb i assume you can hear some echoing going on we're going to get this thing all set up down some games benchmark it tell you guys all about it all right so checking out the turbo case itself and some of the specs inside uh it is custom painted white to fit in with the rest of the setup theme but in terms of specs you have an amd ryzen 9 5950x cpu the nvidia geforce rtx 3080 graphics card all custom cooled with the hardline apex cooling looks super nice with the acrylic blocks inside just crazy attention to detail our motherboard is an asus rog strix x570i gaming 64 gigs of hyperx fury ram at 3600 megahertz and then 5 terabytes of storage for all our games and editing software so that's gonna be a multi-use pc up in here in the minimal office but man it just looks so so nice um with the asus armory crate software you can change all the lighting and like you know the effects and stuff for the inside of the pc but also you can just use the included remote to change it on the fly customize the effects and stuff definitely convenient there now for gaming and benchmarking i did this with two different monitors uh my primary monitor upstairs is the lg 27 inch ultra gear it's 4k one millisecond response time 144 hertz with g-sync then i also tested it downstairs on an asus rg swift 360 hertz monitor at 1080p for the benchmarks we'll have both 4k and 1080 just to give you an idea of how it performs with both resolutions she is a vegetarian i swear she's literally eaten like every dandelion in this yard um that's like her favorite thing you can look there's like no dandelions anywhere except for a little bit over there but she just devours them rosie you're crazy but you're crazy cute look at a happy trot nearly 90 degrees today crazy it's only end of april but super hot so i'm currently waiting for all the games to finish downloading you know when i get these new pcs and i just want to play right away but obviously i gotta wait uh wait for all the games to download and they're like 100 plus gigs each so of course it's going to take a while i've got like five games downloading right now so uh i'm gonna hang out for a bit wait till that's all done play some benchmark and have some results for you tomorrow all right so next day sorry about the continuation here everything's downloaded everything's installed everything is ready to go alright so before we get into the benchmarks of the main gear turbo um with the rtx 3080 inside obviously you're familiar with you know the rtx gpus and ray tracing and the visual you know gains you sort of get with that but what i'm mostly pumped for is the nvidia dlss 2.0 which uses the artificial intelligence and machine learning to up sample a lower resolution when you're gaming which is going to give you a nice boost in performance while offering image quality that's comparable to gaming at a higher native resolution so this performance boost with dlss 2.0 is made possible by the specialized tensor cores found in geforce rxtx hardware which visually is going to give you a boost in frame rate and generate a sharper image for your game some games do allow both rtx to be enabled with ray tracing and while using the ultra high resolution with dlss um i know battlefield 5 for example uses both from my testing so it's definitely putting the 380 to good use and if that all just sound like a bunch of foreign words i'll kind of break it down for you guys the rtx cards it's just using ai to render and produce image quality that's visually comparable to the native resolution so what that means is for example in like call of duty you can set it to the 4k performance dlss setting this is going to render the game at 1080p but with the ai upscaling going on it's going to produce an image that looks like 4k so you're still running it at 1080p technically avoid that sharpening and upscaling going on in the background it's gonna help you get more frames out of your game because it's still just running at 1080 and it's not as taxing as it would be if you're running it at 4k so it's like you're tricking your pc in a way to boost performance without taking a major performance hit okay so for the first run of tests like i said before i tested on a 1080p monitor at 360 hertz just so we can get you know a good idea of how it's going to perform at a pretty common resolution at 1080p and i use cap frame x for all of my benchmarking and i am not good at excel so if my benchmarking you know final result looks terrible you can blame me it's fine and taking a look at the results as you can see in blue we have our average fps with the orange bar underneath being the one percent low average and everything performed you know up to par if not better with the exception of of course microsoft flight simulator so everything that you're gonna see with these game benchmarks it's tested at the highest possible setting nothing is turned down whatsoever so that's why you know flight simulator is pretty low it's a very taxing game as it is but everything else at the ultra highest possible graphical setting valorem of course over 400 fps a very easy to run game forza looked gorgeous forza horizon 4 is like one of my favorite racing games and that just blazed at 197 frames don't know why i started from the bottom going to the top and then we have call of duty and battlefields two very few fast paced action fps games battlefield not so much you know fast-paced but you get the idea i tested that both with rtx on and off so you can see the difference there in the fps average and then apex 246 then we're going to switch gears to our 4k benchmarks because a system like this with these specs is gonna be you know better paired with a 4k monitor and honestly the results didn't take too much of a hit like i thought they were going to apex still 127.5 fps then we could talk about battlefield and call of duty because battlefield on and off with rtx and dlss you can see tested both cases here and we got a 10 frames boost with rtx on as well as dlss enabled in battlefield 5. so usually rtx is going to make the game look better but you're going to take a pretty big hit in terms of frames but here that is not the case same exact story with call of duty modern warfare playing some warzone we went from 94.4 frames stock during the game to 112 with dls that's enabled again using the ai behind the scenes to take away a lot of that taxing performance hit but still making it look equally as good if not better and you can see the fps boost we get forza still looked gorgeous 140 frames microsoft flight simulator yes that did take a bit of a hit still we're at 43 frames at 4k here and then valerian still just insane at 273 but with gaming out of the way i still wanted to test this with a more practical use for my upstairs office space you know with it being a more clean and minimal vibe i like to get more work done up here if i want to kind of de-clutter free the mind a bit from the crazy studio space downstairs so with this being you know originally what i wanted to be a separate editing room obviously i wanted to see how this system performs versus my downstairs pc with editing and rendering a clip in premiere pro and what i used for this was a 10 minute black magic raw video clip i applied an adjustment layer with color correction as well as a blur effect on the clip itself again just to see the comparison between the two cpus and how it performs with that export render on my downstairs pc with the intel i9 10900k it rendered in 12 minutes in one second and up here with the ryzen 9 5950x it rendered in seven minutes and 30 seconds so we saved three and a half minutes the same clip on this pc and when it comes to know the editing workflow time is money and three and a half minutes is huge [Music] if you couldn't get a good idea from the vlog footage but the size of this thing check this out it's it's my upper chest okay this thing is just a monster for its small compact size and as you saw with it outperforming my pc down here uh just doing great for that premiere pro export i might as well just flip-flop them bring this upstairs and keep this down here as my main pc and even for gaming you saw 1080p 4k for most games it killed everything i say that because obviously flight simulator a very taxing you know highly demanding game but that game's like it's it's a weird outlier because the the conditions play into effect do it where you're flying over you know the map at that time of what you're flying over it's all going to change the performance of flight simulator but like battlefield at 4k with rtx on and dlss at 4k looking that good playing that smooth the performance bump was definitely noticeable same for uh modern warfare so if you know playing warzone with that performance bump was definitely nice i loved playing forza and seeing that you know at 4k right up close looked gorgeous i'm used to playing down here on my ultra wide monitors which you know i've been ultrawide user for so long now but seeing that crispness of a nice 4k display man main gear turbo guys absolutely loving this tiny beast of a pc definitely one of the smallest i've owned and probably hands down the most powerful so if you want to check it out any of the main gear pc offerings have a link for you in the description down below so you can go and configure your own i know building a pc right now is kind of difficult for the stock storages but main gear they got some inventory so i hope you guys dig it let me know your thoughts down below do you like this pc should i swap them drop your comments in the comments section if you like this
