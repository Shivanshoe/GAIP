okay what's up guys i'm random frank p and uh razer sent over this absolutely massive pr box filled with a ton of their most popular gaming peripherals this is aimed to be like a testing kit so hopefully down the line you'll be able to pick up one of these and test out which you know certain mouse keyboard headset is right for you you can pick between them and it'll help you make a better purchase decision in the end so we're going to go through this massive box uh see what's inside see what they included and just go over it all right after this this video is sponsored by nzxt and their build pcs if you don't have the time patience or knowledge to build your own nzxt has you covered all you have to do is choose a few games you want to play pick your price and then it'll configure it for you they even have the latest gpu offerings from nvidia and amd so if you want to get your hands on a 3080 they actually have some stock plus all their pcs come with a two year warranty which covers all the parts and labor from their warehouse right to your desk setup so if anything goes wrong you'll be in good hands if you want to check it out including their new starter pcs i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below alright so this massive container has a ton of different latches and stuff so we're just gonna unbox it and see how it goes and as you guys know this studio is more so set up to be focused more on me when it comes to filming a little bit of a tighter shot so here we have a wider camera angle to hopefully capture what's going on i hope we have a secondary camera angle right here and then a third guy right up here so i hope between the three angles there's some usable footage uh but we're just gonna open it up and see what we got inside okay so first up again hopefully overhead is capturing this um actually let me just kind of do it like sideways maybe so you can see me oh whatever uh first up we've got some a little note here let's see what we got it's probably just a finding your right fit so yes it's kind of like an introductory kind of thing um pretty much stating that this is a razer test kit here to help you uh find which is going to be the best for you to give you the best advantage in game toss that aside we've got oh pretty much an entire like this is like a whole press kit right here it's got a bunch of information about their stuff i guess this is all it's gonna be what's inside here i don't know toss that aside as well and first up right up top we actually have uh a mouse pad this is the razer akari i checked this out when it came out it's definitely a nice um hard pad surface and it's going to be better for those who obviously prefer a you know harder pad surface versus cloth you're not going to have as much control with the hard pad but it's definitely going to give you speed so we'll put this aside for now and obviously uh with the included mice that's in here we can talk about how that will benefit the akari and then we also have whatever this one is i assume this is their newer mouse pad uh the gigantis i believe this is the v2 from the gigantis lineup they do have it different sizes and stuff this with that woven texture is going to give you an even x and y axis glide nice and soft so you'll have more control with this but again i'll put the mouse pads aside for now i assume there's more to go over and there's also keys up top and there's more latches on the side i don't know if i'll even need those we'll keep these keys over here for now and i think i could just take this out right yes okay so right there underneath us now we've got some uh some serious gaming mice options we got one two three four five six different mice here to pick from i'll turn it back around so you can see me again like i said the studio is not usually set up to get these wider shots like this so i hope between all different camera angles this is working out for you but yeah six different razer gaming mice and the first one is looking like the basilisk ultimate because it has the dock right here with it yes so again just to reiterate with a test kit like this um their overall goal which i assume is the point of a test kit is to be kind of like what zowie did last year with their mouse kits you could pretty much have the whole selection right in front of you so you can physically test out which is going to be best for you and your preference and also with a gaming mouse it's going to factor in what it's going to come down to is your hand size and your grip so with an actual physical tangible test kit you get to see which feels best in your hand which is best for your grip your play style that's why this is really cool so the basilisk ultimate this obviously very close in shape to the g502 so you have the ergonomic design it's not the lightest mouse out there obviously i believe this is closer to i want to say if i remember correctly a little over 120 grams but what you like about this is again it's the shape it's the size here when it comes to ergonomics obviously when you have this fin on the side to support your thumb it just feels good in the hand you have a bit of a higher bump here so when it is in your hand it just feels nestled in you know so with the wireless version in this test kit because we also have the dock for the viper ultimate which looks like it's next uh you have the dock here so you can plug this in you can plug in the dongle so you have that wireless connection here then at night time you put it on the dock it charges for you so again we'll do a closer look at these in a minute uh because right next to this like i said we have the viper ultimate so this is the lightweight uh symmetrical design here but it's one of the more groundbreaking products in the mouse market i don't mean to say that like lightly but when this came out you know think about it were there a lot of lightweight wireless gaming mics in this released last october in 2019 no uh it launched for 150 and it got on the lighter side i want to say if i can remember correctly off top of my head if i want to say it's anywhere from 76 to 74 grams uh so for a mouse like this that just does feel naturally good in the hands with a symmetrical design that is wireless lightweight uh it was a great product it's still the mouse that i used today since this came out like i said october 2018 for 2019 i've been meeting this so you have that in the test kit and this is looking like yes this is the smaller wired version the viper mini which you know by its name viper mini it's smaller this at 61 grams still ambidextrous and with it being a smaller size overall it's gonna be best for those who maybe have a smaller or medium sized hand to obviously you know fit the smaller size so you're not cramping up if you have a larger hand you're not like clawing it you know so for smaller hands for those who like to say smaller mouse in general it's going to be lighter as well this is what that's for a smaller version of the viper and viper ultimate the viper mini moving on down now i don't think i've tested out some of these more recent ones uh but i know while we you could say the top three with the basilisk ultimate the two versions of the viper are gonna be more suited for fps gaming this is the naga pro and what i liked about this i checked out the naga trinity when that came out uh but what you have when we take off the side grip is you have these interchangeable side buttons pretty much so this with 12 keys is gonna be good for like you know moba games and stuff uh but these come off like i said they're interchangeable uh so right here embedded you have the actual wireless dongle uh but if you want one that has you know less keys instead of you know 12 like we had on that first one this one has six it's magnetic with a pogo pin that snaps in comes out now you have six right here and then say you don't need six or twelve buttons you know you just want the more traditional uh fps design they also have the third side grip which just the forward and backward button a plus a little bit of extra textured grip here on the side so that's where mounts like this really comes into play is the fact that it is so versatile and you can use it with pretty much uh different titles different genres with the different side grips it's gonna complement whatever game you're playing a different programs for you know photo editing video editing assigning those different buttons to different macros always clutch and given the size here again ergonomic you have those grooves on the right side to fit you like your ring finger or your pinky finger depending on your specific grip but it's definitely going to be best for the medium to larger sized hand put that back put this grip here this grip here we got two more and this is the newer v2 pro of the deathadder deathadder v2 pro um i do have this in studio i haven't fully checked it out yet but from everything i've heard and seen this very very popular and you know doing very well in the market right now because that death adder shape it's it's trusted it's loved by many again ergonomic as well and it is a bigger mouse overall it is on the larger size in terms of actual shape so smaller hands probably won't favor this too well it's gonna be for those medium to larger hands uh but with their v2 pro kind of offering here it still manages to keep a pretty lightweight form factor to it at just 88 grams given its overall size which is pretty impressive and then as razer is done with releasing smaller mice we actually have the lighter wired version of this if i can get it out real quick this the deathadder v2 mini so larger 88 grams this smaller and i believe it was 62 grams so again for those who love that that that are shape you know that trusted shape of the death adder nice and ergonomic you have those two options the larger deathadder v2 pro which is also wireless or the lightweight smaller version the v2 mini then before we move on to show you an overall roundup of the mics we have here and who they're going to be for again it's going to factor into your hand size and your play style and grip so my hands are 18 and a half centimeters long by nine and a half centimeters wide for my inner palm but for the basilisk ultimate and naga pro this is definitely the larger out of the six here and they're gonna be best for i'd say palm the viper ultimate and death outer v2 pro you can pretty much do either palm claw or fingertip with this mouse because it is so flexible with the shape and the medium to larger side then when it comes to finger tipping that's going to be best for those smaller mice or the viper mini and the death outer v2 mini probably going to be best for that but again you could also fingertip the viper ultimate in the death outer v2 pro so i'd say basilisk ultimate and naga pro on the larger side viper ultimate and death outer v2 pro medium side and then viper mini death outer v2 mini smaller side and also throw up the little price charts you can see right there but again with the test kits you have six options to physically test out yourself to see which is best for you and best for your hand size and when it comes to gaming peripherals um the mouse is the one that's going to be most important and tailored to you and your hand side so if you have an uncomfortable mouse if it's too small or too big for you for your specific hand size odds are not going to perform too well or game too well so that's why when it comes to a test kit like this this is very unique and very important in finding which can be the best mouse for you so again i hope this does come to market put that behind me and next up we've got keyboards okay so looking okay we got two in this kit gotta break it out here okay yes two plus their actual like key switch tester put that to the side and i can see we got headsets coming up next okay so first up um let's see this is looking like the thankfully tell us inside the black widow v3 yeah so i don't actually believe i've physically tested this out in person um i know it got released and what they've done with these test kits is actually give us two different switches in the specific keyboard so you could kind of test out not only what keyboard you like but what switch you like so on the left side of the black widow v3 we have their clicky green switches so real quick just you know that sharp clicky tactile response it's the more popular you know green switch version odds are you've seen many times in the past then on the right side you have their silent linear switch which in this version is their older yellow switches these are not their optomechanicals so just real quick okay so linear yellows nice and quiet no actual tactile feedback or bump on the switch so it actually it's nice and smooth which is why it's quieter versus okay so clicky linear and again this is not other optomechanical switch offerings in this black widow lineup what i like about it is for being a full size it does seem relatively compact uh no big forehead which is good to see you do have an integrated volume dial up on the top right side which is also clicky and a button next to it so these i assume you could also use for you know different sorts of multimedia keys and switching songs and playback functions but i feel like now as we roll into 2021 uh full-size keyboards really are becoming a thing of the past because the rage over the past year or so has been the tkl or the 60. and this yes i can feel it already two different switch options here this the huntsman tournament edition i reviewed this it's a very very popular keyboard so on the left side these are gonna be their purple clicky optomechanicals then on the right side here they're red linears so again you can hear that stark difference and the the feedback and the response of the switches i'll do some b-roll so you guys can get a better look at this but again with this specific tkl tournament edition offering you have those two options of optomechanical clicky or linear and the advantage optomechanical versus their traditional switch is that this uses the infrared light beam to instantly transfer that signal to your pc versus on a traditional um you know keyboard switch with the actual pins it relies on that metallic to metallic feedback of the pins to the pcb which over time could corrode or cause problems which is why you get a lot of times key chattering with the double presses and stuff so optomechanical more reliable they're faster that's pretty much why they developed them and over the past you know year or so you've also seen a lot of companies also put out their version of an optical switch and like i said before with the key switch tester we have which is on the top side of the unit here this gives you the full rundown of five of their different switches so you have the optomechanical clicky nice and lightweight fast loud then you have the optomechanical reds which are smooth linear still equally as fast with the optical infrared light beam then for the more traditional switches like i said before green tactile and clicky orange is their tactile and silent which is very similar to a brown switch you're familiar with cherry brown switches or gather on browns whatever they're more silent than a actual clicky green switch but they still have that slight tactile a bump and response so you feel the bump but it's a lot quieter than their yellow switches are the linear and silent so they're as quiet i say as the orange switch but you don't get that actual bump and feedback but these allow you to be really really quiet if you want to get these like real quick actuations as you can see so you can press it down and it's virtually silent so that is their keyboard offering and again if it's up to me you know if i'm telling you my personal opinion uh tournament edition all the way because not only are these switches faster and more reliable uh but do you really need a numpad i know for gaming i never do i know in some cases some of you out there yes you might need a numpad so that's understandable but i can't think of a single time when i've been gaming that i needed a numpad nor do i ever really use it on my regular uh setup behind me so tournament edition all the way or the hudson mini with the smaller 60 layout and uh prices of the tournament edition have gone down a lot over the past year uh so odds are you can find this at a pretty good price and again optical switches put that behind me again and then the last offering we have here are their headsets and these are looking like what i believe is some of their newer ones oh yes and this is good because actually hold on a second let me put that to the side uh because there's this lat i guess this is part of the same thing there's a whole latch over here and i guess this just oh this just allows this to fall down i don't know if there's like a secret compartment if they open this wrong but yeah we have a secret little or a little compartment on this side for those latches this would be a really good box for like camera gear and stuff when i'm traveling um man what a kit nothing underneath right and that's the bottom okay so let me just put this over here real quick and we'll get to the headsets i know this video is getting a bit long but that's okay it's less less serious than our usual uh videos right i'm trying to do it all in one take less editing on my end but now for the actual headsets here two different ones and like i said some of their more recent offerings and one of the more popular ones as well so coming in on this left side uh which was rated as my personal favorite headset of 2020. i did a video a few weeks back on the top five gaming headsets of the year and this honestly for me came in at number one this the black shark v2 pro and i've said this before i said in my actual review i talked about this in the actual uh black shark v2 x video in the regular v2 version which are wired these the v2 pro wireless um i was a huge fan of the original black shark headset back in i think i had that one 2012 2013 and these are by far the most comfortable it's the most comfortable headset i've ever used and just the weight distribution they're lightweight overall they feel nice the the padding here on the side it all just feels super light and just good on my head now wearing a hat doesn't really matter but what i also really like is you can see it's like that kind of nod to the older black shark with that helicopter sort of pilot design to the headset overall the original black shark back in you know eight years ago it had a more like mechanical look to it with the mechanical uh microphone boom arm so this definitely more modernized i would say it looks more like a 20 20 wireless gaming headset so they're ditching the mechanical look but in terms of just overall uh comfort sound everything is a total package it's it came in number one like i said it's my favorite headset of the year it sounds phenomenal you get the thx uh sort of sound signature you can use in the razer uh synapse software so you get the thx surround sound they also have razor 7.1 surround sound which is really good and i don't say that often but when it comes to surround sound i think logitech and razer do it best for an emulated surround sound you know odds are most other surround sound headsets sound like garbage but razer logitech they do it right and uh i absolutely just love this so this is this would be my go-to but again it's wireless you have to factor that in on which devices you can use this with which can be compatible with uh you have the nice volume dial here on the ear cup a great headset great headset and then the next one here which is one i haven't checked out but i know it's from the probably the most popular headset lineup in the whole gaming space the cracking lineup this the kraken ultimate so again the cracking lineup um i think i forgot i reviewed a kraken headset a long time ago i also checked out the kraken x last year which was like what fifty dollars this still has their thx spatial audio uh it's they're custom tuned i want to say 50 millimeter drivers uh it's a usb connection so you can plug this in and again still take advantage of their synapse software with thx and go in and sort of eq it uh there's also rgb on the ear cups so it might not matter to you but it does have rgb like i said i'll show you some b-roll but what also is really interesting about these is and i feel like they should do these on all their headsets is the actual ear pads okay they're over the ears you can see and they're circular so they're definitely over the ear but they're they have this sort of cooling gel infusion into the actual ear pads so when you put it on your head like it feels cool it's not the most comfortable to me like the headband up top i do feel a bit of a pressure point uh and that's again still without wearing a hat obviously so it's it's different different construction obviously from the black shark series but i really like the overall cooling effect it has for longer gaming sessions you know if your ears do get hot uh which is a common thing with people uh this will definitely cut that down you also have the mic and stuff so this both of their you know more premium options when it comes to their offerings with the usb kraken ultimate again this plugs in via usb so use this on your pc adapters for your phone consoles so the more versatile option here with the kraken ultimate but again for the person out there trying to go completely wireless cutting cables you want to use this as like a dedicated headset on your pc or something uh the black shark v2 pro i just think is one of the best out there hands down now we've gone over a lot and uh one thing i want to revisit real quick is the certain uh mouse pads that we have with the mice that we unbox should have done that before probably but we'll get to it now all right so i cleared everything off to the side we can revisit the mouse pads again we have their gigantis v2 which is their cloth control mouse pad versus the new razer akari which is a hard mouse pad more so for speed and with that really hard sort of glide surface um you know it's a it's a hard mouse pad now it's going to come down to preference again whether you prefer a hard fast surface versus a more traditional cloth mouse pad i've always been you know favorable to a cloth mouse pad but also you want a mouse pad to complement your mouse feet on here we have their 100 virgin ptfe feet on both units and all of the new razer mice out there have these 100 virgin ptfe feet most commonly compared to you'll hear hyper glides out there it's that nice you know sort of white mouse feet you'll see versus the older black mouse feet which were not 100 virgin ptfe so again it's their hyper glide equivalent this is going to give you a more you know a faster slicker glide on your mouse pad surface so really for both surfaces you're going to be able to take advantage of their 100 virgin ptfe feet and one thing again with a with a hard pad surface like this yes you get absolute speed flicks on a dime look at that spin uh but it's also a lot louder so just like you hear that versus cloth a lot quieter obviously so again here more control that's what you want if you want more control then you have that if you want just real quick flicks if you want to be moving your mouse pad like a madman you have that here so that'll pretty much do it for the razer test kit again going through the different peripherals and their top selling offerings pretty much out there to again help you see what's kind of best for you your preference your needs when it comes to gaming and if if racer can get something like this to market where you can rent these test kits to try out peripherals before you buy it i think it would be really really cool and would be a great way for people to try things before they buy them so they can see which suits them so hope this video isn't a total disaster i hope all these cameras i get them all synced up and that actually looks good as a final video and not just me rambling for 25 minutes straight but either way hope you all enjoyed if you did give this video a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at alas if you
