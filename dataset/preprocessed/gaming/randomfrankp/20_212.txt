what's up guys I'm random Frank P back with episode 213 of room tour project the series where you show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup the whole point of the series and this week we're gonna have like a cosy kind of addition some nice chill setups say anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll start it off now episode 213 alright first batter is Jason s and he's coming in with that stack to monitor setup always loving these in lots of warm tones going on that's you know that's a cozy thing and just jumping right into it his primary display is an LG 34 inch with that stacked over head being a 24 inch from Asus and it's seemingly attached to a different bracket because it is you know suspended pretty highly up and it's a little bit behind that monitor but still working out at that big ol window there nice natural light getting into some of the gear now those speakers you can see on each side of the ultra wide are the Logitech Z 150 multimedia speakers and for his main peripherals we have the Razer sigh nose to chroma keyboard with the Razer Viper Mini Mouse and then those a pair of headphones right there the Skullcandy venue anc wireless and yes some plants for some extra bonus points now rolling over to the PC this is the Thermaltake C 23 RGB case inside that AMD Rison 520 600 CPU with the cooler master hyper 212 Evo cooler got 16 gigs of g.skill aigis or Aegeus ram I never know how to say it who says is that word anyways with the asus rog Strix b 450f motherboard and the EVGA gtx 1060 for the GPU and obviously with those green RGB fans the lights inside all go into a green kind of theme so whether it's the color of the wallpaper maybe it's even the color grading of these photos it just feels very cozy to me you know what I'm saying like I look at this and I feel like sitting down here in a cup of coffee or some hot cocoa on a nice like winter day and you would just you know feel all warm that's the kind of cozy feeling I'm getting next up we have Liam and this one you guys are starting to see a trend I like plants in a setup it just takes it to a different level it brings life into it even as far as into the wallpaper and it's still gonna look good like we have here but I mean it has been 213 episodes by now I assume you know that about me in my ways so for these two Tetris shaped monitor setup the primary is an AOC 27 inch at 144 Hertz with the vertical monitor on the left side being an ASIS 24 inch display and you can see under that display it's kept up by a single monitor arm right there and then moving on down to the peripherals a nice Wireless black and white theme going on for the gear and fitting in with a panda of our Millah extended a desk mat for the keyboard it is the vortex tab 60 with Logitech G 305 and for audio basking in the light of those daintily for our light panels or the sennheiser HD v 8x jubilee open-back headphones now over to the PC and just thriving in the ivy it's like a shot straight from Animal Planet we have the NZXT th 500 case with our AMD risin 5 2600 cpu and the shark gaming blood freezer ai oh that's a name for you 16 gigs of Crucial Ballistix sport LT ram on an asus rog Strix b 450f gaming motherboard with an asus r-tx 2060 dual GPU and just throwing in the shot here a nice collectible lightsaber on display looking pretty nice as well so again let's identify what makes this cozy is it though natural wooden desk possibly is it possibly the huge window for all the ambient lighting maybe is it the the plants like I mentioned probably and that warm warm light bulb you'd factor all that in and what does it do it makes you cozy it's a chill setup this is what I'm loving speaking of love have you ever seen something like bassy has here this is a hell of a setup and guess what guys it's got plants and that's what's up if I leave any legacy in this world I hope it's something related to improving desk setups and just giving a home for all the succulents on a desk set up so I'm really digging this monitor orientation because the primary one is actually the 34 inch ultra wide with the two on the bottom kind of being like an under kind of glance display you know and then here you'd switch it up with all the lighting and make the setup look really cool but it's still all ties together so for that primary it's a 34 inch from LG and the bottom two are each 25 inch models from LG got a lot of gear for the peripherals including the normy arena keyboard with Logitech MX master 2's Mouse a Wacom Intuos M tablet with the Korg nano control 2 for audio his headphones are the skull candy crusher wireless and also you might have seen in previous photos his speakers those are the Heiser HS R 120 then over to the PC this case is the anti des AI crystal cube AR case with a rise in Federer xcp you with a Noctua n hu 14s cooler 32 gigs of Crucial Ballistix sport ram on an msi x3 99 sli plus motherboard and two graphics cards we have a gigabyte GT X 1080 Ti and a gigabyte gtx 1070 TI inside but playing off the colors that knock to a fan with some sort of like bronze and black braided cables there and it looks pretty good so one thing that's really interesting that he did is with that top display he has it on its own dedicated arm I could completely just attach him his main setup and fold over to the left side where he has his bed so he can just lounge back watch some movies game on here and really just chill with a nice display right in front of him so I am just loving this one yes the plants definitely helped out a lot but I love the monitor orientation I love just the flow all the colors he has in the daytime when it's all natural it's looking just as good kicking it nice and simple we have Johanna's and this one here I think is I can't really tell if it's like a bedroom or an office space because it's laid out pretty unique and it works so don't get me wrong the nice wooden floors the wooden ceiling even definitely cozy keyword for today he's going with the single monitor which is a 27 inch 4k it's the e line from Philips and I just want to take a second to point something out those Kermit prints he has above the monitor what's the main color they're green what else does he have going on in the set up the green plants and the green in the wallpaper with it literally being this serene country road with the plants the trees you see what I'm saying guys so for the gear those speakers are the Logitech z6 25 th x with a delta qotb 631 wireless keyboard and Logitech MX master mouse so two primary wireless peripherals and then for the PC the fractal mesh fic tempered glass case always love them with what a fractal is doing inside the Rison 930 900 X CPU with the sight the ninja v cooler 64 gigs of Corsair Vengeance lpx Ram I'm gigabyte X 570 or pro motherboard in the MSI r-tx 2070 super gaming X graphics card I'm digging this overhead shot I'm digging the desk and I'm digging this set up all around good stuff here from Johanna's you can see I'm getting some work done there editing some videos good stuff and then last but not least we have I like to read books with a very bright and saturated salt lamp that is seemingly contributing to the very warm feel of everything I don't know if it's just very saturated photos but that desk is popping out as well which you know again it's gonna contribute to the cozy warm feel so for the display it's the specter pro 34 inch ultra wide in forest peripherals he has the arcade 61 keyboard he put on some ym DK carving key caps again to touch on some of the orange little accents in there as you can see with Logitech G 402 Mouse and for the PC we have the cooler master ms hundred case inside then risin 5 3400 cpu with the hunt key RAM 8 gigs of hunt key Ram I've never heard of hunt key but that's ok there's plain different companies and alright the tough beef 450 m+ gaming motherboard with an asus strix RT X 2070 GPU vertically mounted RGB all synced to orange which will match his personal son that he's captured yet again with that salt lamp man this thing is must got some like real ass crystals in here harnessing the power of the earth from its core so again I like to read books is the name and I was contemplating it maybe you like saving this for a clean and minimal edition but ultimately because of that warm ass lamp in the desk it felt more cozy to me that's the overall takeaway guys some little cozy tips for your setup alright guys
