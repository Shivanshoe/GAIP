what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be checking out my top five gaming mice from 2020. now keep in mind this is my personal list i've tested and tried out tons from this year but also everyone's hand size grip and preference is going to be different so keep that in mind but also we've been completely spoiled because 2020 showed the release of the most gaming mice ever no other year had more releases than 2020. so there's a lot to pick from like i said we'll go over my top five but also as you saw from the thumbnail there was more than five there's definitely a good amount of honorable mentions in front of reps that we're gonna have to go over because you can't just narrow all these great gaming mics we got this year down to five so sit tight it's a bit of a longer one but we'll go through it all for you if you see anything you like you want to check it out i'll put them all in the description down below with the holidays coming up add them to your wishlist and you'll keep an eye on them as well because if black friday and cyber monday next week hopefully you can find something on sale now first up coming at number five is the newest one to this list because this literally just came out and it's a follow-up from one of the top selling mice of all time the g pro wireless this is the brand new logitech g pro x super light now the g pro x super light cut down nearly 20 grams in weight to 63 grams now making this one of the lightest wireless mouse options out there and it's that same familiar ambidextrous egg shape comes in either a black or a white color option and their hero sensor uses their low latency light speed technology for a dpi range of 100 to 25 600 dpi which is definitely overkill but hey you now have that option new this year they also have their massive zero edited ptfe feet for a smoother glide there's really no need to swap these out with aftermarket skates or anything they're gonna get the job done they feel real good and the battery life is stellar at around 70 hours now obviously when i was gaming with it i had no issues whatsoever no interruptions or anything and obviously guys with a list that's you know composed of my top favorites from the year they're not going to be anything that's going to be having these like world shattering problems or issues then it wouldn't be on the list so keep that in mind for me this has been great and honestly in the end the super light probably would have been higher up on my list if it weren't for the fact that uh you know just some other mouse companies have also been killing it this year and really pushing the lightweight mouse market my main reasoning for keeping this at number five is the price it comes in at 150 which is definitely on the pricier side when comparing it to others and the fact that i don't know 100 if they were able to actually make significant changes to the switches to avoid any double clicking issues but again you know price aside if you're looking at it just as a gaming mouse it's going to be a great option for sure if you love the g pro wireless which a lot of you did it's hands down one of the top selling mice of all time now you can shed nearly 20 grams it's gonna be lighter and i'm also impressed that they managed to cut down all that weight without actually putting holes in the shell so it's all done internally that's impressive so all in all besides the price tag uh it's a really solid mouse but it's coming in at number five for me so what's number four coming in here i think is hands down one of the more interesting options from this year mainly because there really hasn't been anything like this out there that we've seen in the past that's gonna be the pwnage ultra custom and given the name one of the main selling points is not only the fact that it's wireless but they let you easily swap out the shells left and right clicks and dpi button with different colored options so if you hate you know the cutouts in the shell and you want a different look you can use their included solid shell to just really make it look unique switch it up customize the colors make it match your setup on their website they have numerous different colored options shelves you can buy i think it's like 11 or 12 or something and you can buy the mouse in either black or white but also included inside the box is a set of opposite shells so if you buy a white version it'll come with black shells and you get the option included as well of both solid shell or the honeycomb shell and for me you know i've always liked the keyboard hobby for that reason is the fact that you can do just whatever you want to the keyboard to switch it up and i always thought that was like the one thing the mouse market has kind of been lacking so when they first put this out you know i was skeptical but also have it be so that these interchangeable shells and paddles you know you could swap out aren't compromising the overall quality that's huge because i figured that would be one of the crippling points but no doesn't feel cheap doesn't feel flimsy they did this right for shape as you can see it's an ergo design and for size of my scale comes in at 69 grams with the stock honeycomb shell then from there whether you want to go with the solid shell it bumps up a little bit to 73 grams or you can just remove that bottom shell altogether and get it down to 65 grams if you're someone who has a fingertip grip on the bottom is their 100 ptfe feet even though there are smaller pads in the corners and stuff they still feel very very smooth and the sensor here is a bmw 3335 it's 200 to 16 000 dpi so all this and you're thinking well this is either too good to be true or it's going to cost you an arm and a leg and the muscle is only 89 which i think is extremely fair plus like i said before if you want those extra colored shells and covered sets that's just an additional 12 so even for around 100 bucks it is definitely worth it but like i said they also include the optional shells inside the box already for you of the opposite color but if you're big into aesthetics and you just want to match your mouse to your setup this is probably one of the best ways to go all right now coming in at number three is a bit of a twofer because we have two different options of the same mouse but they're both different so first is gonna be the xm1 rgb and then the original xm1 even though this was a newer revised version of the original xm1 so two different versions and again the rgb here isn't the only difference between these two they're pretty different so for starters the white version is the non-rgb this was released i believe in february or march i want to say i think it's been flying under the radar but i feel it is a killer option and yes as you probably noticed if you have two working eyes these mice are wired but for the xm1 it is coming in at around 70 71 grams on my scale and for its size i think it's really comfortable it personally just complements my hand size and my sort of claw fingertip grip hybrid really nicely it's lower kind of wide but it works out and some things that really separate it from the others out there are its super flexible almost defying gravity paracord they use here it is crazy lightweight and it's honestly one of the best stock cables out there on a mouse to date the sensor is a bmw 3389 adjustable from 50 to 16 000 dpi and they're actually using their own form of an analog technology for their bend omron switches which means these are pretty much hand-picked to ensure that the best of the batch and in the end you're getting a faster response time in general and for a wired mouse you'll be able to tell you know that rough two to three millisecond difference probably not but it's still reassuring to see them using their own custom tech instead of recycling some of the same stuff that's already out there shows dedication really and switching it over to the xm1 rgb again we have rgb now in this version but that's not the only change the first difference is the larger ptfe skates underneath so you can compare them to the original xm1 we have that wider foot spinning across the top and bottom we also have brand new kale switches instead of omron personally i've always liked kale i feel like they're a lot more tactile but these also have a longer lifespan overall but the one downside to the new xm1 rgb is the fact that it does add around 10 grams from before around 70 grams to now around 82. and i mean all things considered that's still pretty lightweight you know but this updated change here is gonna be for those who absolutely need that rgb integration but also for those who prefer just the stability and reliability of kail switches over omron needless to say though for a wired mouse both are great options and again i need to bring up how just flexible and lightweight this cable is it really does feel wireless in a way the one thing i really like about this mouse is the coating it has it's matte super soft but still manages to remain grippy at the same time it's just a very great shape for me in my hand obviously i know with a lot of these lists and videos about gaming mice it's going to depend on your hand and your style and stuff like that uh but i'm just really a big fan of these for the overall shape design and the price the original xm1 is 60 and the xm1 rgb is 70 bucks they seem to be flying off the shelves on amazon though so like i said keep an eye on these links now winding down the top five to the number two spot is a mouse that a lot of you probably didn't see coming uh but for those of you who follow the channel you'll know that when i showed this off in cool tech under 50 for this month i was absolutely blown away and that kind of spoils it this is under 50 bucks and it is the hyperx pulse fire haste this thing came out of nowhere and just completely shocked me so this is one of the few times where i actually get something in the mail for the channel and it's the complete opposite of what i was expecting and i mean that in like a good way i figured okay a 50 lightweight mouse from hyperx probably gonna be meh but no it's awesome so coming in at 59 grams this definitely puts it on the lighter spectrum of all the gaming mice out there and even though the body does have the honeycomb cutouts to the shelf it's weight reduction the overall ambidextrous shape and design i think is really comfortable to use they are using the pixar 3335 some other physical notes here are the fact they're using their own hyper flex cable get it hyper x hyperflex you have some subtle rgb integration into the scroll wheel underneath our top grade ptfe skates and then the use of ttc golden micro switches i like these these are super sharp then also inside the box they include a set of rubberized grip tape and an extra set of skates in case they ever get damaged so not only do you get the mouse 50 bucks but you get those two additions and the whole thing really with the pulsefire haste is just in the end it's a great mouse it's not trying to do you know too too much at its core it's lightweight it's simple it's got a super comfy shape and i really like how there's no compromises anywhere while still giving us that budget friendly price tag of just 50 loving a budget option like this and really it's a better mouse than a lot of other ones out there that are charging more gg hyperx and now for my number one spot on the top five gaming mice of 2020 uh personally i'm gonna give it to glorious with their model oh wireless so last year in 2019 we saw the release of the wired modelo which completely just shifted the entire gaming mouse landscape this year we get a follow-up with the same mouse now being wireless and still not breaking the bank so taking a look at it the shell shape design obviously going to be identical to the wired modelo and gloriously gives you the option to pick it up in their black or white colors and they did say the glossy finished variants will be coming on later on down the line you still have the six programmable buttons the embedded rgb light strip and a usb-c port for charging so physically giving the lightweight ambidextrous mouse that lightweight form factor is with their honeycomb cutouts bringing it to 69 grams on my scale as advertised and this is really impressive considering the wired model o was 67 grams so now just adding two more grams for their wireless technology inside is awesome to see underneath is the power button and the dpi led indicator and their very own bamf sensor which goes up to 19 dpi the sensor is their very own creation and they said it's designed for low power consumption and obviously you're not sacrificing performance because it's 1 000 hertz polling rate 400 ips tracking and the 19000 dpi like i mentioned now for battery life they have it rated for 71 hours of gaming that's with no rgb enabled and that's definitely pretty high so obviously having rgb turned on it's going to drain it a lot quicker and there's also no reason to keep it at 100 but if you do just keep it fully blasted rainbows the battery is looking like an estimated 15 hours with full brightness so again not worth that sacrifice one cool thing i'll mention as well with this is when you're charging the mouse the scroll wheel's gonna act kind of like a charging indicator it'll pulse from red to orange to green to kind of show you what battery percentage it's at and with just a 30 minute charge i got full battery again so the usb c port is definitely proving worthy now again the original wired modelo launched last year for 50 which completely shook up the mouse game you know and here they are now only charging 80 for the modelo wireless which i think is more than fair and if you compare that to other lightweight wireless mice out there you'll quickly see this is on the way more affordable side so like we saw the g pro super light that was nearly double the price of this so glorious yet again giving us a great product for a great price tag which is why it's coming in at number one so while the monologue wireless does take my top spot like i said before we still got a lot of honorable mentions to go over that's going to start with the cooler master mm720 this mouse i personally love okay but i realized due to this super flat pancake shape this is not gonna be for everybody so i'll keep this segment pretty concise but at just 50 the 49 gram mm 720 it's gonna be for those who prefer a smaller mouse overall and mainly uses a claw or a palm grip because as you can see here with these grooves and contours it really is just an ergonomic dream so if you can master the shape you're going to be in good hands literally it has a 16 000 dpi sensor a super lightweight ultra weave cable uses 95 ptfe feet and some rgb lighting inside but it also uses optical switches which still for this price point i think is just really really impressive i personally really really like the mouse so if you could try it out and get used to the shape i think you're going to be very very shocked at how comfortable and how good it is okay next is a mouse that i admittedly completely overlooked it was sitting in the studio for like two months then when i finally broke it out of the box and started using it i was blown away i definitely contemplated putting this on my top five but again with so many great mice this year it took a bit of a back seat this is the ducky feather and you know ducky from their ducky keyboards they also made a really good lightweight mouse inside is a 3389 sensor up to 16000 dpi tips to scale at 66 grams and manages to do so without any holes or cutouts on the top shelf there are some on the sides but they also have some rubber grips there i really like the matte coating they have it doesn't show any fingerprints or oils and stuff which is always good also has some subtle integrated rgb zones and it's just 65 and for a company's first gaming mouse release like this i really really liked it and i needed to include it here because like i said it shocked me i was really impressed when i tried it out deserves more attention next is the steelseries airox 3 wireless this was also recently released last month and overall my review was pretty positive some clowns out there are going to cry about the sensor placement and honestly it's fine my only real complaint in the end is that the feet on here are too thin so you want to swap them out with third-party skates i think it'll really take it to the next level but it's a lightweight 66 gram ambi mouse with integrated rgb lighting uses their true move air optical sensor up to 18 000 dpi has great battery life overall it can connect to your pc via the usb dongle or via bluetooth so nice and versatile there and it comes in at 99 which really isn't too bad it's definitely a solid release from them using that trusted shape and i really like what steelseries is doing here now i gotta acknowledge the asus rg chakram this mouse is definitely a change of pace compared to the others on this list for starters it's still wireless but unlike the recent trend this is not lightweight and it's not trying to be it comes in at 121 grams but it's also packed with features so first off the mouse has hot swappable switches which is just a super encouraging thing to see i wish every mouse in existence did this so big ups for that next we have the ability to connect via their wireless dongle bluetooth again or use it wired the side of the mouse has a programmable 3d joystick you can swap out and 3d joysticks are awesome on a gaming mouse you can use this in games where you're flying program it to even be analog movements and inputs in game or for programs like cad and stuff the shackram also has built-in fast charging over usb-c and wireless qi charging it also features some of the brightest rgb lighting i've ever seen on a mouse and i personally really like the translucent shell it has for its design so again a heftier mouse in both sides and features and it comes in at 150 the last thing real quick i do want to mention the razer viper mini i've showed this off a few times on the channel and there's a lot of fans of the viper and viper ultimate so this a smaller lighter version of that at just 60 grams and only 40 dollars it's ambidextrous has rgb lighting and underglow uses their flexible paracord has a 3359 sensor inside and for 40 bucks it's just really hard to complain for the whole total package here i was really impressed to them release this at such an affordable price point this is gonna be great for people who prefer a smaller size but really like the viper shape so all right guys that'll wrap it up for my video on the top five gaming mice from 2020 plus a fair share of extras of course hope you all enjoyed and
