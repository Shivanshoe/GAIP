what's up guys random frank p and today we're gonna be reviewing the brand new razer black widow v3 mini hyper speed wireless mechanical keyboard could have just called it the the black widow 65 maybe because it is their brand new 65 keyboard and it's wireless so in this review we'll go through it all talk about my opinions do our sound test pros and cons all that stuff in case you're interested in picking up the new black widow v3 mini so first let's talk form factor right out of the gate because honestly given all of razer's other keyboards on the market this is going to be the main thing that kind of separates it right they have their full size they have tkl they have 60 with the huntsman mini but now stepping into the 65 game which is kind of uncharted territory because very few gaming companies offer a 65 option and it really gives consumers you know the best of a 60 and a tkl by offering a compact footprint with dedicated arrow keys and four additional keys that can double as macros and honestly that's what a lot of people want if they don't want a full-size keyboard give me the compact layout but also give me them arrow keys and here we are plus it's wireless so taking a look at it in terms of design language is very similar to the black widow lineup with the angular edges and that front lip got the glossy logo patch so more of a gamer look i'd say versus the design of something like the huntsman mini keyboards which are more you know rounded edges and have the minimal bezels to it in terms of construction we have a top aluminum plate here and the rest of the housing is plastic but that's pretty typical with these gaming keyboards but very compact no flex no creaking it's not going to budge which is good on the back side we have four rubber pads in each corner plus two different flip out feet with a six degree and a nine degree angle we also have the usb dongle door if you want to kind of store it during travel plus the always cool looking embossed font for gamers by gamers then on the back side there's your usbc port for charging or if you want you can just use it wired then the power switch to toggle between their 2.4 gigahertz hyper-speed wireless technology or connect it via bluetooth you got three connectivity options take a look at the keycaps the fonts again taking notes in the community giving us the minimal characters which is always appreciated plus the rgb shines through nice and evenly across the lettering on all the keys now like i said before with the 65 layout we get the extra keys on the right side above the arrow keys they label it as m1 through m4 so in synapse you can go in and assign them to be some secondary functions to act as a macro which i mean you always could have done anyways regardless in synapse you can reprogram any key so the fact they just have it labeled there now is m1 through m4 they can you know call it dedicated macro keys you know market it as that but it's really nothing new you could have always done that now they're just labeled but also making up for the lack of physical keys we still have the front printed secondary functions things like you know media playback brightness control switching profiles recording macros your afro all printed there for you so you can see what keys you're still accessing now to the touch they do have that slight grain to it to avoid shine over time uh with this it doesn't you know show oils and smudges from your fingerprints also kind of helps you know gain traction a little bit i've always liked that slight grain and here they are a double shot abs shine through plastic and razer flat out says in their marketing that they are thicker than most abs keycaps out there and you know are they i didn't know honestly they didn't feel too different to me but then i compared them to a set of ppt keycaps i have and construction wise you can see the inner walls of the cap they are kind of right on par with that thickness now also for keycaps when it comes to customization it's going to depend on the keycaps that you have or plan to buy i guess since the bottom row is technically non-standard if you already have a set from a full size keyboard the right side alt function and control are 1u instead of 1.25u and this is standard for a 65 layout mind you but again so you have a full-size keyboard with keycaps you bought you just want to you know do a quick swap and use them here those three keys won't fit but everything else will be fine so it's not a big deal if you do buy some full set anyways a lot of times it will include the extra 1u keycaps but just worth pointing out for you guys now in terms of switches the v3 mini doesn't go the optomechanical route unfortunately since it's wireless and they go for their traditional mechanical switches we have two types to pick from they offer razer green and razer yellow green being the audibly clicky with a tactile response yellow being linear on the quieter side and these have silicone dampeners in them as well and i don't have any loose switches so i can't take it apart and actually show you but you can kind of see through the housing where the dampeners are embedded on the left and right side of the stem so it kind of lessens the sound as the stem pops back up against the top shell these actuate at 45 grams have a total travel distance of 3.5 millimeters and actuate at 1.2 millimeters and in terms of key wobble it's very very minimal here since on each side of the stem you have those walls that helps keep the keycap you know more in place so you're going to feel less wobble to the physical touch and the stem itself blade doesn't budge either so we'll do a sound test now of these razer yellow switches and i filmed it like right as i unboxed it so it doesn't have you know these keycaps on it has the stock keycaps that you get when you buy it so do the sound test now so for a dampened and you know silent yellow switch they call it here uh to the touch it feels really good nice and smooth it there may be some audible pinging it's just because my microphone is very very close to it and i can assure you when you are typing with it that is not really audible at all especially when you're just like you know just actuating them they're very smooth very very quiet but you can't really say the same for the stabilizers they were pretty inconsistent as you saw or heard and that's because they only lubed the space bar so in previous keyboards you know they talked about how they lube stabilizers and stuff they listen to community feedback uh so we have a loop spacebar here but nothing else was lubed not the backspace enter the shift none of that so uh kind of weird because they sound like doo doo so with this being a hyper speed keyboard using their hyper speed technology inside it's the same tech they use in their gaming mice their headsets and stuff like that and they claim the connection is more reliable it's 25 faster than a traditional you know wireless connection um given their competition as well out there and there's no real way for me to test it but again they've used this in their other popular releases and i know for me you know obviously versus just a standard bluetooth connection yes that connection is much more efficient definitely faster as well and i had no problems whatsoever uh gaming with this i probably gamed i used this around 10 days straight and not once did it cut out did it double click none of that no issues so obviously that's always good to know and as a linear guy myself i didn't have any issues i like the switches they're using here they feel nice they sound pretty good and dampened overall and like i said before would i have liked to have seen optim mechanical switches yeah it's their premium switch option uh it's faster with the infrared light beam would have complemented the hypersphere technology in here but again with it being wireless that i guess has more power drain so they want the traditional route here but these are noticeably quieter so like again just i'll show you real quick that's how that sounds and here is the huntsman tkl with their linear optomechanical switches still very smooth but a lot louder here a lot louder i'm not going to bore you with software talk we've gone over it a hundred different times one interesting thing you can do with the hyper speed keyboard is connect with one dongle to other hyper speed products you already have except the viper ultimate which is weird that wouldn't connect even though that uses their hyper speed technology so if you have other compatible hyper speed products from razer you know you're keeping it on the ecosystem you can use just one dongle and have that connect to all the other products it's compatible with things like the new orochi a deathadder v2 pro the black shark headsets and stuff but again i would have liked to have seen this also be compatible with the viper ultimate because it's the same technology i guess there's just a difference with the dongle support or something like that then lastly we can talk battery it boasts up to 200 hours with no rgb on that's obviously going to lessen if you do have the rgb effects turned on and 100 brightness as well but 200 hours is still very very good i think it's set around 40 hours if you have it at like 50 brightness and stuff with some of the rgb effects uh but still it's that's pretty good for a wireless keyboard and in terms of rgb again it's the same effects the same synapse stuff we've seen i'm apparently using function control and then one through seven can't control the seven on-board lighting effects it wasn't working for me although it has worked on previous keyboards so i don't know why i couldn't get that to work but if you just want to check it out real quick again it's the their full chroma offerings and capabilities nice and bright vivid rgb lighting you can go through configure in synapse save it on board it has five on-board profiles say to the keyboard at once so it's all configurable but again nothing really new you've seen these rgb effects 7 000 times so frank what do you think about the black widow v3 mini hyper speed aka call it to black widow 65 it's interesting because i don't have any real issues with it right it does everything it's supposed to doesn't do anything wrong but what it does wrong is the price a hundred and eighty dollars god damn razor what are you doing that's insane now like i said in the beginning razer looking at the gaming space there are not a lot of gaming keyboards that currently offer a 65 option um asus has their their falchion um fnatic has their streak 65 and that's it those are the only two gaming keyboards that are offering a 65 keyboard now that's not including obviously the the custom market and stuff razer isn't competing with like novel keys there i'm talking about gaming keyboards uh the falchion was 150 i want to say which was still too expensive i said and the streak 65 i think was 110. so coming out of left field charging 180 for this razor no i get it there's not a lot of keyboards like this especially even being wireless but man that's just way too much money again i like it it does everything it's really supposed to do i don't mind the switches even though they're not optomechanical um 180 though i can't i can't go out there and say yeah buy that will this sell probably that's a premium price tag and this is not a premium keyboard it's just it's it's a few extra keys from a sixty percent you don't gotta do that to us i didn't even buy this and i'm hurting razer no so what it's gonna come down to is this do you need a wireless 65 keyboard if you do and like i said before you're in the razer ecosystem you have other compatible products with hyper speed then it's just gonna be an extra bonus on top of that but i don't know who's gonna willingly shell out almost 200 bucks for a keyboard like this that's you know not giving you the benefits of custom keyboards and stuff like that which you can get and start to really build up and customize with different switches and stuff uh for around that same price again razer you gotta check yourselves that's that's way too much so that'll wrap it up for the black widow 65. yes we're calling it that from now on hope you all enjoyed if
