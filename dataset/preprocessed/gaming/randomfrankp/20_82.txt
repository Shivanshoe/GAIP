what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 249 of room tour project the series will show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup say anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 2 49. all right i got a belly full of penny vodka let's do this thing first up is the name shot in the dark here tiniest and he's rocking those what is that like washington maybe western canada vibes because i'm loving the trees the mountains the snow-covered peaks and his wallpaper the prints above the setup those vibes forest ii displays his primary is the samsung odyssey 24 inch and the vertical one on the left side is also 24 inches but it is an acer nitro display i want you guys to comment down below your thoughts on the t-shape monitor setup i've been seeing this orientation a lot more lately and i get having a vertical monitor for like web browsing and stuff like that but let me know down below what do you use a vertical monitor for underneath the displays you can see the creative pebble speakers and also for the rest of his peripherals he has a gk61 keyboard and all white nice coil cable here some glorious pulley panda switches inside and the glorious model o wireless mouse also for audio his headset the razer nari essential gotta chill on a nice and simple wooden headphone stand always a nice addition so they're not just laying on your desktop adding more clutter then over to the right side of the desk right by that big old window for that natural lighting with nzxt h510 case in white inside an intel i5 10 400 f cpu with an id cooling sc224 xt cooler you gotta love those random ass model names 16 gigs of core serve engines rgb pro ram an asus rg strix b450f motherboard and the asu strix 1660 super for the graphics card but a nice clean build internally as well you can take a little peek under the desk great job on cable management everything held up by the ikea signal there still that's hanging down just adds to the overall you know cleanliness of the setup so really good job keeping everything nice and organized nice and tidy keep into a black and white theme as well some natural elements around with the wood the plants really liking this one next up is terence with the ultra ultra ultra wide man really wide monitor really long desk the rgb light behind it it gives me these like futuristic vibes to it i don't know what it is maybe it's just that cool looking pc or i don't know everything here pretty much adds up so for that single display it's from asus the rog strix xg49v and today i learned asus makes a 49-inch monitor got like that downtown skyscraper wallpaper for it spans really nicely and man i i love seeing cap speakers is it the kef lsx they look like straight out of iron man right down to the rest of his peripherals using coarser gaming k70 rgb with the corsair dark core rgb pro se mouse and also for audio you may have seen the apple airpods max and you can see right in front of you behind the keyboard he's using an ipad pro just to be sort of like a secondary display secondary browsing that kind of thing and now we get to check out that pc this one on the left side of the desk you don't see this too often but man with a side panel like that and a really nice looking internal build definitely want to show this one off it's the leon lee 011 mini it's the snow edition case inside amd ryzen 5 5600 x got the leon lee galahad aio that's how you say it as well 32 gigs of g skill trident z royal rgb ram on an asus strix x570e gaming motherboard and gigabyte rtx 3070 gpus from their designer lineup looks super super nice and man just a really nice looking build so with the desk setup being primarily monochromatic you know with the actual desk and the peripherals uh the really only color we're getting here is from the wallpaper and the rgb in the pc was keeping that to one color so it's like white and purplish the blue strip behind the desk i'm just really liking this and again huge window there just like a sliding glass door natural lighting checking off all the boxes here terrence next up we've got flex and he's flexed on us with those dual stacked monitors here always near and dear to my heart and i think back like i feel like most people maybe don't know but like the stacked monitors i had the stacked ultrawides back in like 2015 2016 and that's when i was kicking off my channel so near and dear to my heart but i feel like people don't even really remember me for that uh either way pulled off really nicely nice and clean as well great mounting job and i like how you can see he switches like the color of the rgb going on behind the setup to the color primarily in the wallpaper so great job matching that and for those two displays the primary is an asus tough 27 inch with the secondary one being a benq xl 27 inch and it's funny how i like the setup equally when it's turned off then when it's turned on he has just the monitor light bar on giving a nice subtle glow to the desktop in this shot looks really dramatic but really nice i want to steal that plant bro now down to the peripherals got the corsair k63 keyboard with the razer basilisk x hyper speed mouse nice extended wall desk mat here and for audio he's going with the razer kraken headset you can see the mercury colorway taking a look underneath the desk another really great job on cable management three for three so far nothing hanging down whatsoever this entire setup by the way you probably noticed by now you don't see a dedicated pc it's powered by his 2016 macbook air but you can also see for gaming he's got the xbox the ps5 which is also a flex in itself but man you know i don't have a single thing to complain about here it's all gorgeous i'm sure a lot of you love this one also now hot damn this one blends all the future sort of vibes for this aesthetic it's mixing like the cyberpunk with the vaporwave with the outrun theme i can't put my finger on it but this is killer the more you look at it the more things you notice and the more you start to drool no just me all right i'll admit it another t-shape monitor orientation here and both monitors are actually 24 inches from lg but they're both different models you can see the the silver strip on the bottom bezel on the vertical one off to the left side and man this desk layout and the way he has everything organized just also still making me drool now my pants are wet and that's not from the drool no i'm just kidding i'm not wearing pants anywho let's dive into these peripherals because i'm sure you've got questions for the keyboard it's a 40 split ortho keyboard okay so definitely not what you're used to seeing but definitely ergonomic but it takes some time to get used to and it seems like he has different switches inside if you're curious he says he has fake holy panda switches that are lubed um oko mochi switches that are also lubed and t1 switches that are also lubed so he could be using a combo of the three and four's keycaps has a mix of two sets dsa blank white and a mix of xda ice cream caps for his mouse he has the phantek helios xt3 in combo with intuos pro ctl-490 graphics tablet and then for audio the steelseries arctis 7 headset in the back you can see that sort of like rgb a lamp going on tons of rgb throughout the room i mean you've seen how crazy this thing is right seemingly next to this like i don't know it's like a station for keyboards little little pegboard and stuff some edc but check out that just custom thing like going around it the rgb the frosted rgb built into the desk underneath as well i'm getting too excited i can't properly form sentences and think of the right words to describe how cool this is but another thing i noticed before next to the setup off to the right side you could see the little google home mini that he has and instead of just like putting it on his desk he has it mounted but he has like the strip coming down to hide it and he transformed that into this futuristic industrialized look there's certain like stickers around the room it just takes things visually to the next level and it's insane this is so cool and we still got the pc to check out this case is the dlv 22 in white this is from company dark flash and inside the intel i5 8400 with an id cooling zoom flow 240 xtaio got 16 gigs of a pacer ram and an msi b360m bazooka motherboard with an msi gtx 1050 ti graphics card it's their aero itx edition so like i said before i've pretty much run out of words to properly describe this this is like a 20 rating out of 10 every day of the week so much innovation cool ideas just everything here is pulled off so so well i could have just showed you this picture for 10 minutes and it would have done justice just looking at it so really great job then last but not least going crazy minimal and simplified here is raya really liking how clean this is with a 24 inch lg monitor as the single display and check out you know we got to go with that topographic wallpaper here it's only right and some things that i really like is just the lack of clutter in general on the desktop and nice and simplified there's not even a desktop lamp he's yet again using one of those um monitor light bars up top to free up some space but you can see behind the monitor he has the speakers the logitech z120 also fitting in aesthetically with the rest of his peripherals they got the vortex series vx5 keyboards got boba switches inside some tai hao blue on white keycaps the logitech g305 mouse also in white in this setup also not powered by a dedicated gaming pc but by his asus laptop this model is the a455l inside that intel i3 505u why that sound weird 5005u 5005u with an nvidia geforce gt930 but you know the routine it doesn't matter about the specs does it matter about whether it's a gaming setup or not you know we show off all setups all nice setups that inspire me that i think will inspire you that are just in general badass looking setups this one again meets the criteria super clean super minimal
