what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out two new products from razer that are unlike their usual releases we have the brand new wireless mechanical keyboard known as the pro type as well as their ergonomic wireless mouse the pro click so these are not for your gaming setup they're designed with ergonomics in mind for more so the office space or your professional work environment so again not your gaming setup if you want to check him out or know more about it got you covered in this video so pretty interesting to see razer still touch on these peripherals but with a different audience in mind and there is a huge market for these type of products because you take a look at logitech and what they've done with their mx master series that's where the proclick is gonna fit in competing directly with that and you can tell it's a direct competitor because it's the same price coming in at a hundred dollars so for the pro click once you get it out of the box my first impression was i'm a really big fan of the simplicity here it looks really nice and clean all white you have some silver accents in the scroll wheel and around the mast itself and these sides are a rubberized grip that are more like a matte gray built in underneath is the storage door for their 2.4 gigahertz wireless dongle so you can connect with that or connect over bluetooth because you have both those options now this connects up to four devices at once for switching between your different devices from a computer a laptop your phone a tablet anything like that a real quick and easy way to navigate your workflow if this is connected to multiple devices there's a button on the back side which you just press and that will then switch the device for you so checking it out like i said a really clean ergonomic design on the right and left side you have this gray rubberized texture which is gonna be great for obviously in your hand you do have those side forward and backward buttons the scroll wheel also has the left and right tilt clicks so not only does it click in but you can click it to the left or right side and configure that to be different functions but underneath that is a dpi button for toggling between different sensitivities and the sensor inside is the razer 5g optical sensor which goes up to 16 000 dpi the switches are mechanical not like their optical switches on their gaming lineup but again this is not a gaming mouse the battery inside can last up to 400 hours so that should definitely get you throughout the work week plus some if the charge it does come with an included micro usb cable and the port is embedded right into the front unfortunately no usbc fast charging or anything so besides the great battery life the four different modes of connectivity and the eight programmable buttons the big thing and the main selling point really with a mouse like the proclick is gonna be the design and the ergonomics curvy in all the right places so your hand is naturally you know shaped to curve at a 45 degree angle like this which is how the mouse is you know meant to be used and if you think about it go like limp zombie arms real quick all right or go frankenstein mode whatever you can see when your hands are completely limp it does naturally have this curve to your hands and your thumb and that's gonna pretty much fit in perfectly with the design of the mouse that's the reason it's designs you can use this for hours and hours on end and not get fatigued or cramped and again since the main competitor is pretty much the logitech mx master 2s and the 3 that's going to have a very similar shape to this you have that vertical tilt up by your pointer finger and then it curves in so your thumb can lay down and there's really going to be no real pressure points or anything on the inside of your palm just to kind of visually show you the difference in design between the viper ultimate which is like their gaming mouse again logitech mx master 2s and then now the pro click it's very evident to see the design process that went into this but now we can check out the pro type keyboard again a full layout wireless and mechanical and the big thing with this i know it for me my first kind of impression and as a keyboard enthusiast i was really hoping this would have been like you know a 10 keyless that's just what i prefer but again for the office for the workspace people 100 need the numpad okay so i understand that with a work environment type keyboard it would be a full-size layout makes sense this is the all-white mercury colorway when you turn it on there are embedded white led lights inside the keycaps are shine through so whether it's you know on your desktop during the day or at night you'll still have that slight level of illumination through the shine through keycaps and just like the mouse you can either choose to use the integrated a wireless dongle to connect via 2.4 gigahertz or bluetooth it has them both and again up to four devices at once just that quick and easy way to navigate your workflow on multiple devices this however does have the usbc port for charging so that way if it dies you can use it wired and for battery life it's gonna differ depending on whether you have the led lights on or off so with bluetooth and the 2.4 gigahertz it goes up to 12 hours with the lights on and 84 hours without the lights so you know don't use them if you don't need them so 84 over bluetooth and then 78 hours on 2.4 gigahertz with no lights but yeah it's 20 20. i've had no issues with connectivity or anything like that there's no lag or latency and switching between the different you know connectivity modes is pretty much seamless now inside they're actually using their razer orange switch which is their tactile and silent switch variant it actuates at 45 grams travels 4.4 millimeters total and actuates at 1.9 millimeters so again in the office workspace you're not going to be really annoying people because it's not gonna be that loud and clicky response it'll be quieter but you'll still have that tactile feedback while using this and these r switches can be compared to the mainstream mechanical brown switches but also what i appreciate is razer went ahead and lubed their stabilizers which proves that again they are listening to their community this will make it so the stabilizers aren't as rattly and loud which yes if you're surrounded by people in an office they're probably going to be able to hear so good job for applying the lube razor we'll do a sound test now of the prototype with their orange switches [Applause] so all in all i think it sounded really good no real complaints on my end except for the space bar it didn't sound terrible but on the right side it had a fair bit of wobble when i was even just touching it the wire or the stabilizer wasn't like damaged or anything it was just a bit wobbly on that side another thing i wanted to point out is while you're using this with the led lights on yes it's gonna still give it that nice white clean glow overall and since the keyboard itself is you know white and silver it's gonna just make it shine even more but one little visual annoyance i noticed on some of the letters was the outline to the character it wasn't like etched properly or the ink bled i don't know but it looked kind of messy on some of them but it was slightly bugging me again it's not all characters just some just a little slight outline but the lights are still gonna be useful for those who maybe you're working from home the lights are out it's late the kids are asleep you want to see what you're typing you don't want to wake them up so the orange switches also gonna be clutch razer also went ahead and released a color matching mini mouse pad for the pro click it's ten dollars and for the rest of the prices the proclick itself is a hundred dollars again right in line with the logitech mx master release and then the pro type wireless mechanical keyboard is pretty hefty at 140 but again you know wireless mechanical it's got those that's a lot of money so take it or leave it if you will but yeah i want to hear you guys thoughts down below do you want to see me do a dedicated review and comparison with the proclick to the logitech mx master 3 which is the latest release so two ergonomic competitors not for gaming before you know productivity in the workspace want to hear your thoughts down below and also drop all the links to this stuff in the description so you can check it out but
