what's up guys i'm random frank p and as the title implies we have two massive setup upgrades today and i mean that in the literal sense these upgrades are huge uh and i have to go to home depot right now to pick one of them up we also have a pretty big giveaway going on with one of these so it's gonna be pretty long day we're up nice and early gonna run out and uh start it off so let's go all right so at home depot the first thing we're going to be picking up that i ordered is a brand new desktop as you've known for the past going on over four years now i've had the ikea carl b desktop and that's been great it's worked out just fine with the ikea hack set up you know but just naturally from me using it pretty much every single day it has that natural wear and tear a lot of scratches and stuff the desktop isn't looking really good anymore up close especially when it comes like to filming and stuff and since it's not a solid piece of wood i'm pretty sure it's just like compounded cardboard with wooden veneer on all the sides uh so over time it's you know naturally sagging as well so i am getting a brand new solid wooden desktop piece it's also a countertop i don't remember the name of the actual wood but it's really nice it looks a lot more natural has a nice live edge and stuff as well and this is solid so it's gonna be def definitely a nice upgraded piece still keeping the alex drawers and stuff and it's the same dimensions as well it's eight feet wide so it'll fit in just fine uh but yeah definitely time for a new desktop piece to kind of improve the looks of my desk setup a little bit more [Music] all right so as you can see just swapped with the new desk and man that is a nice nice piece of natural wood uh that's the main thing was having an actual piece of solid wood versus the flimsier ikea carlby this will not sag ideally but i also picked up this wood polishing conditioner again to the actual wood you're going to want to treat it right you know what i'm saying this is going to give it a nice shine and really kind of accentuate as well some of these wooden accents and like a buffing pad so i want to give this a nice probably two coats let it dry for a bit so you could really make this thing shine all right in between coats right now and i am just admiring it i don't know what it is but a nice natural wooden desk but it just looks so good like this now like i said before it has that live edge which is what you see here in the front which pretty much means it's just not a straight cut it's that more natural look with it kind of being all like rugged and stuff like that or rigid whatever the proper word for it is but i'm still deciding if i want to do like what i did with the ikea desk and that is drill a hole in the middle to route my peripheral cables or just now the keyboard cable since the mouse that i use is wireless do i do that to this nice desktop or do i just have one cable from the keyboard and deal with it let me know down below because i'm pretty torn all right starting to look nice and while that dries it is definitely time for some coffee and i gotta say thank you to trade coffee for sponsoring this video

here man okay so while the desk dries and stuff right now it has arrived the 82-inch qled samsung tv that is 8k all right this is not only going to be a massive upgrade from my current 65-inch lg 4k tv um well it is it is going to be a massive upgrade i don't know where i was going with that but a near a 17-inch upgrade from 65 to 82 let alone the jump of 4k to 8k now can i take advantage of that right now no i'm pretty sure like digital cable and stuff is still 1080p uh most console gaming is 4k but it's the idea of future proofing and being ready for ak when it comes and just the fact that it is a massive upgrade so i'm pumped to set this up we're gonna do that and as i've been alluding to and i mentioned before you saw the thing on twitter last week samsung is 100 down to just give one of these away it was their idea they reached out and i was like yeah i'm sure the audience would love that again it's a bit overkill can you actually take advantage of one of these and if do you need these in your your room or your house or whatever that's up to you guys but we're gonna be doing a giveaway let me set it up and we'll talk about that more in a minute [Music] wow okay so i don't know if you guys could really tell from this angle but even though it's just a 17 inch upgrade this thing is huge and it makes sense you know it's 82 inches now i gotta say this was not easy to fully set up on the box it recommends four people to lift this because you don't want to damage it at all and that makes sense obviously it is 112 pounds which doesn't sound like much but when it's spread out on a massive 82 inch you know surface area and it's super thin the weight distribution makes it impossible to do by yourself so you're gonna have to have at least one other person help you set this up i had to get my neighbor to help me it is definitely heavy definitely massive and then everything actually goes this is the next step into the one connect this is pretty much like the main hub for everything nothing gets plugged into the tv so your cable your hdmi the power it all goes to this and then one sort of wire pretty much goes into the tv connecting this to it and then you're good to go but man i'm out of breath i'm telling you that thing was heavy so now again i finished setting that up and i am really pumped to see you know the the upscaling to 8k and getting some gaming going on so naturally while i wait for the xbox to update um i am still just blown away at how massive this is i know it sounds stupid but like 82 inches is a lot bigger than i thought it would be and to the point where i probably should update my entertainment center i got that a while ago too and it was very cheap off of amazon and also cheaply made so it's probably in my best interest to get a better quality entertainment center so this doesn't collapse in the middle of the night uh so that'll be a different project for a different day but i can't wait to get gaming on this because it's just crazy i don't know what sort of technology it is but the upscaling even just for like the main menu and like the videos and stuff is incredible all right so now the moment you've all been waiting for like i've said we are giving away one of these tvs samsung floated the idea around and there's really nothing crazy you guys got to do just you know give this video a thumbs up make sure you're subscribed to the channel obviously and follow me on twitter that's like one of the main things so i can pick it because that's where i'm going to be pretty much hosting it and you know doing everything is going to be through twitter just easier to manage that way so check the giveaway link down below and yeah i'll do it once this video gets 10 000 likes so if you could take advantage of a massive 8k tv if you could fit this in your house in your room well one of these is up for grabs just finished up some red dead for a bit it looks amazing upscaled to 8k makes you want to go back and play like a ton of games but yeah good luck to everybody who enters i now have to clean up all this styrofoam from the tv packaging as well as this huge box so that'll be fun for the rest of the night but uh yeah like i said good luck to everybody who enters and i am just still loving this desk what a day massive new tv massive new wooden desk i do also want to get one of those white led light strips and just line the back of the desk so that you know when i power on the pc it kind of glows and shines in the background and stuff ah what a day what a day i'm hungry it's getting late so uh i'm gonna go eat do you want a free tv nah she just wants belly rubs tell them what's up are they all back oh yeah they're all running over here now let's see if you can see in the backyard all right a lot of deer back there are you good you're protecting the house huh all right so it's like eight o'clock now it's still super bright and sunny i'm loving these longer days but yeah that's gonna wrap
