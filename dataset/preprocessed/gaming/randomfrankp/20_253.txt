what's up guys I'm random Frank P and welcome to my gaming setup and studio tour for 2020 alright so it's a new year a new decade and I figured it's time for a new setup video to show you what powers a channel behind the scenes and in terms of layout not too much has changed but a lot of the gear and hardware has so that's why I figured you know a new video over 2020 would be necessary you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out if you're interested and like we usually do well make it like a hybrid of a vlog style and some fancy b-roll but let's hop in and check it all out okay so for this video we'll go half the log style like I said and we'll break it up into three portions pretty much so the main filming setup which you see right here which also includes the secondary sort of death setup station that is more so evolved into a set over the last year this is the main thing that I focused on for 2019 and if you look at last year's video this has changed a lot so this will all be part 1 part 2 will be the goods and we'll get then into the primary death setup and my main workstation and then to end the video we will talk about the more so entertainment center and entertainment space that is also pretty much just used for a set I rarely hang out over here it's mainly for us when I'm filming stuff for you know reviews and b-roll stuff like that so starting off like I pretty much have had for the past few years this is the main desk base this is where you see me sitting I will have my camera right here which is the Blackmagic Ursa mini Pro 4.6 K that's what's filming my you know the a role a talking head which is also being fed into an 11-inch lilliput monitor so you can kind of see me down there hi so that's how I could see myself my mic is from Sennheiser don't remember the exact name and the actual model number for this again it's gonna be tough to remember all the model numbers on top of my head so everything you see will be listed for you down below but this has been you know the primary a role setup for filming some Falcon highlights and we'll just move over on to the secondary workstation which like I said before has mainly been a set for the past few months the main purpose of building this space has been so I can have as a secondary area to film and do things for again b-roll product reviews anything like that it's a good little space to just film it's more open than my main desk set up and it gives me that freedom and flexibility so for my desk with just a regular 48 inch matte black desk the monitor is a 27-inch Walter gear from LG it's their newer well new isn't it was released late summer but it's the ultra gear 27-inch it's 2560 by 1440 P it is their one millisecond response time 144 Hertz it is definitely one of the better gaming monitors I've tried so I got that in here for this test setup and then that is on a walnut monitor riser this is from artifacts and terms of my peripherals over here I have the razor Huntsman tournament Edition this is with their newer linear optimal achill switches next to that is the model o and as you can see I haven't kind of synced to this light blue color lighting which I think goes nicely with these red PBT key caps I have on with it and that is on my custom mousepad that I collaborated with novel keys on this is the topographic Mouse pass they're really nice custom design here these unfortunately are no longer available you guys missed out some making this a little later but yeah custom pretty much collab for that and then for audio got the Sennheiser HD 800 s these are like these have always been like a personal holy grail to me pick these up recently the headphone stand is from Grove made and then also for audio are my studio monitor speakers on each side these are from Vanna - there's a transparent one encore have a mounted on stands facing towards me and for the price they are some of the best speakers I have ever tried they are phenomenal they sound so good that's pretty much like the main peripherals here I also have the JD s labs L amp and L back for powering the HD 800s headphones and some other things I guess you probably wanna know what the PC right this is a custom build that I just did recently this was the Xbox one series X kind of mock build I did pretty much using like similar components what we did expect and I wanted to get all that and build it in this small form-factor like we would see on that it's a really unique case you know it's called the Azmi and it definitely gives off a really cool look for this minimal ITX PC so that is pretty much the main stuff here the chair is from verdaguer it's one of their trigger series there's some other things around the room over here I'm a shelf for some camera stuff lenses little Eagles shrine pretty much so they're letting me down this year got hope for a nice playoff running some custom keyboards you've seen on the channel and by the way one of the newer editions also are these aperture 120 Demark tube lights so that that gets dark it like 430 now pretty much it's harder the film down here so I have one blasted over here and as you can see it's like completely blown out which does emulate you know daylight so I could film over here and have a controlled lighting and then this one also is just shining up towards the ceiling I do want to get these get better stands and then replace these soft boxes I have over here but that will probably come in the next you know a month or so I'll start to sort of upgrade these lights and transform that but yeah that is the secondary sort of workstation and filming spot now we could talk about to the goods the primary best setup and workstation are so the main changes that I made here from what you've seen the 2019 version is I've upgraded the bottom two monitors some new peripherals and a brand new PC build so starting off with these monitors they're from LG there are 34 40 by 1440p they have adaptive sync so they can be used to enable free sync or g-sync 144 Hertz one most like in response time so there are a great altra wide monitor for gaming and once you try ultra wide monitors it's really hard to go back I've been hooked ever since so I still have them in that same you know format and layout and stuff and that overhead is just a really old Samsung I believe it was probably from 2060 at this point but since it's just an overhead monitor there's no real need to upgrade that although I have been saying it for a while maybe I will do a 49 inch so it spanned more I don't know I've been thinking about it but kind of heads into because I kind of like this orientation here I don't want that top to be too full you know I don't want to be like it's all just one giant screen you know so I just get a giant TV so for peripherals I'm still using the Corsair k95 Platinum RGB keyboard with their carry speed switches it's you know yes I built a lot of custom keyboards I've tried a lot of different ones but this for me and my workflow this works nice had those putting PPT key caps on there so the RGB light shines through gives a really unique look I just have it on white right now to match the kind of winter themed wallpaper going on you know it's winter so I got it got a snow in and stuff up here and again it's got the macros and stuff the multimedia Keys RGB light bar on the back for what it is it works out just fine for me but one of the newer upgrades has been the Razer Viper ultimate this came out I guess in October at this point and it is hands-down the best gaming wireless mouse you can find on the market its lightweight it's got crazy fast switches it's just it's completely changed the way I gain from using the g502 for how many years the viper ultimate is hands-down one of the best gaming peripherals i've ever tried it also comes with their charging dock because you could see you there right next to the PC has these magnetic Pogo pin so you can just put it on there and it'll charge your mouse for you and next to that is like my smart home device the Amazon echo spot a nice you know kind of smart clock fits it nicely with the best setup and then also for my mousepad this is the Mad Catz glide 38 and I know Mad Catz gets a bad rap because they've kind of made junk products over the years but this mousepad in you know conjunction with the Viper ultimate is insane it's just very unique sort of like a hybrid rubberized texture that with like the Mouse feet on the bottom of the mouse it glides perfectly it's like water resistant and it is just a killer combo with the mouse so definitely loved that in collaboration my peripherals there for audio with my amp and DAC using this for a while as well the grace design m9 xx and they power my headphones of choice which are open back the Sennheiser and master op HD v 8x Jubilee I've been using these in the 6 X acts for the past few years but I just love open-back headphones and also if you guys are interested in another pair of open-back headphones if you're on a budget hands down one of the best recommendations I can just give you in general is the Philips SHP 9500 for the price of I believe they're like at around $60 right now they are literally some of the best open-back headphones you can buy just in general they sound phenomenal they're definitely on par with headphones I've tried like $200 around that price range so a killer value here so those are my two go twos for headphones and then also for audio my speakers this is the can to yu5 have them mounted on each side of my monitors I don't use them too much it's more so just for like playing music and stuff I'm filming in the studio so I know when I'm sitting down you want them to be ear level ideally but I don't really use them for that if I'm here I'm using my headphones this is just for play music when I'm filming all around the setup you know that's for the chair I always forget to include this and talk about it but it's the Herman Miller embody I got this a few years ago at this point from an actual likes retailer store is if that was buying it in person it was like half off so I had to jump on that considering how much time I'm sitting here at my desk set up it whether I am you know gaming or just editing it's definitely worth the price hands down a very comfortable ergonomic chair and then we'll hop into the PC which is the main upgrade for the setup we just built this little over a month ago and I'm pretty happy with it overall the case is from fan Texas the fan facts and through evolve X it's in the silver version and it has the built-in kind of like RGB lighting on the front which gives it a really nice kind of accent glow in the background when you see in my videos I love that and it's all synced to the rest of the RGB and some of the hardware and stuff that I have in here so inside Intel I $9.99 hundred KS CPU cool castle 360 e^x cooler and as you can see I have the custom random Frankie logo there in the middle got 64 gigs of course serve engines RGB program for the motherboard I got the ASUS Maximus 11 formula motherboard and it is custom plastidip in white to you again fitting with the black and white theme I have for the hardware inside GPU is ASA Strix RT X 28 et I also customs free paint and whites well they just came out with a white version so I may replace that soon and no those are actually not RGB fans you see there are fan frames so they go on top of a fan and then again you can sync it with all the rest of the RGB lighting I think it's a really really nice piece to any gaming PC these are also from fantex it's their digital RGB fan frames so I could sync those effects to my AIO and the front of the case and it all just goes in unison a really really cool and pretty much you know it's like under 20 bucks of these fan frames so really cool addition to your PC we've also got these Sabourin rocket nano which is a super super tiny one terabyte pretty much nvme SSD but it is like an external hard drive pretty much so I know you guys can't really tell by scale right there but it is one of these smallest hard drives I've ever seen and I have all my games backed up on here so if I want to you know put them on a laptop and I just get in or I build a new PC I could just you know put that over on the new PC and I have to download the games again so it's blazing fast all on there and speaking of hard drive space and stuff underneath is the lossy to big this is 16 terabytes pretty much what I do is I backup all of my videos all of my video files and stuff onto here because you need to reference them in the future again or use those video clips again for different videos so definitely a lot of space and I will mention it for everyone asking although you probably know by now the death setup itself is like the IKEA hack so you use their Alex drawers at like the the stand you know the base of the desk and then I have their karlby desktop in walnut and it's actually a butcher's block or like a kitchen block used for countertops so I have the 98 inch version and that is being you know kind of propped up and kept up by these furniture legs I use those have them screwed into the Shore's himself so we can prop up my desktop so all together with the karlby desktop and the Alex drawers it just makes for a really cool desk that if you were to buy like completed somewhere it would probably be close like a thousand dollars but here much much cheaper if you have an IKEA buy you definitely check it out try to build it yourself and you're definitely seeing this more over the years you know this desk hack is becoming a pretty popular thing but yeah that is pretty much the main desk set up some other things like the random Frank P logo illuminated nice piece some stuff over here in the little shelving unit another new addition obviously from last year is the 1 million subscriber plaque we hit that last January so pretty much almost a year ago at this point crazy times flying and then we'll end it with the entertainment setup so a 65 inch LG 4k OLED TV I reviewed this I believe in 2018 maybe 2017 at this point yeah might have been end of 2017 but it is just super thin it's like as thin as a smartphone and with the OLED panel you know it is crazy nice in terms of color accuracy deep blacks vibrant colors the picture on here looks stunning and behind it I have an actual RGB light strip but it's addressable and it actually goes along to whatever is on your screen so this is from dream screen I've showed them off before I've used these for a while at this point but it's really cool because it's essentially extending the colors that's on your screens if you're playing a game and stuff there's explosions it will reflect that behind the TV definitely a nice addition I'm sure you guys don't care too much but the actual furniture and stuff like the coffee table but yeah I kind of have it goin to you know sort of as an aesthetic here with like that the mountain pillows and stuff the prints on the wall some of the warm lighting with the gray wall I'm gonna get a lot of questions about the actual entertainment center unfortunately it's not available on Amazon anymore last time I checked it just brought me to one of those oops couldn't find it pages so yeah I have been looking can't find it but over here like I said just for console gaming watching some YouTube maybe and primarily for filming I'm reviewing like a headset or something like that this is where all the console gaming is done it got my Nintendo switch the Xbox one ps4 some games and stuff a little shelving unit but yeah altogether you know it's a pretty chill little spot not too much going on over there primarily for filming which is kind of what everything down here is used for everything in this studio is for filming except over here you know gaming editing primary channel stuff but yeah I think that about does it alright guys so that'll wrap it up for my gaming setup and studio tour for 2020 hope you all enjoyed don't forget like I said numerous
