[Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p back in episode 255 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if you see anything you like today i'll have all the gear and hardware that's peaking your interest in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 255. now starting us off today is omar daly oh yeah hi i'm down here for a little bit trying something new out we'll see how it goes so omar daily kicking us off with the dual monitor setup here think it's looking nice and clean pretty organized overall with a nice 72-inch uplift desk you can check out underneath he also has one of those foot hammocks to kick back and chill so for those two displays they are both a 4k 27 inch 160 hertz monitor from lg obviously one horizontal one vertical off to the left side but down to his peripherals to match his desk going all white here with the logitech g915 tko lightspeed love this keyboard very underrated i feel like but also kind of pricey going also with logitech g305 lightspeed mouse and also for audio not really pictured here but he does have mentioned the astro a50 wireless gen 4 he has the base station behind the monitor so because it stays out of sight but one thing that caught my eye right away was the small four factor pc i love small form factor cases like that especially with a you know more clean and organized desktop so here looking really nice with the encase m1 inside is an amd ryzen 9 5950x 32 gigs of g-score trident z rgb ram on an asus rng crosshair 8 motherboard with a liquid devil 6900 xt gpu and it is all liquid cooled for the pc you can see part of it hanging out the back side there mounted on the actual back side of the case for the radiator so a really nice small form factor built you know but yeah omar just keeping it really chill here not a lot going on in the desktop got a plant on the desk a bigger plant off to the left side that's a tree not a plant a little rgb light shift behind the desk or behind the monitors give us some more accent glow but pretty simple here good stuff from omar now we've got jared bringing in all the luscious vegetation here with a very green setup you got all the plants all the ivy everywhere down the legs of the desk up on the shelf around some of the prints i'm surprised there's not a full-blown plant in the actual pc maybe there is probably not but either way let's check it out now for this two displays again they are both the same panel with it being an acer 27-inch 1440p monitor i'm having them both side by side like that mounted and kept up on one solo monitor bracket and of course to match all the green and vegetation throughout the room a nice leafy spanned wallpaper i do like some of the knickknacks and stuff he has throughout the room got some vinyl some prints some books just some things to fit in the overall aesthetic needs some water now down to his peripherals is a techware phantom keyboard it's their full size 104 key layout with the glorious model o wireless and the glorious extra extra large extended stealth mouse pad then for some audio stuff over on the right side of the desk you can see he has the mica rb42 bookshelf speakers as well as a moto m22 usb audio interface and not really pictured here or anywhere that i've seen but his headphones are the audio technica m40x you can see in some shots they are hanging off the side of the desk underneath where the legs are now over to the pc here we have the nzxt h710 case in all black with an intel i7 8700k cpu cooled by the be quiet dark rock pro 4 cooler be quiet dark rock pro 4. what a name got 32 gigs of g skill rip jaws v ram on an asus prime z370a motherboard and gigabyte gtx 1080 ti so for the most part you know with some of the pictures on and off uh you can't really tell because there's really no rgb inside the pc so keeping it nice and matte nice and stealth inside so a nice and clean build and again just taking a look at the general setups you have a massive l-shaped desk here probably two of these ikea desktops you know mounted side by side like that to give them a ton of space even have like a little station off on that right side if he needs to because there's just so much room you know so really liking it again you dig in the earthy tones here all wooden desktop that nice warm lighting behind the actual desk itself like an orange rgb light strip and obviously all the green all the green tones complement each other looking real real good jared now coming up next is pyri or pyree don't know how to always pronounce the names but pyride we're gonna go with has the dual monitor set up here the tetra shape orientation and we definitely have a lack of photo submitted by pyrite so i'm gonna do the best i can with what i'm giving so checking it out his main display is an acer nitro 27 inch with the left side vertical monitor being a dell 24 inch monitor happy to report the wallpaper is spanned so it's nice and cohesive across the two displays can't stress this enough you gotta spam your wallpapers people then moving on down to his peripherals of a varmilo va69 keyboard with a custom macro pad always like seeing some macro pads the mouse over on the right is an extra fi m42 with an x-ray pad equate plus mouse pad now that's definitely a pretty good peripheral layout here again good macro pad a nice customized keyboard nice mouse good mouse pad love to see it then for audio real quick since he hasn't only really seen in one photo it is a sennheiser gsp 550 headset but over to the pc again looking real nice i was eyeing it up has that nice glow and aura to it with the phanteks p400a case inside the ryzen 5 3600 gpu cpu not gpu my bad with a scythe mugen 5 rgb cooler what is a mugen 16 gigs of course of engines rgb pro ram on an msi b450 tomahawk max motherboard and the vertically mounted gpu is an asus strix gtx 1080. so white or cool blue tones in the pc to match you know the white peripherals and just those tones throughout whether it is some of the hardware and also matching the wallpaper pretty much like you take a look at some of the keycaps and stuff even on his keyboard and that's all very cohesive looks pretty good looks pretty good for sure so again a nice wooden desk this is a mix of cool and warm tones but i think it works out here not too crowded or overdone very nice pyri now we've got nasdas and we are just doing well with the names here i hope and nasdas is going for a pretty unorthodox monitor setup here we have the three but the way they're aligned you don't see too much here we have the vertical monitors being in line with the top of the primary monitor so it spans down a bit kind of looks like i'm getting like an elephant ear vibe from this one so we're going to call this the elephant monitor orientation right let's roll with it i don't know so unfortunately kind of like pyride nasdas didn't provide the best case scenario in terms of photo submissions so a lot of these had to be cropped and kind of enhanced a little bit so you could see what's going on but the main monitor is an aoc 24 inch at 144 hertz his left is an aoc 24 inch but just 75 hertz so a cheaper alternative than with the right being a benq 24 inch at 60 hertz so three different panels here moving on down to the peripherals to kind of fill in that gap underneath the main monitor are his speakers so it looks you know more cohesive in that sense with the logitech z333 he also has the equestria virtuoso rgb wireless headset and for his main setup here got a ducky one-two mini rgb keyboard with some pudding keycaps to let that light shine through nice and vividly with a razer basilisk wireless mouse now over to the pc of an nzxd h700i case this buds up right against that right monitor and inside's an intel i7 8700k cpu with an nzxd kraken x73 aio got 16 gigs of corsair vengeance rgb pro ram an asus prime z390 motherboard with a gigabyte rtx 2060 for the gpu now as you saw in some of the earlier shots this is a larger room with dual setups here this is actually shared by his girlfriend he said so he has his setup then his girlfriend's right by his side we'll take a look at it we're not going to go through it all entirely we don't got enough time today for that but this one visually you know a lot more simplified with the solo monitor rgb mouse pad got the purple you know colors glowing throughout in the pc in the peripherals in the wallpaper so you got a little glimpse at the second setup right next to the main setup from nasdaq's in the room i will say i included this setup today because it is a rather unorthodox setup with it being you know that orientation and gives it more of like a boxy look but there's just something visually missing to take it to the next level it's still a great setup don't get me wrong a great gaming room uh just something that i can't quite put my finger on regardless though it's a good setup and i'm sure 99 of the population out there would love to have this oh baby last but not least is nice setup dude and that's literally what we're all thinking right now this is a hell of a setup so much to unpack here visually but first off gorgeous photography this is goals the rgb throughout the room just enhances everything it makes it look ten times cooler but yeah your name is spot on nice setup dude so i actually first found him on instagram hit him up and here we are definitely check him out on instagram if you want to follow his setup and the evolution as well because i just i want this right now so let's check it out he's going with a 34 inch lg ultra wide for the main display here with the monitor light bar up top acting as the desktop lamp again a very very popular thing i've been seeing a ton recently and he does have a crazy lamp over on the left side of the desk uh but he also has just a bunch of rgb so just a nice you know overhead little lamp there for him now this entire setup is powered by his 2020 macbook air and you know regardless of what gaming gets done on this whether it is for gaming or productivity it doesn't matter what matters is this is one of the most badass looking setups i've seen in a while i don't care if you have an android phone hooked up to here from like 2008 i don't care what's powering it it looks killer down to his peripherals he's a royal clutch rk87 it's a tkl keyboard and his mouse is the logitech mx master for audio on each side of the monitor you can see his speakers are the donner 3-inch and he also has a steel series arctis 3 headset on the desktop as well a quick peek under the desk you can see nice and organized all kept up nice and tidy nothing on the floor and it's also a sit stand desk from flexi spot so the leg in the motor here from flexi spot gives him literal flexibility move it up and down then a little peek across the room for his entertainment setup he's a 50 inch tcl tv it's oled hooked up to the ps5 lots of little figurines and stuff over here as well to give it that more gamer vibe some prints above the wall behind it rgb behind it as well so he can be just kicking there at the really nice setup in front of him and then turn around get some console gaming done on the 50 inch but man oh man this is just one of them that you see every now and then that visually jaw dropping the way it's all just laid out is gorgeous great in terms of symmetry as well just a ton of rgb some people you know might think it's too much but no this is where it's done right because it makes it all come together more there's probably like between six to ten different rgb products going on here but it just it doesn't matter to me it looks great in the end that's all you could ask for right so nice setup dude you got a nice setup dude all right guys that'll wrap it up episode 255 of room tour project hope you enjoyed drop your comments down below did you like the
