wow [Music] [Music] all right let's see all the boxes the same yep want to double check real quick and yes okay so uh that's a lot of lights let's kick this off oh my god [Music] man oh man we've got quite the upgrade going on today what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be decking out the studio with a ton of these cola light mix rgb lights and they are going to be going all over the accent wall behind me in the studio over there you can get a shot in the secondary cam that wall back there we're gonna be decking them out in this crazy rgb canvas of an accent wall and it should be crazy just fill it with a bunch of these all synced all rgb so we have eight boxes each containing 16 and the last box has another row so two more so 16 times eight plus two if my math is correct i believe that's 130 yes i checked it beforehand i'm probably still wrong but 130 of these cola light mixes back there up on the wall this can be a crazy project let's start vlogging and let's just do it okay now is the tedious process of going through and taking every single mixed light out of the box and then i'm going to line it up so i could see the overall dimensions of how big it's gonna be on the wall now each mix panel is five by five inches so that's gonna be definitely easier when it comes to making the rectangular shape and how i'm gonna mount them on my wall is with these uh those like pegboards pretty much i picked up a few different black metallic peg boards and that's how i'm going to mount these since the lights themselves are magnetic so i won't have to be like tediously putting like sticky tape on the back of each one or drilling them or anything all i have to do is mount the pegboards and then these will just snap onto the pegboards and these are actually there's two different panels total in this massive just pile of lights so there are nine cola light mix panels themselves which are like the core panels and then the rest of them the majority of them here are the cola light mix extension lights they look identical the difference is is the core uh call light mixes have the tech inside with like the bluetooth and the wi-fi which is what it lets it connect to the app and is able to be controlled the extensions don't have that they rely on the little chips like the little like connector pieces which will give it that info and will sync it all with the colors and the effects so that's why if you look online the cola light mix core panel is a little bit more than the extension the extension is cheaper because without the core light it's useless so i'm gonna have to go through organize all of these and figure out you know how to route them all efficiently and give them all power and that's gonna be a task [Music] [Music] and no it is not going to be fun to clean up and break down all of these boxes man that's an actual garbage pile well yeah that's what it is so anyways it's been a few hours since you've seen me last this project took much longer than the time lapse might make you think and so far as you can see everything is up and running behind me sort of outlining the back area where the futon is down here in the basement studio setup i currently just have all of the extension bricks and stuff for the power just behind the couch right now and thankfully that hides it for the most part i do have it rounded then off to the left side where i have an additional like extension cord everything there is organized so nice and neat you know in terms of just the appearance when you're looking at it and then it's all synced up in their app where you can go in and change up all the effects create your own sort of stuff going on if you want just like static colors it's all in the app so definitely a pretty cool little project uh definitely took a lot of time though again just you know in the background for a nice extra dimension in the studio when i'm filming and stuff it'll look pretty cool now there are some things that do annoy me about these um mainly with the little connector pieces it's these tiny little chips especially if you're familiar with the nano light stuff how they all connect uh it's pretty much this little thing just a little little chip you connect one block to the next one the problem with this is um well there's like there's four little spots on each light form to connect so it's really only connecting one out of those four spots so with the other three it would be cool if they had like a black flush piece that did nothing but just secure the light to the next one and make it more sturdy um and also the ridges here or the sides of it again you can't really see it here in this poor lighting but the tops of the little connector pieces are like white or it's whatever the pcb material is so i went through with a sharpie and made all of the tops of the pcb piece black so it fits in with the wall better so i wish they just had a better you know way of connecting them and i wish this was i could just flush with the wall because when it is in it just sticks out a little bit i'm not with the wall but with the lights so yeah i would just wish it was more flush more seamless rather than having the piece stick out but again that's how you have to kind of pull it out just my little uh my little two cents on that but man definitely a pretty pretty cool project if i do say so myself all right so it literally just turned midnight it is 1202 right now i started this project around 3 so again with the time lapse it seemed a lot quicker but just a lot of tedious work making sure the cool light mix wall comes together and as you can see in the background there looking pretty cool my pup seems to be enjoying it as well hey luna oh luna girl hi want to say hi to everybody can i squeeze your little face how can i that was stupid all right but if you're curious about the mix lights themselves again the core panel is i believe like 45 and the extensions are only 30. so the difference there like i said before is you cannot buy just the cheaper 30 lights and expect it to work you need to have the actual core module to connect to it because the extension modules don't have any of the wireless tech inside it needs to be connected to a core for it to work and it's funny when i first reached out to them i was like i want to do my entire wall and they were on board they're like yeah sure um it's a heads up it's going to be around 500 individual lights it's going to be 19 different you know power extenders uh can you can you handle all this and stuff and i was just like ah maybe i'll do like a six foot by four foot section on the wall then as a little accent and uh i think it looks good because if it was an entire wall yeah it would look cool but it would also be crazy and just the amount of power that would be drawing is way too much for anybody and it's just not necessary i like the way it is now and i think luna does as well then again very simple in the app to go in and just change up all the effects this rainbow one i like is pretty cool but also you can just do static colors if you want and then boom all blue if i want you can go in like i said diy make your own effects but what i like is just making it like a white color so that way when i'm filming and stuff over there if i want to have just extra glow i can do so as well so very easy to control and all together a cool little project i said that five times and uh even though it's late and i'm getting tired i still gotta clean all that crap up but just you know a cool little thing a cool little light you can use them you know on your desktop they have speakers built in so they can pulse to what you're saying and pulse to music use it as like a display thing and put like a gaming mouse up top i don't know try to think of some cool things um again the cool light mix panels definitely uh pretty cool pretty cool so guys that'll wrap it all up hope you all enjoyed if you want to check it out i'll have it listed for you in the description down below if you like this project give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp at last if
