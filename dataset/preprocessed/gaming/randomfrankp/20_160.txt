what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be checking out the brand new release from steelseries we have the airox 3 wireless a 66 gram wireless gaming mouse that people have probably been waiting for for a little over a year now but we got it in today got a little sneak peek at it this isn't available until november 10th so we got it early hands-on here we'll take a full look at it talk about my experience the pros and cons all that good stuff in case you're interested in picking up the airox 3 wireless so real quick i do want to point out that last month they released their rival 3 wireless mouse and i'm sure a lot of people loved that but there's still a big group of people the majority were wanting a lightweight mouse so i'm happy to see that they actually have this here right in time for the holidays now as you can see when you get it out of the box it is an ambi design with the side buttons being on the left side so not technically symmetrical and not really for lefties and then you can see with their honeycomb cut out for the shell that's how they're going to cut down a majority of the weight you can see the holes the holes are on the top of the shell the bottom of the shell and even extends upward a little bit to the left and right clicks and fans of the rival 3 which is why i brought it up before will feel right at home with this because it's pretty much you know identical in shape and size and for the size here the air rox 3 it comes in at just under 120 millimeters long 57 millimeters at the middle grip 67 millimeters at its widest point at the hips you got 37.5 millimeters tall at its highest point the front flare comes in at 13 millimeters and then up to the scroll wheel is 21.5 millimeters and for reference it's not the smallest mouse out there i kind of categorize it as on the smaller medium side and for visual reference it's a little bit shorter than the viper ultimate so for those who thought that was too big this is going to be a little bit smaller for you and lighter so the long time users of the rival 3 and now the 3 wireless are not going to have an issue transitioning to the air rox 3 whatsoever and it also managed to shed over 10 grams they have it rated at 66 grams it's around 67 on my scale but you know give a grammar to difference for different scales and stuff like that um and also it managed to do so while ditching the aaa batteries that the rival 3 needed battery is integrated here and it's rated for up to 200 hours which is definitely one of the best in this you know class for the lightweight wireless mouse market and with the embedded usb-c port it actually has fast charging you can get 40-plus hours in just a 15-minute charge that is gonna give steel series a huge boost in a lot of people's books because people have been asking to have usb-c on mice for a while and now that it does and the fact that it also has fast charging is just a big thumbs up now that is 200 connected via bluetooth but if you were to connect this over the 2.4 gigahertz connection which we'll talk about you're expected to get around 80 hours with their default lighting so you could still have the lighting mode on and still get 80 plus hours then flipping it over on the bottom like i said before some of the cutouts underneath and there's a switch for connecting this via two different options you have the option to connect it over bluetooth which is great if you just wanna you know have it with your notebook real quick while you're out your mac anything like that or the 2.4 gigahertz connection which with the included usbc dongle lets you you know pair this seamlessly to your pc with their quantum 2.0 wireless technology now i like the fact that the dongle itself is usbc but i did have a slight issue with my case uh i know my my fantasy valve x just has that little lip in the front where most of the i o is covered so i couldn't connect it in the front i o had to put it in the back that's probably not going to be a big deal for most people unless you have this case so just make sure your motherboard also has usb-c so you can just plug it in back there also included inside the box they do include a usbc cable for charging obviously and the cable itself is actually very nice and flexible they call it the super mesh it's nice and lightweight and it is i would say you know paracord equivalent there's no drag no resistance or anything so it's definitely you know happy to see that as well also underneath they're using the same sensor from the rival 3 wireless it's the true move air optical sensor it was up to 18 000 cpi which means you can move your mouse in 18 000 increments just in one inch on your monitor i usually play around 500 dpi so i won't be touching that anytime soon then also underneath we have their ptfe glide skates now these are technically yes ptfe but they're not 100 virgin ptfe which would explain why they're black and not white uh they're not as smooth as most hyper glide equivalent skates out there but just tested them on my different mouse pads they were a lot smoother than i expected which is good probably due to the fact that they are round you know on each of the corner of the mouse so that roundness is going to give it just that even even stability when you're you know gaming and swiping and stuff so it's a lot smoother than i expected but again would have loved some 100 virgin ptfe here and for all the lovers of rgb out there yes it returns here you have three zones of their prism rgb lighting you get a strip around the back side of the mouse and the entire underneath of the mouse shines through as well you can see there's five different leds all configurable you can change it up in the software and when you're actually using the mouse and moving it around the rgb cuts out to again help save some battery but that can be changed if you want to you know in the software if you don't want it like that but no obviously it's going to eat up some more battery now even though the cutout is in the shell one comment i always see in the comment section is about you know durability what happens if you get sweaty palms is it going to fry the pcb and actually the air rocks 3 is the first ever gaming mouse that's an ip54 rating that means it's water resistant it's protective of dust oils dirt all that so you're not going to worry about anything getting in here and frying your mouse then before we move on we'll do a sound test of the brand new switches inside they're actually an upgrade from the rival 3 wireless those are rated for 60 million clicks these are 80 million so we'll do a sound test you can hear that tactility so as you heard nice and tactile clicks very satisfying and in terms of like a squeak test or you know like a give test or anything like that um altogether it's very very solid i did find however if you just squeeze the top and bottom like this uh it doesn't squeak or give or anything but it does actually with the dpi button but no one's going to be doing this you know so since i got this in last week i've just been trying to game non-stop with it since i've used the viper ultimate since release you know having this ambi shape wasn't too tough of a transition i really like the grip at the middle of the mouse it cuts in more dramatically than i'm used to but for me that felt fine now for my grip when i'm gaming i play like a claw kind of fingertip hybrid i guess it depends on the situation a lot of sniping in battlefield so i'm not doing like you know crazy movements and stuff but the fact that it felt so you know it was quick and accurate to me it was obviously going to be very important although i will say with my grip i wish those cutouts weren't there and left and right clicks i did find my fingers you know kind of uh being on that for a bit and it wasn't the most comfortable and like i said with the viper ultimate that comes in at around 75 grams and with this being around 66 67 the weight is 100 noticeable like immediately this feels way lighter than that even though it's just a matter of you know eight grams or so but at the end of the day that's a lot i played the entire time utilizing the quantum 2.0 wireless which is with the included dongle so i did not game over bluetooth with this but again no issues no lagging it felt just great you know one to one but at the end of the day i'm just really impressed here because again i brought it up a few times but you compare this to something like the razer viper ultimate that's been one of the top selling lightweight wireless gaming mouse out there for the past year or so this comes in a little over a year later but it's cheaper it's lighter and it's a little bit smaller so just for reference that was 150 when it launched this comes in at a hundred dollars so i'm really liking what they did because you have the rival 3 wireless which is you know a trusted mouse out there the trusted sensor and people love that but now you're shedding the weight you're cutting down and i think a lot of people are going to start to not jump ship but transition to the lightweight gaming market because it's just become it's it's the thing now so i'm happy to see steelseries embrace that push this out right in time for the holidays and like i said uh it's coming out november 10th so we have this sneak peek today for you so you have to wait you know a little over a week if you want to maybe save some more money pick it up then but yeah i think they're doing a really really great job with the air ox 3 wireless the one thing that i could possibly say that i would change is like i said i wish it didn't really have those cutouts on left and right clicks just because with my grip i found myself sort of my fingertips were sliding back a little bit and they would be on the cutouts it wasn't too comfortable but it's not a deal breaker by any means all right guys that'll wrap it up for our first look
