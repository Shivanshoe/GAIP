what's up guys I'm random Frank P really pumped to see more of these new small form-factor PC cases coming out and today we're gonna be reviewing the brand-new fractal era ITX so with the era ITX it's a 16 litre chassis does a really good job of blending I'd say minimal and classy in a small form-factor PC case they are available in five different colors this one in particular is the titanium gray in walnut oh yes that top panel is actually a removable walnut accented piece that magnetically attaches to the frame and adds a bit of extra eye candy and something you don't really see on a PC more on this in a minute though in terms of size the air ITX comes in at 310 millimeters tall 166 millimeters wide and 325 millimeters long and I can say right now it's definitely smaller than it appears on camera because when I first unboxed it it was just much much smaller than I thought from seeing the initial press images but in terms of getting into the actual build we don't have any thumb screws for the aluminum side panels which is always nice to see they're kept into place by these push to lock pins which makes them really easy to remove but also so it stays secure when it's put back into place both of these side panels do have these staggered cutouts or heat dissipation they're angled sort of near the backside of the case with an eternal dust filter and for the bottom of the case we do have these side vents but no actual bottom of the case exhaust or intake which is why they have it sitting straight on the desk surface instead of you know propped up an interest so with feet you can also see the subtle curve either top of the case where it's designed to kind of you know bow outward which is just to help the heat kind of expel their out and around that top panel with that little gap in between so it just vents out and like I mentioned before the top panel is magnetic moving that reveals a dust filter that is also magnetic but inside the box is an additional secondary top panel which is mesh that just pops right on as well this is going to be more favoring for you know better thermals and then what's both removed you have access for mounting radiator we will be testing thermals for each of the side panels coming up in a bit but for the walnut finish this is actually a composite core with walnut veneer on all sides and this is so versus regular wood overtime and humidity and temperature this won't warp like usual would so back into the build process before you start you actually have to remove the front SSD drive bracket and the PSU bracket on the top right which are held on by 12 screws in total the SSD bracket can hold up to two SSDs and the power supply bracket actually does have a mounting slot for a three and a half inch drive but you can also hold two more SSDs in there as well I'm gonna be removing both the SSD and three and a half inch drive completely from the build because I'm just using two nvm ease but that's just me but both do need to be removed before building now one of the more interesting features to a small form-factor case like this is its power supply compatibility it supports ATX s FX L and s FX power supplies inside I'm gonna be using SF 600 from Corsair which is modular and oddly two of my PSU screws that came with the case weren't threaded the top mounted PSU does include an internal rounded power cable and in addition to your usual i/o cables we have support for USB C but my motherboard does not return the favour' unfortunately speaking of which in addition to that we have an illuminated power button two USB 3.0 s and a headphone jack all in the front then once you're done building and everything is installed we can talk compatibility and size limits some of the more important stuff which depending on your hardware can either be a good or a bad thing because it's not all picture perfect even when meeting their limitations you can see here we have a decently sized graphics card with the gigabyte GTX 10 80 TI and up top mounted it's a 240 millimeter AIO something you don't usually see in an ITX case so for the GPU you can fit a two slot card up to 295 millimeters in length and 47 millimeters tall max but you can see on the right side where our power supply cables are coming down it does press up a bit against the top of the GPU so you're gonna have to try to route them and bend them behind the backside if possible it is definitely a tight fit so those cables might be giving you some grief you might be saying we'll just move the power supply up a bit but you can't really because even living it up one slot to the next screw had the actual power cable jammed into my fan from the a IO before the cooling compatibility you can fit like I have a 240 millimeter radiator with a max width of 125 millimeters and millimeters in height where you could do a 120 millimeter rad or 2 120 millimeter fans up top you get the idea but another slight issue I ran into was the loop from my Asus Ryu was pressing right up against the included 80 millimeter exhaust fan which was obviously slowing it down a bit so I had to really just Bend those cables out so it just touched the side of the fan and since there isn't much room as it is for these loops that are pretty stiff it just provided another obstacle but another thing I'll caution you of is on the back side make sure you have your cable management down PAP because there is virtually zero give zero space for any cables to be unruly because that back panel does lock right into the frame and as you can see we really don't have much of any clearance here so the back panel would be just completely bowing out if a cable were just lying stray so as you roll into thermals I'll go over my hardware even though it's pointless to have RGB and stuff on the inside since there's no temper glass on the sides we won't see inside but that's okay I have an Intel i7 8700 K with Asus Rio 240 a i/o 16 case of course revengeance Pro RGB Ram on an Asus B 360 I motherboard and I can go buy GT X 1080 TI which all together for you know being inside a small case like this is pretty beefy and just man that dark silver and walnut accent I think looks so good so with a small case like this obviously thermals are important something you should be aware of and I did a 10-minute stress test in firm Ark with kind of eight different results but I ran those tests five times then averaged out between those five tests for the eight results and I ran it under load and idle for both the walnut top finish and the mesh panel to see the differences between the two and as you'd expect the wooden panel is gonna you know choke it a bit more the mesh does give you the better results because there's more just room for the air to vent out but the main difference came under load because at idle the wood panel had the CPU at 31 degrees Celsius and the GPU at 26 degrees Celsius then for the mesh not too different at 30 and 23 but yes under load when the PC is fully going 100% that's where most of the the benefits are going to come from that mesh panel we saw an 8 degree difference from our CPU and a 7 degree difference for a graphics card to the Ryu 240 with those two 120 millimeter fans pushing the heat you know outward up top did seem to perform pretty well but do keep in mind these are just my results from my hardware components inside here not everyone's gonna be using the same CPU with the Ryu 240 cooler you could use a smaller one just internal fans and air cooler that kind of stuff now also for compatibility fractals said you can use two 120 millimeter fans on the bottom of the case if you have a one slot graphics card which will help obviously push more heat from the GPU outward on the side of the vents but not everybody's gonna be using a 1/8 PU the last thing you're probably all wondering about is the price and the era ITX comes in at 160 dollars MSRP which is definitely pricey possibly too pricey I know when I first saw this I was thinking all right maybe 99 dollars you know that hundred dollar price point a sweet spot for a nice-looking ITX case like this and they said 160 and I was like damn that might prevent this from taking off like it should in this new wave of the ITX craze and stuff and you know it's a great case altogether I love the end results thermals aren't too bad but as you saw there are some annoyances when building moving all those brackets and drives before you even start the build was kind of annoying the lack of clearance in the backside for cable management was a bummer some of the limitations I showed you with like the power supply cables butting right up against the GPU which was kind of pushing it down into the bottom of the case and I do really wish instead of just having this sit on the desk they would have had it propped up a bit with like feet or something like that an inch or so so we could have an additional filter on the bottom that would just also help with heat don't really say why that wasn't a thing but altogether for a hundred and sixty bucks if you want this really you know minimal classy looking small form-factor case that has a pretty small footprint on your desktop gonna cost you a bit but yeah guys that'll wrap it up for my review I just punched it I'll wrap it off my review of the fractal era ITX hope you enjoyed if you
