how you doing just take a seat right over there no no no right there's fine right there smudge just take a seat i'm chris hanson with dateline nbc what are you doing here no don't don't mind the cameras don't mind them just just talk to me just talk to me what are you doing here you're here to watch room tour project episode 233 okay okay well i have the chat logs all right here if you don't mind i'd like to no no no just just stay for a minute let me just read you the chat locks hey baby wanna watch rtp 233 let's keep it clean and minimal okay so you want to watch the clean and minimal edition of rtp what are you doing here yeah no you're free to go you're free to go no it's fine you can go watch room tour project episode 233 the clean and minimal edition first up today we have tom with a partial dual monitor setup you'll see more so in a minute but i'm really liking the black and white theme here all throughout so like i just said his primary monitor is the asus vg279q so a nice 27 inch display and underneath that he has a 13.3 inch portable monitor so with this he can hook it up and really extend the monitor real estate and get some extra tasks to run some programs down here but also since it's portable he can really move this wherever he wants or just you know take it down close it off and pretty much have a nice solo monitor setup so i like the flexibility here thor's main peripherals he has the ducky one two mini in white nice coiled cable to compliment it as well with logitech g502 light speed mouse on a titan wolf mouse pad then for audio he has the creative pebble v2 speakers and the logitech g pro x wireless headset for the pc he has an nzxd h510 elite case inside the ryzen 7 3700x cpu with the nzxt kraken x63 aio got 16 gigs of corsair vengeance rgb pro ram on an msi b550 gaming edge motherboard with an msi rtx 2070 gaming x trio gpu and it's hard to tell whether the lights on the inside are set orange or a warmer color or just the camera white balance because everything else is pretty much black and white but either way it's a nice build and also a good job on cable management as well you can see underneath the desk no cables and stuff hanging down everything kept up off the floor so tom starting us off strong really digging the overall aesthetic with the little plant there on the desk always nice to have a little succulent a little lamp off to the left side and like i said before with the addition of the portable monitor you can do whatever you want with that so you can move it wherever not even set it up so really great stuff all around next we got squeezy jibs that's a name for the history books hey don't look now check out the squeezy jibs on that one and squeezy jibs is getting real cozy here loving the real warm tungsten lighting and of course lots of plants all around so this is just i'm gonna say it probably 14 more times uh squeezy jibs has a real cozy setup now for the single monitor squeezy jibs has the aoc 24 inch and then for audio as you can see on each side of the monitor squeezy jibs has the edifier r 1280db speakers and a pair of perfectly matching hyperx cloud alpha gold edition gaming headset all right if i keep saying it it won't be funny anymore so i'm going to savor it so one last time squeezy jibs for the peripherals has the ikbc mf-87 that's a mouthful with some gmk red samurai keycaps and the corsair ironclaw rgb wireless mouse also a really nice custom wrist rest that he had made locally then peeking out behind the roses like spaghett we have the pc this is the omega xo case inside squeezy jibs has the ryzen 5 2600 cpu with an id cooling sc 214 rgb cooler on an msi b450 pro m2 v2 motherboard 16 gigs of t-force delta rgb ram and a zotac gtx 1660 graphics card so when i look at this setup all together three words immediately come to mind cozy squeezy and jibs let me tell you right now if your setup does not have some cozy squeezy jibs don't even bother submitting all right but real talk before i lose my sponsor if i haven't already from that intro uh really digging this setup i just get some really good vibes from this visually aesthetically all good stuff batting next is alex l with a crazy clean setup this is pretty much the epitome of the clean and minimal edition for this series what i like about this is this is the rare breed of just a laptop setup going real simple he's just got the essentials i'm loving the plants loving the artwork this is some real good stuff so for starters his laptop is a 2016 macbook pro but taking that a step further he has an external gpu enclosure with the razer core x chroma inside here he has a radeon rx vega 64 graphics card and he did say he's a photographer and videographer and also does some like gaming on the side so having that extra gpu performance i'm sure it's going to help out now checking out the peripherals all wireless and super clean with the apple magic keyboard 2 and the apple magic trackpad 2 plus the razer viper ultimate again just for that light side of gaming wonderful pick up the mercury edition of the viper ultimate as well and check out that talon from jurassic park pretty much i don't know if it's like a letter opener it's a sort of knife but uh looks pretty cool man looks pretty cool you bet i'm gonna google this one and then for audio i know you skipped it but you can always go back on his desktop for his speakers of the yamaha hs5s and the headphones here on the left of the bose qc35 and on the right he has the moondrop kxxs iems with a fio wireless adapter then just check out like the other corner of the room like these setups are nailing it like i love this vibe like this would be a great just set for filming like i i want this in my room so alex man i gotta hand it to you because it's not too often we get just you know laptop setups let alone that are jaw dropping like this while still being clean and minimal like this is a perfect clean and minimal setup my man then we have faruki over here who's saying did i just hear a perfect clean and minimal setup then look no more because check this out i don't know what it is okay but whenever i see a pegboard and you have some matching just wooden accents somewhere else in the setup like he has here with the speakers and the desktop it just ties the whole space together it's like a weird life hack so going the solo monitor route here for rookie has the lg 24 inch it's a 24 p8 hm i'm digging the transformer props around for audio those desktop speakers again are the edifier r 1280 db speakers and then those headphones over on the right side of the bear dynamic custom one pro also he has the audio technica ath s200 bluetooth headphones and the audio technica r70x which are the open back ones in the middle and then for the main peripherals behind it as you can see at the ducky one two keyboard which is their full size edition with the logitech g402 mouse he didn't provide specifics but for the amp and back in the back i see something from topping and then for his pc we have the nzxt h440 case which by the way they don't really make cases like that anymore that was my favorite back in the day inside the amd fx 8350 cpu with the noctua nhu14 cooler 16 gigs of hyper x3 ram on an asus aura 970 pro gaming motherboard and a gigabyte gtx 1070 g1 graphics card and then also in the same room kind of like in a section behind it as you can see a really nice looking entertainment setup just about to kick back at the big speakers nice actual entertainment center mounted tv i don't know if this is like a bedroom or some sort of just like open area because you can see the steps right there as well so again is this downstairs is that leading upstairs i don't know but what i do know is both setups your desk setup and your entertainment setup look super nice you're just nailing clean and minimal and then last but not least we have joel kerr and i hope that's a play on words of joker and this one while not your traditional clean and minimal look still got those cozy vibes but really it's just the essence of the setup where it still kind of maintains that clean feel so for the display he has an lg 27-inch it's their gl850b it's honestly one of the best gaming monitors out there given the specs for its price and that's standing on a grove made walnut riser there which looks really nice and fits in especially with the green and all the plants around and for the peripherals he actually switches up his entire kit depending on what he's doing so for example this is his gaming peripherals with the razer huntsman mini keyboard and the logitech g305 mouse then for productivity he goes the kikron k2 keyboard with the logitech mx master 3. his desk pad is the razer goliath extended chroma with the marshall mid headphones and his speakers not pictured here but on his desktop are the sony sms 1p and then for the pc we have the nzxt h510 elite case with the ryzen 5 3600x cpu and the corsair h100i rgb platinum se aio and then keeping the entire internals consistent with the black and white theme he has a gigabyte b550 vision motherboard 16 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb royal ram and a gigabyte rtx 2060 super gpu so i am loving the look of this it's really hard in today's age to make a really nice and clean black and white pc because there's just not a lot of white hardware out there and spoiler either today or tomorrow i don't know when you're seeing this video but i have a pretty similar pc update coming soon so joel i'm digging the digs man it's clean but it's still nice and cozy and it just has a life to it you can tell when you sit down here whether for gaming or productivity all the mind clutter can just go away you sit down here and relax
