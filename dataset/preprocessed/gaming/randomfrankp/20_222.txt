what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in another episode of cool tech under $50 for April the series we show off some the best tech you can buy under that price point if you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out and also shout out the last month's winners I already hit you up so you should be receiving it soon if not already so let's kick it off we got some good stuff this month first up is an mp3 player and I know you're saying that's 2020 why do we need an mp3 player this is like an iPod Nano but at the 5th of the price this 16 gigabyte mini touchscreen mp3 player is pretty cool for just around $35 the screen itself is an inch and a half but that's more than fine for just swiping along the built-in apps and I've got things like a radio ebook reader voice recorder photo and video player and of course you know playing music the design is simple as well you just have the volume controls the power button charging port headphone jack but they also include a watch strap inside the box if you want to wear this while you're out on a nice jog burning off all those extra Quarantine pounds we're gaining plus a pair of cheap earbuds and a wearable clip which I like that way you can have this clip to your shirt or your pants while you're out in the jog you leave your phone at home and I've all your music loaded up right onto here and you're good to go it even has built-in Bluetooth so if you want to connect this to wireless earbuds you can and yeah well I'm more of a Spotify guy myself again if you need a dedicated mp3 player with some extra cool features this has got your back definitely pretty cool pick up next is gonna be for anybody looking to spice up the look of your PC a little bit and know this is actually not Ram these are dummy sticks or a dummy Ram so this is the courser Vengeance RGB pro light kit it's essentially the same light module without the actual memory inside you can add to your motherboard and give it that RGB glow on the inside so if you currently have just 2/6 installed regardless of the brand or company you can add these to your PC to get that RGB flowing now they do say on Amazon you need to have their very own RAM kit already install these to work but that's literally not true you can use this with any ddr4 Ram kit that you might have you just need to have their software installed so you can control the lighting the dummy sticks come in either black or white depending on your PC or color theme you have going on it's a kid of two and again it's not actual RAM it's just a lighting kit same module just no memory inside and they're only 40 bucks a pretty cool idea from Corsair I think next up we have this wasp a wing this is a little mini cooler for your phone whether Android or iPhone a tablet or your Nintendo switch on the back of the wasp wing are these three suction cups if your phone is glass obviously it'll stick to it no problem but it also sticks to my film with any skin on it so the section here is strong on the bottom there are two buttons one for controlling the fan levels and the other for controlling the lighting modes it's a very simple setup so if your phone gets hot while gaming you stick this on the back turn it on and it'll help expel that heat and continually dissipate it while you play I know for me when I'm playing emulators on my modded switch you'll get a sneak peek at this in a minute don't you worry the switch does tend to definitely get warm this isn't gonna prevent it from ever overheating and it's only $20 it's got great reviews on Amazon I picked it up but I can definitely see why so again if you're a big mobile gamer we all know if owens tend to get hot if you want to keep it cool this will help

join honey calm slash Frank thanks and honey for sponsoring this episode picking right back up next we have some UV blocking glasses or heavily marketed as gaming glasses but obviously not with that aggressive you know gaming glasses look so for those who have following the channel for a while and now you'll know that used to always wear glasses 24/7 and then in July I got LASIK surgery and it's been great but it occurred to me in October I was getting these constant sharp tension headaches and I remembered that my glasses that I used to wear but had UV blocking built into the lenses and now I didn't have that so I found these on Amazon picked up two pairs just to show the variety but you can get these in like any color and as you can see they don't have this crazy orange tint to them like most gaming glasses do and to demo the UV blocking they also included a blue light and this little card so you can see without the lens the light kind of burns right into the card pretty easily you can see that UV light clearly but once you put the lens in front of that card it pretty much blocks out all the UV light rays that are harmful to your eyes funda was a pretty cool demo to kind of show you in real time so after just used to having this in my lenses once I was constantly you know editing after LASIK and gaming I would get those tension headaches so if I do have a long day of editing I'll put these on and it helps out greatly they're pretty cheap to only like 15 and 16 bucks depending on your color figured out show them off in case people wanted to ditch their creme dual Jabbar looking glasses or something more casual then last but definitely not least is something that is admittedly not for everybody but the payoff could be huge but it is a bit complicated so pay attention this is the RCM Lauder one it's a payload injector if you can intend a switch which lets you run custom operating systems modded games emulators custom themes and so on it's definitely powerful but like I said it's a bit complicated so the caveat here is you need to have a compatible switch with an eligible serial number you can check this online if you are eligible I'll have links down below as well and you need to be pretty tech savvy because this is not easy but it's well worth if you know what you're doing so I'm sure allowed to use solid Linus tech tips video recently where they loaded Android onto there switch but they had to do that and download it all and be tethered to their PC what the RCM loader does lets you install different firmware as remotely just with this so you don't need a PC you can do it anywhere anytime the loader also comes with an included jig on the back which helps kind of boot the switch into the recovery mode you inject the payload then hold the volume up and the power button and then the switch if done properly it will now boot into the new payload I use atmosphere on here which is already built in you can load up to six different payloads on here new the five tutorials online about how to do this again I'll have it down below and then from there you can get tons of different apps that let you change the themes download emulators to play all your old favorite games even download new switch games and tons of games for free that aren't on the switch it's pretty crazy but like I said it is complicated it took me a while to figure this out you'll need to follow multiple tutorials online and again make sure your serial number is compatible and if you're up for the challenge and you buy the RCM loader do it quick because these are selling out everywhere fast they're real hot commodity right now because of that line is tech tips video when I bought it it was $20 I just checked recently and it was 35 so yeah hop on it while you can wants to show this off for those up for a challenge and wanted to make their switch the ultimate modded console so right guys that'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under $50 for April hope you enjoyed don't forget like I said so anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out if you like this video give it a big
