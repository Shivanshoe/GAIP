some killer ones planned we'll call this hot damn edition see anything you like today i have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check out all the gear and hardware we'll kick it off now 253. this episode's sponsored by whirlwind fx and their signal rgb software which is a free rgb platform to let you control all your rgb pc hardware peripherals and even have cool reactive lighting and on-screen mirroring rgb effects during your gameplay this means no more having like five different companies rgb software on your pc just to control their hardware it can all be done through here i use it with their fx strips and it makes gaming even more immersive new games and integrations are constantly being added and it's just really cool to see a company really revolutionize the same rgb effects we've had for years and now take it to the next level with community support it really is community driven people are always creating and sharing their own effects plus they have a discord server for sharing as well if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you listed in the description down below first up we have scott c and as you can see he's got the dual gaming setup going on with the more traditional desk setup over on the left side of the room and on the right side is the racing rig always love seeing one of these and how they come together but let's check out the main desk setup first got the nice triple monitor setup going on in the whole you know tie fighter orientation and the primary display there in the middle is a 35 inch benq it's their ex3501 model and the two vertical monitors on the outside are two 27-inch dell ultra sharp models loving the darker gray wall the nice warm desktop and as you can see obviously a car enthusiast car lover got the span wallpaper the three model cars nice and symmetrical great decor and like i said just really good symmetry here taking a peek down to the peripherals we do have an apple magic keyboard and an apple magic mouse because this entire setup over here is powered by his macbook pro it's a 17-inch and he calls this portion of his setup you know the work station so not a lot of gaming going on because obviously as you saw got the whole racing sim right next to it so this the workstation but still comes together and looks really nice with the triple monitor setup but now we're gonna go check out the racing rig there is a ton of actual detail to everything he has here from fanatec and i'll just drop it all down below i'm not gonna go over every single thing so i don't know what half of it means but over on this side of the room he has a samsung 49-inch ultra wide monitor it's a crg 49-inch model really really nice and over here he has the alienware rgb keyboard with their alienware wireless mouse and for audio he has the corsair void elite rgb wireless headset this is all being powered by his alienware aurora r12 um inside the intel i9 11 900 kf their naming is always so weird got 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3080 inside but man really really nice stuff over here again it's a really great multi-purpose room you get the work done on one side you know focus over there when you're done kick back and relax get some gaming done over on the right side of the room so we're really digging this one scott they came together really well like i said symmetry on point the racing decor the whole theme you have going on 10 out of 10. next up we have alex and this is from his instagram if you want to check him out definitely do over there this is a really nice console gaming setup so no pc or anything all console based and as you can see with the decor the way it's all styled and laid out this looks beautiful you can see obviously a big playstation fan for the nods of the controllers and the sony logos really loving this believe it or not i get a lot of requests to just do like a console edition episode but i don't get nearly enough console submissions so when i saw this one saw how just awesome it looked was definitely pumped to get it on the show for you guys so alex is rocking a 32-inch phillips momentum monitor his 4k got hdr and 60 hertz and as you can see on the desktop he has the ps5 the playstation 4 pro it's the god of war limited edition and also some peripherals powering this as well that includes logitech mx master keyboard and a logitech mx master mouse and for the speakers on each side of the desk through the m-audio bx4 studio monitors i always have to reiterate yes speakers are also known as studio monitors i'm not miss speaking people google's free also for audio on the desktop is the turtle beach cell 700 gen 2 headset and for some extra rgb and stuff around the room from lifx it has their z strip and the lifx beam so we can just add some color in some more pizzazz but man like i said we don't get nearly enough console submissions and i just love how he has this all coming together all the decor all the nods to his love for sony and playstation and just gaming in general it really spices up the room a bit you know all the extra personalization and stuff around the room just really gives it some more life so really really digging this one again if you want to check them out over on instagram definitely do killer setup okay okay jd now coming in with the quadruple monitor set up loving the colors of the vibes here a nice green and purple mixture uh just reflected nicely as well by those tessellated textures on the wall there very similar to like a sound absorption panel but these with that 3d tessellated block design and as you can see it does a really good job of adding some extra flair to the room and then mixing the rgb together on those panels really really nice digging this so for those four screens the top overhead is a 32 inch lg monitor and then we have three others i'm not sure which or which i could only assume the center and the left monitor are two of the benq models he said and then on the right side i think is an alienware but i'm honestly not sure so there's an alienware 360hz panel um i would assume maybe that would be the the primary one in the center because you would want that to be 360hz but it didn't really specify um on the sizes or which model is which so we're gonna go with those are probably 24 or 27 inches on the bottom now checking out some of the gearing peripherals the steel series apex pro tkl keyboard with logitech g pro x super light mouse got it matching there with the white key caps and the white mouse so fit again with the theme and that's on an x-ray pad aqua control plus mouse pad bed for audio you've got the bear dynamic dt 880 headphones as their premium edition powered by the audient id4 mark ii audio interface and also you can see the desktop with a shirt sm7b microphone on a rode psa1 boom arm also by the way loving all the plants and ivy and stuff across the room not too sure if they're real they might be artificial but lots of variety lots of extra green thrown in to again mix the theme well match the theme mix and match you get what i'm saying going right along with the wallpaper now for that pc over on the right side of the desk this is the very popular leon lee 011 dynamic case in white and inside the intel i9 10 900k cpu with the leonleigh 360 galad aio 16 gigs of g skull trident z rgb ram an asu strix z490a motherboard an evga gtx 1080 super clock graphics card but a super clean build here for the pc loving how it matches the theme as well and with all the rgb and the fans and stuff this can completely switch it all up you know go different colors match a whole different theme of the setup if he wants that's one of the great things about rgb obviously you know first it was green purple leafy now i've got a whole sunset theme going on completely switches it up on the fly change your setup without really changing anything and that's why rgb is so popular now we've got squeezy jibs probably a familiar name we've had him on i want to say towards the end of 2020 now with the 2021 refresh still super warm and cozy got those earthy vibes and tones going on but like i said a nice 20 21 update so let's check out what's all new we do have a gigabyte 27 inch 170 hertz monitor here this is the m27q panel got one of the monitor light bars up top nice setup magic wallpaper with the leaves the jungle the theme i mean even check out the little like moss planners and stuff behind the monitor all the little things you can just add to the setup and make it feel so complete and homey and cozy at the same time ford's peripherals his main keyboard is a gmmk pro he has ks3 black switches that are lubed with gmk white on black keycaps and a custom wrist rest of course wooden to go along with some of the wooden accents throughout the setup and for his mouse got the corsair iron claw rgb wireless those speakers on each side of the monitor of the edifier are 1280db speakers in addition to his hyperx cloud alpha gold edition headset and you know a lot of times with these cozy setups we're gonna have an itx pc uh the pictures here as you can see a lot of them are kind of blurry not too sure what happened might be a shutter speed issue because he was shooting in low light but we'll forgive you squeezy jibs this is the cooler master nr200p case inside the ryzen 5 3600 cooled by the noctua nhl9a it's their chromax black low profile edition got 16 gigs of g skill rip jaws v series ram on gigabyte mini itx motherboard and an no3d rtx 2070 super graphics card so really digging the vibes here squeezy jibs i do wish we had a bit more you know detail and clarity in some of these photos because it is low light kind of makes it hard to see with some of the blur but nonetheless still happy to see your 2021 update and then last but definitely not least buckle up right now because we have cjp which stands for cyber junk project yes this setup all the decor was made custom from plastic styrofoam and cardboard piece that cost him just around a hundred dollars so transforming a triple monitor setup with tons of really cool decor and the inspiration is entirely from the rx0 unicorn gundam that is entirely what brought this setup to life he said also check this out he sent the little video along the panels behind the monitors they move outward and there's a window right behind it so you can have it open he can have it closed get the whole gamer mode going on with the the gundam unicorn or open it up get some natural lighting this is crazy impressive this yet again a perfect example of how just symmetry is so you know pleasing to us and does something in our heads where when you see something symmetrical like this the way he has the background and everything laid out it's just so much more aesthetically pleasing but let's check out the hardware i'm sure you guys are probably wanting to know we have three samsung curved 24-inch monitors and for the peripherals we have the kikron k4 with blue switches inside the mouse's logitech g900 over to the wall mounted pc we have the very popular thermaltake core p1 mini itx case inside the ryzen 7 2700x cpu with the thermaltake ring flow 240 rgb aio 16 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb ram and an asus rog strix x470i motherboard and an rtx 2080 founders edition gpu but visually when you have this core p1 case it fits the theme perfectly you know very gundam looking for sure but the setup as a whole is still just something to be in awe over and the attention to detail and just how crafty you have to be to put something like this together with in his words junk you know all the styrofoam and cardboard and plastic putting something this beautiful and detailed together with those materials is just jaw dropping and you can see for like those wall panels it's pretty much what i would assume is like those you know wall insulation foam panels it's what i used in my setup to carve and make that like faux brick wall and i assume it's that same thing and for a lot of the details i assume it's either like tape to give it that really nice clean look or he just went to work with some sharpie and made it look perfect i don't know but the fact he did all this on a budget the fact that it moves is so crazy love the use of rgb the use of colors integrated into those panels it's just ah wow truly a one-of-a-kind jaw-dropping setup here this is why i do this show the inspiration cjp is just destined for great things in life whether it's uh an architect or some sort of designer his craftiness is super unique and one of a kind and i'm sure there's millions of people out there who would pay for his services to create something like this just man i'm out of words now it's truly
