10 years ago in 2011, Sony 
released the playstation Vita   and at the time it failed miserably, but here we 
are in 2021 not only is it more relevant than ever   but the community behind it and the 
modding scene is also stronger than ever. what's up guys i'm random frankp and today we're 
gonna revisit the playstation vita and talk   about the one big reason this is still so awesome 
after all this time after everyone counted it out   even after sony discontinued it that one reason 
the mods but first why make a video on this   you're asking well after nintendo's pathetic 
announcement of the oled switch this is oled   2 by the way and steam just dropped a bomb on us 
after making a steam deck handheld are seemingly   on the rise yet again and by the way if you're 
wondering why this failed not to get you know   too far out of the subject of today's video like i 
said in 2011 you know mobile gaming was new and on   the rise everyone out a smartphone in their pocket 
um iphones were dominating the mobile market   and having this just you know gaming device 
in your pocket was just kind of redundant   second sony kind of shot themselves in the foot 
by requiring proprietary memory cards for the   vita that were just crazy expensive but no one 
wanted to shell out all that extra money just to   save your games third it was kind of gimmicky for 
being honest again mobile gaming already a thing   and sony to kind of sort of stay relevant they had 
a touch screen on the front obviously for inputs   the back was also a touch screen for additional 
inputs this had two cameras built in front and   back an internal gyroscope and at the end of the 
day you know you don't want to be doing all these   extra inputs swiping up and down on the back just 
to perform a melee move i don't want to be using   the gyroscope and the cameras to look around to 
find stuff in game a lot of it was just extra   and unnecessary stuff built into games at the 
time didn't really work out so 10 years later   circling back to the intro mods the modding 
community completely revived the vita making   this single-handedly one of the greatest handhelds 
capable of emulating all your childhood favorites   gameboy atari n64 ps1 ps2 even the power behind 
the vita is pretty damn impressive recent monitors   have been successfully porting over popular games 
like doom 3 max payne rockstar's bullies even one   of the more recent ones that's been ported over 
successfully and runs fantastic san andreas even   just some popular and really complex games in the 
playstation 2 era actually running here on the   vita imagine a ps2 in your pocket so the hardware 
the vita's packing was pretty impressive at the   time even some native vida games were gorgeous 
for the era games like killzone mercenary could   pass for the console equivalent fifa looked just 
like fifa kinda even sold us today uncharted   golden abyss was killer final fantasy 10 hd look 
stunning so it's no wonder the modders today are   sort of really starting to tap into the power the 
vita has getting your vita modded and the whole   process behind that is a story for different days 
is not a tutorial video there's plenty of those   out there on youtube already if you're curious you 
have a video yourself and you want to mod yours or   you can just go on ebay and buy one that's already 
modded my unit here has henkaku which is you know   a jailbreaking tool unless we do things like 
install adrenaline so i can play old psp games   some exclusive ps1 titles from the playstation 
store installing something like retro arc is great   for loading up roms of all your favorite game boy 
games playing pokemon on an oled screen by the way   is just awesome on here and 64 emulators 
it's honestly just a giant nostalgia trip   going through and playing games i loved as a kid 
or never got to play as a kid and it's crazy to   readily have thousands of games all in your pocket 
because game boy games are like five megabytes you   know the typical n64 game is anywhere from like 
12 to 18 megabytes so literally i have every game   boy and n64 title loaded onto here and revisiting 
it is fun as hell now yeah most modern phones can   do this stuff too and there's definitely a fair 
bit of android emulators out there but the main   thing that separates the two from you know mobile 
gaming to a via emulated device the fact you have   physical controls makes gaming 10 times better 
and not every single port or game is going to run   perfectly on here you know there's a fair bit of 
games that do have some glitches or problems just   due to the port itself not that the vita can't 
you know power and run the game successfully   more so that just the port itself is bad but 
again the fact that modding community is still   active giving us new ps2 titles always growing 
and even been releasing updated daedalus n64   versions that make it more stable and capable 
of running some n64 games had issues in the past   things like goldeneye and pokemon stadium 
for example where ports that did not run   well now are being improved so as you've seen i do 
have two models here the black one is the original   playstation vita it's the 1000 series it has you 
know a nice oled screen pretty bulky overall but   it has an aluminum construction and stuff and then 
they even released a 2000 series few years later   which ditches the oled screen unfortunately is 
lcd it's lighter it's thinner it's all plastic but   it's interesting because they still released this 
knowing that after the third week of its release   that it was dramatically underselling and what's 
even crazier than putting out a second edition   is the fact this was available in so many 
different colors and color combos but then   they kind of doubled down and released a ton of 
special edition releases alongside some certain   games it has this really cool like design or print 
on the back of the vita all very ambitious if you   think about it for a device that sony knew they 
were taking a massive l on at the time and you   may remember a few years ago i did a video on 
handhelds as a genre and i had a blue one back   then and i actually used that pretty consistently 
because one of the really cool features that the   vitas have built in is called remote play where 
you can actually play your ps3 and ps4 games   through your vita you can stream it right 
to the device or some games even let you   use the vita sort of like a smart controller where 
instead of using your dual sense or dual shock   controller you're using the vita and then on the 
screen it would do things like have your map or an   inventory so it was really kind of cool my first 
experience with that was back when i bought a ps3   off of craigslist probably in like 2012. i think 
i was actually playing killzone it was just really   cool to control my playstation from my vita and 
have all these extra things on the screen here so   thousands of games pretty much any title starting 
from like the 1980s all the way up to 2003   could be ran and emulated on the vita also 
including obviously all the psp games you can   download plus the entire vita library so should 
you buy a vita today yes hands down for everything   we talked about today for the whole modding scene 
the community behind this still the power this has   untapped seemingly since we are getting you know 
ps2 games running on these definitely a dream   device for emulators running those old game boy 
games you want to revisit play pokemon on here   n64 it's a really really great device at the 
time was under appreciated and definitely under   utilized but now the power of the community still 
growing 10 years later i want to say it launched   for 250 at the time right around that price um 
you can find these pretty you know readily on ebay   you get them imported from japan for around 
like 150 and below i believe this one was 111   imported from japan which is a steal i modded it 
myself very simple um also on ebay you can just go   and buy devices that people have already 
modded for you and the roms onto it   probably gonna be a bit more expensive if you do 
that but again if you don't want to take the time   and learn to do it yourself there are probably 
options out there where you can already buy them   modded with henkaku on it and then download 
retroarch put all your roms and games on there   it's a hell of a fun trip i'll tell you 
that and hopefully like i said with the new   you know the oled switch coming out but i think 
the steam deck is going to really sort of you   know give handhelds new life and maybe sony 
even though their focus right now is on the ps5   maybe that'll be enough to push them to give 
us a vita 2 or a new vita device handhelds   within the next few years or so that'd be cool 
alright guys that'll wrap it up for my video   on revisiting the playstation vita in 2021
