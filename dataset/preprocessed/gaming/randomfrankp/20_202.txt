it's actually pretty damn green and I like it what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today thinking let's switch it up a bit I got a fun one planned let's react to my first ever gaming set up on YouTube from nearly seven years ago I thought it'd be cool to look back and see kind of how it all started and you know where I am now alright so here we are back to July 2013 like I said nearly seven years ago coming up it's a ten minute video let's do it nice no intro music or anything look at those graphics hey youtube right now Frank P here and today I'm gonna be doing a simple little room tour slash gaming setup just to show you what a casual gaming setup looks like first off that's not really considered casual so the story behind this is that I saw a room tour from somebody else I believe his name was Ryu condo and I actually had him on room tour project seeing his setup completely inspired me to change my room and my setup and it's funny because I say this is just like my casual setup but I've got three I got the two displays over on my desk with the laptop plus the TV so you could say there was some jealousy involved with me being like oh that's a really cool setup I should do something cool with mine and make my own but then kind of play it off like it's casual yeah okay Frank because I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos lately and tons of people just post these extreme 2013 best gaming setup ever videos you look like they just have like 20 TVs in their room and all this [ __ ] hooked up and it looks extremely wonderful and you just get really jealous I'm just gonna show you what you can do with a little simple setup like I the irony is just fantastic here nope have that works for me you know so you know what to be jealous because I'm jealous of half people out there but whatever starting things right off here oh this is my little desk area right now I have it all set up for this video something easily like this yeah but since I am home from school for the summer I do have my 22 inch Emerson yeah TV over here that was my 22 inch have face book over here and Twitter over here it's 1080p LCD it's not the best TV but you know it works for colleges not and forth I haven't hiked up I think by the way it was only 720 and I was just saying 1080 to kind of like up it a little bit you know but I'm pretty sure it was just 720 whoo my 2011 I think it's yeah 2011 i5 MacBook Pro it's beautiful laptop definitely wrong with it can't complain at all hell of Mac products but um I love Mac products I said not Apple products but I love Mac products 2013 Frank they don't know much about technology yeah I have a cuppa there so I can use to play casually browsing on here going online you know eBay Craigslist that's really what I do right now to make money so they'll have a main job right now yeah so super huge is like watch my bubble mailers and scale so true story back when I was in college I was more focused obviously like on my studies and stuff I didn't have even like a part-time job or anything going on and during the summer and sometimes up at school I I took craigslist and ebay as like a part-time job so I would go on Craigslist primarily with video games I would buy games and like consoles and stuff that people were just selling for like really cheap just to get rid of so they can get some cash quick and then I would usually just resell it on eBay it started off me making like you know each transaction I'd get like $10 out of it which you know when you when you're unemployed and you're living at home for the summer you know during college a quick 10 bucks you know that's a little type of tank of gas you know it helped it worked out but it started off you know small just getting a quick 10 bucks to you know flipping more things and more things eventually I was getting up to like a few hundred dollars per flip sometimes even $1,000 flip just from me buying and then reselling but yeah video games and consoles I would definitely buy a lodge because people were trying to get rid of him for cheap and then I would take advantage of that play the games sell them or if it's a really good deal like I remember like right after the ps4 came out I got it for dirt cheap with a bunch of games because this girl bought up her boyfriend and they broke up like a week later after like it was she got it for him for his birthday they broke up like a week later and she took him back and was selling out on Craigslist for dirt cheap I drove like an hour paid I forgot what it was at the time but it was more than 50% off including some of the games and I was like this is great and I kept that ps4 and it's still the one that I have now a really really shitty 2003 maybe yeah thousand three it's a Dell it's still running Windows XP it's a piece of [ __ ] I don't want it in my room but I have to because my little brother doesn't have a laptop or something like that about it certainly room with Internet because it's not wireless so my brother and I hate it it's massive it's slow it's a waste out of its garbage but I have it here I haven't set up just for this it's usually not like this alright that's who's the owner my bad if I'm not using it yeah I never had this figured I have it on display no over here is a Google Nexus 10 I love this yeah five of the white iPhone 5 I didn't want to get an iPad the Nexus tablets were very very underrated I loved that thing did a lot of like drawing and sketching on and stuff figured why not get a something different and go with a Android product and I don't regret it it's beautiful it's a great screen that's me yeah that's uh over here is my bamboo splash tablets that was cool too it is for like you hook it up to your MacBook or whatever you're using your PC and you it's like a drawing pad and it goes right to your laptop or whatever it's you know I used to draw a lot back in the day I got a really great deal on it off Amazon so I figured why not pick it up it was definitely worth it this is my little up over here I get to the good my men mainly it's what I use for like doing work and stuff three minutes in about showing the papers on the crappy desk but I just have us here for now like I said this used this is actually I remodeled my room like crazy this past like month or two yeah this used to be on top of here I used to have a smaller TV and then the top shelf is full of games but I recently got a new TV I'll show you that in a minute how to mount the wall but yeah so now I have little stuff on display over here you know I have my Nexus 10 box up here still my iPhone 5 box and my iPhone 4 box this is a little mmm sorry blanked out for a minute that is a little Microsoft Xbox 360 I think from Gamestop came with a gift card and I have it on display I keep money in there don't come round me up he responds you're like little blank how old was I seven years ago 2021 I sound so stupid I keep money in here don't come around me okay okay Frank DVDs my movie editing software I used to use back then and I had a PC blank CD's bunch of stuff I have immense zingers vinyl if you don't really are and the Holy Mass happens behind there for now so I don't really having to put them on the wall with if you like them nice little shout-out this is my iPhone 5 I keep it here because I don't have good reception at all so I keep it here this is where I get reception and yes if you could see it on the focus but I am running iOS 7 screen why do I have that I am baby Yap that's a real question this is like where I keep a little like odds and ends [ __ ] you know I have for my iPhone cable headsets and stuff in here that's whatever that's Mike actually my college mascots bobblehead is really creepy I know I have Morrowind oblivion on display it's got to do it up here's a lot of them a big Eagles fan I had this ball signed by David Akers a team signed this ball the entire team back in 2006 can't let's show everything from now but yeah every one for the team Ross can you kill this whole room tour I even Oh kissing on the tech little mini helmet signed by McNabb a little Westbrook action figure thingy no gaming that's what it is I think in that either here is the main thing this is my auntie manage it is a Visio 42 inch 60 Hertz LED TV it's beautiful I recently just got another great deal off eBay it's just like brand new yeah so I always had like not it wasn't like a box TV remember like when it was four by three I had a smaller I want to say maybe it was like a 34 inch TV but it was like the the bigger one and gaming on that you know was okay because I back then you know before 2013 it was fine to game on a smaller TV like that but I just feel like since TVs got bigger and more affordable high resolution 4k wasn't out yet in 2013 I don't believe so when I got this it felt like a massive upgrade like upgrading from the TV I had prior to that to this what I say 42 inch TV it literally felt more drastic than having my 82-inch 8k TV which sounds ridiculous but just the jump seven years ago it was it was crazy so when I was gaming on this it just like changed everything just having that huge screen 1080p looking great yeah I said I got it I put I guess I bought that on eBay I said again deals I used to have a smudge smaller 32 inch sharp TV that was on top of this that was though everything I do plan on getting a different a smaller entertainment center maybe you like the one that goes to here instead so it looks more Mountains I have it on the wall I do plan on getting the ps4 and the Xbox one so I just want to change things up a little bit but uh all right over here is my ps4 yeah I wish my ps3 i recently got it for The Last of Us but I get to even play it these are my position pulse headsets they are amazing that is an extra one headset brand new if anybody wants it let me know I did a little deal message me I did do a giveaway on this video I forgot about that this is a little like a and the person I gave it to I'm pretty sure he was from like Austin Texas and I remember being like oh of course of one person I give us was probably like a Cowboys fan and I wrote like Gober is on it they probably a laptop gaming desk you know I pull it up over here sit down with it have my laptop there and I'll hook up some lovin a music playing something my steam I'm a TV instead of having on the 15 inch screen but I do have this partitioned also so you know I can run a bunch of PC games and I'll just look up yeah a month this is my xbox 360 a big fan that's why I have the big Xbox 360 sign things that I guess they use that like soccer games and the sidelines yeah I don't know how I got it here it is this is the wall mount kind of kind of messy back there right now yeah it's like I said I don't want to make anything official except I'm getting different there Tama Center not sure but yeah this is my view from back here since it is adjustable the wall mount does come out it swivels it's great over there I have much like my museum which like keys and stuff they everything's layered so there's DVDs CDs and whatnot a little lamp but yeah I old bedroom what I wanted to show you guys about this yeah I really did I guess in my head I was thinking of maybe the 2014 version I don't even have my PC yet this is before I start a PC gaming so the layout I'm thinking of that I like remember most I guess was after this year because from what I remember I had that like the thing above my desk was full of games and it was by my TV I don't I guess game is hit the Lights so I can show you yeah recently I've seen a lot of videos on YouTube I am wearing those abouts right now I'm pretty sure that's light okay I've usually seen a lot of videos on YouTube about ambi and LED lighting ambient lighting we all can see feature hold on there's still light over here I gotta hit the real quick so you can see the full experience and the full experience LED lighting in DC feature for the ambient lighting I decided to go ahead get some LED strips myself and make this my own little rendition of aam being lighting okay obviously we're now playing Mass Effect I can't really place I have one hand and because I'm controlling of the other but uh yeah it's these little simple LED strips I have mounted at the back of my TV the IR blasters it's the quality even yeah I'm playing a 1080 very tight some of that has white blue green red orange turquoise pink and it's kind of hard to see the contrast isn't gonna pick up too well but uh it was it was a cool little investment so this was before like the boom of RGB lighting so I remember I just saw it on that one video from the the Ryu Kondo guy and then I was like yo I need that for my TV so when I got the TV I bought those light strips and then as these room tour started to pick up and you just saw like the boom of RGB lighting with the strip's not even in peripheral is just like the light strip so this was new to me and probably still new to the community out there I'm not saying I had any sort of influential like rise on RGB light strips obviously but it was definitely cool to pick it up early on and just be like wow this just completely changed my room because it did it looked it looks pretty cool back it was like 23 bucks does like strobing and 73 bucks now you can play you can change the speed if you want to have a seizure you're more than welcome to I'm sure this is also a different fading feature yeah but it's a little like I like putting it on blue when I'm playing Mass Effect or if I'm like playing Madden or FIFA but family that's like a neon green like it just looks white no but uh it actually is pretty damn green and I like it so it's great for I'm playing like Madden FIFA like a races it's actually pretty damn green and I like it as a whole experience that's the reason I did it a lot lately because I had a trilogy so I just put it on like red or blue depending on the scene and kind of extends the screen we'll debate there's a lot easier on the eyes and it's just cool for those long gaming sessions at night yeah that was one thing you really want to show you guys so I just figure I do a whole room tours as I went else on YouTube dozen here I'll show you I'll show you behind the TV it's just these little things like three millimeter strips I doubled them all up cuz it was I think 16 feet so I measured everything out and I got it so it aligns perfectly my TV I'll show you the remote the lights I'm real quick right here it's simple no on/off brightness all the colors it has flash the little smooth oh yeah this is my little gaming setup just to show you guys and you can have a simple thing in your room doesn't cost thousands of thousands of dollars it's not some people post and they're like oh I've been people have been asking me for months do a gaming shut up and like a room tour so here it is well no one asked me to do it I was bored something I did one if you enjoyed it if you want if you want to see more about these LED lights yes I'm pretty happy how did this guy grow to 1.5 million subscriber itself like extending it so they actually go to what's on the screen so you send any message or something comments I can even make a new video demonstrating how to do it how to set it up yeah so give me a like because I'm like [ __ ] you know I want to get more subscribers and whatnot maybe extend the channel a little bit yeah thanks for watching limit if any questions leave a comment below I already said no see you later alright man so yeah like I said 2013 and that was my first sort of gaming setup before that I just had my small TV with consoles cuz like I said I didn't have a piece yet and build a pc iguess told that year after 2014 let's go I could I can't go by oldest first it's funny because you can see all the people coming back now being like wow this is crazy to look back on but this really is the video and it I know it only has like a hundred thousand right now but for the time this video yeah okay so this one we're not going to do a reaction of this because this one's obviously more badass if you want to see a reaction to this video let me know Rob booth had the cool intro back then I had the cool intro today this is a good frame to leave it on but yeah so this is when my setup really started to evolve a little bit more actually doesn't look that different all I did was kind of clean up the cable management a little bit behind the TV and then get a PC off to the left side but yeah these setup videos is really what started the channel because I think I had like 15,000 views on that the 2013 one and I forget what network it was but one of the networks like one of the MC ends reached out and was like hey liked your video do you want to like partner and gain like money off of this so then like back then not even knowing that was possible like I didn't know you could make money from YouTube and like partner with her company I was like oh yeah sure just just to see what happened and then as I started doing more videos see the channel didn't take off until I would say 2015 into 2016 but just having this early foot in the door with doing gaming set up videos and room tours inspired off of just me being jealous from other people's room tours I think is hilarious it's just very ironic how I started off doing a casual set up tour that wasn't casual at all because I was jealous and then it turned into what you know today and what you're watching so yeah that'll wrap it up for the 2013 room tour my first ever room tour and I'll do reaction videos much but I figured because like I said somebody commented on the 2013 one recently and I think hey that would be funny to react to so yeah that'll do it if you want to see future reactions on certain videos you know let me know let me know maybe we can toss that into the mix every now and then throw into the video but on the wall look I do plan on getting the yeah alright I'm random Frank P hope you enjoyed have a good day
