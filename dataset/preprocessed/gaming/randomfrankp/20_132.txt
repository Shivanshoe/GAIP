what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out the ghost and pewdiepie a1 wireless mechanical keyboard obviously if you're a fan of the pewds you're gonna be uh probably wanting to pick this up because it's a pretty interesting collaboration with a big time youtuber and a keyboard company so if you want to check it out we'll go over it all talk about my opinions pros and cons all that stuff in case you're interested in the pewdiepie and ghost a1 so this collaboration of ghost and pewdiepie will run the floor gang a whopping 230 dollars which even still for a wireless 60 keyboard is pretty expensive but this is the a1 keyboard model versus their other k1 the difference is the build materials as this board chassis is all aluminum so it's a higher quality more solid build altogether and taking a look at it you can see all the nods depends with it having some of those nice novelty accents throughout highlighted by his signature reddish pinkish color for the modifiers with that wavy pattern as well as some cool woz keys which we'll take a closer look at in a second then also included inside the box is another box you get the bluetooth receiver for pairing this wireless keyboard to your pc if it doesn't already have bluetooth usbc cable for charging and a keycap puller however i did not receive the extra space bar that it said it included on the packaging i guess they're just for using old packaging but visually it is a nice refresher to see some personality on a keyboard in the community i think they catered to his fans well from the signature brofist logo and the escape key the default red rgb lighting when you turn on the keyboard to match the accented modifiers the branding on the front lip of the case for both ghost and pewdiepie there to my favorite addition the actual textured woz keys with the wavy pattern embossed onto the top it all just looks really nice as a total package some other things i want to point out and i mentioned it before but with this being wireless we do have a usb c port on the backside for charging or just using this wired if you choose and for those who aren't too familiar with 60 keyboards yes we all know it's smaller and no you're not really losing out on functionality unless you need the numpad so the way these 60 boards make up for the loss of physical keys is with functions on the front side of the ppt keycaps you can see all the additional rows of functions that you would still have at your disposal brightness media keys volume control arrow keys it's literally all still there for you but one physical thing you do lose out with this particular keyboard is to flip out feet underneath with this a1 model so the case by design is slightly angled a little bit but you do not have that additional flip out feet for adding height but in terms of builds you know obviously with an all cnc aluminum board like this there's not going to be no flex it's definitely hefty nice and solid so construction wise definitely all good moving on under the caps as you can see for our switches we do have cherry reds they also sell this with cherry blues and browns i recently saw guided on reds available as an option but the red switches here are going to give us that linear feel during use and the shell for these cherry switches is that crystal see-through housing which is going to allow the led light to shine through better and also to know under the space bar we do have four additional leds to illuminate that area more evenly now like i said before with all those additional functions you have they do include a user guide with it all laid out for you so that's definitely going to be your friend when it comes to learning your keyboard but saved onto the board itself with no need for additional software are 19 presets of different rgb lighting effects and if you're familiar with like ducky and keyboards like that then odds are you've seen most of these lighting effects before but you do have a lot of variety when it comes to picking whatever sort of you know effect that you like and what you want to have on your keyboard you change the effects with function tab there's also a custom mode we can go in and manually configure each individual key what color you want it to be if you want to kind of design it effect yourself which honestly is way too tedious but it is an option so technically 20 effects if you're including that custom one but also if you're not nine years old and you want to keep this a nice static color which i think is the way to go here you can change that with function and control that's going to enable the solo color you can cycle through the colors there and like i said default is red when you turn the keyboard on you can go through and pick function u and then function i is also going to control the four levels of actual brightness so real quick we'll do a sound test with the cherry red switches [Applause] so as you can hear the the board itself overall has a pretty noticeable and loud ping in terms of resonance and stuff and that's just because again of the aluminum body that is to be expected but man like two dollars in terms of manufacturing costs would have went a long way if they could have added some sort of dampening foam in here for a really really cheap price on their end it really would have made this sound a lot better now they also claim the stabilizers here are factory lubed and that's mostly true so check this out underneath the keycaps for the stabilizer keys you can see this sheen on the top of the stem so yes the stem itself is wet and that's seemingly the only part of the stabilizer here that is looped which just leads me to think that they think lubing a switch is just that in a literal sense where you just apply lube to the top of the switch i guess and again underneath you can see the actual stabilizer bar itself which is what should have lube on it it is completely dry that would also mean there is no evidence of residue of lube from inside the housing of the stabilizer which again is what should have actually have the lube on it and as you heard during the sound test like the stabilizers didn't sound too bad overall it's just interesting to see their take on lubing stabilizers it's definitely wrong we could say that but i mean thankfully for them it doesn't sound too bad so i can only imagine how good it would sound if they properly lubed the stabilizers like i said before out of that dampening foam this thing could sound a million times better if they just went that extra extra foot not even the extra mile an extra foot now for my time using it both just regular use with web browsing as well as gaming i didn't have any issues like i said it includes that bluetooth 5.0 dongle if you want to pair this to your pc that doesn't already have bluetooth capabilities or you can choose to pick up a nice fancy custom coiled cable and give this board a whole new look but i didn't have any lag or interference issues which is good but you know naturally with bluetooth it's going to suffice for 99 people out there but it's still just not as fast or as accurate compared to something like logitech's light speed or razer's hyperspeed for example you know they have their own proprietary wireless technology but here for this novelty keyboard like this bluetooth is still gonna be just fine so in terms of pros i mean for a novelty keyboard yes it looks really nice it's wireless you have the rgb you have what the viewers of pewdiepie are gonna want um for cons though 230 dollars is very very expensive and one thing i noticed on the sides mainly on the front side of the the bottom row here for the keys the ink and the printing with that wavy pattern starts to fade a bit and it's really not too noticeable but i mean when you're looking at it you can see that the ink and the wavy pattern is a lot less saturated than it is on top and yes that's probably normal in a printing process like this but it does kind of you know once i saw it i can't unsee it kind of thing and for 230 dollars i don't want to see that also with bringing up like i showed you is the lubing is done all wrong here and i still think that just a layer of dampening foam would have done this board wonders now bringing it all together my honest thoughts for you guys 230 is just way too much and i understand that pewdiepie is the biggest youtuber of all time you know over a hundred million subscribers but they're still narrowing down their potential audience to a very small percentage because of his viewers how many of them are going to willingly shell out 230 dollars for a wireless keyboard the the answer is probably a lot i don't know the numbers but they probably moved a lot of units because that's how his fan base is you know they're dedicated they love him he puts out a keyboard a nice looking novelty keyboard it probably sold well but in the end given the competition and other keyboards in the market it's just not a good value you have the ducky mecha mini which is you know aluminum keyboard as well very solid 60 it's not wireless but it's only 120 dollars der god venus a better version of the ducky mecha mini i'd say with lube stabilizers properly done as well as dampening foam only a hundred dollars so the the main selling point to the pewdiepie and ghost a1 is the fact that it has a novelty look to it you know it's very custom and unique which yes it looks good but also the fact that it's wireless that's the main advantage here it has bluetooth but just being honest real quick i think if you're buying this keyboard why would you not you know want to also pick up a nice custom coiled keyboard cable like this have it on your desktop and really complete the look overall and if i'm being honest i think this looks better than it being wireless because with a keyboard like this again into the custom market when you get these sort of accents and stuff you want to make it more custom so that's where the custom cable comes in and completes the look and even still for 230 dollars you can even get start to you know put your foot into the custom keyboard uh community get into that door hell i know for me and my custom keyboard with novel keys we put out our very own nk65 you know the random frank p one we did that was 220 dollars and i think that's a better value because you have a polycarbonate build which you know it's not as solid as aluminum obviously but polycarbonate's gonna give you that sort of nostalgic look for some people it's gonna sound better versus aluminum and also that keyboard has hot swap sockets so you could put in whatever switches you want so more flexibility there and i just i can't justify 230 for this keyboard again it probably sold very very well i'm sure they moved tons of units and yes it looks really good but there are just better keyboards out there so um i know for me i never heard of ghosts before this but now they're on my radar certainly and i'm interested to see you know where they go from here i'm sure they made a lot of money sure pews made a lot of money so i want to see their next step i know like i said i was interested in it that's why i wanted to check it out but i just can't say it's worth the total package and cost of what you're getting in the end so that'll wrap it up for my you know sort of review of the novelty ghost and pewdiepie k1 wireless mechanical keyboard hope you
