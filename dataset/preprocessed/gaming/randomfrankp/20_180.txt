what's up guys i'm random frank p and logitech has hooked us up with a brand new set of their colored gaming peripherals so logitech and most gaming companies out there you know they'll release products and peripherals headsets mice keyboards and usually either black or white however logitech is now releasing a blue variant and a lilac variant i said hook me up with that blue so we're gonna unbox them check them out do a little first look at the products and see what we got inside all right get all this out of the way and right off the bat we have the g733 in the blue color set that aside for now we'll get into the rest of it in a minute so we'll go product by product for this just to kind of see what the uh the kind of the variance is and how it looks in person for their new color options um again so black white lilac or blue and i could see already just even through the um the little cover on here this is a bright bright blue this is actually a headset that i don't know if it's new um i don't think i've checked out the g733 and man that is definitely a vibrant blue color you can see up top there's like a a tealish sort of headband just for a little bit of an accent and a color pop you know let's see left to right let's put it on check it out has a look the uh do you like the blue color and we got here the cables and i assume yes the microphone and what is this even the bluetooth dongle is blue as well get it blue bluetooth all right let's put the mic on yes okay so very blue this is like when they told me about it um i don't know what kind of blue i had in my head i guess like a darker maybe like a navy or a dark like royal blue but i did not expect a vibrant blue like this it definitely visually stands out in the wireless space i'll tell you that talking some of the specs inside we have their 40 millimeter pro g drivers when talking battery it's up to 29 hours with no rgb lighting enabled but with their default lighting you can get up to 20 hours on a single charge with this the charging port embedded is usbc so good job on that logitech built it on the left ear cup above the charging port is the on and off button you have your volume rocker and then a mic mute button and the microphone they use here is a cardioid pickup pattern in collaboration with blue for their blue voice okay just real quick a little mic test of the wireless g73 so you can get a general idea of how the mic sounds here just plugged right into my pc all wireless via light speed and i will say that layer of fabric up top of the headband uh definitely adds to the comfort overall so it's not like you know adding pressure or anything that helps take the the weight off pretty much and it is a bit on the pricey side but again it's a wireless headset it comes in at 130 dollars we'll put that here for now let's see what else we got in the box uh a picture frame high ball energy grapefruit sparkling energy water is this like i assume this is just padding right this is extra protective stuff because we also have a a seasonal throw blanket okay i assume this is just padding anyways get the rest of this out of here oh something i didn't expect not the little stress ball no let's just let's just take it all out let's just take it all out the mouse whatever that is and the keyboard this is something that oh so i i'm a big fan of the g915 this is the newer tkl version but in white oh man okay so um i haven't checked out the tkl yet i've heard good things and obviously since i like the larger original obviously it's gonna i'm going to like a tkl version as well but the white is definitely a a nice choice doubled up the stickers here so i don't think this is a part of their new colorway uh meaning you can't get this in blue or the lilac i don't think why is this so hard to open logitech with the 10 out of 10 strength stickers and oh yes logitech oh this is super clean got brown switches in here i do wish they were a red version but that's okay i'm not going to complain turn it on and i can only imagine just the rgb on here um at night time you know reflecting off of the like the silver metallic surface white keycaps i can assume the rgb is going to be really nice and vibrant it's like i said bouncing off and reflecting like i said we have the brown switches here which are gl tactile it's also available in their gl linears and gl clickies for the red and blue switches you go through 40 hours of battery life on one charge with this um thanks to light speed it's an ultra fast like one millisecond report rate to it i used a full-size version for a while and never had any issues with latency or anything like dipping out or anything it is flawless and again in 2020 especially with lightspeed you're not going to have any wireless issues you're not even going to be able to tell it's wireless pretty much i know it's not brand new or anything they have the black wireless version of this as well uh but it is 230 dollars so a bit pricey but i'm telling you this is definitely one of my favorite keyboards out there turn this off set it over here for now and now we have the g203 mouse this is a pretty popular mouse out there in the community uh mainly it's because of the at the price point it's definitely affordable open it up i need to sharpen that knife it's not not cutting through these industrial strength stickers there we go that's nice too that is also nice again something just with this teal sort of accented strip you have on the top with the dpi button and the scroll wheel as well it definitely makes it pop and stand out so if you were to turn on the rgb you know you plug it in and change the lighting here to like a matching teal color and you got some you got some real uh aesthetic going on you know the matching set of peripherals so for the g203 it has an 8000 dpi sensor inside you got six programmable buttons with the two on the left side here where the thumb is but certainly a mouse on the smaller end obviously for smaller hands and i believe this is gonna come in at forty dollars and what else i'm not really sure what this last thing is i'm going to guess a mouse pad um no okay it is oh man look at that like a chameleon that is a hell of a canteen what do they call these uh the insulated canteens not a thermos is it a thermos oh i'm thinking of a rambler never mind you get the idea but yes we do have the steel and the show hands down the white tkl version of the g915 lightspeed keyboard with they already forgot the name of this one the g733 in the blue color and the nice tiny and compact g203 light sync mouse unfortunately as again as far as i know this is sort of what we're limited to in terms of product selection so i don't believe we're going to have you know this colorway and these options available on all their peripherals you know and like the rest of their lineup for the mice and keyboards and headsets i believe just these for now but this is pretty nice looking you gotta you gotta appreciate some color in some peripherals you mainly just see black starting to see more white stuff like this a lot more companies are putting out white variants which are really nice and clean but now they got the splash of color all right logitech i see you i see you but all right that'll pretty much wrap it up for just kind of you know short little first look and unboxing at some other color peripherals now with the blue version of the g733 got the blue g203 and then the white g915 tkl on and some of these are also available in lilac like i said in addition to white and black so if you want to check it out i'll have them listed for you in the description down below i'm random frank p hope you enjoy it have a good day
