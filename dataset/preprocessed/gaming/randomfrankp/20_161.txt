what's up guys i'm random frank p and today i am very excited to reveal and give you guys a first look at our very own novel keys and random frank p nk65 keyboard i teamed up with novel keys so you guys can buy this pre-built custom keyboard that has some nods to the channel you know you see the custom mouse pad matching custom space bar the escape key and what's great is even though it's a pre-built we're giving you the option when it comes to switches you can pick from either the thickest of the clickiest with recolor jade switches which we call midnight jades as well as recolored silk switches so you're getting factory lubed linear switches so again whether you're a fan of linears and clicky and tactiles you have the best of the best right now to pick from for this keyboard so it's not going to be a dedicated review obviously because that would kind of be conflict of interest but we're going to go through take a look at it and show it off for you guys in case you're interested in picking it up so first off for the nk65 here it's the same case that you've seen with their previous releases of the nk65 entry it's a nice polycarbonate case but in this special midnight green colorway to the eye it does appear to be a more darker teal color but this is not to be confused with their bloomin colorway this is not bloomin has a standard 65 layout and for the keycaps here again since there's a pre-built these are included for you they're nice dye sub cherry ppt keycaps obviously again going to a nice white and that midnight green colored accent on the characters and also for the functions and modifiers we're going nice and minimal and you got icons instead i'm really loving the topo spacebar here i think it's really really unique and gives the whole keyboard a nice accent piece in addition to the random frank p logo escape key so you have both those there again as a nod to the channel and say you love to look at the keyboard but you're not a fan of my logo on there don't worry inside the included carrying case which this comes with to bring it with you wherever you go we do have just a regular escape key for you if you just hate my logo in me some other physical accent pieces to it is underneath the keyboard itself we have this really cool uv printed topo design as well go along with the rest of the build also in this unit i do have my logo next to the usbc port but in the final production unit that won't be there that's just from me the pcb inside here is hot swap so say you do buy this and whatever switch you choose at checkout maybe later on down the line you want to switch it out you can easily pop the switches out replace them the pcb allows for three pin and five pin switches so you're really not limited and you're getting that extra stability with the five pin support and we do have per key rgb lighting with the pcb here and since the actual case itself like i said is polycarbonate it's kind of see-through you will see some of the lights but i like to keep it a single uh static color here pretty much like that dark teal midnight green color just to accentuate the board as well you can switch it all up it's configurable in the via software very easy to use and included inside the keyboard like you saw on the rest of the nk65 boards you have that nice thick silicone dampener this one is white so underneath it'll just give the keyboard still that nice colored appearance it's not gonna interfere with the color at all that's really gonna help when it comes to you know dampening a lot of the resonance and pinging from keyboards so silicone damping pad the way to go here now one thing i do want to point out is the actual cable you've been seeing is a custom cable that i picked up from space cables so this is not the cable you will be getting with this particular keyboard they do include a white coiled one but it's the same sort of material like you saw on the nk 65 entry so you are getting usb-c cable included just not this one in particular like i said this was a custom one i got from space cables all right so bringing it back around now and talking about one of my favorite parts about this keyboard is the switches and in my opinion you're really getting the best of the best here the choice is yours whether you like the really smooth linear switches we are going with recolored novelties silk yellow switches which are factory lubed so super super smooth and we're going to call these silk emerald switches and do the recolored colorway here and for our clicky fit click switches we're going with box jades recolored we're going to call these midnight jades we'll do a sound test in a minute but these midnight shades i think are by far some of the most clicky thick switches you will feel they have a 50 gram actuation force and bottom out at 60 grams the stem and shell are a darker color most similarly match to again the midnight green color and then for those linear switches like i said the recolor novel key silk yellows they actually have 45 grams and bottom out at 63.5 grams so they're factory lube with crytox 205 grade zero the stem is white and the actual shell and housing is a transparent teal colorway so we'll do the sound test now for both of them i'll do a quick little comparison real quick and then go through and do an actual sound test for each in the keyboard all right guys so there you have it both switch sound test again the smoothest of the smooth for the linears and the thickest of the clicks for the clicky switches i'm just very happy with this i'm very pumped to get this out to you guys i think you know for a custom keyboard like this with the collaboration with novel keys it's everything i imagined plus more i love the color of the polycarbonate housing the custom keycaps i think are really really nice it's giving you the option between both switches is something that was definitely important to me so i'm really happy the final result here i think is something that is definitely definitely cool and i hope you guys enjoy it i'll drop a link for it down below this is 190 but again you are getting the complete build you don't have to do anything when you get it it comes out of the box ready to be used comes with a usbc cable comes with a carrying case and i'm just super super excited and hope you guys are too like i said it'll be listed for you in the description down below well i'm brandon frank p hope you enjoyed the custom keyboard have a good day
