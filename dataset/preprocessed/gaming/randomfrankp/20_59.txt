[Music] what's up guys i'm random frank p back with an episode of cool tech under a hundred dollars for october the series we show off some of the coolest tech you can find under that price point if you see anything you'd like to i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but to save you guys some money this episode's sponsored by karma which is an app with a chrome extension that uses tech to skin the web for coupon codes price drops all that stuff more on them in a little bit and october is a good time to always do a hundred dollars you know we usually do quote like under 50. but with the holidays coming up we got a lot of items planned so today under 100 bucks now first up all my knob heads rejoice because you know you know this is a wireless macro pad remote thing it's awesome it's from sense keys and it's called their quick remote it's wireless it's got a dial it's got buttons got an oled screen tons of profiles tons of awesome so yes the senslabs quick keys remote this is actually originally made to go along with their drawing tablets and stuff but obviously you don't need a drawing tablet to use and to take advantage of it obviously if you want to use it with like photoshop or premiere it's going to be you know really helpful and stuff for that but each of the keys can be reprogrammed to reassign to be any sort of shortcut function launch applications keystrokes mouse clicks literally anything you guys know i love these so checking it out up top is a rotary dial and stock it's great for doing things like changing your brush size in like photoshop with that button in the middle can also change what the profile is and what that dial does there's four different ones preset and there's a little light ring around it which will let you know what profile you're on below that are eight tactile keys and you'll see in the middle a little oled screen that shows you what the actual preset or function is for each of those keys or profile you're on then on the bottom is another button which will go through and cycle the five different presets so you can have you know five pretty much profile save and this will just cycle through them the software is really easy to use that's where you can go in and program this entire remote you can have different functions for certain programs you can add obviously like i said create your own you can change the orientation so you can use this you know vertical upside down left orientation right orientation and it'll adjust accordingly and it'll also tell you like the battery life and stuff remaining you could also use these wired if you please but obviously wireless is the way to go so have 40 customized shortcuts and functions right at an arm's reach for just around 85 to 90 bucks definitely good pickup if you're like me and you have an unhealthy obsession with macro pads next up if you're in the market to add some desktop speakers to your setup or just speakers in general to your room check out these edifier r128t these active bookshelf speakers are a crazy good value for under 100 bucks they punch way above their price tag first up checking it out i love this simplicity to them gets a nice wood grain finish it does come with that mesh grill but you can take it off and expose the speakers and tweeters and all that so visually you can choose to have them clothed or naked but yeah just visually digging the warmth it adds to the setup now in terms of sound quality obviously the most important thing these are crazy good again for the price the speakers feature a 4 inch driver and a 13 millimeter silk dome tweeter which is going to be delivering an extremely wide range of frequencies in the range of 75 hertz to 18 kilohertz but the great thing about these and the sound profile is you have the ability to adjust it and change it on the fly on the left speaker on the right side you have three dials one's for adjusting the volume you also have independent treble and bass knob so you can adjust that if you want to increase it decrease it you do that all right there change up how your music sounds they do get pretty loud as well definitely more than enough to fill a room and say you do adjust the bass you know all the way up to 10 it doesn't sound muddy and there's no distortion definitely a big fan of that way to sort of eq your music and to top it all off they do come with a remote if you want to adjust it quickly on the fly instead of having to reach and manually adjust it a killer killer value here now as i mentioned before this episode's sponsored by karma which is an app and a chrome extension that's constantly using tech behind the scenes to scan the web for coupon codes price drops all that stuff to save you guys some money in the end and we're gonna show this off in a little bit don't worry it's razer's brand new gaming mouse i just saved 10 off on this it's a brand new release because a lot of times you know companies don't want you to know when they have a coupon code available and apparently there was like a first day of fall sale on ebay so using karma i got 10 off a brand new mouse so on the karma site or the chrome web store you just install the karma plugin with the add to chrome button takes like three seconds now when you're shopping on your favorite sites you can track items save them create lists and get notifications via email or mobile push when that saved item comes back in stock is on sale or if there's an active coupon code and for products you want you can choose when it notifies you create lists to manage certain products and to organize categories and then when you save it it'll be tracked going forward and everything else you've saved to save you some money and speaking of which karma scans your cart for coupon codes so you don't have to manually search the web yourself it's just one click of the button and it'll do all the scanning and applying the codes for you automatically so you know you're always getting the best deal for your money this feature is just on your computer so the chrome extension is a must also you can earn money as you shop with their karma cash when you shop select sites and retailers so you're seeing a pattern here more money in your pocket so again if you're trying to save some money and who isn't i'll have the link for karma listed for you in the description down below so you can start spending less coming up next is the backbone one mobile controller and i've used a ton of different controllers out there before a bunch of the ones from razer this one hands down no pun intended is the best it is limited to just ios currently so iphone users you'll be in luck if you're an android fan i'm sorry so first things first obviously you just snap your phone in and you'll be good to go it does adjust so you can fit pretty much any iphone size you have it fits my 11 pro max no issues at all and all the buttons overall feel the control very ergonomic nice and tactile clicks as well construction wise they did it right what's also great is there's no actual battery to the controller it runs off your phone's battery which means you could just you know use this without having to worry about the controller dying it also has pass-through charging which is really cool you can charge your phone through the controller and it also has a built-in headphone jack if you want to plug in headphones but besides the controller itself they do have a shortcut button to pull up their backbone app this is like a central hub to all your mobile gaming needs it's really cool through here you can launch whatever game you have on your phone that supports controller but it's also helpful you can go in and launch xbox cloud gaming if you have game pass things like apple arcade uses with playstation remote play your sadia if you're one of those people steam link pretty much any gaming and streaming network out there you can use and stream your games with so for example i use this with xbox cloud gaming you don't have to actually download any games you don't have to have your xbox turned on you don't even have to have an xbox in your house it streams all the games directly to your phone and if you have game pass then you literally have thousands of games ready to be played right in your hand i went through played a bunch of forza booted up skate 3 for old time's sake got to play some games that i didn't even know i wanted to play like mech warrior playing steep on this was crazy again just a really awesome well-made controller no lag or latency because again it's not bluetooth it's powered directly by your phone's lightning port and it's definitely the best mobile controller i've used coming up next is a very very interesting one okay this is spotify car thing and did you know spotify actually made a dedicated device used for streaming music yeah this thing's awesome so in terms of ui and how it works does connect to your phone via bluetooth it'll then link to your spotify premium account and visually yeah it's reminiscent of like an old mp3 player you have a four inch touchscreen display you have a big dial on the right side and a button underneath and up top is four microphones and five buttons one is for muting it and the four other buttons are having presets you can set each button to be like a playlist for example so a lot of functionality you know use the dial to go through adjust the volume search through playlists or albums or just use the touchscreen to navigate it's all up to you inside the box it comes with everything you're going to need usb-c cable the 12-volt usb power adapter and three different mounting solutions so you can have it by your cd player the car event or just use the 3m adhesive to like attach it to the dashboard so sure you can just connect your phone to the bluetooth in your car and play music that way this is going to give you the extra functionality now so maybe your car is older you don't have one of those new smart displays no apple carplay nothing like that this can now be your solution for music podcasts anything it doesn't just play music it plays podcasts as well anything through spotify another cool thing about this is you know so you don't want to be distracted navigating the actual spotify car thing itself you can just say hey spotify so you can use voice commands like hey spotify play this song or hey spotify play this album so you don't have to go through siri or google they have their very own voice assistant now even though it's called you know car thing there's no telling you where you can and can't use this you can use this pretty much anywhere you're gonna have a usb connection so for me what i've been loving this with is using it around the studio yeah i can just have my phone on me control spotify through that but if i'm you know at my desk my phone's not readily right near me having this as this spotify hub to just change music cycle playlists all that is really really cool and useful so you know have this on your desktop maybe like mount it under your monitor or something for that quick and easy spotify navigation i can see this being really useful if you own your own business like you own your own cafe or coffee shop for example so you can have it like mounted on the wall the employees can go through and change the song change the music that's playing in said business i don't know uh so what's the catch what's the caveat here how come we haven't heard about it well the weird thing is this is going to eventually launch for 80 dollars they said um however if you're a spotify premium member which you need to be to sign up to get this you can get it for free which is what i did i it was like four bucks shipping but back in may i signed up and they sent it out like a month later so you can either sign up to get it for free possibly or wait till they roll it out for 80 bucks either way depending on what you pay definitely worth it spotify car thing if you could take advantage of it i think it's really really cool and then last but not least we have razer's brand new release with the razer basilisk v3 yes razer's made like 10 different versions of the basilisk lineup this v3 though has a ton of new additions so first talking shape and design yes very similar to the logitech g502 we call it that like aggressive gamer ergo design here definitely a favorite of mine but i get it might not be for everybody but all in total it has 11 programmable buttons by the way that little thumb button there on the left side can be programmed to be anything you want as well as a dpi shifter if you're sniping and you want to like you know cycle the dpi down to like 200. it uses their razer optical mouse switches a 26 000 dpi focus plus sensor i usually game at around seven to eight hundred on here you have the 100 pure ptfe feet underneath for a nice slick glide you have their lightweight flexible cable because yes it is wired unfortunately you have 11 rgb lighting zones so it's going to be nice and bright very vibrant lighting all around the mouse which looks really cool and a really cool upgrade to their scroll wheel this is the razer hyper scroll tilt wheel which not only tilts left and right but it has that like infinite scrolling feature that we saw on the g502 lineup so you can navigate from the individual scrolling clicks or have it free scroll check it out now again the basilisk isn't trying to compete with the trend of new mice out there it does tip the scales at 102 grams which is yes a bit heavier and yes it's wired but man something about this shape again having used the g502 for so many years it just feels so good and so at home so again no it's not wireless no it's not lightweight so i could see it you know not being appealing to that many people but at the same time there's just as many people who don't like the lightweight mouse trend and who could still love and appreciate a nice ergo mask like this with a ton of gaming features uh razer definitely has some pretty good upgrades here with the basilisk v3 and it comes in just at 70 dollars and guys i'll wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under a hundred dollars for october hope you all enjoyed thanksgiving the karma for sponsoring this episode if
