what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 239 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup hand movements and this week we have the special budget edition to show you some really cool setups that don't break the bank now as i always say when we do this uh these are just a lot more scaled back than usual so i don't have what they spent down to the scent on their setup but you're not going to be seeing triple monitor setups thread rippers all that just more scaled back setups use anything you'd like we'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll start it off now 239. this episode is sponsored by the corsair hs70 bluetooth headset if you're looking for a wireless gaming headset under a hundred dollars that works for it all mac pc xbox ps5 your switch your phone your mom anything they got you covered with the hs70 bluetooth it's got great sounding custom tuned 50 millimeter neodymium drivers a fully detachable noise-cancelling uni-directional microphone and stellar build quality if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below first up we have crimson cyan with almost a crimson cyan setup i'll give it to you for the rgb it looks a little bit more you know bright red and blue but we'll give it to you we'll give it to you but what i like about this is the makeshift l-shaped desk you can see for the main setup here a pretty small compact desk but then off to the right just like a one of those picnic table kind of things to more affordably replicate the l-shaped desk solo monitor is the way saving some money with a 24 and a half inch asus monitor it is 144 hertz but again if you're gonna have one making sure it is specked out like that it's a good choice and it comes in under 200 so it's still not even breaking the bank when you consider all the gaming monitors out there for the peripherals on the desktop in terms of audio and logitech z213 speakers and the audio technica ath sr6bt and those are probably one of the more expensive items in this entire setup believe it or not for the mouse and keyboard we have the techware phantom l and the redragon m601 mouse so again two very popular peripherals that are definitely under 50 bucks and then we'll check out the pc over on the right side on that sort of picnic table setup we have the rack hilaya m case and rack's a very popular company from the philippines inside of the ryzen 5 2600 cpu the deep cool gamex gtx cooler 16 gigs of hyperx fury ram on an msi b450m motherboard and a gigabyte gtx 1660 ti graphics card i like the little bust of the stormtrooper there is like a little you know accent piece on the inside as well so all things considered you know you take a look at this aesthetically it's a very nice looking setup good matching wallpaper for the color choice you know going with the the red and the blue rgb so all matching there a nice clean appearance overall i'd say definitely a good example of putting this all together and showing what you can do without breaking the bank i wonder how many times gonna use that phrase today next up we have sam897 with a very interesting layout here i like this everything is powered by his laptop which he sits in front of and he also has a tv next to it which is going to act as his secondary display pretty much so for the actual laptop itself is an hp omen he said he bought it refurbished as well again to save some money in respects it's got an i7 6700 hq cpu and nvidia gtx 965m for graphics that's also uh mounted on an arm so it's you know propped up right in front of him and it gives him room to still use his extra peripherals like the mouse and keyboard but real quick that side display like i said before it's a tv it's from olivia and it's a 32-inch lcd tv but again using the dock for peripherals his keyboard is the royal clutch sync 87g and logitech g602 wireless mouse and also is sort of like a desk lamp you can see that the mood ball or the ore with a little globe thing going off to the side ample rgb as well you know with some light strips under the desk behind the displays in little spot behind the setup too kick back relax chill really like the way it's all set up here so the takeaway from sam is you know pretty much dock the laptop use it as the dedicated workhorse for the setup and say you have you know an old tv lying around you don't got to pick up a brand new gaming monitor hook up whatever you have next to the laptop and now you have dual display so good thinking and a good setup here from sam now is l-team and visually this looks really nice and clean another use of an l-shaped desk here but also another laptop setup not the most interesting wallpaper choice i'll say but that could be a note to work on but laptop itself is an hp pavilion it's got an i5 9300 h cpu eight gigs of ram and nvidia gtx 1050 for the graphics so that's off to the side and that's then hooked up to a 27 inch phillips monitor mounted nicely to the wall which is a cable strip running down to maintain that nice seamless appearance as you can see with the red rgb light strip behind the desk it's going to match his chair as well as some of the red accents in like the peripherals for example the headset there has red accents that's the logitech g332 headset and for the rest of its peripherals you get another royal clutch keyboard this the g87 wireless with logitech b170 wireless mouse so matching rgb wireless peripherals clean desktop definitely give it a nice appearance and even a peak under the desk also nice and organized so you know it doesn't cost money to be organized yeah it might cost a few cents for some zip ties or whatever but you're not gonna be spending a lot of money is what i'm saying just to make it look nice go that extra mile and put in more time and dedication to clean up some of those cables and wires just to give it a nicer look i do feel like i'm in the shining right now i'll admit it but it's all good good execution all around i would just say pick a more lively desktop wallpaper to match everything give it a nicer look all right now is ryan this one mwah chef's kiss very nice and real quick not even talking hardware but the way the room is designed is nice with the darker walls looks like a deeper navy so it's a nice contrast with the all-white desk and it brings out the blues with the rgb light strip and the monitor wallpaper even so real nice color choices and this does seem like an ikea desk setup obviously so again the more affordable option they are saving money with ikea so on the right side of the desk is a 32-inch e-star tv again using a tv's secondary display with the primary monitor right in front of him being a samsung 27 inch model and also real quick for some peripherals you could see we've got a sony speaker right under the monitor and then the headphones off to the side from sony as well they are the ch-700n down to the main peripherals the keyboard is from piktek it's a tkl with blue switches for the mouse the hyperx pulsefire fps pro on a piranha speed mouse pad as well as the blue snowball ice for his microphone and then the pc which is the nzxt h500i case inside the ryzen 5 3600 cpu with 16 gigs of crucial ballistics ram on an msi b550a pro motherboard and an rtx 2060 wind force for the graphics card so one of the more stronger pcs we've seen today yes but still you know before everything you know exploded in terms of the gpu aftermarket prices 2060 all things considered the more affordable option when you factor in 2070 2080 you get the idea so ryan like i said in the beginning great setup and i think just the contrast is what sells it for me the nice dark blue on the white and again even having things like the plants and stuff the little bamboo off to the left side adds a nice splash of brightness and stuff with the light green then rounding us out today is daniel with another l-shaped desk setup that utilizes a glass dash for the primary and sort of using like a shelving unit off to the right side like a little bookshelf kind of thing as the extended portion of that desk so for his monitor going with the classic asus 24-inch 60 hertz display this is a very popular gaming monitor also comes in just at around 100 mounted up on a bracket off to the right side so it has a more clean floating look underneath it as you can see and then as he's demoing different wallpapers matching the rgb switch it all up match it all nice ford's peripherals is a hyperx alloy fps with logitech g305 wireless mouse two very solid budget options for the main mouse and keyboard combo but also for his headset the one area where you could say he splurged the more premium option for the headset going with the logitech g pro x now behind it is a pre-built hp pavilion pc don't have too much info but he sets for the specs as an i5 5700 cpu and a nvidia gtx 1050 for the graphics card now if it is that's not too bad of a build definitely a sleeper look for the pre-built case they always use but again i will say it's a little tip i would definitely look around to try to find a budget case just to make the setup look more modern because the look of that pre-built case i think is holding the setup back a little bit you know what i mean cooler master by the way has some great cases around 50 bucks and under then also off to the side you can see an ipad air 3 which you said is solely used for school so putting the l-shaped desk to use really like the way it all comes together and it's done pretty well by the rgb light strip i think with the desk being glass obviously it's gonna shine through that so it looks a lot brighter fills the room more nice little shelf up top with some boxes little plants all together really good stuff daniel all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 239 of room tour project hope you enjoyed
