what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be checking out a very unique product that might just be the ultimate desktop and gaming accessory for your gaming setup if you need something like this so this is the fire CUDA gaming dock a pretty unique hybrid solution to add to your desk setup combining an external hard drive an additional UI that you can connect to your gaming laptop or PC it's gonna get people a brand new option when it comes to configuring your desk setup as you can see for the form factor it's pretty compact and it's noticeably smaller than something like a console the Xbox one X for example again just making this a natural integration on your desk inside here is four terabytes and as of right now that's the only capacity option that Seagate provides however there's an expandable m dot 2 and the ME slot on the right side of the device you just kind of pop off that right cap revealing an enclosure and here you can choose to add more space and take advantage of the nvme speeds so it's cool we have that option here to upgrade I have an additional terabyte of space with the fire cuda 510 series you can add any m dot 2 mb i mean that you may already have installation is just like you would on a motherboard and when you get it installed you just screw it into place reconnect the shroud screw that in and then pop back on the side of the fire could enclosure piece then you plug it in get it all powered on and you're good to go and yes as you can see we have an RGB light strip and stuff here we'll talk about that more in a minute but for now I'm just going over the i/o here so you know what to expect you have the power button two USB ports for plugging in peripherals a mouse and keyboard that kind of stuff a headset port for the a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a mic jack on the back side up you have the power inputs a Thunderbolt three to connect this to your laptop or your PC an additional Thunderbolt three a DisplayPort plus three more USBs in an Ethernet port so instead of you know plugging everything your flash drives peripherals displays into your laptop here you just connect everything to this and then that way you have one Thunderbolt connecting everything to your laptop it's not only gonna free up some space on your desktop but it's gonna be more organized so that's all just running through here this is kind of acting like the main hub essentially in your laptop is then just gonna be the gaming hardware for example so depending on your desk layout and stuff you could choose to have them next to each other on top of each other or something that works for you I just have mine tucked nicely into my monitor riser shelf and it works like a charm now that's kind of progressed into the first major point of this video and that's the fact that your laptop or PC must have a Thunderbolt 3 port I'm using this along with my razor blade 15 most modern laptops should have Thunderbolt 3 so do keep that in mind second you're also gonna needs who had your laptop powered you know plug into the wall at the same time because the fire CUDA while needing the power itself does not also provide power to a laptop which is definitely a bummer then for major point number 2 of this video is gonna be obviously the hard drive speeds and how you can take advantage of this so after my razorblade 15 the only have a single SSD inside with just 500 gigabytes but it's blazing fast at 3164 megabytes per second read in 2013 megabytes a second write speeds for the actual 4 terabyte fire cuda drive which is just a hard drive itself we get a slower 254 megabytes a second read and 250 megabytes a second write then for the terabyte end dot to nvme we get 2500 50 megabytes a second read and 1180 megabytes a second write speeds so what does this tell us well since my configuration on the razorblade just had me 500 gigs stock that's gonna be mainly used for you know storing files frequently used programs launchers and stuff and since it is blazing fast you could add a game or two on here but the 500 gigs is pretty limiting the 4 terabyte internal drive and the fire CUDA that's gonna be for maybe holding you know larger games because of that drive capacity but mainly used for backing up files content creators definitely use this for saving those large files and projects you can use it for backing up files for like extra security and stuff I personally wouldn't have my games onto there since it is a slower drive so you know games that are more graphically intensive you want to cut that on load times and textures loading and stuff for those more modern graphically intensive games like I don't know which are three GTA 5 battlefield you know the good look he came for example that are gonna be more taxing on a PC that's what you want to load then onto the nvme and when you are gaming it's honestly a lot quieter than I thought it would be I've used many different storage solutions in the past from your traditional just external hard drives or are different nas solutions and they can definitely get pretty loud you know you hear that the cranking of the hard drive but this is a really good job of staying quiet well do a little sound test test you could hear how it sounds when I'm playing games actually stored on to the fire CUDA as well as how it sounds when it's idle the last thing I'll bring up is RGB since this does have that kind of RGB strip in the side there for the ventilation and you can obviously use this to match it to the rest of the RGB colors and your peripherals or your desk setup and stuff it's honestly not too obnoxious either and if anything you can always just have these lights turned off but having that strip and glow out of the side where the exhaust is does provide a little extra Flair it's all configured in their toolkit software very easy to change up so then who is this for exactly kind of rounding this up well like I said you could use it with your desktop PC but it's obviously gonna be mainly targeted towards laptop gamers if you have a gaming laptop with Thunderbolt 3 you're usually just gaming at your desk this is gonna kind of act as a desktop PC experience you know you plug everything into this this is gonna act like a main docking hub then you just connect it to your laptop so now your monitor peripherals all runs through the fire CUDA and your laptop can just stay closed off to the side providing that juice and I still do think at the same time it's a major bummer that we have to not only power the laptop and the fire CUDA separately that the fire CUDA does not actually charge and provide power to your laptop so definitely a bummer I understand that's going to obviously require a lot of power to keep this thing going and running efficiently definitely still would have been nice and the second bummer is gonna be the price of this bad boy it's three hundred and fifty dollars which for a four terabyte hard drive and a docking solution you know combined is it really too bad when you look at prices for things like that separately but it's still gonna be a tough sell for a lot of people looking for something like this a typical four terabyte 7200 rpm hard drives other you would find out there are around 150 nowadays so an extra $200 just kind of for that docking solution seems like a bit much to me I feel like if this wasn't priced at 250 it would have been a more affordable and understanding sweet spot there in the market so altogether this does exactly what it's intended to do and what it's supposed to do it also looks nice you know it's sleek it's modern it's not gonna be taking up too much room on your desktop you're just gonna have to be somebody who needs to need something like this at 350 bucks I'd like it I don't love it so you're gonna have to need a really unique hybrid docking solution and you know extra external hard drive in a compact form factor to want to pay something like this up you guys I'll wrap it up for my review of the fire CUDA gaming dock a pretty unique desktop gadget hope you all enjoyed if you want to check it out I'll put a link for you in the
