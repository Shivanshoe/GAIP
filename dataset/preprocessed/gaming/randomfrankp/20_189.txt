what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're going to be reviewing two of razer's brand new gaming headsets we have the razer black shark v2 x and the razer black shark v2 don't worry we'll go over the differences of each so you can decide which headset's going to be best for you and your needs but little 2013 frank is pumped because back then before i was even doing youtube seriously and recording videos on my iphone 4 these were my go-to headset so i'm very happy that we have a refreshed release now seven years later now like i said we'll fully cover the differences between the two units in just a minute but first the black shark v2x is actually their budget option out of the two despite the x at the end of its name usually companies put x for a product that's you know more high-end but razer uses the x as an affordable indicator and then here the black shark v2 with their usb sound card is their higher end premium model even though i wouldn't really say that's even the case here because it doesn't have a premium price tag yes the v2x comes in at 60 and the v2 comes in at a hundred two very fair price tags for these but we'll hop in because there's a lot of good stuff to go over so first visually they look pretty identical despite minor color differences you'll see on the v2x it has a green rubber cable and it has that stealth logo on the ear cup where it's glossy so you can only see it in reflections which looks pretty nice whereas on the v2 their logo is green and the cable here instead of being rubber is the braided speedflex cable nice and lightweight and they use this on their gaming mice so in terms of cosmetics that's really where they differ visually but it's the physical features they start to you know separate themselves so for starters on the v2 the microphone is actually removable if you want to wear these like actual headphones whereas on the v2x it is not removable it is permanently stuck in the ear cup so the design for both overall is still that like david clark-esque pilot helicopter design to it which i do like and a little bit more on the original black shark back in the day it had that more mechanical look to it which i do prefer but i will say these definitely have a more modern look to it so it's appropriate both use memory foam in terms of the ear pads and the headband although on the v2x they use more of a pleather they're on the v2 it is more of a cloth fabric material both very very comfortable and very soft so i will say in terms of comfort hands down throughout the life cycle of this channel these are probably the most comfortable headset i've ever worn they're lightweight this goes for both the v2x and the v2 it's only a few grams difference between them but they're lightweight they just feel you know right it feels natural doesn't feel like i really have a headset on they're over the ear so it just feels good all around and i can definitely say that with confidence and i know last year i did get lasik so i haven't done glasses tests over the last year so i apologize for that i got some uh lensless frames here but even with glasses on there's absolutely no pressure whatsoever the breathable memory foam in both the v2 and v2x it's just it's doing good i cannot complain in terms of comfort at all however one thing i will say is slightly annoying is the way you adjust the earcups and the height adjustment they're both on their own independent suspension rods if you want to call them that but the wire here does not move together with both of them so you can adjust them slightly independently which could be annoying if you want to just quickly adjust them on the fly i've had it a few times where either the left side would be down or the right side would be up a little bit more and they just weren't completely even so that's slightly annoying i will say that now a few more physical features to go over before we move on to the good stuff like my experience the mic test sound quality all that on both pairs on the left ear cup you do have a built-in volume dial so really quick and easy adjustment there if you want to adjust the volume on the fly and right underneath that you have a mic mute button it presses in mics muted you unpress it you're good to go but where that 40 price tag starts to really show is in their connections so the v2x is completely analog it plugs in with a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack it is 4-pole so you can obviously use this on a controller and stuff it'll transmit audio and chat obviously comes with an extension cable and stuff but the v2 has the usb sound card this gives you the option to enable their thx settings as well as you know microphone eqs music eqs change up different sound profiles you have that usb sound card flexibility now and the added benefits with that whereas just on the v2x the only flexibility you have to adjust these sound settings is with their included surround sound so when you open up the box the first thing you're going to see is a redemption card you scratch it off and you can enable their surround sound which does differ from the thx sound profile but enabling or disabling surround sound is the only real you know software flexibility you have to change up the v2x but what's crazy this is 100 being truthful if you were to blindfold somebody do an a b test where you hadn't listened to these back to back and you had thx on for the black shark v2 and you had their emulated 7.1 surround sound on the v2x it would be very hard to tell the difference between them i always say and i've said it in numerous reviews to always avoid emulated surround sound but razer is the one company that does emulated surround sound right and it sounds phenomenal in game not listening to music not for movies necessarily but gaming it's done right for the v2x when talking positional audio i could easily locate footsteps in the distance when i was playing battlefield uh one thing i will say is with the surround sound on they are more pronounced but i could easily tell which direction they were coming from so i heard footsteps i thought it was maybe you know five to six feet away from me turns out it was more like 20 to 25 feet away you know it was my teammate walking around but i was able to quickly identify okay there's someone right there be on alert now both headsets use the same 50 millimeter newer razer triforce drivers the only real difference between them is the v2x has a membrane-coated diaphragm inside whereas on the v2 it is titanium coated and again that's a lot more the marketing stuff and technical aspect but in terms of just listening back and forth not too different i will say yes the v2 does have the edge in terms of just overall clarity and kind of depth and the way you can push them in their usb sound card settings and stuff so i will give them the slight edge but if i'm being honest it is very very close now when you're eq'ing these in the software which i'll show you in more detail in a second i know i keep stringing you along you can push the levels of the bass the mids the trebles all that obviously you're familiar with eq settings by now but one thing i was really impressed with is no matter how much you would push them it never got distorted or muddy i could bump the bass all the way up and it wasn't to the point where it was overbearing or anything it still had good clarity and a good punch to it but it never got distorted now since this does not use the same 7.1 surround sound like we have on the budget v2 x their thx setting does have that more versatility to be used with watching movies listening to music so it's more you know well-rounded i think still gonna be great for gaming same's gonna go for the positional audio but they both sound really really good it's very hard to tell a difference i'm being honest but i will give the slight edge to the v2 and again having the sound card that's going to be the main selling point for the v2 all right so now it's time for the mic test we'll do two individual ones so you can hear the differences between the two even though they're both using the same razer hyper clear cardioid mic capsule so the same they do have some differences we'll head back now okay so we're going to start off with the mic test of the black shark v2 as you can see it is plugged into my computer via the usb sound card and with the actual mic you know it's one of those flexible like rubberized goose necks you can move it wherever you want i wish it had that old mechanical look that's okay and this as you could hear is the sound obviously with proximity and stuff on your desktop you're still going to be hearing some stuff with in terms of like typing and clicks in the background but one thing i want to focus on and i'll show you while i do this my test is their software through that sound card so i currently have at around 75 and the only thing that's turned on as you can see the mic eq is at default uh you can also enable things like side tone and stuff so you can slightly hear yourself the only thing that's really turned on is the normal uh the volume normalization at forty percent and i believe once i downloaded it this was on by default so if you want you can go in and you know change some things up but this is the stock sound test obviously raw unedited audio you can hear what mic boost does vocal clarity does also enhance it a little bit this is at 30 so if i were to go up you're obviously hearing that differences right now ambient noise reduction you have all these different effects that you could go in and enable but again all stock all default nothing really uh turned on or customized so this is the mic test for the v2 now i'll switch to the v2 x okay so now we switched over to the v2x as you can see here plugged into the front i o on my pc and this is gonna be the raw unedited mic test for this obviously all analog would there be no usb sound card to enable with this so this is how it sounds and again just a quick little typing clicking in the background test but it's gonna do an okay job at picking it up obviously just because it's so close even though i didn't mean to say okay job you don't want to pick it up you get what i'm saying but yeah that's just the nature of that so the thing with this now like i said before is you have the 7.1 surround sound software and once you download it you just tie it to the proper output device in your pc sound settings then all you do is enable it and then now you can enable surround sound for your gaming audio there's also a little kind of indicator in your taskbar and that will also pop up as well if you don't want to have to go through this sort of little interface but it's just down here in the corner you either just turn it on turn it off real quick and easy toggle but yes the raw unedited mic test for the black shark v2 x so let me know in the comments down below which mic do you think sound better i think for the v2 with the usb sound card again you have that option to enable some vocal enhancements and eq it a bit versus the analog mic on the v2x which sounds very good out of the box they're both going to be more than passable for playing online talking to your friends they're decent for what it is in 2020 i have heard better but i've heard a lot lot worse so just comment down below which one do you think sounds better now in the end both price tags are extremely budget-friendly for the overall value you're getting and they're more than appropriate for the product in the end so very impressed i just have to say what razer's doing right now is great i think both the sound quality in each whether you want to go v2 thx versus the v2x and 7.1 surround sound you are not going to be upset with your option in the end they both sound pretty clearly identical i'd say the trained ear is gonna be able to you know pick apart the differences but they sound very very close one's not a clear knockout punch over the other not only that but they're hands down the most comfortable headset i've ever used i love the the minimal design even though like i said i wish the the mic itself uh had that more mechanical look to it like we had in the original black shark not a big deal but in terms of cons and things i don't like two minor things one i alluded to earlier and that's just the the height adjustment of the headband and the ear cups so since it's on this wire it's just not easy to really uh get that fine-tuned level you want without them kind of doing their own thing so you're gonna have to do a lot of this to kind of wear it out a little bit just so it's easier to fully adjust and the second thing which is more something i'll have to get used to but with the included volume wheel on the ear cup it's the opposite direction of what i'm used to so to increase the audio you turn it counterclockwise which isn't natural you would usually turn these clockwise to turn it up right but that's just turning it down so i feel like if that was reversed it would have made a lot more sense because i'm always turning it down when i want to turn it up vice versa um a little complaint on my end but a little bit of muscle memory will knock that right out of the water so man the v2 and v2 x whether you want to save 40 bucks and just you know enable 7.1 uh emulated surround sound with their surround sound settings you're going to have a great product in the end with the v2x if you want more flexibility with the sound card change up the mic cheat up your eq's sound profiles with the original v2 you will not be disappointed razer gotta give it to you you revived a seven plus year old headset and you somehow made me love it again i don't know how it's possible but love them again and guys i'll wrap it up my review of the razer black shark v2 and v2x if you want to check them out i'll put a link for you in
