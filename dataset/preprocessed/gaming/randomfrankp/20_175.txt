what's up guys i'm random frank p and i definitely got a bit of a different video for you today because razer just put out their own gaming gum yeah so if you remember last year when they put out their gaming drink which was called respawn now it's the same sort of lineup but in a gum form with a collaboration with five i'm sure you're familiar with five gum so i'm definitely interested to see what this is all about we'll do like a taste test go over the different flavors i assume there's a variety in here and we'll talk about if it's a good you know alternative to like gaming drinks like g fuel or energy drinks and stuff like that uh because this is definitely you know not my territory when it comes to reviews so like i said a little first look and uh taste test so we've got a little thing here i'm not gonna bother reading that don't cover up my onyx all right we got cool mint right off the bat pomegranate watermelon and tropical punch so i'm not much of a gum guy you know i don't really chew gum but i think i would be if i had to kind of categorize what i would prefer probably more towards the minty side not so much the the fruitiness but we'll it doesn't matter we'll check them all out either way also interested to see what kind of ingredients we have here so i'm just taking a look at the respawn and five pack right now this is the mental focus and reaction time i think they all say that right yeah so they're all for mental focus and reaction time you know when you're gaming you just really want to get focused in and dialed in um so vitamins b5 b6 b12 niacin green tea extract okay so i don't believe there's any form of actual um like caffeine or anything um and i assume you know with that with the green tea extract that's gonna be where your energy is coming from with the green tea so okay so no actual caffeine interesting let's open this up nice vibrant colors as well so we got the the bright teal for the cool mint bright red for the pomegranate watermelon and a bright yellow for tropical punch so okay let's hop into this let's see there's one two five ten 15 pieces of gum per pack and i saw they were selling them in packs of 10 for 28 so you're getting 10 packs of these uh figures out to what like 280 a pack so not too bad and a bit of a shocker here it's like a black kind of gum i know it has like a powder on it but it's like a dark okay we'll give it a minute i'm sure you guys are loving me chewing the sounds cool mint yeah minty cool cool mint i'm gonna cut a lot of this out need to give a good amount of time to chew okay so um definitely minty it's not like overbearing like you know when you use like mouthwash and stuff it has like that tingling kind of mint nothing like that here pretty subdued overall but i mean it tastes fine tastes like yeah cool mint all right so actually let me let me cleanse the palette first i can get the mintiness out of my mouth because if i'm trying out different flavors the last thing i want is that that mint hanging over you know okay pomegranate watermelon so so just first impression here i do kind of wish if this is a piece of black gum um it was as bright or the same color as the packaging it's a little bit more satisfying you know to have the color coordinated gum but yeah something something about putting like a dark licorice flavored piece of gum into your mouth i don't know i would have rathered a brighter piece of gum stupid preference thing all right pomegranate watermelon whoa immediately very good stimulate your senses whoa this brings me back to something in my childhood what does this taste like there was definitely a gum as a kid that tastes just like this i cannot remember the name this is what's up all right pomegranate watermelon stealing the show right now like i said in the beginning i'm more of a cool mint kind of guy you know if i were to have gum uh i prefer that mintiness but this tastes ten times better all right now to tropical punch so i i've done absolutely zero um reading up like about this stuff um i just saw like the announcement and the price so i don't know like you know how long they want you to chew it for before you start feeling you know the the uh the mental focus and increased reaction time well that's just marketing terms you know um but yeah all right tropical punch well okay also very good pina colada pina colada gum where's the actual wrapper hold on okay so natural and artificial flavors because these do taste very sweet and like on point to the actual name so i wonder what type of natural and artificial flavors go into this this is very fruity oh but okay it's so these are all sugar-free by the way that's um that's pretty important because i know people who chew a lot of gum you are getting that actual sugar in there um and it says yeah 35 fewer calories than sugared gum i didn't even see that but yeah it does say on the bottom 15 pieces of sugar-free gum okay okay all right so i'm gonna chill for a bit and um then we'll come back and i'll let you know if i feel any different or more mentally focused how it feels to chew five gum stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses [Music] stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses [Music] stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate and stimulate and stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses stimulate your senses your senses [Music] stimulate your senses all right so it's been about a half hour just played around the battlefield real quick and i don't feel really that different i'm definitely a big caffeine guy i drink like a minimum two cups of coffee every morning to get me going um so the fact that there's not extra caffeine in here getting me jittery and stuff uh is good so the green tea extract you know i probably would have had to have consistently been chewing a piece and not just like a quick two minute you know taste test of each one just really start to feel any different but i will say this and i'm not you know obviously 100 sure the market or demographic for this because i know it's like say you're streaming for example you're not going to want to be chewing a piece of gum while you're streaming because chewing gum kind of makes it harder to like talk you know like you don't want us to be chewing constantly to your audience on camera in a mic having that just that chewing sound over and over and over while you're streaming to them so i don't think this is really for that crowd of people who would just be you know about la okay can't talk it'd be a lot easier for them to just you know take a swig of a drink and then you know keep going so maybe this is just for yourself a little pick-me-up to keep you focused while you're gaming on your own um i don't really know but i will say in terms of flavor uh this is the complete opposite of what i was expecting i said in the beginning i'm more of like a minty fresh kind of guy so i thought cool mint would have been my style 100 but it's actually the complete opposite i think well hands down number one is pomegranate watermelon this tastes amazing absolutely amazing love this so that's number one and i think i'd even still go tropical punch number two because it has that real nice pineapple pina colada type taste to it and then three the cool mint it was definitely minty but it wasn't too much it wasn't over barely minty which in this case might be the drawback so i gotta give hands down the winner to pomegranate watermelon i am loving this tastes super familiar can't remember what this tastes like from my childhood but man it is good like i said uh sugar free gum b vitamin b6 12 niacin green tea extract sugar free 15 per pack you get 10 packs for 28 280 per pack razor respawn gum with their collaboration with five hope you enjoyed this little taste test first look at razer's gum not tech i know but you're here anyways and if you're still watching thank you for going on this wild ride of a gum and taste test 2020 man you never know what you're gonna get all right so that'll wrap it up i'm random frank p hope you enjoyed have a good day stimulate your senses
