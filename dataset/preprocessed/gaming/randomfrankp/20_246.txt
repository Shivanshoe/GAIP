what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna be checking out to 60% metal mechanical keyboards putting them head-to-head to see which is best for you in the Battle of the mechs in one hand we have a newer ducky mecha mini as well as the brand new der god Venus so not picking a winner exactly but just going over the features of each how they edge each other out to see which is gonna be best for you if you want to check him out I haven't both listed for you in the description down below so why did I pick these two for example well like I just mentioned they are pretty much brand new and second 60% keyboards has become the rage over the past year or so mainly due to people like T few and other streamers you know liking these smaller compact keyboards so first just checking them out inside the box of the Durga Venus we have a keyboard obviously and two cables a USB C 2 USB C and a regular USBC cable you get a key cat puller and a coaster mousepad France asks for the ducky Mecca mini we have the USBC cable a key cap puller again and then two sets of additional key caps with a year of the pig spacebar and this Halloween theme spacebar plus I set up accent and key caps in blue and then just in terms of visuals at first glance they don't look too different from each other they're both made of aluminum so they're gonna feel solid and have some weight to it for its compact size after all this is battle of the metal mix with some minor design differences to each the ducky mecha Minnie follows that same look from the original one to many we saw with these kind of standout ledges on the front and back side I think it provides a more flattering look while the Venus has that more intentional angle design to the sides but a small bezel at the top which houses these three small LEDs for things like caps locks and profile switching in terms of other physical features the Venus does not have flip-out feet underneath the Meccan minnie does however and it provides that extra you know backside height and unlike most flip-out feet on keyboards these have a very satisfying locking mechanism so they're not gonna accidentally flip back in if you move your keyboard something while using it check this out that's good stuff and while we're underneath the keyboard the ducky does feature built-in dip switches for things like changing or n key rollover function key position for Mac users and window keys disabling that kind of stuff and lastly since they're both USBC keyboards highly recommend picking up a custom cable by the way they are positioned rather differently they're both located on the left side but the Meccan mini has a plug flush with the board while the Venus has that kind of site into the board a bit more but after testing around five different cables in mine they all fit with no problems so you should be fine unless you're using some sort of bulky mofos so while it may seem right now ducky has the edge in terms of visuals and physical features it's about the whole typing experience that counts and what's happening underneath these keys this is where it gets interesting in my mecha mini I have cherry reds and then I have data around silent browns in the Venus with numerous switch options available at all different prices for both the Venus gives us way more options in ducky though including cherry gather on and kale switches with even box cheats available that is extremely rare to see the mini does limit us to just cherry providing the usual suspects and silent Reds available for a $5 surplus but it's not just these switch options that matter here because I'm really impressed with what Venus does to go that extra mile for users first the stabilizers here are actually factory lubed that means the slaves won't sound as harsh and like a plastic rattle when typing you see in other keyboards this is not something you see from most mass-produced keyboards here so this is really cool and then dergah that actually has a built-in dampening pad to absorb the resonance when typing it may be you know like a minor difference in the end but the foam insert to me is a huge plus now I'm not gonna do a traditional sound test like I usually do in keyboard videos since I have two different switches in each of the keyboards however I want you to pay very close attention to the resonance when you are typing on both these keyboards and how the that dampening foam does a lot of good things for the Venus and I'll also do a sound test of the stabilizer so you could hear the difference between the lubed and the unlived so if you have headphones on you probably very easy to tell the difference in that resonance that you get from the spring sound in the ducky keyboard and just the outstanding job that that foam insert does and the loop stabilizers from the Venus really impressed now I'm bringing it back around to some other visual features of the board let's talk RGB the actual key caps and all the stuff that goes along with that both the mech and mini and the Venus are gonna be using double shot shine through PBT key caps with this nice and clean non-gamer looking font which is the big thumbs up and the duck is actually using an OEM cherry profile here which is pretty standard versus the Venus which has a shorter profile it's not the biggest difference and if you didn't know that there was a profile difference when using them you probably wouldn't be able to tell honestly the Meccan mini has a white plastic backplate underneath the keys for a nice bright LED reflection and the Venus plate seems to be this silver aluminum plate as well to complement the aluminum body of the board this too is gonna reflect the RGB lights brightly because it's actually metal so both the kind of neck and neck there but ducky claims to be using a new motherboard an SMD RGB lights and I'll say it's probably ten percent brighter than the Venus maybe it's honestly not too noticeable and if you're looking at the footage you probably not gonna be able to tell a difference between the brightnesses both have built-in RGB lighting effects I'm not gonna go through every single the effects here because that would just be wasting our time but the next one could be either a pro or con for some people depending on how you feel everything in the ducky Mecca Minnie is done on board from configuring you lights profiles and macros there is no software here and like I said you could either be happy can I have to download another program onto your PC or you could be bummed out that you don't have this quick and easy way to configure everything the Venus also does have their built-in effects on the board that can be changed according to a profile you're on and that's changed by that second function key instead of the right Windows key there but you do have software with their Hera compiler here you can change the lights create macros reassigning keys layers profiles all that stuff the software is so so I'd say it's something cleanest I've seen but far far from the worst so it's funny how similar they are at first glance and then it just goes a completely different direction for each board and like I said earlier I'm not gonna be picking a winner because people are going to value different points and features of these keyboards differently depending on what they're looking for in their keyboard however for me I will say this in terms of actual build and design I'll take ducky ask for the internals and talkin switch switch options the plate stabilizer dampening foam Venus all the way RGB zettai it's a because they're both bright with saturated colors and smooth transitions to the effects but Venus does have the software so it's easier to configure and then when it comes to the included accessories and sub with the extra key cap sets that gets the nod for me to ducky so depending on the features you value the things you're looking for in your keyboard you can't go wrong with either one that's why I picked these two because they're outstanding there are definitely two of the best options right now on the market if you're not looking to you know get into creating your own in that whole community if you want to just buy a keyboard that you can then customize take it a step further these two I think are outstanding and guys I'll wrap it up in my video of the Battle of the metal mechs hope you enjoyed like I said you want to check them out I'll have them both listed for you in the description down below if you liked this video give it a
