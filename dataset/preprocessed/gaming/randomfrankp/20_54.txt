what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 258 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup and this week get a nice clean and minimal edition say anything like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll kick it off now 2 58. today's episode sponsored by the corsair xenion gaming monitor the 32qhd 165. at an ultra slim 32 inches 2560 by 1440p you're getting a silky smooth 165 hertz refresh rate one millisecond response time all on a gorgeous quantum dot ips display with a 100 srgb rating as well as 100 adobe rgb for bright vivid but natural colors if you want to check it out i'll have a link for the xenion gaming monitor listed for you in the description down below first up we have isaac and i'm really digging the mix of colors here with the orange and the blue behind the monitor behind the desk really helps the monitor itself pop a bit more so he's going with a single display on the omnidesk pro 2020 and the display itself is a dell 27 inch 4k it's from their ultra sharp product line you can see up top he has the monitor light bar acting as a desktop lamp now moving on down to the peripherals on that nice felt sort of desk pad we have his apple magic keyboard and the apple magic mouse but in terms of audio on the left side you can see these headphones the hifiman sundara powered by the ifi zen amp and dac combo now also around the desktop he does have his ipad pro it's the 11 inch from 2020 and you can see the macbook pro as well so it completely is like more so a workstation than a gaming setup you know um and obviously on this show we show off a multitude of setups so it doesn't have to just be gaming a lot of times these clean and minimal ones are powered by some sort of you know apple product and this looks great here absolutely loving it i said it before i'll say it again we don't judge people on this show we just show off their badass setups in which this is doesn't matter what it's powered by i don't care if it's powered by a hello kitty backpack as long as it looks badass it's all that matters all right rant over you get what i'm saying isaac really loving the way you pulled this all together touches the green around the acoustic foam behind the monitor as well just adds that more you know geometric look to it and i think all just ties together symmetrically really nicely and next up we've got nico with a really bright and ambient lit setup right by that window and it seems to be a hell of a view as well loving all that natural lighting so checking it all out we said it's a custom made desk which is really cool going with a single monitor again with an msi 27 inch 144 hertz display and that's mounted on an arm off to the left side by the speaker so it does have that more you know floating appearance down to the peripherals you have a kikron k2 v2 keyboard with a custom logitech g305 wireless mouse the back shell has the holes in it to you know free up a few grams and stuff to make it lighter also for audio on each side of the monitor are his speakers from edifier the r1280db and you can see in the side is the headphones from asus of the strix fusion wireless and while we're here we can touch on the small form factor pc always love a nice compact build like this this is the aqua a4 v2 water cooled case inside the ryzen 3700x cpu with an msi mag 240 aio 16 gigs of course revenge's pro rgb ram an msi b450i motherboard and an msi radeon 5600 xt for the graphics card so definitely a nice compact build here then when the sun goes down the rgb goes on you can see curtain closed rgb shining behind the monitor behind the desk gives it that more gamer look to it definitely looking pretty nice so all around nico really good job here really neatly organized no clutter hence clean and minimal next up we've got the jx files and not only am i an x files fan but i'm a fan of the jx files because this setup is banging nice rich looking wood got the green and the wallpaper around the room is it hot in here is it just me makes me want to do the the harlem shake remember that fad from what 2012 good old filthy frank now the jx files is rocking two monitors here a bit of a change up from the first two that we're rocking the single displays we have an alienware 34 inch at the 120 hertz monitor with the left display being a samsung 27 inch on each end yet again we have some edifier speakers the r1280d and then for his desktop peripherals taking a look he has the and pro 2 keyboard and a gh60 wooden case got some nice side printed keycaps looking real clean and minimal here love the blank look with logitech g pro wireless mouse and also the mx master three you can see he sort of changes them up and has them both there at an arm's reach but aesthetically a beautiful peripheral choice with the wooden matching um accents in the case like the phone case the keyboard case speakers all look so good and also for headphones again continuing right over here because in the back you can see those wooden ones those are the meze 99 noir he also has the philips shp 9500 for speakers now we've got the pc inside the nzxt h500 case the way that glass reflects the outside with all that green there still looks really nice inside the intel i7 8700k cpu with an nzxd kraken x52aio 16 gigs of g-skill trident z ram on an asus prime z370a motherboard and a zotac rtx 2080 super for the gpu this is just all around a classy clean looking setup i love the color of the wooden desk again all that green sprinkled around just makes everything else pop and you did a really great job man 10 out of 10. hey now shoutout matt is an all-star man there was a video of smash mouth performing recently at some like food and beverage fair or something like that i don't know and the lead singer was just like telling everyone he's gonna kill their family it was fantastic and that has nothing to do with showdown mat so let's check out the setup because i'm really digging it usually when you have you know the more clean and minimal format like this you don't see too too much rgb but he's got it behind the desk he's got it behind the monitor and of course a nano leaf or a light panel's up on the wall but it's not overdone i'd say he's got a lot going on but it's very organized and planned that's why i really like it so he's rocking an lg 34 inch ultra wide monitor got a herman miller embody chair nice wooden desk the construction here the layout on point down to his peripherals you can see he has a logitech g915 tkl keyboard in all white to match the g pro super light mouse in white as well really nice color combo there to go along with the speakers the trifecta from edifier the r1280t here also in white and then for his headset which unfortunately is in black i'm sure still series makes a white variant of this these the arctis 7 but that's okay that's okay the black still matches nonetheless but now we can check out the pc we have the corsair 4000 x case inside we do not have a cpu listed so can't really go over that but it's a leon lee 360 aio with their lee only rgb fans an msi gaming edge x570 motherboard courser vengeance rgb pro ram and a zotac rtx 3080 for the graphics card got a nice white and red color theme going on inside and then obviously you can tie it all to the rest of the setup change up all the rgb and different rgb hardware to create some different color themes so now he's rocking this really nice teal in red battlefield 2042 theme and showdown matt i'm loving it then lastly we have arie here checking off a lot of the boxes nice wooden desk nice punchy wallpaper natural lighting small form factor pc i'm digging it you know there's a there's a bit of stuff going on on the desktop but that's okay at least it's got like its place and stuff doesn't seem cluttered or really unorganized which is good to see now for those two displays one is an lg 27 inch and the second is a dell 27 inch both up on one monitor bracket but down to the peripherals this is where it gets spicy because it got an iv works av3 r1 keyboard it's that split layout here nice and ergonomic once you get used to it for typing looking like an all acrylic case very very nice logitech g pro wireless mouse and then for audio over on the side are two pairs of headphones with a hi-fi man sundara in the sony wh-1000xm3 and then also in the back providing some more lighting and stuff around the desk the logitech g560 light sync speakers and like i said before a nice small form factor case this the encase m1 inside the ryzen 7 5800x on an asus x570 guy gaming motherboard 16 gig of klev's cross 2 rgb ram always bizarre never know how to say it in an asus dual rtx 2080 graphics card all water cooled inside you can see the custom loop which is really nice and you know for a small form factor pc impressive that it's pulled off seemingly you know so easily the rgb inside the pc with all the acrylic blocks and stuff is orange matching the light stick speakers and orange as well so it looks great on the wooden desktop the complementing of the purple wallpaper complementary always good to see and arie really loving the final result again that massive whether it's a window or a door to a deck i don't know but all that natural ambient lighting just makes the whole setup you know shine some more all right guys i'll wrap it up for episode 258 of room tour project hope you all enjoyed like i said before so anything you
