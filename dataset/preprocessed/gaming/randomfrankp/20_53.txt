what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we have the long awaited releases from glorious with the model o minus and model d minus wireless gaming mice this comes as no surprise as glorious has seemingly been pumping out the budget gaming peripherals over the last few years so run through them both and show them off for you guys talk about the changes and improvements in the brand new model o minus and d minus wireless gaming mice first obviously one of the big selling points of these is going to be the fact that they're lightweight each a few grams under 70 grams is still definitely on the lighter side and given the minus models that means the shell and body are now smaller than the original o and d releases and the fact that releasing these both at the same time is cool to see instead of spreading them out each individually because now you know depending on your hand size your preferred grip glorious gives you the option to pick from the entire lineup of lightweight mice neither small or large ambidextrous or ergonomic and now wireless each mouse is available in a black or a white color in the matte finish i believe they're formerly ditching the glossy version from years past haven't seen that one available in a while but yes these two the latest installments in the lightweight wireless mouse market now the o minus is advertised as 65 grams but comes in a little lighter at 64 grams on my scale same story with the d minus advertised at 67 grams coming in at 66 grams for me but obviously this is just my particular like kitchen scale and all these mice have like a one or two grand variants as it is visually compared to their bigger brother they do look pretty much the same with the only real visual difference being on the o minus to the model o we no longer have the cutouts on the left and right clicks which is something that even the model d ditch so overall it's a cleaner look without those cutouts up top but i mean just side by side you'd be pretty hard pressed to tell they're actually different because they don't physically look that much smaller but honestly it's a world's difference when you're actually holding and using them compared to the non-minus versions for me personally since we just had the model d y list come out like last month i was more used to this d minus now since it just felt more familiar to me and this one i'd say is more on the medium to small side comparatively because the o minus is just petite it's much more small than medium i'd say and now using them both with no cable completely wireless does feel like an extension of your hand almost at this weight in size we still have the odin logo on the left side glorious printed on the right three zone argue lighting still so really just the big difference for those who may not be you know used to the mouse market is the ergonomic d minus has a extended hump on the right side with a more dramatic groove on the left for your thumb which is why it's called ergonomic it's you know naturally made to fit the inside of your hand while the ambi model o minus is more symmetrical on both sides before we move on inside the box you get your charging cable wireless dongle and usb adapter plus an additional set of skates for each mouse if you want to extend the footprint surface area underneath now the one knock of glorious over the years has been sort of an inconsistency when it comes to quality control i personally have not had an issue and same stays true here no issues at all very sturdy you know just really trying to squeeze it hard no squeaking at all in terms of like left and right clicks are nice and firm no wiggle room at all no noticeable pre-travel or post travel on left and right clicks same goes for the side buttons they sound and feel really snappy listen up and like we saw on last month's d wireless the scroll wheel is still just super smooth but you still get those individual steps it says because it actually did some um like internal lubing to the scroll wheel so it's the same wheel just now lightly lubed and it feels great inside the mouse it's still using their bamf sensor up to 16 000 dpi it's the same wireless tech that they used for the dno wireless but switches now are bend 80 million kill switches which is why they just felt more snappy and tactile to me versus years past like it was immediately noticeable how much more just satisfying they felt so the new switches definitely a welcome change and for my time testing with gameplay and stuff i played at 750 dpi which is kind of like my go-to with these smaller vice i always have a variance between like six to eight hundred so for me 750 felt dialed in thousand hertz pulling rate and a zero millisecond debounce time which something i saw recommended on a bunch of forums other youtubers talk about and just overall they both felt great now i've always said in years past i am more of an ergonomic user so i like that shape better even though i really you know mained the viper ultimate for pretty much over two years so while i prefer ergonomic i did sort of gravitate more towards symmetrical mice and the big thing here was at this smaller side i would say the actual d minus doesn't feel as drastically different as the o minus does um it's but for me the d minus was my go to i felt really really comfortable with this and it's really the mouse that i use where i perform best in with gameplay however if you are looking for the lighter version which is the o minus wireless and one that's gonna actually feel noticeably smaller like i said o minus is the way to go because it's still smaller than the d minus lighter which again with the trend of this whole lightweight mouse market going that's what i think most people are gonna gravitate towards is the o minus wireless now it's funny because when the wired o minus came out i really didn't like it that much it felt too small for me but even back then the more lightweight trend was still going and progressing but smaller mice weren't really you know that big of a thing yet so over the past two years as the lighter smaller trend started to evolve um i did get more used to this now so i've tested a bunch of smaller mice over the past year or so so for me i could say i like it better now than i did with the wired version but again the biggest factor with finding the mice that's gonna be best for you is you your preference your preferred grip and your hand size which is why i said it's really cool that glorious now gives you that full lineup to pick between large small wired wireless ambi ergo during my time testing battery life has been great it's rated for over 70 hours and when i fully drained it the first time i had it charging for just around a half hour and it got right to 50 so that's a pretty good bump for that time frame you know half hour charge you're still getting around 35 hours of use then now obviously the rgb effect and led brightness is also going to impact your battery life so i always recommend keeping it below 50 get the most out of your wireless mouse there's never a need for 100 brightness and then into the core software which they use here you have the lighting tab obviously for configuring the lighting on those three zones with the two strips on each side plus the scroll wheel being illuminated also change the brightness and stuff as well then you have the key bindings tab for reprogramming the six buttons on here they are fully programmable so left and right clicks can still be whatever you want and on the right side of the core software has all your functions macros and bindings you can remap these two it's all there and then the performance tab that's like i said before you can change your dpi change what each step is in increments of 50 change up the lighting color for each dpi step which will correspond to the led underneath the mouse change your pulling rate debounce time liftoff distance all here at the end of the day each minus wireless option comes in at 79.99 so for 80 bucks that is still very competitive given the current mouse market and as i said before the ergo shape really isn't too too popular um and there's really not a lot of small wireless versions like this out here with this shape so i think it's a really great price for both in terms of cons like i said before quality control was on point no issues whatsoever i do have very two minor things i want to bring up one is kind of stupid on my end but on the o minus wireless the right side of the light strip is peeking out a little bit more than on the left side it's an extremely minor annoyance but like once i noticed it i couldn't stop staring at it doesn't affect the mouse at all and secondly i will admit i wish the minus wireless options were just a little bit lighter because compared to the you know wired versions of these yes they're lighter but they're not drastically lighter i believe this one's like four grams lighter this one's two grams lighter so i would have loved to have seen maybe like a five to seven gram range here of them being you know lighter in the wired version but again 80 bucks for these very impressive so if you are in the market to pick up a new gaming mouse or maybe you're trying to just upgrade over a wired mouse you have you're ready to make that wireless plunge and get into the wireless lightweight small market then here you go really good pricing at 80 bucks and guys i'll wrap it up for my review of the glorious model d and model o minus wireless
