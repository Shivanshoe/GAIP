what's up guys i'm random frank p and elgato just to release their webcam it's only a matter of time this is the elgato face cam the facecam webcam so in this video we're going to go through it all talk about the webcam itself do a whole demo and a test for you guys you can see how it looks how the webcam actually performs in low light with the green screen show off their software all the adjustments all that good stuff in case you're interested in the elgato face cam so let's be honest if one company's gonna do a webcam right it's probably gonna be elgato they're a leader in the streaming scene tons of useful streaming products so that's why i said it's only a matter of time before they gave us a quality webcam but is it quality so first off just taking a look at it it's actually a little bit on the bigger side you know kind of bulky it's not a small little flimsy webcam this thing's got some heft to it and check out that lens so this is elgato's prime lens it's an f 2.4 24 millimeter focal length they say it's got 18 anti-reflective coatings to the lens also an ir filter inside and it's actually backed and powered by sony with their starvus cmos sensor this is limited to 1080p 60fps so it's not a 4k webcam we're not there quite yet it would have been nice but unless you're mia malkova i don't want to see you in 4k who said that i mean let's be real odds are if you're streaming you're probably going to be in a small box in the corner anyway 1080p is fine unless you are doing a big old 4k hot tub stream and then maybe that benefit but again 1080p60 i'm fine with it now also taking a look at the facecam itself as you saw on the back side it does connect via usbc they do include a nice long cable for you so you connect it to your pc power it that way um also included inside the box was a little lens cover nice little addition yeah it does come with their own detachable mount um there is a 1 4 thread on the bottom so you could use your own mount or a ball head uh the mount itself you can see is definitely made to go like around the back of your monitor you are kind of limited in terms of actual flexibility though it really only goes i'd say about 70 degrees in terms of verticality and you can move the webcam left and right on the actual mount but then you're gonna either loosen it or tighten it some more and when it's all set up and ready to go you'll notice a little blue tally light off to the left side of the face cam letting you know we can see you all right let's see how this thing looks all right so to demo the face cam will bring you through the camera hub software which should look pretty familiar to you you know it's laid out very similar to other elgato software out there so you should feel right at home on the left side you have all your adjustments for the picture quality in the image on the right side or in the middle here your video preview so you can see how you look and your adjustments real time you're probably noticing that you know we're not in the studio downstairs i'm in a different environment this is sort of best case scenario because i've got lighting over here got a big window over here so lots of natural ambient lighting which is what you want because you know lighting me the subject is just as important as the actual camera is so like i said best case scenario i'll show you in a little bit more done with this how this looks with like you know keying a green screen or if you are in a dark dimmer room how it looks with that and how to kind of you know fine-tune the camera so get the best image possible but anyways here on the left side for some of the settings this is all stock defaults you have your zoomer field of view which is kind of just a digital zoom you know you're not actually adjusting the field of view of the lens or anything so yeah all digital not too good you're going to get a lot of you know noise introduced for this image looks kind of fuzzy and distorted for your picture settings you know you want some flat contrast more punchy contrast change your saturation all that kind of stuff and say you really hate what you did it looks terrible like this does for each of the settings you can hit this little button right here and it'll bring it back to the default picture uh one thing that's is always on by default obviously is exposure this though i would turn off and then sort of adjust sort of accordingly to your environment so in this case you know since we're at 60 fps the one uh 125th isn't too bad but i would definitely lower the iso you know maybe to around yeah that looks pretty decent well if you want to keep it on you can then just adjust the compensation tab which kind of you know does the same thing for lowering your iso if you will so you know let's just go let's just go there for now another thing turned on by defaults that i would definitely also recommend changing is the white balance so you can see right here it definitely looks kind of warm the wall in front of me is kind of like cool tones for the wall behind me here looks kind of yellow which it's really not in real life so we're going to take the white balance off and you can adjust the color temperature from 2800 kelvin very very cool to a 12 500 kelvin very very warm uh so we're kind of you know kind of see what looks best i guess right around there around 5100 kelvin maybe a little bit lower uh 40-900 kelvin it's only adjustable in increments of 100 so you can't go like 47.50 for example there's also no tint which is kind of a bummer because now this looks kind of you know greenish to me so i would love a green majesta tint to be able to adjust that maybe they can put that in the future i'm sure they will because now if i go back to you know automatic it looks a lot more magenta right so i could just you know make this a little bit more green but unfortunately we don't have that and now it looks kind of green tinted to me so their white balance definitely isn't there yet i hope some updates in the future can kind of adjust that then you have the processing for noise reductions you can take a look right now you can see like my hair kind of blurred a little bit you turn it off a little bit more detail there so just kind of you know reducing some of the grain and stuff in your image and you also have things like 60 hertz and 50 hertz for the anti-flicker so that's sort of just you your quick run through of the settings one of the things real quick if you want to adjust the actual like they say video format but your resolution 1080p 60 is what we're on right now 1080p 30 down to 540 and there's no way in the software to record video they just have this little snapshot button which will then bring up a snapshot as you can see so i would have loved to have have in here some sort of way to record video so for that you have to bring it to obs so what else doesn't this have you probably noticed by now nothing was mentioned in terms of autofocus because this is a fixed lens everything is supposed to be in focus they say so for example if i want to like bring something up here it's not going to be in focus it's not going to breathe or you know adjust try to get this in focus it's just going to more so get everything in focus and say that's because you know if you're moving around your room you're moving around the frame a little bit you'll stay in focus which is true i got a fix for you in a second with that but i would have liked to have had some sort of you know autofocus if i want to bring something up close it would focus on that and it seems maybe around like i don't know what is that like 10 maybe a foot away from the camera is when things start to get in focus so keep that in mind and also as you saw nothing in terms of like a background blur nothing like that what we're going to do is bring this on over to nvidia broadcast this is definitely a good tool that i would recommend you have along with this and that's going to get you a better you know quality image i'd say in order to do that i believe i have to exit out of this so we're going to do that real quick kind of just give it a little refresh and there we go so this is really what should be in with elgato software um i don't think i can make this bigger either so i'll sort of crop in so you can get a better idea of how the image looks but here for effects you can see background blur is on and this is it by default so you want it on to kind of you know eliminate kind of introduce like a fake bokeh you know get the background stuff out of the image so it's not in focus so you're mainly focusing on me and not what's going on behind me so you can adjust it a little bit you know you want to be just like a very slight strength you can do that halfway all the way up definitely looks pretty good they also have things in the nvidia broadcast for like an auto frame so it'll crop up on me if i go over here it'll you know try to catch me try to bring me in frame yeah i'd keep that off though but yes these settings here uh with the background blur on you know that should be a thing in elgato software maybe they'll you know bring that in the future and then since you don't have control of the actual like settings and stuff anymore because the camera hub software has to be closed they do still have this camera settings little uh button here which will then bring up you know some just minor adjustments but pretty similar to what we saw in camera hubs you can adjust you know the brightness all that kind of stuff uh contrast yeah so you still do have some control in here if you want to fine tune it some more and you know when you're messing around on obs and stuff like that you still want some of that adjustment you can still get it and adjust that all uh right through here but yes so pretty much what elgato lacks and their software you can sort of make up for with nvidia broadcast and really take the image to the next level okay so you've been seeing this image you know the whole time in the small little window now let's show you how it looks real time in obs what i'm gonna do is bring it up uh we're gonna add a new source sure and not sony imaging where did it go nvidia broadcast yeah so this is going to bring up you know the two effects combined with the background blur and we'll see is it going to do it boom i'm also just going to hit record so you guys can see how the video looks and now this is how it's going to look inside of obs you can get a better idea of the image quality so you know some minor artifacting going on when i'm moving my hands and stuff and around my face when trying to detect that background blur but when you combine the two software together with the camera hub and the nvidia broadcast you can get a better image for sure then in here if i want i can even go in and adjust some of the uh the picture quality even further with adding different filters um so this is where i could also go in and adjust things like the tint if i want just make it look even better for when you're finally streaming in obs or streamlabs whatever you're using but yes when you combine the two software you can definitely get a better image and i'd like to see some adjustments and changes with elgato's end i'm sure they'll come in future updates but uh is it dslr quality not quite yet with the fake bokeh but in terms of the actual video quality um definitely one of the best i've seen and we're getting very very close when you start to you know get artificial stuff going on but yes pretty good so far now we're gonna bring it back downstairs get the green screen up and i'll show you how it looks with that how we can key that and also in a dark you know situation where you're gonna need some more lighting and how it handles a very dark dim room okay so now back down in the studio and as you can see behind me got the green screen up show you how that works with this what you do and pretty much is gonna be you know different depending on the software you're using filters then we're going to add a chroma key which is going to again you know key out that green and i literally didn't have to do anything else it just did it and since the green behind me it's all you know nice and saturated and pretty you know an even contrast overall for the green as you can see it eliminated pretty much all of it so uh that was pretty easy now again with something like this what you would want to do is you could also go a step further and add a different crop so it could just be me so for example let me go down here let me find it real quick where is crop oh second one all right so the crop looks fine resize it let me just bring up a background image and then there i am in the corner this is going to be obviously great for game play and stuff and you could just be there in the corner background perfectly keyed out and this is also without the nvidia broadcasting and webcam settings set up so there's no bokeh or blur being applied artificially this is just straight out of the face cam pretty good next up let's ditch the lighting and show you how it acts in a dark setting okay so what you're seeing right now is the result of absolutely zero lights on right now and this is actually pretty impressive because looking at the image i feel like it looks pretty decent overall in terms of you know bumping up the highlights and giving me light when there is none in the studio it's completely black in here the only lighting really going on is just my monitors in front of me and as a result i think it looks pretty good i'm not gonna lie now you can definitely see there's a definite noticeable amount of grain and noise going on in the footage and this is right now inside the camera hub software a noise reduction is turned off and just to show you when i turn it on since there is a lot of noise in green it reduces that pretty heavily it looks kind of soft overall so one thing we can kind of do to compensate for that is maybe turn the sharpness down the software it was usually at plus two and maybe like a plus one i think that kind of looks better and also just for exposure um again i think it's good it's very bright but if i want to maybe bump it down just a little a little bit um i don't know i'm just really impressed with how it looks with no light sounds now we can do a little test we can add some lights just to show you you know how it reacts worst case scenario um real quick i have some led lights behind my monitor i just pop those on add a little bit more i have a little lamp next to my desk that's turned off now i'm going to turn it on you can start to see adding some more just light to the overall image in the background but i'm staying kind of the same i got a light over here again still i think looking better now and honestly in terms of like a skin tone and color overall i think this looks a lot more natural than it did when i was upstairs in the uh like the cleaner office space this here looks more you know true to life in terms of colors and skin tones and stuff like that again this is just adding minor lights around me i don't even have the main lights in the studio on so let me go do that okay now all the lights are on and you could see i believe when this starts to get more light into it uh and the less kind of work it has to do when the color starts to get a little bit funkier because now i can see it has a bit of more of those magenta tones to it uh but still as you saw worst case scenario with it being very very dark in here it you know it looked very good it looked fine it looked and handled the footage a lot better than i thought it would and a lot better than i think most webcams out there would handle that last thing to do for this then would be just to see how it looks and with the nvidia broadcast turned on just to see again with a minor bit amount of background elimination going on and not too bad not too bad overall against this 1080p if i wanted to you know again like we showed you before make it smaller it's going to look better the smaller and the more resized it is so if i want to go in real quick and just reapply the filter that i had before again bring it back down if i had gameplay going on or whatever uh this looks more than fine pretty impressed overall okay so at the end of the day this comes in at 200 let's talk about the pros cons my wish list that kind of thing of what i really think about the face cam and first off just the actual image quality very very good uh yes in some instances it's gonna be a bit you know grady and distorted the color balance isn't quite there yet but the actual image quality is pretty good for 1080p 60. and again you're probably going to be the small little box in the corner anyways so really no complaints on that end like i said though i really wish they would sort of improve the white balance because it was just off in a lot of my situations and even including something like a magenta to green tint would help a lot sort of fine-tune that color when you're not using it on automatic you know another thing it's sort of minor but because you can also just buy your own but i really feel like they should have gave us a ball head to use this on like they make ball head for their multi mount so why not make like a smaller one uh and kind of use that so that way we can get a full 360 make this really flexible instead of just this you know what i'm saying another thing it's elgato why not include a tiny little ring light you know like a little ring light built in around the lens we know you can do it they make their own ring light they have the air light the key light they make a bunch of streaming lights so it would have made sense for us a little ring light it's not necessary honestly you saw how good it performed in low light as it is but you can only benefit from a little ring light on here now softer shadows with roll off on your face that flattering reflection in your eye would have been nice what else i will admit 200 is kind of steep for it but when you take a look at the entire you know webcam space out there it's kind of booty and this is definitely the best image quality i've seen so they can get away with charging 200 another thing i noticed in some of the shots is a slight flickering in the background and regardless of the anti-flicker setting i had it on it was just kind of you know you can see it slightly pulsing kind of an annoyance and i don't know what it was or what was triggering that another thing i noticed is on the corners again it could say 24 mil it definitely starts to get distorted around the edges things get wider and as you get towards center of the frame it looks more normal but definitely some distortion at the end i know it seems like a lot of cons i'm saying but again i'm being sort of picky because you know cameras and stuff is what i do and webcams are an important aspect in this work from home space so when we get a new one from a very good company i'm gonna be a bit more picky on that side the last thing i'll bring up which for me isn't really like a pro or a con but the lack of autofocus might sort of you know turn some people away again with it being a fixed prime lens with everything sort of being in focus um that's going to benefit you if you are moving around but not if you're like doing you know close-up detail shots of things that's why i showed you the nvidia broadcasting where you can do that background blur and stuff like that and i do think they should have some sort of implementation of a background blur in their own camera hub software it would be cool to see but again it's day one launch i'm sure their software is going to expand grow and get better as time goes on so honestly i'm just really really impressed with like i said before the image quality and how it performs in low light and that i think the low light performance is the biggest selling point of this because that means you don't have to have a ton of lights you don't have to have expensive you know rigs and things to make this you know perform better it performs pretty damn well in low light so pretty good stuff i'm pretty impressed overall again yeah kind of steep at 200 but given the webcam space the face cam probably right now your best option and uh that'll wrap it up for this review hope you enjoyed if you want to check it out i'll have a link for you in the description down below if you like this review give it a big
