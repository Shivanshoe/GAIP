what's up guys i'm random frank p and today we're gonna be checking out razer's brand new wireless gaming headset the barracuda x it's really impressive for what it is you can see really slim and minimal looking as well so in this review we'll go through it all do a mic test pros cons talk about the sound my experience all that good stuff in case you're interested in picking up the razer barracuda so name wise following their other aquatic headset releases like the kraken the black shark recently now the barracuda x for 99 comes in at a pretty overall budget friendly price tag for a wireless gaming headset that's usually razer does with their product name so put x at the end indicate budget and you know it's not breaking the bank either i think 100 bucks is pretty fair overall and speaking of black shark it's what we're going to kind of compare this to today because that release last year is just hands down one of the best gaming headsets on the market so how does this follow up well first taking a look at it it's really nice and sleek minimal looking overall it doesn't scream gaming headset you know and it actually looks very similar to their wireless noise cancelling headphones the opus i believe like it's very very similar looking to that now it's just kind of turned into a gaming headset i'm digging the all matte black stealth look it has and one of the first things i noticed when i unboxed it was really just how lightweight it is it comes in at 250 grams that does mean yes the construction here is primarily plastic but i don't feel the actual construction is compromised even though it's plastic you know it's nice and flexible as you can see uh stretchy for fitting wider heads and stuff like that as you saw you can rotate the ear cups you can either have them laying flat on your desk around your neck as well and always like when headsets do this because it's obviously great for travel and stuff you know you fold them up like this put in your backpack and be on your way and there's a little leatherette headband up top with memory foam ear pads and yes razer has been nailing it lately with their design like i said before the black shark super comfortable super ergonomic these still following right up with that very very comfortable and one of the things i definitely noticed about this when i first tried it on was the clamping force or the clamping pressure is like spot on and it's so much so that with the over the ear cup design they're not noise canceling by any means but due to that natural clamp it creates a really nice seal and does block out a lot of the ambient noise going on in the room i was actually working out with these and it was great for that until i started doing some bench presses laying down on the bench then just you know naturally because of gravity they do start to slide off oh yeah you got to remind me to keep doing these glasses tests i always forget because i don't wear glasses anymore but again just due to the really you know even balance and lightweight design uh yeah no no force in the temples definitely is approved taking a look around it on the left ear cups where all the controls are give your mic mute button the volume dial the power button 3.5 millimeter headphone jack if you want to use these wired the usb c port for charging then you have the slot for the microphone this is removable that's great to see because if you don't want to you know have these looking like a gaming headset you can wear these out it's not gonna look like an eyesore by any means so happy to see it charges with usbc it also comes with the headphone jack the 3.5 millimeter adapter if you want to use these wired with little consoles and stuff like that but once you get them powered on and since they are wireless the main connection point here is this wide little usbc dongle and i say wide because you know it's pretty wide for a dongle and it could cause some problems so to kind of remedy that they include a usbc adapter so if your pc doesn't have usbc or if it's just blocking other ports on your pc you can plug it into the extender cable and then use it freely from there and it's a good thing that did that because as you'll see on my pc it does not fit in the front i o i usually have problems with dongles fitting in here it's pretty small space as it is this will not connect anywhere on my pc even on the back because it blocks other ports so you have the gaming laptop with the usbc odds are it's still going to block the other ports so again use that included cable adapter but the barracuda x actually works natively with the nintendo switch also works natively with your ps5 also no issues with android phones the usbc you plug it in and you're good to go so that means yes with xbox you cannot use these wirelessly but that's why they include the 3.5 millimeter cable so what are they doing here how are they making a 100 dollar wireless headset and the drivers inside are actually the same exact drivers from their black shark release they're tuned slightly differently and these are 40 millimeters instead of the 50 millimeter triforce driver so 10 millimeters smaller does that make a difference not too much honestly for me i did some a b testing back and forth with the black shark v2 pro and now the barracuda x and one thing i picked up on was these have a bit more bass to them surprisingly even though they're smaller and it's a pretty solid punch it's not too muddy it doesn't get distorted um when you're playing these at 100 volume i noticed it wasn't too too harsh overall there was still pretty good clarity the one thing i would say that did kind of suffer is the sound stage again is it because they're just 10 millimeters smaller is that why is it because of the really solid you know clamp forces has maybe but i did notice it wasn't as wide sounding as the black shark v2 pro now these also boast 7.1 surround sound but not with synapse and i'll talk about that in a minute it's actually just surround sound through your built-in windows 10 sound settings and the big point with that is that's you know a general pc setting it's not tuned for the barracuda x like they do with synapse so they're thx surround sound you know and it didn't sound too bad i would say it did widen the sound stage a little bit more but it was definitely harder to kind of pinpoint and nail directional audio in that sense but also with the built-in windows surround sound that's also going to depend and you know benefit greatly from whatever game you're playing so for example in battlefields it's sound better um in the sort of reverse spectrum playing like call of duty their audio is pretty good but it doesn't touch battlefield audio and then there i noticed the sound quality was worse having surround sound on versus off so for movies yeah it'll sound good for games that are very you know well mastered and have a great overall you know audio experience in that game you're going to benefit from it but honestly just a stock serial sound on here very very impressed so why windows surround sound in your sound settings versus synapse and as far as i know these aren't compatible with synapse which could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you think about that because i know a lot of people hate synapse you hate software that you need to have downloaded in order to properly use a product and in this case you don't need it nothing to download plug and play and you're ready to go on the other side of that you could maybe to see that as a downer because now there's no way to you know eq your headset there's no way to kind of you know bump certain um frequencies if you want to kind of you know play around with a little bit and get more out of your sound quality if you're a fan of eq'ing your headset so again depending on who you are how you think could be a good or bad thing but as of right now as far as i know no synapse planned for these and also it didn't come with one of those codes that you can like scratch off to redeem the razer surround sound which i feel like is kind of odd maybe they'll do that in the future don't know next up the microphone how does this sound and you know always an important aspect of a gaming headset now okay so one of the big things with a wireless gaming headset is obviously gonna be how the microphone sounds right because it's not directly connected to your pc there's gonna be some sort of loss in the audio quality and yeah as you could hear definitely not the best definitely pretty meh it has a slight distortion to it kind of like nasally robotic it's that typical wireless headset microphone quality that you've probably heard on a bunch of other headsets out there disappointing yes and it's their hyper clear cardioid unidirectional microphone i believe it's the same exact one again they use in the black shark v2 pro which was also very underwhelming so i assume this is the same yeah not too good so bringing it around town one of the last things to touch on is the battery life for a wireless gaming headset also an important aspect and they're rated for 20 hours which uh not too bad not too good still kind of middle of the pack i think in terms of other wireless gaming headsets out there but again with usbc you do i believe get a bit of a quick charge i believe i've rated them for around a half hour you plug it in and it's good to go but one of the weird things about this and again because there is no synapse there's no real way for me to tell the percentage and what sort of battery level we're at so i didn't know when they were getting low to die i assume that the little led indicator on the bottom here would be like flashing a certain color but again they're on my head i couldn't tell so they died on me and i would love to know what percentage i'm at so it's gonna be tough to see how they can kind of you know remedy that or give a solution when there is no synapse so what are my thoughts on this for a hundred dollars the barracuda x i think all together really solid and impressive at that price point again i like the design nice you know slim low profile on your head uh very you know like matt and stealthy overall lightweight nice and comfy great clamp force all that stuff and sound quality very very good again it's the same drivers that we've had on their black shark lineup just 10 millimeters smaller and it doesn't make a huge difference if i'm being honest it's very very minimal uh so impressive in that regard the microphone that's definitely a bit of a con right you heard you're probably not too impressed with that another thing like i said um i would i guess you can't really call it a con but more so a thing i would like to see changed or addressed is knowing what level i'm at for the battery because it's just it's you know it's roulette am i gonna is it gonna die while i'm gaming is it gonna are they dead now when i go to game i don't know another little annoyance i noticed before i forget is um the volume level on the back of the left ear cup they did this on the black shark v2 i'm pretty sure and it's not a big deal but you know that's my keyboard hands i'd only be able to adjust volume uh when like nothing was going on in game because obviously i don't want to die free up my keyboard hand it'd be easier it's a real quick go you know i don't know is that just me maybe i don't know but again a hundred dollars for a wireless gaming headset to use on your pc your mac your switch your ps5 your usbc phone all natively is really really cool something you don't see too often at this price so all things considered i'm pretty impressed you guys ought to wrap it up for my review of the barracuda x
