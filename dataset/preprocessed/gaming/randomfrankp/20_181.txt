all get that next-gen bump powered by nvidia touring asus and their 20 series rtx graphics card lineup provides not only the most advanced gpu architecture for gamers but also reliability as asus graphics cards are manufactured through an auto extreme process that's 100 automated what does that mean for you well they're not made by hand so in the end there's a stricter quality inspection and control process giving your pc the edge and reliability if you want to check it out i'll put a link for you in the description down below first we have a very colorful looking setup with two ultra wides and massive overhead but what i really like about this is the diy aspect that went into it because literally everything you see is homemade okay the desk that red accent piece behind it the legs for the desk that big piece on the wall everything here is made from scratch and again when it comes to perfecting a setup and you know making it personal then what better way to do that than personally make it yourself so you could fit it to that exact vision you have in your head that's why i love diy stuff like this because they go the extra mile to really just make it unlike anything out there so for the panels he's using the primary two on the bottom are the msi 34-inch ultra wide with the overhead display being a 55-inch samsung 7 series tv gotta appreciate the colorful and spanned wallpaper in four's peripherals on the desk patty has the drop control keyboard with box white switches inside the mouse is logistec g903 got a sonos arc sound bar and also for audio on the left side you can see on that skull looking stand is the steelseries arctis pro and then we can check out the wall mounted pc hanging right above it very good job with cable management you can see he has it routed into the wall that is some dedication so for the specs here's a ryzen 9 3900x cpu obviously all water cooled stuff from ek water blocks alpha cool it's got 128 gigs of g skilled trident z rgb ram on the msi mag x570 motherboard and the sapphire pulse rx 5700 xt graphics card white and red color theme going on can always appreciate a nice wall mounted pc and could also appreciate a grand entrance because check this out this is the glass door is leading into the man cave or the the gaming room whatever and it just looks awesome speaking through there you open it up and then boom rgb custom design custom desk dual ultrawides 55 inch tv all the colors all the pixels all the good next up is mark p with a super cozy setup i am loving the vibes from this one and what i like is the little things like the color of the wallpaper you see the open 24 hours it's like the reddish oranges and then teal and blue so you kind of complement that with a pink sort of rgb behind the desk and then the natural lighting you see behind the curtains it's like pretty much the same color temperature as a 24 hours little stuff like that makes it all flow so for those two displays with the obviously vertical and horizontal monitor mounted side by side they are each a 27 inch asus panel 1440p 165 hertz g-sync panel so they're gonna be great for gaming and productivity really whatever you're doing on here and down to the peripherals this guy he knows what's up you can always tell a man of culture when you see a rama board okay so this is the m60a sequence 2 in the milk colorway it's got xylem v2 switches the mouse is an all-white potent ultra custom even got the rama wallet and stuff you can see the stream deck in the back and uh by the way i know people have been asking for a new episode of switch it up we also have mark on there with his very own board so you're gonna see that and hear it soon it's also got the white ember mug in the back for audio he has the audio engine a2 plus speakers as well as the hyperx cloud flight headset tell you what when it comes to peripherals and just your desktop accessories this is all you need right here and then for the pc over to the leon lee pc-011 dynamic case is an intel i7 8700k cpu with the corsair h100i v2 aio 16 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb ram on an asus rog strix z370e motherboard with an msi gtx 1080 ti gaming x gpu so mark you're crossing everything off the board here 10 out of 10 setup and i didn't even mention the ivy and the plants in the beginning you can see kind of trickling down off the left there but yeah splashing a little bit of green got the webcam mounted off to the left side as well i mean it's not a webcam but you get what i'm saying he's just casually got the z cam e2 mounted there but yeah mark loving this now yeah i restrained myself on the last set up with the plants but johnny ashtray coming in with one two three four five six plants in like the tier order two so it's all symmetrical man that's some good stuff i just noticed that now the the symmetry of the same plants it's a nice touch nice touch for sure and obviously in this room more than just a gaming setup because it is primarily built for music production as you can probably tell with the massive speakers the guitars the sound phone behind the monitors so let's get into the the nitty-gritty because for his main display it's a 34-inch view sonic curved ultra wide with a 40-inch 4k tv from samsung as the overhead got the rgb light behind the desk there to throw some blue color on the sound foam loving the choice of the wallpaper as well to complement the plants but for these speakers and a lot of the more primary audio gear we have the focal sm9 studio monitors in addition to the eclipse bookshelf speakers and the midi keyboard is the m audio oxygen 49 key hanging off that left speaker is the beyerdynamic dt-770 pro headphones some more audio stuff but then his primary peripherals he has a basic dell wireless keyboard and logitech g602 mouse underneath the desk is the pc it's the fractal design r5 case inside the intel i7 6900k cpu with a corsair h100i aio 32 gigs of course survey engines led ram on an asus x99a motherboard and an evga gtx 1080 ftw gpu and as you can see with the hardware all matching blue when necessary so i am digging it whether you are throwing down some fat beats or i don't know what kind of music you make your music production obviously i'm not sure which genre regardless whether you get some gaming done music production done you got a killer space to get it done next we have cheeky scrub and you may be cheeky but this is not the setup of a scrub scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me but you you're getting all the love gorgeous wooden desktop all the green i assume it's fake iv but it looks real like how you have it behind the desk and then kind of running up the wall into the speakers like ib naturally does and then you got it matching to the desktop wallpaper all right so for the three displays before i have an aneurysm the two outer monitors are 24 inches from dell and the primary is an acer 34 inch for the main peripherals got the corsair k70 rgb keyboard with the steel series rival 310 mouse steel series arctis 5 headset 2 elgato stream decks and those overhead mounted speakers are the krk rocket 5 gen 2. hey did i mention how i love the wallpaper then as for the pc this is underneath the desk so i'm not too sure what case it is but inside's an intel i7 7820x with the corsair h115i aio 32 gigs of corsair vengeance led ram on an asus x 299 tough mark 1 motherboard an evga gtx 1080 ti sc hybrid gpu and he also has the avermedia live gamer 4k capture card man oh man all this right in front of the window for some natural lighting really gorgeous prints from the public service broadcasting those look really nice on top of the setup and help kind of fill it in where else that massive space would just be blank and again you got to tell me where you got that fake ivy because it looks really good a bit vibrant but it's believable and then last but not least we have chris k with a gaming and streaming setup another very colorful one as by the wallpaper pc and uh what's it called desk pad mousepad whatever you want to call it blanked out for a second just lots of color going on but nothing wrong with that for the main display okay the primary on the bottom it's the popular asus rog swift 27 inch the overhead one is a 27 inch from asus but a different model then the left vertical is a 34 inch ultra wide from lg for the peripherals you guys are lucky you get two rama boards featured this episode this again the rama m60a sequence 2 with gmk phantom keycaps and that desk pad by the way is the milkshake got a glorious pc gaming race model o for the mouse then over to hardware and some other stuff sennheiser hd 598 headphones with the sennheiser gsx 1000 amp got the elgato stream deck some other artisan keycaps on display and like i said before with this being primarily like also for streaming you can see their key light mounted up into the left that ring looking light is from brightech got the sharper image word clock here on the right side of the screen i showed that off in cool tech under 50 and then that little display we're not really little but it's the eight inch display from the echo show eight right next to the pc and speaking of which yet again we have the leon lee pc-011 dynamic case always looks so nice with an intel i9 9900k cpu the corsair h150i pro aio 32 gigs of juice guild trident z royal ram on gigabyte z390 aorus master motherboard with an asus strix rtx 2080 super gpu real nice job coordinating all the white hardware and stuff with the graphics card and motherboard and getting that royal ram definitely is a good complimentary piece to not only the build but the entire setup because it's flashy you know and that's what this is with the the bright colors all across the board from the wallpaper to your pc down to your peripherals you definitely get that gamer aesthetic here so i can see where you sit down here and you just get some natural energy built up before you stream you know what i'm saying good stuff chris k all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 222 of room tour project hope you enjoyed don't forget check the
