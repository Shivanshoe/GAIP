what's up guys i'm random frank p and i've been trying to reach you by your car's extended warranty if you're the owner of this vehicle please press one now to speak to a customer representative also we're back with episode 246 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now episode 246. first up is javalo with a really nice dual monitor setup here with the stacked orientation lots of green you got iv off to the left side spanning to the wallpaper which is always a nice touch to kind of match those two colors really draws your eyes right to the center here loving the natural lighting with a big window right behind the setup just naturally illuminating everything looking real nice and cozy so checking it out for the two displays the top monitor is an lg 27 inch and the bottom one is an acer 24 inch display you can't really see how he has it mounted here but i assume the top monitor is just on your standard desktop arm and the bottom one seems to be leaning backwards you can kind of see those little like things sticking out in the front so i assume it's just leaning back on something ford's peripherals going all wireless here with the kikron k3 keyboard and the logitech g604 lightspeed mouse they're both sitting on a blank extended mouse pad might be like an amazon generic and then for audio we have steelseries h wireless headset and logitech z207 speakers chilling off to the left side of his setup you could see these little pokemon terrariums and it looks almost identical to the terrariums i made my groomsmen a few years ago when i got married um i made them all like a little you know starter pokemon terrarium with a starter pup one that they use because we all grew up playing it together i thought that was cool to see and then under the desk is the corsair of city in 750d case inside is an intel i7 6700k cpu with 16 gigs of ram and an asus maximus 8 hero motherboard and an evga gtx 960 gpu said i didn't really want to show off the internals because it's a bit dated but that's a okay so loving the natural desk setup here really nice wooden desk i love that little lamp you even have there too all the natural lighting the plants really digging the vibes from this one continuing those good feels is dr brown 07 with a dual monitor setup this one also stacked but in a rather different orientation because they're both mounted separately but it's clean and organized and again just loving the earthy tones it has to offer so checking it out for those two displays the primary one on the bottom is a dell 27 inch and then mounted above is actually a 32 inch video con tv really clean mounting job though like damn the top one looks like it's mounted in the wall maybe can't really tell and making it pop and stand out a bit is a nice rgb light shirt behind the monitor again just to add some color and depth to it checking out some of the desktop gears got this cool little succulent log thing going on then for the peripherals got a kikron k2 and logitech g903 mouse again going all wireless and he also has the xbox controller there as like a secondary peripheral for audio there's no headphones or headsets to report on but he does have mounted a really nice pair of speakers using the edifier r1280t and again it's a great job here they're only a hundred bucks for the pair and also he has the same mounts that i use in my setup to mount my speakers so again it'll all be dropped down below for you and then checking out the pc we have the cooler master h500p mesh case inside the ryzen 7 3700x cpu with an nzxd kraken x62 aio got 16 gigs of g-skill trident z rgb ram on a gigabyte orris elite x570 motherboard and an evga rtx 2080 super for the gpu and you can see not that there does appear to be a second graphics card but uh no information on that he didn't really point it out so but personally the first thing that stuck out to me and honestly what makes things so visually appealing is the symmetry here it is on point perfect even down to the prints and stuff and that's just what makes it you know so satisfying to look at but a great job putting this all together super clean great mounting man real good stuff oh baby now we got frothy with another clean looking setup i should have themed this some sort of you know clean and minimal edition but damn look at this this is kind of like a render almost it's that clean but credit where credits do because again this this is the stuff that inspires me when i see stuff like this that looks so clean that i'm like is that a real photo is that a real setup you know it just makes putting these together that much better that much more enjoyable for you guys so frothy's rocking our titan army 27 inch monitor that is one brand i am not familiar with you can see though again rgb light strip behind the display looks nice adds depth easier on the eyes rgb light behind the backboard as well in ford's peripheral he's a gk61 keyboard with some hyperx putting keycaps on there in white to perfectly match his mouse the logitech g305 very aesthetically pleasing here then over to the audio we got the steelseries arctis 5 headset with the jbl 650 wireless headphones you can kind of switch them up use them for different use cases then next to the pc mounted on each side of the monitor you can see here the speakers the edifier r1280t yet again but now inside the nzxt h210i case is a ryzen 3 3100 cpu with a cooler master ml240 light aio got 16 gigs of t-force delta rgb ram on an asus b450i gaming motherboard and the gigabyte oris gtx 1660 ti for the graphics card got a custom back plate on the gpu keeping the insides nice and purple just to be extra vibrant and a peek at the cable management underneath the desk i assume that's a custom desk he probably has all the cables routed through it but man really really good job so a round of applause for frothy because man this this manages to be clean and minimal and like futuristic but also kind of like cozy and inviting at the same time it floats a very fine line and it does it very very well oh speaking of warming inviting now we've got this guy uh i don't know how to say that name i apologize but i believe we had him on a few years ago and the float of this setup is undeniable each setup kind of leads perfectly into the next and i am loving the way this is laid out really nice desk and gaming setup here in the room huge window and then a massive entertainment center as well so this is the best of both worlds lots of earthy tones with the plants the entertainment centers wooden the desk is wood and the backboard there digging the prince mounted above the tv as well but let's check out the desk setup and he's rocking a 34 inch msi optics gaming monitor and i'm going to sound like a broken record but beautifully mounted and again another rgb light strip behind it for that depth and separation and for the peripherals this is like a first time ever but we have yet again another kikron keyboard with the k6 logitech mx master three mouse and for the third or fourth time now the edifier r1280t speakers so these are under a hundred dollars i'm gonna buy them now because everyone's got them this this is the edifier edition might be a good addition to cool tech under 100 coming up who knows and then underneath his desk he does have a pc he said it's not worth you know talking about or showing off so we don't have any information on it that is the cooler master storm striker case and then for the massive tv i'm checking down i actually don't have a size on it but it uses the nvidia shield pro and a plex server here to you know watch movies tv all that stuff on here and i assume you know console gaming would be pretty badass as well but i don't see any consoles listen it doesn't matter he could be hooking up a nintendo 64 on this and it would still look badass probably so big big ups for this one the ultimate entertainment room fantastically massive tv really nice desk setup as well like i said this one's got it all nice and warm and cozy as well and then last but not least is joseph keeping it simple with a single monitor here but we got some nice and punchy colors here i like the orange and the blues and the wallpaper orange matching to the pc and also just that deep wooden tone he has in the desk that's really rich looking what kind of stain is that give me give me the hookup on your stain guy my guy ran dry who's your plug but now for his monitor he has an hp 24 inch it's a 144 hertz one millisecond display he has one of those led light bars mounted above the monitor and also an rgb light bulb in this actual lamp to throw some extra color then checking out his main peripherals the keyboard is the drevo caliber v2 he also has a moto speed numpad with some extra keycaps on there and the steelseries rival 650 mouse on a felt extended mouse pad and then for audio on a little hanger mounted inside the drawer so that was a good idea is the hyperx cloud 2 gaming headset but now for the pc inside the deep cool mac cube 110 micro atx case that sounds very weird to say deep cool mac cube why does that sound like a tongue twister but here's a ryzen 5 2600 cpu with 16 gigs of xpg spectrix ram on an asus b550m tough wi-fi motherboard and an xfx rx 5900 nope 590 gpu it's been a long day people cut me some slack but this one's nice and moody in the best of ways again i've said it a hundred times so far but loving the earthy tones it's been a consistent theme this episode but whenever you see like you know blues and oranges mixed together in a setup it just it makes you feel good you know and this one does just that all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 246 of room tour project hope you enjoyed if you did
