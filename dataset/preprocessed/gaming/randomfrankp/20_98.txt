and today we're back with episode 245 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup see anything you'd like today we'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out but we'll kick it off now 2 45. first up we have fallen foe with all the rgb here the damn gun is glowing up on the wall got the nana levora light panels there is a lot going on here including a very unorthodox triple monitor setup orientation so taking a closer look his center primary monitor is an asus 27 inch the top monitor on the overhead is a benq 27 inch and then mounted on the right side he has an lg ultra gear 27-inch 144 hertz panel and the primary one his asus that one's 175 hertz so getting the most out of that as for his peripherals and main gear in the desktop there's a lot going on here his keyboard is a tofu 60 with frosted acrylic he has lubed alpaca v2 switches inside with dsa astral keys keycaps on him for his mice because there's multiples he has a logitech g pro razer fighter ultimate but he's maining the monolo wireless but you can also see in the back the elgato stream deck and the sterling audio harmony h.224 audio interface checking out his custom pc inside the intel i9 9900k cpu with an asus lc 240 aio you got 32 gigs of t-force delta rgb ram on an asus z3 90 prime motherboard with an rtx 2060 super founders edition graphics card all inside the corsair p4000x case which looks super nice here keeping the rgb all consistent as well with the pinks purples and blues which is gonna spread across the entire room in the entire setup you can see right next to the setup pretty much is his entertainment center here he has an lg 43-inch 4k tv more rgb some dope shelves collectibles some keyboards on display i love when i see stuff like this so good stuff all around here from fall info the massive span l-shaped desk tons of free space lots of room to move around flail your arms and stuff killer gear killer hardware really liking what you did here now we've got brandon and this one's giving me some you know chill vibes nice and calming relaxing maybe it's the wallpaper and the nice warm lighting behind it and uh do take note here because what he did was place those two lamps behind each monitor and you know gives it that warm sort of glow to mix it with the sunset wallpaper a little bit i don't know might have been unintentional but it looks really good so for his display it is a xiaomi me 34 inch 144 hertz monitor then the vertical monitor off to the right side is a 24 inch from dell down to his peripherals on our desk map with the kbd67 light keyboard inside he has zelios v2 67 gram switches with some enjoy pvt wob keycaps logitech g pro wireless and for audio in the back he has the g733 wireless headset as well as the audio engine a2 speakers and then right on schedule we move our way over to the pc in this case is oddly named the msi vampiric 100r case msi this is not a vampire inside the ryzen 5 3500 x cpu with 16 gigs of team force vulcan z ram on gigabyte b550m gaming motherboard and an msi rtx 3060 gpu assuming everything was bought for msrp that's like your ideal best bang for buck pc right there i do wish the pc though was over on the right side of the desk instead of off to the left you can see it's not on the desk here it's on like a drawer unit either way i'm not going to complain still really digging the vibes you're giving us here brendan now we've got taz.com and he is all the way from year 2056. check out that view with that natural ambient lighting all those windows this is like straight out of a really nice futuristic modern magazine this entire setup is pretty much that society if meme all right we're going to try to dive in here and see what he's got going on because this is all powered by the mac pro 2012 from apple uh inside is a 3.2 quad core intel with 32 gigs of ram and an 8 gigabyte radeon rx 580 gpu hooked up to the apple cinema display 23 inch i really don't know much about apple's you know desktop hardware so i'm just reading off whatever respects he provided here but also for some peripherals got the apple magic track pad the magic keyboard the magic mouse got an ipad and the rode nt usb microphone i would possibly though move the camera and the gimbal somewhere else in addition to that workspace he also uses his 2015 macbook pro uh inside an i7 it's the 15-inch got the bang olufsen h9 gen 3 wireless headphones and check out the entertainment space over here a 55-inch samsung 8000 series tv got the apple tv there black and white home pods tons of other things that i have no idea what they are the ps4 even though the ps5 usually would fit right in here and i really dig the uh the storm troopers here these are the star wars first order troopers by artfx and it just looks really cool fits in perfectly so this setup this entire space really just speaks for itself i can't get over that view all that ambient lighting the cleanness of the all white everything pretty much here this is nuts now we've got dollar 42 with another nice warm and cozy theme setup all nice wooden desk beautifully mounted triple monitor setup here some more warm lighting with that lamp over in the corner and rgb behind the monitors and the desk so let's take a deeper dive here all three of those displays are an lg 24 inch again beautifully mounted here you can't see any cables drooping down good stuff you did the proper thing by spanning the wallpapers across all three so it's a uniform image and not just duplicating the same monitor and bro i'm not gonna lie i usually you know keep this to myself but i just casually farted over here and i'm struggling to stay alive all right i think i'll make it for the for the peripherals the logistics g915 tkl keyboard with the corsair harpoon rgb wireless mouse on a nice extended desk mat here for audio he has the blue yeti mic with the sony wh-1000 xm4 headphones and then powering this entire setup is his dell p750 laptop inside the intel i7 8850 cpu with the nvidia quattro p1000 integrated gpu and a peak underneath the desk really good job of cable management also no cables drooping down here either everything nice and organized definitely the theme here for his desk setup and check out the spot behind the setup a nice spot to chill relax on the couch but he has a 65-inch sony 4k tv plus two additional insignia 32-inch tvs mounted above that so he can netflix and chill netflix and ps5 and ps4 and all the stuff here with three tvs six displays total in this setup hot damn dollar 42 you spent at least 1.43 here you might have to update the name because there is a lot of gear and hardware going on making the really nice setup props props all around and then lastly we have hassan with a really nice looking gaming room here got the desk set up the massive tv right behind it hell the dragon ball z prints are glowing let's check this out so for his display it is a 32-inch monitor from asus and yes i will admit this spot here is definitely pretty cramped and there's a lot of stuff going on uh but at least the room itself looks really cool and then for the peripherals unfortunately he only gave one photo of each up like this so i had to edit it so we can only get a sliver of each picture but for his keyboard it's the corsair k70 rgb mark ii rapid fire the steelseries rival 600 mouse and the jbl quantum on headset submission instructions are down below they're very very simple also on his desktop for audio he has the razer nomo chroma speakers now over to the pc inside the thermaltake vue 51 case is an intel i5 10 600k cpu with an nzxt kraken z73 aio got 16 gigs of thermal take tough ram on a rog strix z490a gaming motherboard and an aorus rtx 3080 master gpu rgb fans rgb cables all of the rgb in the world and i wish we had more information on the entertainment space because he didn't provide any info on the tv at all hassan you're killing me man you're killing me but you can get some pc gaming done at the desk roll the chair around play some spider-man on that glorious massive
