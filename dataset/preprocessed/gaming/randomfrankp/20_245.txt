what's up guys I'm random Frank P back in episode 202 over room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspirations for your own setup you see anything you like I'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll kick it off now episode 202 this episode is sponsored by the courser virtuoso RGB wireless headset available in black or white and features 7.1 surround sound a durable aluminum frame and slipstream technology allowing for high fidelity audio with ultra-low latency these were also featured in my best gaming headsets of 2019 video if you want to check it out I'll put a link for you in the description down below alright first up we have Paul and this is actually a setup built inside of a shed so we've got a shet up but it's really impressive seems pretty spacious and stuff big TV doesn't need a desk set up but all that just outside of the house very very interesting before the actual death set up we have the IKEA concoction with the Alex Shores karlby desktop and they also want to step further to make his own monitor riser which is definitely a pretty cool idea looks really nice as well both of those monitors side-by-side are these same panels in LG 34 inch ultra wide from there Ultra Gear gaming lineup then talking peripherals to get to the audio setup he has going on that's the Logitech Z 906 speakers with the corsair k70 RGB keyboard the coarser night sword RGB mouse on the coarser mm 800 RGB mouse pad and a wireless phone charger now over to the PC this is the Corsair 760 T case in sides got an Intel i7 6700 K CPU for the Questor H 100 I GTX a IO thirty-two gates of g.skill ripjaws Ram I'm gigabyte z170 XK me3 motherboard into EVGA GTX 970 s in SLI and then for the entertainment setup got a massive 65 inch Samsung 4k TV the Bose soundTouch 300 sound bar they're just delivering a really cool spot to get out of the house game chill relax ceilings even lying with RGB light strips really really diggin the way this all came to get next up we've got Bruce B's for brave with a really unique Japanese kind of theme going on here from the prints the wallpaper the bonsai tree and I'm really digging the earth tones and the darker colors here to accent the prints just makes a the setup look bit different the monitors yet again same model and the stacked orientation with the LG Ultra gear 34 inch displays and those cherry wood speakers are the AV 1 2 3 ELT 5 to 5 M sounds made-up but for the rest of the peripherals we have a really nice custom keyboard here the key cult number 2 Rav 1 insides out Tilley Oh switches and simple J a key caps here with Logitech G Pro wireless mouse on a glorious extended extra-large stealth Edition mousepad but damn look at that wrist rest always love seeing a custom board and then even got my custom water-cooled PC which is looking really really clean this case the Lian Li P Co 11 dynamic case inside of Intel i7 6700 K CPU with 32 gigs of courser Vengeance Pro RGB RAM on ASUS Maximus 8 hero motherboard with an NVIDIA r-tx 2080 founders Edition graphics card some of the water cooling components are from ek for the CPU and GPU water blocks as well as the rat and stuff but this is a really nice looking PC so Bruce got to give it to you great job on execution here everything just flows love the natural tones everything just looks neat and organized my only tip is to see if you could span that wallpaper so it goes across both instead of having them repeated next up we have Manuel with the single massive ultrawide monitor mounted nicely on these geometric back boards acting like a mounting surface great for cable management and great for aesthetics so this monitor is from Asus it's their Strix xg4 9vq so 49 inches which is just insane and he's got some RGB light ships behind the desk and the monitor to give it that separation from that back door so you have some actual depth with the colors in these words are meant to replace like wallpaper and stuff if you want an accent wall here pulled off nicely for the peripherals with the coarser k95 Platinum RGB keyboard with the course of your iron claw RGB mouse on the ear Corsair mousepad again the mm 800 Polaris and it's got the white PBT key caps on the keyboard as well for audio going with a bit of a mix up here got the Logitech G 560 light sing speakers with their G 933 gaming headset on the Corsair RGB headset stand and then over to the PC another really nice clean water cool job this is a thermal take Corp III case a very popular frame in size an Intel i7 8700 K CPU with 64 gigs of course revengeance RGB program on ASUS Maximus 10 formula motherboard and asus rog Strix gtx 980ti graphics card water cooling components from ek and thermal tape great job on cable management as well as you get to see no cables hanging down from the desk and I assume a lot of the cables from the monitor and PC are gonna be routed behind that back board so when you see it head on it looks super fresh good job next up we've got Jonathan and this is a hell of an RGB gaming room Tonsley Nelly who are light panels and these geometric kind of standout prints that have RGB surrounding the shapes I don't even know what they are but it looks crazy cool so for these three displays again mounted nicely as well his primary is an alienware 34 inch the 1900 are with two dell 27 monitors on each side and then above those you could see his speakers mounted the clips are 15 M then for the rest of the peripherals on his desk got the shreem deck there the and pro 2 keyboard with the Razer Viper ultimate wireless mouse on the Mad Catz glide 38 mousepad deadly calm if I do say so myself and again checking out the customization he did to his an Pro 2 keyboard it looks nothing like this when you buy it but he got custom key caps and artisans a custom cable and it really took it to the next level in terms of again customization and for the rest of his gear on his coarser SC 100 RGB headphone stand is the coarser void Pro wireless headset now over to the PC this is the NZXT H 700 I case bringing all those colors in the room directly to the internals pinks purples ice blues all that kind of stuff it's at the Intel I 999 hundred K CPU with a Corsair Kraken X 62 a IO 32 gigs of Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB Ram feel like everybody's had that so far this episode on the msi xiii 98 motherboard with an EVGA r-tx 20 80 TI black edition GPU but hot damn this thing is super neon and as you saw on that first shot over on the left side of the room kind of making this massive custom l-shaped desk is a secondary setup and we're not going to go over this too but we'll focus on the peripherals because yet again he has a customized keyboard he ducky one too many with the pretty much same key caps and like matching coil cable and stuff to highlight it in the mouse here is Logitech MX master 3 so a secondary workstation completing this crazy cool RGB room those hexagon RGB panels are really unique and I like how it again it adds some depth because you can kind of see them stand out and pop a bit more than with the monitors being mounted and stuff it's it's all about depth you see what I'm saying and then lastly we've got Scott with the sect monitor orientation right in front of a big massive window for some natural ambient lighting and even though it's winter he's bringing the beach to the bedroom with the waves and the ice blue theme going on in the PC and the monitor wallpaper so for those two displays his primary is the MSI 24-inch with the top overhead being a 25-inch ultra wide from LG you can see the MSI monitor is still on the stocks and but he has the 25 inch overhead on his stand off to the left side you really can't even notice it looks like once and then like clockwork moving on down to the peripherals Scott actually didn't give us any info on the actual keyboard so don't know what it is it's obviously some sort of like custom build if I had to guess I would assume it's one of those DIY kits from KBD fans but I custom coiled cable for the keyboard you get see the RGB lights are also going to a teal color to highlight his mouse which is the glorious pc gaming race in Mahwah oh and the other secondary mouse the Logitech G 703 Lightspeed so you can kind of switch it up between wired and wireless that's not an extended mouse pad from Corsair the mm 304 speakers off to the side is Logitech Z 333 but then rounding it up with the PC build you got the fan Tech's Eclipse P 350 x case inside as a risin v 2600 cpu with a gigabyte X 470 gaming + motherboard with 16 gigs of course revengeance pro rgv ram in the msi RX 470 gaming X graphics card and a pop figure inside as well which is a trend that is still going on I'll leave you know how pop figures are still a thing but I guess that's just the boomer in me talking right that's what the kids say now I'm just playing I know it's a big thing with collectibles and I encourage it I encourage collectibles and a set up to add that personality you know I'm saying but good stuff Scott you can kind of see the desktop there is kind of limiting and cramped in terms of space so like how you have the essentials there everything you need to keep the setup thriving alright guys I'll wrap it up for episode 202 of room tour
