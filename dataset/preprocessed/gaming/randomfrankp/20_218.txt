what's up guys I'm random Frank P and today we're gonna talk about how to take your portable gaming setup to the next level with a brand new 240 Hertz display today we're gonna show off the asus rog Strix XG 17 a 17.3 inch HD 240 hertz refresh rate display with adaptive sync for smooth tear free gaming this is the first of its kind it's literally the world's fastest portable display and whether you're adding it to your laptop using it with your phone a tablet for gaming a console Nintendo switch the XG 17 is a killer monitor for your setup for some specs as we get into it the full HD display is IPS with a three millisecond response time has the 100% srgb color gamut with a 1000 in 1 contrast ratio for the built-in IO we have a DC in for charging USB C and a micro HDMI port with included cables if you want to connect this - like I said before your switch ps4 PC any HDMI or USB C device it also has a headphone jack built-in but on the front we also have built-in speakers there on the bottom bezel there and for a portable monitor this is pretty cool that means you don't have to use headphones you have the audio here for you checking it out in terms of builds the monitor is super thin at just 0.4 inches making this a breeze to fit in your bag and carry around with you if using this out on the go now included in the box is a magnetic protective case this is kind of like those covers you see for iPads and you can use this to obviously save the screens we're getting nicked up when it's in your bag and it can be used to kind of prop up the monitor on your desk now when talking use case or something like this it's pretty obvious how you can take advantage of a second display but I'll show you what I did to really get the most out of it so putting this to good use I'm using this with the a su Sepphoris X which is a super slim gaming laptop that has an r/t X 2080 in it so slim and powerful for its 15.6 inch 144 Hertz display and since both panels are 1080p the extra 17 obviously gets the advantage when it comes that higher refresh rate for gaming having this mounted above the laptop screen that's like an overhead display that only just feels better in terms of being at more eye level but it's getting me you know more out of my gameplay I could kind of you know use the bottom monitor or the me laptop monitor to do things like monitor the armory crate on the bottom have something up like Twitter Spotify whatever I want on that bottom screen but the high refresh rate gaming on the tops where it's at how about something like photo or video editing even a usual timeline on the bottom your bins and stuff and you can have the vector scopes up top for color correcting more displays for editing is always a good thing especially with organization and I mean say if you're a streamer you could have your gameplay up top 240 Hertz and on the bottom you can have OBS you're monitoring all the software and stuff chat all on the bottom screen and he'll say you wanted to pick up a second display so you have two of these yeah sounds pretty crazy to have this triple monitor laptop setup going on you can have your very own Razer project Valerie you'll obviously need a laptop or something powerful enough to run this and with those two outer 240 Hertz displays you'll be really taking advantage and I refresh rate in a scenario like this well I mean no one's gonna stop you since they're both so thin you could still have these two plus a laptop in your bag when you're out and it'd still be less thick than your average textbook it even has a 7800 milliamp hour battery built in so you can use this without additional power for up to three and a half hours at 240 Hertz this means while gaming if you're out and about you only need to have that one display cable plugged in to connect this to your laptop you don't have to worry about extra cables now we're taking a look at it yeah the perfectionist in me is wishing they kind of aligned better since the XG 17 is 17 point three inches and these efforts as display is fifteen point six inches it's a tad bit off when stack in the overhead orientation but I mean I'll live and that you're probably wondering how I have this mounted well on the back of the display they have a quarter inch thread and this is so you can mount something like a mobile tripod or like I'm using on the back I just have my desktop mic stand and the clamp there but since the display has that protective cover and that like magnetic stand as it is included you could still use that for like the side by side use case but yeah so if you have a powerful rig or a laptop that can actually push games to take advantage of the 240 Hertz refresh rate having that extra portable monitor like this is gonna be great it even has things the settings we can go in change up the color profiles it's much like a monitor with all the settings in there you would usually find on a gaming monitor including things like you know putting up not not the aim-assist like the radical and stuff like that it's your usual monitor settings now the extra 17 does come in at $500 which yes is pricey but you have to remember as a portable laptop it doesn't require additional power you can bring with you and have a 240 Hertz portable display like this at this size that's actually a pretty good price comparing it to other portable monitors out there and you can be thinking to yourself well I could just buy you know a regular desktop monitor bigger size higher pixels anything like that for a cheaper and yet there are panels like that out there that exist but again those aren't portable you're not gonna be putting those in your bag and bringing them with you as efficiently as you can with a super slim portable monitor like this at 240 Hertz so if you want to add one of these to your desktop you know just have a secondary display like I did with the laptop as an overhead you could do that 240 Hertz in the extra 17 I think could really take your portable or your laptop setup to the next level so I want to show that off for you guys hope you enjoyed if you like this video if you want to see more on the go you know setup
