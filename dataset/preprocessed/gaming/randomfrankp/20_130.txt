what's up guys i'm random frank p back with episode 236 of room tour project the series we show off some of the best setups to give you some ideas and inspiration for your own setup if you see anything you like today i'll have it all listed for you in the description down below so you can check it out we'll start it off now 236. first we have man of all mans and i'm sure some of you can have something to say about that because you're probably the man too right but do you have an all custom wooden desk like this i don't know this is pretty awesome very very nice looking love the built-in shelf up top those white support beams here this for a diy job looks killer even has the monitors mounted to the desk itself so it's this all in one piece for his primary display he's a 29 inch lg ultra wide with two dell 22 inches on each side and remember ultrawide monitors are measured different vertically than they are regular 16x9 monitors so 29 in the middle 22 on the outside and i'm also testing a new microphone so let me know how this sounds down to his peripherals he has an awkey rgb keyboard with some white pudding keycaps on there so a nice budget way to get some extra rgb on the desk with a white red dragon m602 mouse on an all-white extended mouse pad and then as you saw in the wide shot on top of the shelf is where he has his pc this is the dark flash dl m22 case inside the intel i5 7500 cpu on an msi b250n motherboard with a gigabyte auris rx 570 gpu unfortunately it's the only specs he really provided for us but he did plasti-dip the motherboard completely as you see as well as the gpu to fit that all-white appearance so i like that dedication but i just hope that's okay for the motherboard everything on the motherboard is covered so uh i mean if it's working it's working right and then in terms of cable management as you can see everything kept up nice and tidy off the floor and showing you underneath the desk you can see why nice and organized all routed there a bunch of zip ties and stuff always good to see some good cable management like this and i gotta say man of all mans i'm just really really digging this desk like it looks like a real professional piece you would find in some like industrial store you know but uh really loving this definitely a killer looking gaming setup okay next up for five percent gamer i'm also switching mics to my regular microphone so let me know what you think sounds better this mic as we go or the first microphone for the first setup but these photos are from his instagram five percent gamer when i first saw it i was digging it a hundred percent tons of rgb outlined by just the lifx beams pretty much around the setup itself nearly four light panels behind it and of course the stacked monitor so his primary is the asus pg 348q so a nice 34 inch ultra wide g-sync 100 hertz with a 27-inch hp monitor as that overhead both cleanly mounted and as you can see with the wallpaper changing so it is the color theme of the entire setup down to his peripherals he has the asus rog claymore core keyboard with asus rg gladius 2 mouse on an asus rg xl mouse pad and also for audio he has the sennheiser gsp 500 for his gaming headset and then as for his really nice looking custom water cooled pc all hardline here inside the leon lee 011 dynamic case is an intel i7 8700k cpu on the asus maximus 10 apex motherboard with 16 gigs of corsair vengeance pro rgb ram an asus strix rtx 3080 graphics card and the water cooling and stuff is from ek it's their magnitude block that bright fluorescent coolant here looking like a really sick build then also a nice shot across the room is you can see a shelf bunch of collectibles and stuff some gears of war some helmets figures up top always like seeing some stuff like this toss into the room but man just that wide shot of the whole room itself looks really nice definitely a unique way to use those lifx beam strips pretty much to kind of outline a certain framing of the setup if you will just to make it pop and stand out more so definitely good stuff all around here man oh man now we've got jessie j with the really nice looking room highlighted by the triple monitor setup in an unordinary sort of orientation here with a 49 inch on the bottom and then two 27 inches up top completing that sort of rectangle of monitor real estate so let's check this out because that bottom his primary display is the 49 inch it's the aoc agnon and then those two up top are 27-inch monitors from acer and then on the left side you could see is a laptop that's kind of propped up and mounted there that's the dell magnitude 5300 so you can go both gaming pc or laptop there for some productivity work take it with them on the go and just come home dock it and uh it's all good then for the nice overhead shot you can check out some stuff in more detail uh the monitor riser itself is from grovemate it's their walnut riser then four is peripherals there's a custom tofu 65 as well as a custom cable from mech cables it's their obsidian don't have too much information on the custom keyboard though which is kind of a bummer for the mouse logitech mx master 3 and then audio is the steelseries arc to 7 headphones as well as the bose companion 2 speakers i'm also digging how that mug matches everything like perfectly and then over on the right side of the desk is his pc the case itself is the corsair crystal 280x rgb it's their micro atx offering inside the ryzen 9 3900x with the corsair h100i rgb platinum se aio on the asrock pro 4 motherboard 32 gigs of courser vengeance rgb pro ram with an evga rtx 2060 super xc gpu and for some extra lighting and stuff he has the corsair iq lighting node which gives him that extra rgb to make everything well be white here he's using white to accentuate all the white hardware and the braided cables and stuff so instead of rgb going nice and clean here and you can see on this shot he has it on the floor off to the right side so maybe he switches it up every now and then i kind of liked it on the desktop because it is such a nice looking build that i would probably want that on display but i'm really digging the room all together jessie j can tell the other design choices a lot of the props and stuff you have up to complete the room makes everything just look more complete and it's all done really really nicely and having all those pixels with those just that crazy monitor setup i'm sure is a dream to sit in front of now we've got brock with the killer gaming room here looks really futuristic and by the way brock was my favorite uh pokemon trainer growing up because my favorite pokemon was onyx what was yours but yeah with the clean lines the white and blue it just seems so clean and spacey to me so interestingly enough for his setup here his primary monitor is the left side that is the lg 38 inch and then the secondary monitor which is on the right is a 34 inch ultra wide from lg so two massive ultra wides and i assume this shot was done with a wide lens which is going to add that distortion here so i doubt the monitor is that drastically big it's just you know the lens distortion pretty much but i will say so every day you see the larger monitor off to the side being the main monitor not too sure why he doesn't just flip them and have the 38 inch as the primary so he's not you know turning his head i won't lose any sleep over it but down to his peripherals is the logitech k810 wireless keyboard with logitech m705 mouse for audio the steelseries arctis 7 headset and the bose companion 20 speakers so all wireless peripherals here then over to the pc inside the leon lee 011 dynamic case in white which is probably one of the most popular cases i think i see constantly on this series inside for specs is an intel i9 9900k cpu with the cougar hellor 360 liquid aio got 64 gigs of g-skilled trident z rgb ram on a gigabyte z390 oris master motherboard and the gigabyte aorus rtx 2080 ti graphics card loving the blends of rgb here with the fans some of the hardware and stuff the purples and blues and then when it's all turned off and there's no rgb on this just looks like a really clean build like it looks like a different build altogether but still looks real nice then for a peek underneath the desk and the main setup here for the cable management definitely nice and tidy nothing down drooping on the floor and that's pretty much the same thing to be said for the entire setup tidy a hundred percent and then we can take a look at the entertainment center off to the left side which houses the 55-inch lg c9 oled 4k tv it's also 120 hertz with g-sync so a great gaming tv as well so you can kick back there on the couch recline get some gaming done or whatever sort of keyboard that is i assume it's for music production and stuff but he's got it over there doesn't matter a great tv and spot for some secondary gaming and stuff uh but man just super clean spacey futuristic all the stuff here killer job brock loving everything about this then routing us out today coming full circle is d clinox and this is another custom complete diy desk here also some custom headphone stands and i love when i see custom desks like this because again it just shows all the time dedication you put into it and this desk also has the built-in pc so checking everything out his primary display is actually a tv it's a 43 inch 4k tcl tv with roku built in again with it being custom made it could support a tv at that size and also he has the sort of like monitor riser or that additional shelf there which is where the tv sitting on now down to the peripherals lots of hardware here he has the everest max keyboard with all the attachments and stuff i reviewed this last month definitely check it out it's a beast of a keyboard paired with the steelseries rival 650 mouse and for audio he has both the steelseries arctis 5 headset and the status audio cb1 headphones on the custom made uh headphone stands and then his speaker setup is the logitech z906 you can also see some sort of tablet off to the left side which i assume is for the flight sim which he also uses the proof see if i can say this the v-i-r-p-i-l the verbal constellation delta joysticks either way the hardware choice here is for real and then checking out the custom pc into the desk got the amd ryzen 9 3950x cpu with a corsair h150i pro rgb aio with 32 gigs of corsair dominator platinum ram on a gigabyte x570 oris master motherboard with a gigabyte orris rtx 2080 ti graphics card again but man hell of a build also has the little built-in screen there probably one of those five inch screens uh just a monitor some attempts usage that kind of stuff and then another look underneath the desk here considering everything he has going on for his setup that's a killer job for cable management he seems to have this own sort of like box in the back probably some sort of control box that has everything you know kept up and powered nicely but i am really really digging this for a custom desk that could house not only the pc but everything for this flight sim seemingly just a really nice spot tucked away in the room nice and cozy looking as well uh really really digging this all right guys that'll wrap it up for episode 236 of room tour
