what's up guys i'm random frank p and uh got a new gaming pc behind me it's also my dream pc let's check it out [Music] so this is the main gear f131 hands down one of the most breathtaking custom water cooled pcs i've seen pretty much ever and it utilizes their apex water cooling system it's unique to main gear they custom make this for their water cooled builds and it is gorgeous i've heard of main gear a few times in the past i know mkbhd has a custom build from them unbox therapy also has a few custom builds and for someone like me who's always wanted a really nice custom water cooled pc but you know it doesn't really have the time or probably the mental capacity to pull something like this off i would much rather get pre-built from them that's gonna turn out flawless like this so the f-131 is the name of the case it's pretty much like a slim atx profile as you can see and i have it painted in this white finish it's actually automotive paint that they use they had some really cool options to pick from but i just wanted to go white so it fits in with the rest of the setup pretty much by the way i tried thinking of a cool like code name for this pc you know give me some thoughts down below what do you think i should name this i tossed around like frostbite glacier i don't know give me a cool name so for this particular build you're probably curious the specs i have inside it utilizes the new 10th gen intel i9 10900k cpu got 64 gigs of hyperx ram on an msi mpg z490 gaming edge wi-fi motherboard our graphics card is the nvidia rtx 2080 ti i have a one terabyte nvme ssd as the boot drive an additional terabyte ssd installed in the back and our power supply is an evga supernova 850 watt but the main eye candy here comes with their custom cooling configuration it features clear crystal hard line tubing with chrome fittings the tubing is also shatterproof up top we have a 420 millimeter radiator the large block on the right side is two inches thick of custom cut acrylic the cnc job on here is super clean really shows off the coolant on the inside which we do have as white and i did this because of the rest of the components inside obviously and with the rgb lighting this could really give it the option now to change colors pretty much depending on what colors i have going on inside the build what i also really like with their apex cooling is it actually features dual pumps for a fail-safe precaution pretty much so if one does happen to die on you you're not sol you have that fail-safe backup just in case some other things to point out is you can see the flow indicator on the bottom right this is so you can see that the coolant is actually currently moving and then right there on the bottom you also have a spot for draining which is going to be good for you know maintenance and stuff if i ever want to swap out the coolant it's all done right through there don't have to disconnect anything now like i said with the rgb and that white coolant we also have four rgb light strips which are embedded on the top bottom and left and right sides and that's going to again just give it a really nice reflection on the inside since it is custom paint and white inside as well it's gonna bounce off all that with the white coolant it's just gonna reflect all the lighting and look super nice so if i want like it all blue i could change it up and now instead of everything looking white on the inside it looks blue if i want it green you get the idea and then obviously with rgb it just looks nuts so all the lighting is synced to the motherboard including you know the hyperx ram and all the light strips so i can control all the lighting and effects just through the msi software if i want it's called the dragon center software and there there's a few different effects nothing too impressive because i mainly just keep it on like a static color or if i want to just you know show it off for a disco show you know you put it on the rgb but also you can completely disable all that because it comes with the remote that you could just you know point at it real quick and just change the colors on the remote and that also has some pretty cool features built in to the actual light strips itself for this remote that the software doesn't have so again i had that flexibility to really customize the look and the rgb of the pc just to make it all pop now one thing i can really appreciate is there is absolutely zero bloatware zero anything installed on this pc when i first booted it up just windows 10 pro nothing all drivers had to go and download um the msi software wasn't even on there and that's great because a lot of times with a pre-built pc they do load it on with tons of unnecessary programs and bloatware that you don't need companies will pay certain pre-built companies to put on their software so once the trial runs out you can start to use their crap and you pay them it was always terrible here thankfully nothing just windows 10 pro before we move on if you want to talk about cable management and stuff real quick obviously on the left side panel where you have everything going on it just looks super clean they have the custom white braided cables there as well and then once you pop off the right side panel which is held on by eight screws everything is locked down beautifully managed secured with zip ties which you know since because i didn't personally build this pc favor wanted to go in and you know change things or swap things out in the future it's very easy to do that because now since everything is so neatly organized i can see where everything is it just makes it a lot easier in the end all right now we're going to talk benchmarks and performance with the rtx 2080 ti and the i9 10 900k cpu and really i didn't go crazy with benchmarks i only downloaded and benchmarked games that i currently play and use as well as some software and stuff i'll show you um so i'm not gonna you know be going over like 15 different titles here just the ones that i mainly play because that's really all that matters to me so everything was benchmarked at 3440 by 1440p because again this is my use case that's the resolution of my monitor and everything was also benchmarked at the highest possible graphical settings unless noted otherwise again just to show you the like maximum juice you're getting out of this so battlefield 5 probably the game i play the most nearly 120 fps booted up some modern warfare had to wait for the 119 terabyte update to install 126 fps but then we have a game like flight simulator which is brand new it is absolutely breathtaking in every way and it is very taxing so at the ultra highest settings you know in their software i got 36.4 fps which yes is really really low but again for that game um it's kind of understandable knocking the presets down to the highest preset which is just the one knock below ultra we did get a significant jump to 73.7 fps now again with this game again very very taxing there's a lot of factors that go into the performance this was benchmarked over five different flights and i will say for the most part all the flights were probably like 20 minutes or less so i wasn't like high up in the sky above the clouds where i'm gonna be getting more fps i was pretty low to the ground flew over my college campus flew over my hometown flew through new york city and literally right over times square nice little trip from san diego to la but yeah those were the averages over the four or five flights that i did i'm talking 3dmark real quick which is an often used benchmarking tool for the port royal test which is their ray tracing performance test pretty much we had a score of 91.79 and then for the new time spy extreme which is a dx12 4k benchmark we got a score of 6619 but obviously i do more than just gaming at my setup with the pc if anything i spend more time editing and rendering videos so i did a test in adobe premiere i tested out re-rendering my back-to-school tech video from last week it is a 17 minute long video if you missed it check it out it's 38.40 by 1920. i have multiple adjustment layers with different layers of color correction moderate gfx i'd say and every single clip is raw it's black magic raw so it's doing a lot in those 17 minutes with my older pc which had the i9 9900 ks it was a 9 minute 41 second render then now with the f131 and the i9 10 900k cpu it rendered in seven minutes and 33 seconds so a little over two minutes it cut down on rendering that entire video i feel like definitely having those two extra cores clocked at the higher frequency significantly helped out here now i know some people are naturally going to comment why not amd and uh first i already had terrible impression i already have a 3950x cpu that i showed off on the channel before um that build is at the setup behind the camera but also i feel like on the market right now this cpu is more closely compared to the 3900x and while that has you know 12 cores 24 threads when you look at just the overall cost and performance overall um i feel like in terms of rendering and gaming included that this does kind of edge it out and even though you can look at different benchmarks out there and different you know comparison tools it may only be a 5 to 10 fps increase with gaming with the i9 10900k but in a lot of cases that could go a long way plus you look at the 5.3 gigahertz versus the 4.6 turbo with single core and the 4.9 versus 4.2 on all cores and yeah it's a pretty significant bump uh when not at the stock frequency also it's honestly just a matter of preference as well i've had a really good track record in the past with intel in terms of stability and reliability in all my builds uh plus like i said i already currently have a 3950x build so it wouldn't make sense to kind of double up there this is an upgrade over my current pc that i've had which i am still gonna use but yeah honestly more so just preference and again i know i'll see the comments about the upcoming generation of gpus that's irrelevant to this i've had this build for a little over a month now so you know upcoming releases is it's whatever you know i'm content with this build for what it is now one of the things that um i like i saw on their website initially that really kind of struck me was it said this is not just a pc this is art and honestly that's like one of the main selling points here is yes if you're getting a main gear build with this custom apex cooling and obviously you can go and configure it to whatever sort of specs and hardware you want it is going to be a bit pricey but you're getting that gorgeous unique hard line cooling on the inside with their apex cooling system that is a hundred percent art i could take the time free up my schedule for a weekend build my own hardline custom cooled pc but i know in the end it would look nothing like this i mean sure if i did do it and it looked nice i'd be happy but this i didn't have to build and it looks gorgeous so in terms of you know cons other than the fact that it is like i said kind of pricey depending on the hardware you buy um one other slight issue i had is with the usbc port on the back where the motherboard is for whatever reason no matter what i plug into that usbc port it just pops out so i don't know if it's something with the shield kind of sticking out too far or it doesn't let the usb-c connector fully go in uh but that's definitely kind of annoying i do have the front i o and stuff and i can utilize the usb-c ports there and the usb you know a ports and stuff but still i wish i had the extra one in the back uh but yeah guys this is the main gear f131 like i said comment down below what your your thoughts are like a cool code name for it and it is definitely a pretty big bump over my last build in terms of you know performance but as well as visual eye candy and don't worry i'm still gonna be using that i've got a lot of different use cases and stuff for hardware and pcs on this channel uh so it's all going to good use but man 100 my dream pc i am loving it and i hope you guys love this video if you did give it a big thumbs up show your support feel free to follow me on twitter at randomfrankp and last if you haven't already hit that subscribe button i hope you enjoyed
