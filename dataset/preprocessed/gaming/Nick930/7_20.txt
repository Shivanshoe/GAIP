this holiday season welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're going to take an in-depth look at the recently released battlefield 2042 and see how it compares from a purely technical perspective to the previous main line entry to the series battlefield v for this analysis both games are being played on the pc with the graphical settings cranked up to their highest settings at a 4k resolution however for at least most of this video i'll be running both games with their rtx specific features like ray trace reflections or ambient occlusion disabled and i'll re-enable them when specifically covering the lighting design also as i'm already covering the entire battlefield franchise in exhaustive detail for my upcoming documentary i want to spend this video speaking purely about the visual effects of these two games as opposed to going into the nitty-gritty about each available feature and gameplay mechanic but rest assured all that will be covered in my history of battlefield project that's set to release in the next couple of weeks so let's kick this comparison off by first talking about some of the shared weapon models in both games which thanks to the recreated battlefield 1942 content offered in the new portal mode makes this a bit easier first we have the german's stg assault rifle right away you should be able to notice a few key differences the first and most obvious difference is that the snow and dirt decal effects no longer accumulate on the player's weapon in 2042 additionally the metal surface textures aren't quite as reflective even when the ray tracing is disabled in battlefield v and the few reflective surfaces that are still visible have a very dithered appearance to them almost as if the screen space reflections use a lower resolution when we zoom in a bit closer though there's a few improvements offered with 2042's model in regards to the small weapon details you'll find many of these circular pieces have an increased poly count making them appear more properly rounded and things like the serial number along the receiver are much smaller but yet more crisp this is an observation that can be made across practically every shared weapon in these two games with 2042's weapons sporting superior textures and poly counts but without the proper lighting effects to help portray these improvements the end result is a much less impressive image overall and so weapons like the mp40 car 98 the bar and especially the m1 garand all appear like a noticeable step backwards visually next up let's talk about the environments now here's where things get a little bit more interesting if you didn't already know 2042 while primarily based on a semi-futuristic atmosphere also offers several recreations of classic maps from fan favorite battlefield entries this includes two maps from bag company two two maps from battlefield 3 and two maps from the original battlefield 1942 these last two maps are some of the more interesting maps in the collection as they haven't been featured in the series since they debuted back in 2002 and with the help of the newer frostbite engine they're now both fully realized with rich detail huge draw distances and the series signature dynamic destruction effects and because battlefield 5's level assets match the theme of these recreated locations there's several returning building models trees and other objects to help bring these locations back into action most notably this windmill structure however because these maps are built around the core map design of levels from nearly 20 years ago there isn't really the same kind of general infantry balance and flow that you'd expect from a more modern battlefield map design most paths to and from objectives are large wide open fields with little to no cover for players running around on foot encouraging squads to make use of vehicles whenever possible there's still a ton of changes veteran players will run into like an increased number of buildings with full interiors and some massive dunes out in the desert of el elemain but you're still going to want to grab a tank or plane before heading out of any major objective battlefield v on the other hand has much more infantry focus maps overall with narrow lanes too tight for vehicles to effectively maneuver through even the more vehicle-centric maps like panzerstorm have at least some areas that favor infantry combat to some degree which all makes sense considering map design philosophy has evolved significantly over this series's history though thankfully players in 2042 aren't just limited to these two old 1942 maps there's over a dozen maps for players to battle across with plenty of variety and playstyles thanks to the inclusion of bad company 2 and battlefield 3 maps and all of them can be played with 1942 soldiers and vehicles if the server set up that way as for the actual visual quality of these environments the texture maps and general environmental terrain complexity seems to favor the newer 2042 in most areas as the various surfaces of battlefield v have a very low res appearance to them this isn't necessarily always the case as there are some structures and models that look great in bf5 and in these cases there's really no clear advantage one way or the other next we have lighting the lighting in battlefield 2042 is both great and disappointing at the same time in sub maps it does look fantastic bringing out great specular effects along water-soaked concrete and dynamically changing to account for the new weather effects but then there's other maps like the ones in portal that can kind of go either way the 1942 maps in particular aren't all that impressive with the battle of the bulge feeling generally dull and muted el alamein on the other hand has this extremely bright haze to it that feels excessive especially when it's coupled with all these post-processing effects to simulate this glow on every object in the world speaking of which 2042 currently has this really bad visual glitch involving its alpha effects when cast behind object models giving everything this sort of weird light outline an issue that i wasn't able to reproduce in battlefield v meanwhile battlefield 5's lighting still holds up remarkably well today with some beautifully lit environments all coupled with some great bloom implementation specular effects and advanced ray traced reflections that are capable of reflecting all major game assets and character models in real time this latter effect is of course hugely demanding on hardware and i personally disable the feature when actually playing the game but it is a cool effect nonetheless and one that i was surprised to see not return in 2042 though 2042 does at least offer an improved ambient inclusion method that while barely noticeable does technically improve object detail shadowing to some degree now don't get me wrong the lighting in 2042 still looks great in fact many may prefer the lighting design of those 1942 maps that i mentioned as the lighting design in battlefield v is more often than not extremely colorful almost to a fault but there's no ignoring the fact that some of these nice reflective surfaces and the lighting that occurred from things like explosions and weapon muzzle flashes were more technically impressive in battlefield v speaking of which let's move on and talk about some of the effects starting with the water simulation battlefield 5 offers some really impressive water physics effects with ripples radiating out from every player-generated projectile and properly moving around players swimming in the water itself 2042 carries over some aspects of this but it feels a bit broken at the moment with some weird artifacting and maps like battle of the bulge and some weak surface level reflections that exasperate the already poor screen space reflections we saw earlier there's even some areas like this riverbed in erica harbor where bullet projectiles cause jets of water to emit above the surface of the water an obvious bug that will need to be addressed at some point next there's the explosions as i mentioned in my previous comparison on the beta for this game 2042's fireballs are a big improvement over the sort of unusual fireballs we saw in past battlefield entries the fire and smoke have this really cool billowing effect now that you'd expect to see from a real explosion however there is still room for improvement as i feel the lack of dynamic lighting effects really hurts the appearance a great deal and these odd distorted bubbles representing the shock wave feel like a bit much on the plus side the increased particle density and the quality of various alpha effects are a huge improvement over battlefield v and with several of these explosions going off all the time each battle feels a lot more epic as a result which is why it's interesting that battlefield 2042 doesn't carry over the great ambient particle effects used in bf5 at all in bf5 levels like narvik featured occasional snowfall where snowflakes could accumulate on surfaces and then blow in the wind along the edge it's a really cool effect and one that i'm surprised to see isn't included in 2042 even in maps where there is a similar light snowfall i also discovered that general dynamic destruction isn't quite as effective in 2042 with explosives not creating deep craters in the snow like before though it is worth noting that deep craters like these can still be formed using heavy ordnance from vehicles so it's perhaps more of a balancing design choice it could also be a result of the game's new increase to the player count bumping up the previous standard 64 players up to an incredible 128 transforming every location into complete and utter chaos this is without a doubt the biggest reason why there's been so many sacrifices to the general visual quality of the game's makeup as the increased computing power required to handle double the number of online players or even just the ai-controlled bot soldiers presents a major technical hurdle to overcome the fact that the game still manages to look almost as good as battlefield v with this many more soldiers throwing grenades and blowing up walls left to right is certainly commendable even if it doesn't really look all that different on the surface finally let's wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you feel sports the superior audio quality and design [Applause] [Applause] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall battlefield 2042 when compared to its predecessor battlefield v from a purely graphical perspective seems to be a sizeable step backwards yes the weapon models have slightly better geometry and sure some of the environmental surfaces have better texture maps but the lighting design will no doubt stand out considerably to most players and will greatly limit the potential of any improvements that have been made elsewhere also the effects have quite a few issues at the moment whether it be the odd shimmer along objects cast against alpha effects or the artifacting and differing of the water surface battlefield 2042 will need a lot of work to be done under the hood before it can be competitive with the likes of battlefield v that being said it is worth reiterating that bf 2042's strongest new technical feature is that larger player count that not only looks more impressive but completely transforms how players actually play the game so what do you guys think are you okay with those visual sacrifices made in order to justify the larger player count or are you leaning more towards battlefield v let me know in the comments section also if you
