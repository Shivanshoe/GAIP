welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in today's episode we're gonna take a look at the recently released doom eternal and see how it compares both visually and from a gameplay perspective to its 2016 predecessor doom now a while back I conducted a comparison between these two games but then I was only able to show you footage that Bethesda released during their e3 reveal but today we can finally take a closer look at the work that its software has done including weapon and Monster redesigns along with how the new gameplay features impact the flow of the overall experience for this comparison both games are going to be played on the PC with the graphics settings pushed to their highest possible values at a 1440p resolution and the motion bar settings will be disabled to improve image clarity all right so to keep this comparison off let's start by looking at some of the character and weapon models beginning with the doom Slayer himself now in the 2016 doom you rarely get a chance to see the doom slayer himself while wearing the armor the only time at least in the campaign that the player can see the praetor student full is at the very beginning when the Slayer awakens and is about to put it on the suit is mostly green contrasting heavily with the black and grey connecting armor joints between plates and the helmet is a stylized version of the original doom guy helmet from way back in the 90s and doom eternal we get plenty of opportunities to see the Slayer showing off his new and improved armor the first change you'll notice is the coloration the suit color has more of an earthy tone this time around the breastplate has a few new details and the helmet features larger ventilation on the top but it's otherwise a very similar design the biggest change that's been made has been to the arms that are now open at the sleeves and the Slayers gauntlets have been given a new look with a massive extendable blade that makes up a majority of the glory kill animations now the Slayer also has a shoulder mountain launcher device that can fire various grenades and even a flamethrower that helps the player replenish any lost Armour points on top of these new tools doom eternal also gives players significally more options for reversal in the game's environments players can now dash to the sides or through the air which can be coupled with double jumps for extremely long clearance players can also swing along horizontal bars for an extra boost and climb up specific surfaces adding far more verticality to platforming obstacles and combat sequences but that's not all that's changed the weapon arsenal has also been given a huge overhaul first off doom eternal marks the very first time in the series that the player is not given a standard pistol fires instead start off right away with the combat shotgun which now occupies the number one hot key on the keyboard this is a pretty surprising choice though I also get it there's never been a real use for the pistol in any of the past doom games once you start grabbing other weapons even with the upgrades and doom 2016 the pistol never felt like a worthwhile weapon and it really hurt the pacing of the action when you were stuck using it now the combat shotgun in its most basic form behaves as you'd expect it deals a medium amount of damage at close range and you can unlock two separate upgrades to enhance its abilities further in both games players can attach a grenade launcher that would either bounce off of a surface and detonate or explode on impact on an enemy but instead of the burst fire option for the last game doom Eternals combat shotgun has an automatic revolving barrel modification allowing for powerful rapid fire shots that can deal some serious damage in a short amount of time as for the look of the weapon itself the model has been given a complete overhaul the new combat shotgun has a much cleaner appearance with a chrome reflective chamber and sleeker aesthetic by comparison the original shotgun looks bulky and dull and when firing the weapons muzzle flash effects have not aged very well when stacked up to the new effects used in eternal the assault rifle has seen some even more drastic changes again the general idea behind this weapon is the same it fires full auto and deals a medium amount of damage to hostels and can alternatively fire multiple rocket pods in quick succession or be equipped with a scope for mid to long range engagements however this scoped ability has been altered slightly to make it more appealing unlike before where you just zoom in and fire full auto this attachment now switches the weapon to a separate more powerful single-shot mode useful for picking off targets with precision headshots cosmetically the assault rifle looks a bit more complex than its counterpart it now sports a red finish complemented by some great metal piece additionally the rocket pods now eject from the left and right side of the rocket pod attachments as opposed to popping straight up like before the iconic super shotgun is one of the few weapons here that hasn't had many changes at first glance the weapon looks practically identical however the inlay along the receiver has been toned down a bit the site is now more pronounced and this new version sports the new meat hook attachment that allows fires to grapple enemies and swing around them at high speeds greatly improving the players mobility the chin gun has also seen some pretty big changes visually the weapon now appears more sci-fi than before with a clean metallic look rather than the harsh mechanical appearance from before when you activate the deployed turret attachment there's now four rotating try barrels instead of just three giving it an even more intimidating appearance and just like with the shotguns burst fire attachment and the AR scope the mini guns less useful barrel warm-up mod has been replaced with a new protective shield giving players a distinct choice between a more defensive approach or a more damaged heavy one another weapon that was removed from Eternals lineup is the Gauss cannon however its spiritual successor the ballista makes up for this omission and includes an even more powerful charge up shot that sends a devastating horizontal beam at enemies the rocket launcher functions basically exactly the same though its new appearance might suggest otherwise instead of a conventional rocket launcher design it's offered decided to mix it up a little and created a rocket launcher that looks like it was forged in hell itself with bright chrome metal pieces and a skull insignia along the side along with a cool visible chamber in the center and finally we have the plasma gun the plasma gun in doom 2016 looks absolutely nothing like the original design of the gun featured in the classic doom games which was odd considering how much the other weapons in the game had managed to look pretty similar with doom eternal it decide to return to their original design along with new cooling tubes and coils along the side in terms of its functionality it works almost exactly the same as the last game though its heat blast effect is now more powerful and the new mod allows players to fire a constant stream of energy at their enemies speaking of which let's take a closer look at how the demons have changed these standard enemy types called the possessed look a lot more like your typical zombies in doom eternal and also have bright yellow glowing eyes and a pentagram burn into that forehead the possessed from doomed as a 16 however are much more disturbing with a singular hole whether I should be in a strange fibrous look to the cheeks the possessed on the surface of hell also known as the unwilling look a tiny bit more like the enemies in doom eternal but still lack any eyes or pentagram the zombie soldiers have seen an even greater change much like the plasma gun the zombie soldiers designed now more resembles the original classic design of the enemies in Doom 1 and dim 2 complete with the red eyes crew cut hair and green uniforms the soldiers of the last doom looked less like possessed human soldiers on Mars and more like weird ochre hybrids a similar change can be found when looking at the manky bats the Menk abyss and doom 2016 features a single eye and it looks much fatter with how inspired armor plating in technology the minke mists and eternal however looks a lot more like the source material with a slightly more humanoid facial structure more built up body and technology that looks a little bit more modern it's a massive improvement and more accurately captures the spirit of this iconic character other enemies like the kakko demon and the IMP have seen only marginal improvements including enhanced specular effects to help bring out some of their smaller details some reworked colouring higher quality textures and more detailed eyes well this looks great for the kakko demon in the IMP I'm not sure the same can be said about the revenant whose new glowing eyes and eternal take away a bit from the haunting blank stare in the original model also the textures and blood effects along the model in the previous tomb look to be a higher quality than the revenant in doom eternal one of the few times where I found this to be the case along with all the returning enemies doom eternal also features several new enemy types some from past games in the series and some never-before-seen foes there's the carcass that can summon annoying shields into the field blocking your path temporarily the Prower a previously multiplayer only character from the last game tentacles that pop out of the ground at certain locations the whiplash the gargoyle and several more eternal easily offers the most chow rostra foes in the series today and the level environments are built specifically for players to move around quickly to keep their distance from them just like with Dhoom 2 back in 94 doom eternal takes place on earth with house forces attempting to take over mostly the environments offer a mix of ruined skyscrapers and shopping centers along with fleshy interior spaces hellish landscapes and frozen temples doom 2016 on the other hand takes place mostly in high-tech UAC facility on Mars with a few opportunities to travel to the service of how itself the level structures are still very similar with a semi linear design large open arena spaces to fight in tons of secret collectables and unlocks and lots of platforming in between it all but the platforming and doom eternal is far more ambitious players will need to run jump and climb a lot more frequently sometimes while fighting enemies as I mentioned before the new climbing tools mixed with the - ability really helped to build on the game's verticality and to account for this levels are much larger meaning you'll spend likely twice as long exploring as you would have before now in terms of straightforward level texture quality it's hard to really compare anything as the environments are so drastically different though I will say that the textures in Doom 2016 especially in the hell areas have not aged very well and often look really low res and blurry do me turn on the other hand looks pretty sharp all throughout and the level of detail is an easily noticeable improvement next let's talk about the lighting effects now with a linear shooter like doom you can't really expect much in terms of dynamic lighting effects or anything like that though the more interior focus design mixed with the frequent smoke effects help to make the lighting in the original game feel more volumetric whereas now it doesn't really stand out as much all that being said things like reflective surfaces and specular lighting happen improve drastically and the brighter environments give doom eternal a much more colourful and appealing tone doom 2016 is a much darker experience with dimly lit hallways illuminated by small fires and blinking lights every few feet eternal feels like it's always taking place in broad daylight which is consistent with the fact that the cities are being engulfed by Hellfire so how about effects of are a major part of the doom experience particles fire and explosions frequently appear threat encounters with enemies and doom eternal is no exception however I was disappointed to find that explosions aren't quite as impressive as they were previously thus milk is downplayed a bit more and there's less visible particles and shrapnel eternal dust make up for this though with much better fire effects that feature higher resolution flames and better environmental reflections to help them stand out more what really stands out though is the improved gore Gibbs's 'dom enemies in Doom 2016 could be torn apart slightly with bits and pieces breaking away but not like this each enemy in the game can be ripped apart with bright red flesh being exposed giving a clear indicator to the player that they've engaged that enemy in the past and some of the glory kill finishers and chainsaw takedowns are so satisfyingly grotesque you're just gonna have to play the game and see them for yourself to really appreciate them finally let's wrap up with a sound comparison which game do you think has two superior audio design [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison over all doom eternal is a massive improvement visually and mechanically over the previous game player manoeuvrability has been increased dramatically thanks to new tools like the meathook horizontal bars and - ability and the rework of some of the less popular weapon modifications was a wise decision that pays off greatly many of the questionable design choices from before like the plasma gun and the manky base have been rectified an eternal bringing the game more in line with the original games from way back in the day though there are a few like the revenant that aren't quite as impressive as they could be there's also a ton of other new gameplay mechanics in the eternal like the rework challenge rooms the doom Slayers personal hub area the new multiplayer mode and the reworked progression systems but I'll try and cover those in more detail with my final review next week in the meantime what do you guys think Iram press would doom eternal or did you prefer the design of doom 2016 let me know in the comments section and of course don't forget to Like and subscribe for
