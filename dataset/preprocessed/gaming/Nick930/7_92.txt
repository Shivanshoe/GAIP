welcome back everybody to another episode up direct comparison in today's episode we're gonna take a look at Naughty Dog's latest cinematic adventure The Last of Us part 2 and see how it compares to its original III debut from 2018 for today's analysis I'll be playing The Last of Us 2 on the PlayStation 4 pro now putting on a 4k display and it's important to understand that the footage from the e3 reveal may not appear as crisp due to the videos compression but that shouldn't matter as the main focus for this particular video is to point out changes to the environmental detail level layouts gameplay mechanics and behavior of the game's artificial intelligence alright let's jump right in with the introductory cutscene shown at e3 of Elly and a romantic encounter with her new friend Dena now this cutscene does not trigger at this point in the campaign though it is referenced quite a bit especially towards the beginning so if you never watch the original III reveal I do highly recommend at least watching this cinematic before you play the latest game it is included in the final retail game just not during this sequence after Dena tells Ellie that people should be terrified of her the scene transitions to Ellie in a dark forest brutally murdering an enemy this particular animation doesn't play here and seems to have been thrown in for the sake of having a smooth scene transition but after she drops the body the footage flows smoothly into actual gameplay and here's where things get very interesting right away we can see an absolutely massive change to the scene first off there's the lighting in the e3 build the game is dark with thick volumetric fog creating a very moody atmosphere this is the same case in the retail build but to a slightly lesser extent with reduced fog density and a slightly more blue tone to the scene making Ellie stand out even more additionally that dirty lens flare effect that was featured in both the demo and in the original game has been removed from last of us part to the environmental detail has also been altered a good amount the foliage is still beautifully dense and moves realistically as you walk through it but you'll notice the layout of these woods isn't the same anymore new trees have been thrown in the tipped over log Ellie hides behind is now located off to the side and most important of all the group of scars up ahead are now executing a wolf member right in the middle of this initial clearing this nasty gutting sequence was shown in the e3 demo as well but it's located to the right of the parking garage off the beaten path after the brutal execution scene Ellie backs away slowly and turns to climb up into the parking garage structure where we get an even more clear look at how the lighting has been changed the radius of the lighting effects from the nearby barrel fire aren't nearly as bright in the retail build and the bloom effects have been toned down considerably we can see this with all the enemy torches as well that previously lit up the scene significantly but now are barely noticeable once again we have another shift in the position of our enemies here no soldiers ever patrol this particular zone and so it's impossible to replicate this particular kill the way it's done in the demo after skipping this area and rounding the corner on to the next level we see a corpse lying against a wall and another century but this century is again much less advanced than what was previously suggested she doesn't investigate the corpse at all and she simply walks in a triangle in this area repeatedly there's also no brisk when sneaking up on her as no patrolling century ever wanders down the ramp like in the demo for the sake of replicating the melee combat sequence that happens at this point I had a few enemies follow me into this area for a little brawl in the demo were shown some dodge maneuvers to help to spotlight the new melee system but this dodge where Ellie's smashes into the car is impossible in the retail bill of the game I tried dodging both arrows and melee attacks but never had to react this way also never managed to replicate this disarm and counter-attack that's performed afterwards though because of the high variety and melee animations built in I do believe this is still technically possible another small detail that you might not have picked up on are these embers that kick up from a nearby fire in the demo this really helped to add to the realism of the scene as the enemies swings his axe through the flames but sadly this effect is not at all in the final game and the fire itself isn't nearly as impressive now at this point in the demo all hell starts to break loose enemies begin shooting at Ellie and she dashes up the parking garage ramp and jumps down to the street below the scene looks mostly the same though you'll notice a new dry grass too sure along the road surface an increase to the grass density and a more clear example of that distinct lighting change I mentioned earlier with an extended job distance thanks to the less dense fog after hopping down from the parking garage I found the AI to be incredibly difficult to manipulate in order to match the events in the demo in the demo le is shot at by a lone scar standing on the street to the right and she ducks down into some grass on the other side of the intersection to which the patrol shot at that she's somewhere in the grass well I didn't get the enemies to make this particular call-out they do make specific comments like this all the time and will even cry out their friends names when you kill them as Ellie catches her breath here the camera pans down the street to reveal a new group of scars coming in from a pile of vehicles this happens in the retail game as well but if you look closely you'll notice that their animations are again not nearly as advanced Ellie then drops to the ground and crawls under the truck watching as the patrol searches the area for her again the AI is so unpredictable that I wasn't able to get the scene to match up exactly but all the actual gameplay mechanics shown off and do function mostly the same way enemies do search under vehicles and if they find you they will pull you out from underneath and trigger a grapple attack however the way this scar reacts when shot in the face appears to be scripted as well especially considering that a point-blank shot with this same handgun even without upgrades turns an enemy's face into a gross paste after shooting one enemy Ellie is then grabbed and pulled out from underneath the truck where she struggles to escape and then shoots the assaulting enemy three times in the body where he reacts realistically to each impact while this general mechanic still functions roughly the same the way enemies react isn't nearly as advanced they still will jerk back and even fall to the knees depending on where you shoot them but it's just not up to par with the reveal after killing this enemy Ellie runs out and enters a basic firefight by some cars but flees after being struck with an arrow that gets stuck in her arm she then leaps from the road to a building complex below and then runs towards a jewelry store she grabs a bottle off a planner and smoothly tosses it at a nearby enemy who she then grabs and takes hostage and quickly spins around only to have him get hit immediately by a friendly arrow all this can theoretically happen in the final game though I never could manage to get an arrow to kill a hostage arrows seem to break on impact whenever they hit a hostage but I did have a scar shoot a hostage with a gun and the animation that followed was very similar also when to point out some interesting changes that have been made to this area's layout at first glance it does look the same but you'll notice things like the tip trash cans are removed the pneuma building is now directly ahead rather than to the right and both the bottle and the enemy have been removed even though the action itself can still be performed this area is also much smaller than what was previously suggested with the long Lane where Ellie encounters another group of enemies being removed next we have the store interior fight scene the enemies seem to regroup outside of the store in the demo and carefully enter the doors with some really cool moody lighting pouring into the windows and the door but in the final game the doors are sealed by glass that you need to break to get inside and there's now a big shelf blocking the view of the door likely to provide more visual cover for the sake of the gameplay after jumping the counter and he pulls the arrow out from her shoulder which is an actual feature in the final game but the animation itself isn't quite as cinematic and her bloody hand doesn't leave a print on the counter like it does in the demo as the enemies fan out inside the building the camera pans to reveal more of the store the layout of the store is roughly the same though the lighting isn't as volumetric and there's now a lot more grass on the far side again like we added to enhance the gameplay this grass also replaces the corpse with the arrow stuck in em in the demo Ellie grabs arrows from this body and smoothly drops them into her backpack picking up arrows throughout the game still functions similarly but once again it just doesn't look as good as Ellie rounds this row of shelves she pulls out her bow and perhaps an explosive type arrow at this point in the story I didn't have the recipe to build explosive tube arrows though they can be crafted and functioned the same way and players replaying through new game+ should be able to use the arrow during the section after blowing up one enemy the other is stunned giving le a chance to run up and attack them throwing them into a nearby shelf and causing the contents to break apart I tried this several times just like what the car in the parking garage but they couldn't get this particular animation to play here I know you can pin enemies against objects as I did this a few times outside and the shelves here can still break apart slightly when you swing at them but I just couldn't replicate this particular moment next we have possibly one of the biggest changes the new surprise attack from the heavy sledge hammer wielding enemy in the demo only three enemies come in to the store through the main door behind the player the center one being a massive brute wielding a hammer but this enemy doesn't appear until the player attempts to open a red door behind the counter and if you try and rush forward and open the store while enemies are still chasing you all the enemies before are disabled giving players a chance for a more focused one-on-one battle though an additional two soldiers sometimes rush in with him in the demo this battle is hugely cinematic with the brute swinging his hammer around and smashing shelves realistically but in the final build is not quite as destructive and a swings aren't as wide focusing on le more carefully I played around with the melee animations quite a bit to see what he's capable of and he will swing more frequently depending on the difficulty you have enabled for the sake of testing his difficulty was set to light so he only performs one swing at a time and dodging is incredibly simple he'll swing his axe and as long as you press the dodge button at the right time he'll always miss le completely in the demo you'll also notice that the brute grabs Ellie and tosses her over the counter and through a glass panel this is another animation that I was surprised to find is still present and what's more he can even throw you through the glass windows which is a pretty cool feature finally there's the finisher if you injure an enemy enough and they're the last ones standing in the area sometimes they'll drop to their knees and surrender giving you a chance to perform a brutal finisher the finisher in the demo is another pre-rendered animation that isn't possible in the retail game but there's plenty of other finishers depending on the melee weapon equipped all of which are plenty to stripping on their own and after this final kill the scene transitions back to the dance sequence from the beginning while in the retail game the action continues as players move through the rest of the building overall the Last of Us part to retail differs quite a bit from the original III gameplay reveal as we found with other III comparisons the gameplay scenes have been spliced together with a lot of pre-rendered animations to help emphasize new gameplay features while also showcasing the beautiful art direction that the developers aimed for throughout production while the final game doesn't look quite the same the end result is still incredibly impressive the environments are densely populated lighting effects are gorgeous and the enemy AI is just intelligent enough to be immersive while also being fun to play around with although gameplay mechanics like crawling underneath vehicles and being pulled out from underneath them and the cinematic melee fights are found in the final product and while not every animation made its way in there's still a number of cool grapple attacks and throws that can trigger now and again and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison what do you guys think are you happy with the presentation of the retail build of the game or of other features shown in the e3 demo that you wish we're still present let me know in the
